Mr. Trump said the order would help prevent terrorism.The justices, in an unsigned 13-page opinion, narrowed the scope of the ban for now, ruling that the president couldn\u2019t enforce it against travelers \u201cwho have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with a person or organization in the U.S. The court narrowed the ban on refugees in the same way.The court\u2019s decision means a limited version of Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions can take effect in as soon as three days. But it raised immediate questions about which travelers would qualify for the court\u2019s \u201cbona fide\u201d exception to the ban, paving the way for potentially messy legal battles in the coming months.Chief Justice       John Roberts       announced the court\u2019s decision after the justices dispensed with their other pending business, capping a dramatic final day of the court\u2019s term. The high court doesn\u2019t usually announce decisions from the bench in cases it hasn\u2019t yet fully considered, but nothing about the travel ban litigation has been typical.Mr. Trump, a Republican, took office vowing to shake things up, pledging among other things to crack down on terrorism and immigration. His executive orders on travel began producing significant lower-court rulings within weeks after his inauguration.Some judges openly questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s motivations, citing his support as a candidate for a complete ban on Muslims entering the U.S. The president fired back with blunt criticisms of the courts that have ruled against him, tweeting his own commentary about the cases as they have progressed.The Supreme Court said on Monday it would give closer consideration to the case in October, when it will hear oral arguments. By then, the 90-day pause on travel will already be over, a fact that could moot the justices\u2019 further consideration, or at least complicate it.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, however, could seek to restrict travel for some foreign nationals beyond the 90 days in the current order. U.S. officials are studying vetting procedures world-wide, and that review could result in additional countries being added to the list for restricted travel.Both sides claimed a win after the ruling.Mr. Trump called the high court\u2019s action \u201ca clear victory for our national security. It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective.\u201d\u201cMy number one responsibility as commander in chief is to keep the American people safe. Today\u2019s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation\u2019s homeland,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement.The president\u2019s critics argued that the court\u2019s ruling was a narrow win at best for Mr. Trump. Many would-be travelers or refugees have a connection to the U.S., they said, and could be exempt from the executive order.\u201cThis order, properly construed, should really allow for only the narrowest implementation of any part of the ban,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued one of the travel ban cases in the lower courts.Even with the travel restrictions on hold, admissions from the six nations fell dramatically in March and April, government data show. Compared with a year earlier, the number of people admitted from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was down by about half year over year. It was unclear whether that was primarily due to fewer people seeking to travel to the U.S. or to the administration rejecting more applications.Mr. Trump\u2019s first executive order on immigration, which he signed shortly after taking office, was briefly implemented with no advance notice and caused widespread confusion at U.S. airports. It also created anxiety in immigrant communities because its terms appeared to apply to people who already had been given permission to live in, or travel to, the U.S.Lower courts blocked that order, and the president then replaced it with the current, scaled-back version, which he signed in March. The revised order was also quickly blocked by lower courts. And the White House had lost its appeals\u2014until now.The administration filed an emergency appeal earlier this month at the Supreme Court asking for permission to move forward with the executive order as the litigation on the order\u2019s underlying legality continued. The White House also asked the high court to review the core issues in the case and resolve whether the president\u2019s ban is permissible.States, individuals, immigrant-rights organizations and civil-rights groups have brought cases challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s planned restrictions, arguing they improperly target Muslims for disfavored treatment.The high court\u2019s action Monday partially stayed recent rulings against Mr. Trump, and it signaled that the president has favorable prospects of winning a final ruling in the case during the court\u2019s next term. It takes five votes on the nine-member Supreme Court to grant a stay, and one of the factors the court considers is whether the party seeking the stay has a fair prospect of winning the case.Chief Justice Roberts assembled an ideologically diverse coalition for the middle-ground approach, attracting the support of maverick conservative Justice       Anthony Kennedy       and the court\u2019s four liberal justices.Three of the court\u2019s most conservative justices\u2014      Clarence Thomas,        Samuel Alito and       Neil Gorsuch      \u2014offered a partial dissent, objecting to the narrowing of the president\u2019s ban. They wrote that they feared the compromise standard, which turns on the closeness of a person\u2019s connections to the U.S., would be unworkable and \u201cinvite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits.\u201dFederal judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked the president\u2019s plans within days of his signing the revised executive order, which has never taken effect. In recent weeks, two federal appeals courts also ruled against Mr. Trump on the central issues in the litigation, relying on different legal grounds.On May 25, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., issued the broadest ruling, saying Mr. Trump had singled out Muslims for disfavored treatment in a way that likely violated the Constitution. The court\u2019s decision relied heavily upon comments Mr. Trump made on the campaign trail in support of a Muslim ban, as well as other comments he has made since taking office.The Ninth Circuit in San Francisco took a different approach when it ruled against the president on June 12, avoiding Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and the constitutional questions altogether. Instead, that appeals court said the president violated federal immigration law because he failed to provide sufficient justification for his ban.\u2014Laura Meckler  contributed to this article.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Supreme Court Narrows Scope of Order.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 23:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-allows-implementation-of-most-of-trump-travel-ban-1498487727", "news_title": "Supreme Court Allows Partial Implementation of Trump Travel Ban", "keywords": "ban,donald trump,supreme court,travel,U.S. Supreme Court,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans are headed for a vote on their health-care bill as soon as this week, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still scrambling for 50 votes. What the holdouts should understand is that this is a defining political moment. They may never have a better chance to improve U.S. health care and reform government, and the window is closing.Repairing the failing individual insurance market, putting Medicaid on budget for the first time in the entitlement\u2019s history, and passing an enormous pro-growth tax cut are historic opportunities. If reluctant GOP Senators think they won\u2019t be held accountable for a defeat, they should think again.Moderates like Ohio\u2019s       Rob Portman       and West Virginia\u2019s       Shelley Moore Capito       remain nervous about the bill\u2019s Medicaid overhaul, but the block grant model is the kind of fiscal progress they normally claim to want. The budget will never balance, and debt will continue to accumulate, if Congress can\u2019t modernize entitlements. Mr. Portman already won an extension to four years from three in the House bill for the start of phasing out       Obama      Care\u2019s Medicaid expansion, and many Senators represent states that didn\u2019t expand.Liberals call block grants heartless, but ObamaCare increased Medicaid enrollment by 29% to 74.5 million Americans\u2014one of four citizens\u2014in a program originally meant for poor women and the disabled. Equalizing payments for these traditional beneficiaries and ObamaCare\u2019s new able-bodied adult enrollees above the poverty line is uncaring only in liberal caricature. The real scandal is Medicaid\u2019s poor health outcomes and a funding formula that doesn\u2019t encourage states to prioritize the neediest Americans.Conservatives such as       Ted Cruz       of Texas,       Rand Paul       of Kentucky,       Mike Lee       of Utah and       Ron Johnson       of Wisconsin claim the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to lower insurance premiums by repealing every mandate and regulation that artificially drives up costs. Their objections are principled but no bill will ever be perfect and most of their ideas don\u2019t now command a Senate majority.On policy substance, the Senate bill gives Governors the regulatory flexibility to upgrade their insurance markets. Even if the bill isn\u2019t everything conservatives imagine, no one can credibly claim it isn\u2019t deregulatory progress. ObamaCare created a rule-making pathway supposedly meant to encourage state innovation, but these so-called 1332 waivers are highly prescriptive in statute and the Obama Administration tightened them even more through regulation. Among the four states that applied, only a single waiver was approved.The Senate bill would fast-track 1332 applications and expand their scope to include items like the definition of a \u201cqualified health plan,\u201d minimum benefits or limits on purchasing catastrophic health plans. The Senate waivers are far more comprehensive than the House\u2019s Meadows-MacArthur amendment, and any Governor who wants to experiment with market solutions and roll back overregulation will be liberated from federal command and control.The       Trump       Administration would rapidly start to restore the traditional state regulatory authority over insurance. Waiver critics say a Democratic successor could take back freedoms not codified in law. But federalist devolution will be hard to reverse if Governors can show they can make premiums more affordable, improve the incentives for insurers to rejoin a more robust market and increase insurance without mandates.The Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its cost-and-coverage estimate of the Senate bill, and opponents are touting its guess of 22 million fewer insured people compared to ObamaCare. But CBO\u2019s forecasts always underestimate the benefits of markets, and the real news is that the scorekeepers expect premiums to fall by 30% by 2020 than under current law. The GOP can deliver tangible financial gains to the millions failed by ObamaCare.These are enormous conservative policy victories, even if they aren\u2019t everything we or other free-marketeers would like. Democrats built the entitlement state piecemeal over decades, and it will have to be reformed in pieces that are politically sustainable.Some Senators can\u2019t be placated on substance and they may decide that defeating the bill is better for them politically. This is pure fantasy. Democrats won\u2019t ease their opposition to Nevada\u2019s       Dean Heller       in 2018 if he votes no. They\u2019ll double their investment against him as Mr. Heller\u2019s political base sours on him. When you face a tough political choice, better to stick with your friends than bet on the kindness of political enemies.Another fantasy is that Republicans can vote no and blame Democrats for the collapsing ObamaCare status quo. The media will blame Republicans for every premium hike, and voters believe they elected a GOP Congress and President. If this bill fails Republicans will be forced to come hat in hand to Chuck Schumer\u2019s Democrats for the votes to stop a downward spiral of surging premiums and declining choices. Conservative reform won\u2019t be included.The larger and rarer opportunity is to show that conservative ideas can succeed in health care. More progress is possible as voters come to trust Republican solutions, but not if the GOP now panics into defeat. Senator Johnson entered politics to oppose ObamaCare. Is he really going to squander this chance to make his detour into politics worthwhile?Every consequential legislative reform is difficult, but the GOP anxiety over repeal and replace is excessive. They should have more confidence in their convictions and how their solutions can improve American lives.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 22:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-senates-health-care-hour-1498517228", "news_title": "The Senate\u2019s Health-Care Hour", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,editorials,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "One of       Lisa Klinger\u2019s       tasks is to put the brakes on her boss.\u201cWhen I first joined, our CEO said that if we are not public within 12 months, he would be disappointed,\u201d recalls the finance chief of Peloton Interactive Inc., the 400-person Manhattan-based company that sells internet-connected bikes and subscriptions to cycling classes. \u201cI cringed,\u201d she said.Ms. Klinger is Peloton\u2019s first chief financial officer.

Peloton was focused on the exercise bikes and online classes, whereas more mundane, yet fundamental things, such as finance processes and internal controls, received little attention.\u201cThe team was working on a great product but did not think of setting up the background operations,\u201d Ms. Klinger said.Her mission is to turn Peloton into a \u201cwell-run, high-growth company.\u201d Controlled, sustained growth is important to putting Peloton on a solid footing so an IPO will be successful and deliver a high valuation, Ms. Klinger said. This includes expanding and sustaining the subscriber base, increasing the number of showrooms and improving the logistics around shipping bikes to customers.\u201cWe could do an IPO tomorrow, but that\u2019s not what we are here for,\u201d Ms. Klinger said, adding that listing simply for the sake of listing wasn\u2019t the best long-term strategy.Peloton raised $325 million this year and is valued at $1.25 billion.

The company, which hasn\u2019t yet posted a profit, earned $170 million in revenue in 2016, up from $60 million the previous year.A monthly subscription fee of $39 generates about 20% of Peloton\u2019s revenue, Ms. Klinger said.\u201cWe want to get as many bikes into people\u2019s homes as possible so we can get the subscription fee,\u201d Ms. Klinger said.Peloton didn\u2019t give specific subscriber numbers, but aims to have 200,000 subscribers by the end of the year.The company might prove to be disruptive to the fitness industry, similar to the way             Netflix Inc.       upended cable television.\u201cThe subscription fee is the thing that matters,\u201d said       Andrew Burns,        an analyst at D.A.

Some of the cash will be used as a deposit for a revolving credit facility. There is no rush to go public, and Peloton so far hasn\u2019t stated when it expects to break even.

Mr. Zinke has already recommended that the government roll back some regulations\u00a0and shrink the boundaries of the controversial Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.Mr. Zinke announced\u00a0the new payout figure\u00a0Monday\u00a0after he met with a group\u00a0of public officials in rural Nevada.The money is the\u00a0latest in a string of increased allocations\u00a0for a program passed by Congress in 1976 after years of complaints from county officials that federal land holdings within their boundaries took too much property off the tax rolls.The issue has been of particular concern to Western areas\u00a0where the federal government\u00a0may control more than\u00a090% of the land in some cases.The regions didn\u2019t start to receive\u00a0full\u00a0funding under the program until 2008,\u00a0when Congress changed the allocations from discretionary to mandatory.The program is one that draws rare bipartisan support, because the\u00a0proceeds go toward an array of services\u00a0including roads repairs and basic health care services in often cash-strapped counties.The money is particularly needed in places like Nevada\u2019s Nye County, where 98% of the land is federally owned,\u00a0County Commissioner Dan Schinhofen said after he met with Mr. Zinke and other officials.Such funding\u00a0\u201cis not seen as discretionary to us, and as such needs to be guaranteed,\u201d Mr. Schinhofen said in a statement.Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 21:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zinke-plans-to-boost-payout-to-rural-areas-1498527574", "news_title": "Zinke Plans to Boost Payout to Rural Areas", "keywords": "department of the interior,federal budget,rural areas,tax revenue,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "Sprint Corp.        S -0.47%       has entered into exclusive talks with             Charter Communications Inc.        CHTR 0.57%       and             Comcast Corp.        CMCSA 0.41%       as the cable companies explore a deal that could bolster their plans to offer wireless service, according to people familiar with the matter.Sprint Chairman       Masayoshi Son       and the cable firms have entered into a two-month, exclusive agreement for discussions through late July, putting merger talks with             T-Mobile US Inc.        TMUS 0.94%       on hold, the people said.One arrangement that has been considered is for Charter and Comcast to invest in improving Sprint\u2019s network in exchange for favorable terms to offer wireless service using the carrier\u2019s network, the people said. Such a deal could involve the companies taking an equity stake in Sprint, some of the people said. The cable companies already have such a network-resale agreement with             Verizon Communications Inc.,       but the Sprint deal could provide much better terms.While thought to be the much less likely scenario, the talks also include the possibility for the cable companies to jointly acquire Sprint, some of the people said. Sprint has a market value of $32 billion and $32.6 billion of net debt.A reseller agreement with Charter and Comcast wouldn\u2019t preclude a subsequent merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, some of the people said. While Sprint and T-Mobile have remained far apart in their merger talks, people familiar with the discussions said a merger between the two companies isn\u2019t off the table and may still be the most likely outcome.Charter and Comcast, the two largest U.S. cable companies by subscribers, in May agreed to a wireless truce, which barred both companies from doing a wireless deal without the other\u2019s blessing or participation for a year.John Malone,        whose             Liberty Broadband Corp.       is Charter\u2019s largest investor, has been trying to convince Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts for the past year that the companies should jointly buy a carrier like Sprint, according to people familiar with the matter.So far, Mr. Roberts has been reluctant. His goal is to secure a better reseller agreement as Comcast jumps into the wireless business, according to a person familiar with his thinking.Charter Chief Executive       Tom Rutledge       has said that he sees the logic in buying a wireless operator at the \u201cright price and right owners\u2019 economics\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessary.\u201dThe talks between Sprint, Charter and Comcast come as the cable and wireless industries are on a collision course that makes consolidation increasingly logical but also complex. As smartphones become increasingly important, consumers rely equally on cable and cellular companies to surf the web and watch videos, as more than half of all smartphone web traffic is carried over Wi-Fi.Cable titans Charter and Comcast see a chance to retain customers and hold off the threats of cord-cutting and online video providers by adding mobile-phone service to their bundles of TV, phone and broadband internet service. The thinking is that the \u201cquad play\u201d would make their offerings more essential and cost efficient, making customers less likely to cancel contracts.Meanwhile, wireless companies are engaged in a fierce price war in a saturated market that is quickly eroding revenue. T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest carriers by subscribers, have cut prices the most. Unlike Verizon and             AT&T Inc.,       Sprint and T-Mobile don\u2019t have extensive consumer wired networks, so combining wireless with cable\u2019s high-speed wires could help speed the construction of next-generation, or 5G, wireless internet connections.Mr. Son, a Japanese billionaire whose             SoftBank Group Corp.       controls Sprint, has been trying to gin up cable companies\u2019 interest in acquiring the struggling carrier or buying a big stake.Mr. Son had recently rekindled talks with             Deutsche Telekom AG      , the parent company of T-Mobile, to merge the two companies, but a deal has yet to materialize. The two previously discussed combining in 2014 but backed down in the face of regulatory opposition. As recently as last week, Sprint CEO       Marcelo Claure       publicly spoke about the benefits of a T-Mobile merger.Comcast recently started offering wireless service to its own high-speed internet customers, using Verizon\u2019s network for the connections. Charter is also working on a similar service to be released next year.Striking a reseller agreement with Sprint instead of Verizon would likely make it easier for the cable companies to expand their wireless offering. With Verizon, for instance, the cable companies can\u2019t sell wireless service outside of their cable footprint, and the deal was struck years ago, when wireless prices were much higher.In discussions with Sprint about a potential new reseller agreement, Mr. Son has shown willingness to give the cable executives unprecedented flexibility, including control over things like customer SIM cards, according to people familiar with the matter. That would give Charter and Comcast more control over their customers and more leverage with Sprint in any future discussions than they have in their current reseller deal with Verizon, in which Verizon maintains broad power over the wholesale connections.A few weeks ago, Mr. Son met with top Comcast and Charter executives to pitch the idea of investing in Sprint and using Sprint as their primary wholesaler for wireless airwaves, according to people familiar with the matter. That would be a financial boost for the struggling carrier, which hasn\u2019t had a profitable year since 2006.The unfolding game of telecom chess could involve other players, too.             Altice                   NV, the European telecom giant controlled by French billionaire       Patrick Drahi,        just completed an initial public offering for its U.S. cable arm,             Altice USA,       the fourth-largest cable company by subscribers through its acquisitions of Cablevision Systems Corp. and Suddenlink Communications in the past couple of years.With a market value of $26.6 billion, Altice USA could also make a play for Sprint or T-Mobile, analysts say, given its focus on offering quad play bundles in its overseas markets. An Altice spokeswoman declined to comment.Mr. Malone, a pioneer of the U.S. cable business, has long felt that the cable industry should work closer together to combat threats like             Netflix Inc.       and the wireless carriers. In January, he said that \u201cmaybe the three major cable companies get together and buy T-Mobile\u201d\u2014including privately held cable company Cox Communications Inc.\u2014 or even \u201cComcast and Charter could merge\u201d under the more lenient antitrust posture of the Trump administration.Mr. Malone and Mr. Roberts have a long history together, both as a mentor and pupil and as competitors, and they haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye. Mr. Roberts stole away Time Warner Cable from under Mr. Malone\u2019s nose in 2014, though regulators eventually threw up obstacles to Comcast completing its deal. Charter ended up acquiring Time Warner Cable last year, but only at a much more expensive price than initially imagined.Write to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com, Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com and Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Sprint, Charter, Comcast in Talks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 21:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sprint-enters-into-exclusive-talks-with-charter-comcast-on-wireless-deal-1498524087", "news_title": "Sprint Enters Into Exclusive Talks With Charter, Comcast On Wireless Deal ", "keywords": "broadband,cable,charter communications,comcast,merger,reseller,sprint,wireless,Charter Communications ,CHTR,Comcast,CMCSA,Sprint,S,T-Mobile US,TMUS,SoftBank Group,JP:9984,Deutsche Telekom,XE:DTE,Masayoshi Son,John Malone,Brian Roberts,Tom Rutledge,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "The Senate Republican health-care overhaul would result in 22 million more people uninsured and cut the cumulative federal deficit by $321 billion in the next decade compared with the current Affordable Care Act, according to an estimate released Monday by the Congressional Budget Office.That assessment threw into doubt whether the bill would make it past an initial procedural hurdle as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is engaged in last-minute negotiations with more than a half-dozen GOP lawmakers wavering in their support of the bill. Sen.       Susan Collins       (R., Maine) said she would vote against the bill, citing the CBO report.Also on Monday, the American Medical Association announced its opposition to the bill in a letter to Senate leaders, saying \u201cit will expose low- and middle-income patients to higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care.\u201d But insurer Anthem Inc. said it believed the legislation would bring stability to the individual insurance markets.GOP leaders have said the Senate will vote this week on the bill. They can lose no more than two Republican senators on either the \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d to debate on the bill, which could come as early as Tuesday, or on the bill itself, expected to come up for a vote later in the week. None of the 48 members of the Senate Democratic caucus is expected to vote in favor of the bill.Six GOP senators are now opposed to the bill and at least three have said they would block it on the procedural vote.The bill\u2019s effect on consumers would vary widely, the CBO found. Many people would see lower premiums, partly because their plans would cover fewer benefits. But for lower-income consumers or those with special needs, medical costs could be significantly higher.Republicans emphasized the CBO\u2019s finding that after rising for a time, average premiums would go down after 2020.\u201cOur plan will help address Obamacare\u2019s ballooning costs for consumers by lowering premiums over time and cutting taxes, and today\u2019s estimate confirms that,\u201d said Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican.The White House said in a statement: \u201cThe CBO has consistently proven it cannot accurately predict how healthcare legislation will impact insurance coverage. This history of inaccuracy, as demonstrated by its flawed report on coverage, premiums, and predicted deficit arising out of Obamacare, reminds us that its analysis must not be trusted blindly.\u201dDemocrats and their allies pounced on the analysis to say the Senate bill would gut Medicaid and give tax breaks to the wealthy. \u201cToday\u2019s report confirms what doctors, patient advocates, Democrats and Republicans have been saying for weeks: Trumpcare will lead to higher costs for less care, and will lead to tens of millions of Americans left without health insurance,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).Senate leaders have been working for weeks in closed-door sessions to draft a bill knocking down key parts of the ACA and replacing it with a new system of tax credits and cuts to Medicaid. If the bill passes this week, it is possible the House could vote on health-overhaul legislation before Congress takes a recess in August.Four conservative Republicans\u2014Sens.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas\u2014said shortly after the bill\u2019s release they opposed it in its current form. A centrist, Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.), announced his opposition the following day.Ms. Collins said in a trio of tweets Monday evening that while she wanted to fix the ACA, the \u201cCBO analysis shows Senate bill won\u2019t do it,\u201d citing the cuts to Medicaid funding and how that could restrict health-care access in rural areas. \u201cSenate bill doesn\u2019t fix ACA problems for rural Maine,\u201d she said.Mr. McConnell\u2019s most immediate challenge is securing the 50 votes needed to clear the procedural vote. Mr. Paul and Ms. Collins have said they would vote against it, and Mr. Johnson has said he couldn\u2019t vote to advance the bill without further information.If Mr. McConnell can\u2019t persuade at least one of those Republicans to change their mind, the monthslong push to overhaul the ACA would collapse on the procedural vote.Lawmakers will have little time to digest the CBO analysis, if the vote occurs this week as planned. When the CBO reported that the House version of the bill would result in 23 million fewer insured Americans in 2026 than the ACA, it delivered a jolt that undermined the bill\u2019s support, though House Republican leaders were able to muster enough support to narrowly pass it.It is unclear if the CBO score will have a similar effect in the Senate. Some GOP centrists had expressed concerns that the bill would leave too many people uninsured.The increase in the uninsured would be disproportionately larger among older people with lower income, particularly people between 50 and 64 years old, according to the CBO.Under the Senate bill, an estimated 49 million people would be uninsured by 2026 compared with 28 million who would lack care under the ACA, according to the analysis by CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation. That\u2019s primarily because of sizable cuts to the Medicaid program, the end of a penalty for not having coverage, and substantially smaller subsidies to help low-income people purchase insurance. The number of Medicaid enrollees under 65 would fall by about 16% by 2026 relative to current law (or 15 million fewer people).The Senate bill would phase out enhanced federal funding by 2024 to the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and it would alter the program\u2019s overall funding in a way that would sharply limit the money received by the states.Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by $772 billion over 10 years under the Senate bill, compared with $834 billion under the House bill, according to the CBO.States could use waivers to roll back the ACA\u2019s requirements that insurers cover certain benefits, such as maternity care and mental-health services, and could use waivers to override the ACA\u2019s limits on out-of-pocket and lifetime medical costs.The CBO estimated that about half the country\u2019s population would live in states that choose to use waivers that give insurers leeway to cover fewer services required by the ACA. Residents of those states who sought benefits that insurers no longer must cover would face \u201csubstantial increases\u201d in their costs, the CBO said.Republicans say the legislation is needed because the individual insurance markets under the ACA are struggling. About 47 counties in the U.S., or about 34,000 people, are at risk of having no insurer to pick from on the exchanges next year, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.On Monday,             Anthem Inc.       said it believes that Senate bill will bolster the individual market, an endorsement that comes as many other insurers have suggested the legislation could undermine the ACA marketplaces.Anthem said it believed the bill \u201cwill markedly improve the stability of the individual market and moderate premium increases\u201d because it allots billions to help stabilize the markets, eliminates a tax on health insurance plans and works on \u201caligning premium subsidies with premium costs.\u201dThe bill\u2019s reduction of the federal deficit by $321 billion through 2026 is more than the House version, which the CBO estimated would curb the deficit by $119 billion. Under Senate procedural rules, the bill must have at least as much of a deficit reduction at the legislation passed by the House. That leaves Senate Republican leaders with about $200 billion they can add to the bill to get more lawmakers to support the legislation and still meet the same savings as the House version.Cumulative effect on the deficit, in billionsAs passed by the HouseSenate bill$100500", "news_time": "2017-06-26 21:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-health-bill-raises-uninsured-by-22-million-in-2026-compared-to-aca-the-cbo-says-1498508907", "news_title": "Senate Health Bill Raises Uninsured by 22 Million in 2026 Compared With ACA, the CBO Says", "keywords": "affordable care act,cbo analysis, congressional budget office, federal deficit, senate health care bill, uninsured,Anthem,ANTM,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "The surname of Claude Moniquet, a former French intelligence official who leads the Brussels-based think tank European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center, was misspelled as Monique in a Page One article on Monday about recent terror attacks in Europe.The \u20ac37 billion in German military spending approved last year is equivalent to $41.4 billion.

The move could have an immediate effect on trade,pu as the U.S. government will start collecting deposits from imports based on the new ruling.\u201cI remain optimistic that we will reach a negotiated solution on softwood lumber,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       said in a statement announcing the new moves. But, he added, \u201cuntil we do we will continue to vigorously apply\u2026laws to stand up for American companies and their workers.\u201dCanadian lumber producers on Monday said that while they viewed the new duties as unjust, they were actually a bit relieved because they were at the lower end of what the industry was expecting.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe any duties are appropriate,\u201d said       Susan Yurkovich,        president of the BC Lumber Trade Council, which represents lumber producers in British Columbia, where half of Canadian softwood exports to the U.S come from.\u00a0The new round of duties, she added, combined with what was previously announced, will continue to \u201cpunish American consumers who are faced with higher lumber prices when they buy, build or renovate their home.\u201dIn a statement, Canada said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with the Commerce department\u2019s decision. The duties imposed \u201care based on a flawed rationale that is damaging to workers, communities and consumers in Canada and the U.S.\u201dMeanwhile, the U.S. Lumber Coalition, an industry lobby group, said it applauded Washington\u2019s move to counter Canada\u2019s \u201cunfair trading practices.\u201dWhile Mr. Ross and President Donald Trump have both prominently highlighted the dispute, it actually dates back decades, and the U.S. has repeatedly over the years taken measures to try to block Canadian softwood.The battle takes on an added significance this year, as the two countries\u2014along with Mexico\u2014are also renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.

Mr. Temer has previously denied any wrongdoing and has said he wouldn\u2019t step down from the presidency.Two-thirds of Congress must vote to allow the case against Mr. Temer to go to a trial, which would occur before the country\u2019s Supreme Court. That sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown between Brazil\u2019s crusading law-enforcement apparatus and an entrenched political class at a time of growing tension between the two sides.Launched in 2014, the so-called Operation Car Wash has expanded from a narrow money-laundering probe into Brazil\u2019s most significant anticorruption push ever. In a country where the rich and powerful historically faced few consequences for wrongdoing, the investigation has led to the jailing of scores of high-profile businessmen and politicians, yielded more than $7 billion in settlements and stirred broad hopes for a fairer society.But it hasn\u2019t magically given Brazilians a new roster of honest politicians, something even the most optimistic political scientists say would take years. Instead, the investigations have fueled a state of nearly constant political turmoil, contributing to Brazil\u2019s deepest economic downturn in more than a century and leading to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016.\u201cSo far, the confrontation of systemic corruption has basically been the work of law enforcement: police, prosecutors and judges, with strong support from civil society and public opinion,\u201d       Sergio Moro,        the judge spearheading Car Wash who is widely seen as a national hero, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt needs to become part of the political agenda.\u201dBut with a second president in little more than a year teetering, some Brazilians are beginning to wonder if the costs of cleaning up corruption outweigh the benefits. Brazil\u2019s per capita economic output has contracted by some 11% since Car Wash began, forcing millions of layoffs.The instability has been compounded by growing evidence of corruption\u2019s omnipresence in Brazilian politics.In a videotaped testimony he gave as part of a plea deal earlier this year,       Marcelo Odebrecht,        the former chief executive of Latin America\u2019s largest construction company, said he was unaware of any politician managing to get elected without illegal cash. Undeclared contributions, he estimated, account for some three-fourths of all campaign money.\u201cEven if the guy says he didn\u2019t know, he still received money from his party that was [illegal],\u201d Mr. Odebrecht testified.But with a budget deficit in excess of 9% of gross domestic product, Brazil desperately needs to pass sweeping reforms to avert a potential debt crisis, economists say. Mr. Temer, who is deeply unpopular with ordinary Brazilians but enjoys cozy relations with much of Congress, was seen a capable negotiator until the latest scandal erupted.Growing numbers of politicians, and some members of the judiciary, have said Brazil should focus on fixing the economy under Mr. Temer, whose term ends in 2018. The president\u2019s governing coalition in Congress has remained largely intact even after the attorney general placed Mr. Temer under investigation in May.Brazil\u2019s electoral court, known as the TSE, this month acquitted Mr. Temer on charges of receiving illicit campaign funds in the 2014 election, a case that could have forced him from office. To reach its ruling, the court tossed out evidence from Car Wash showing that the campaign had taken clandestine money from Mr. Odebrecht\u2019s firm.\u201cYou can\u2019t replace a president every hour, even if you want to,\u201d TSE President       Gilmar Mendes       said as he cast the tiebreaking vote to absolve Mr. Temer.That decision was roundly criticized. \u201cTSE Ignores Proof,\u201d blared a headline in Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper. Activists placed funeral wreaths outside the TSE\u2019s building in Bras\u00edlia.But tellingly, street protests on the scale of those that shook Brazil in 2013 and 2016 didn\u2019t materialize. Nor were there major demonstrations following last month\u2019s release of a taped conversation in which Mr. Batista told Mr. Temer of his efforts to obstruct investigations into JBS and its parent company.Prosecutors worry the public\u2019s apparent fatigue is giving politicians the cover they need to undermine Car Wash.\u201cWithout the support of the population, Car Wash wouldn\u2019t have happened, and without the support of the population it will die sooner than it should,\u201d said       Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima,        a prosecutor on the original task force, in an interview.Mr. Lima, like many here, sees law enforcement as only part of the solution to Brazil\u2019s corruption problem. He says Congress should also seek to reduce the number of parties\u2014currently around 35\u2014to make politics less transactional. An electoral system that awards congressional seats to parties rather than individual candidates makes it possible for unpopular legislators to remain in office. Elected officials and cabinet members also enjoy special legal protections, such as a rule that they can only be tried in the Supreme Court for criminal offenses.Instead of making its members more accountable to voters, Congress is working on a bill that would expose law-enforcement officials to lawsuits for \u201cabuse of authority.\u201d Legislators have been talking openly of giving themselves amnesty for undeclared campaign cash. Mr. Temer\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, is working behind the scenes to influence the choice of a new attorney general to succeed Mr. Janot when his term ends in September, according to one of the party\u2019s senators.\u201cWe will vote the necessary reforms and purge the dictatorship of the prosecutors,\u201d said Darc\u00edsio Perondi, a PMDB congressman and staunch ally of the president. \u201cTemer is indispensable.\u201dThe stakes have risen since Mr. Batista\u2019s bombshell testimony shattered many politicians\u2019 complacent belief that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government was a \u201csacrificial lamb to prosecutors\u201d rather than a milestone in a probe seeking even deeper political change, said       Chris Garman,        a political analyst at Eurasia Group.\u201cThey are seeing investigations as reaching a politically dangerous tipping point,\u201d Mr. Garman said, noting that PMDB politicians have been openly trying to discredit Car Wash in recent weeks.Against that backdrop, some analysts say Mr. Janot is unlikely to secure the Supreme Court votes necessary to indict the president, who is cozy with much of the political class.But Mr. Temer\u2019s dismal popularity\u20147% of Brazilians approve of his government, according to a poll released Saturday by Datafolha\u2014sets limits on how far legislators are willing to stick their necks out for him.\u201cA lot of deputies are very nervous about their reelection possibilities,\u201d said       David Fleischer,        a political-science professor at the University of Bras\u00edlia.\u2014Luciana Magalhaes contributed to this article.Write to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Brazil\u2019s Leader Charged With Corruption.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 20:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-president-michel-temer-is-charged-with-corruption-1498520407", "news_title": "Brazil President Michel Temer Is Charged With Corruption", "keywords": " brazil car wash, brazil corruption, brazil political corruption,brazil politics,JBS SA ,JBSS3.BR,Michel Temer,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court Monday ruled that Missouri may not exclude a church school from a program that funds playground resurfacing, finding that discrimination based on \u201creligious identity\u201d violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection for free exercise of religion.The Missouri Constitution long had forbidden public subsidy, \u201cdirectly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion,\u201d which state courts interpreted as excluding church-run schools from programs like Missouri\u2019s Playground Scrap Tire Surface Material Grants, which helps schools and day-care centers resurface playgrounds with material made from recycled tires.\u201cThe consequence\u201d of that approach \u201cis, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees,\u201d Chief Justice       John Roberts       wrote for the court. But excluding Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Mo., from applying for the funds \u201csolely because it is a church is odious to our Constitution all the same.\u201dThe court recalled a series of cases addressing the line between church and state, a legal limit whose exact location has vexed justices for generations. In 1947, the chief justice noted, the court ruled that New Jersey could reimburse parents for the cost of public transportation to send their children to school, whether public, private or parochial.The program passed muster, the court said then, because New Jersey \u201ccannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews Methodists, Nonbelievers, Presbyterians or the members of any other faith because of their faith, or lack of it from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.\u201dIn 2004, however, the court upheld a Washington state law that excluded devotional theology studies from a scholarship program. The difference, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, was that the Washington student \u201cwas not denied a scholarship because of who he was; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed to do\u2014use the funds to prepare for the ministry.\u201d\u201cEqual treatment of a religious organization in a program that provides only secular benefits, like a partial reimbursement grant for playground surfacing, isn\u2019t a government endorsement of religion,\u201d said David Cortman, an attorney with the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued the church\u2019s case.The opinion stopped short of the wholesale redefinition of church-state separation that religious advocates supporting the case had hoped for. Chief Justice Roberts said in a footnote that the court didn\u2019t \u201caddress religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination\u201d apart from the playground program.That footnote exposed the court\u2019s divisions regarding the religion clauses. Two conservative justices,       Clarence Thomas       and       Neil Gorsuch,        explicitly rejected the Roberts footnote, even while agreeing with his broader decision in favor of the church. The Constitution \u201cguarantees the free exercise of religion, not just the right to inward belief (or status),\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote.Apart from the footnote, Justices Thomas and Gorsuch joined the Roberts opinion, which had the full votes of Justices Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito and       Elena Kagan.While Justices Thomas and Gorsuch argued the Roberts footnote improperly restricted religious groups\u2019 access to public funds, justices on the court\u2019s liberal wing found it didn\u2019t go far enough to assuage concerns regarding government subsidy of churches.Justice Stephen Breyer agreed with the result on the playground subsidy, but wrote separately to stress that he viewed the decision as applying only to \u201ca general program designed to secure or to improve the health and safety of children\u2026leaving other kinds of public benefits for another day.\u201dTwo liberals dissented, with Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       signaling her distress by reading her opinion from the bench.\u201cHistory shows that the religion clauses separate the public treasure from religious coffers as one measure to secure the kind of freedom of conscience that benefits both religion and government,\u201d she wrote, joined by Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Missouri\u2019s new Republican governor, Eric Greitens, announced earlier this year that the state would cease to distinguish between religious and secular schools in administering the program. But legal analysts on both sides of the issue said his plan could run afoul of state court precedents interpreting the Missouri Constitution.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Church Entitled To Public Money, High Court Rules.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 20:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-says-state-playground-grant-program-cant-exclude-religious-schools-1498496118", "news_title": "Supreme Court Says State Playground-Grant Program Can\u2019t Exclude Religious Schools", "keywords": "church and state,playground case,religion,religion state funding,religious freedom,school funding,separation of church and state,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,discrimination,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,school,social issues,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released its much-anticipated analysis of the Senate\u2019s bill repealing and replacing large swaths of the Affordable Care Act.

That largely is due to sizable cuts made to the Medicaid program and substantially lower subsidies to help low-income people purchase insurance.That coverage estimate clocks in at slightly less than the 23 million people that CBO projected would lose coverage under the House\u2019s version of the bill. Even so, it represents a much smaller improvement than lawmakers would have hoped and could complicate the political calculations of some centrist-leaning Republican senators, who balked at similar coverage losses in the House\u2019s version.The Senate bill would save the federal government $321 billion over the next decade. That is about $202 billion more than the House-passed bill would have saved. The difference is in part thanks to the way the Senate bill repeals the ACA\u2019s taxes, which restricts when people can deduct medical costs.Because of the complex budget rules Congress is using to pass their repeal bill, the Senate\u2019s version can save no less than the $119 billion in deficit reduction contained in the House bill. Still, the $202 billion leaves Senate leaders some wiggle room to add spending back into the bill, a tool that analysts expect they will use to win the support of wavering lawmakers. Leaders are expected, for example, to add money to the $2 billion the bill would spend on opioid treatment.Under the Senate\u2019s legislation, premiums would rise slightly in the first two years after the bill\u2019s passage, because fewer people would be induced to purchase coverage without a mandate. But they would steadily begin to fall starting in 2020 onward. CBO attributes the eventual drop in premiums in part to federal assistance and to the bill\u2019s loosening of insurance regulations that could result in health plans that cover fewer medical benefits and a smaller overall portion of a person\u2019s health spending.At the same time, deductibles for low-income people could balloon under the Senate plan, because beginning in 2020 the bill stops funding \u201ccost-sharing\u201d subsidies that lowered out-of-pocket costs for people making up to 250% of the federal poverty line. And some people with costly pre-existing conditions whose plans would no longer be required to cover certain medical benefits could pay much more for their coverage or forego insurance entirely.The bill\u2019s repeal of the Medicaid expansion and change to the program\u2019s overall funding structure would result in $772 billion in savings over the next decade. CBO estimates that the cuts would result in 15 million people losing Medicaid coverage\u2014slightly more than the number of people who gained it under the ACA\u2019s expansion of the joint federal-state health program.But the number of people losing coverage would likely increase after 2026, the final year included in CBO\u2019s projection. That is because near the end of that window, the Medicaid cuts would begin to accelerate,Overall, CBO predicts the individual market would remain stable if the Senate bill were enacted, despite some uncertainty for insurance companies around the end of the ACA\u2019s penalty for people who don\u2019t purchase health insurance.The report attributes the stability to lower insurance costs, which paired with the bill\u2019s subsidies would entice a sufficient number of young, healthy people to buy insurance. Additional funding for insurers to cover out-of-pocket costs of low-income people and separate funding to help defray the costs of the most expensive customers would also encourage insurers to remain in the market, the report said.But the legislation could cause insurers to pull out of some sparsely-populated areas of the country, because the smaller subsidies would lead to fewer people to buy insurance, making those markets less attractive.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 19:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-findings-of-the-cbo-on-senate-health-plan-1498520946", "news_title": "Five Findings of the CBO on Senate Health Plan ", "keywords": "government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "Shares of utility companies and other dividend-paying stocks led the S&P 500 to a slim gain following some tepid U.S. economic data.As investors turned to more defensive stocks that tend to offer steady income, they dialed back on the year\u2019s biggest gainer, the technology sector.Overall moves were relatively muted.

Mr. Modi stressed that India has \u201cplayed an important role in rebuilding Afghanistan.\u201dMr. Trump also mentioned his concern about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs, saying it represents a threat that \u201chas to be dealt with and probably dealt with rapidly.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. Mr. Trump in a             Twitter                   message last week said that his plan to enlist China in pressuring North Korea to reverse course \u201chas not worked out.\u201dIn advance of Mr. Modi\u2019s White House visit, the U.S. sanctioned       Mohammad Yusuf Shah,        senior leader of a militant group that has used violence against Indian troops in the Kashmir region. India and Pakistan have been embroiled in a conflict for decades over Kashmir.Mr. Trump briefly mentioned the importance of eliminating trade barriers that weigh on U.S. exports, but he didn\u2019t criticize the U.S. trade deficit with India in the same strong terms he has used toward other major economies.U.S. merchandise imports from India are about twice the level of its exports to the South Asian country, resulting in a trade deficit of $24.4 billion last year. U.S. officials say barriers to agricultural goods and India\u2019s policies on intellectual property weigh on American farmers and businesses.The meeting on Monday took place amid differences between Messrs. Modi and Trump on issues such as trade, climate change and immigration. Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 international climate accord, of which India is a signatory.But the two men papered over their differences as they worked to establish a rapport in discussions set over approximately four hours, including a private dinner at the White House. They hugged after their public statements.After welcoming Mr. Modi, Mr. Trump said he had been reading about him and that India is doing well economically, for which he congratulated the prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to have Prime Minister Modi of India, who has been such a great prime minister,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Modi said he was grateful for the visit and mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to India before he became president.\u2014William Mauldin contributed to this article.Write to Carol E.

Justice       Clarence Thomas,        who long has been calling for additional cases to clarify the constitutional right to weapons, and the newest justice,       Donald Trump       appointee       Neil Gorsuch,        would have taken the case.The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, upheld the California regulations, a decision Justice Thomas called \u201cindefensible.\u201dBut it was two liberals, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and       Sonia Sotomayor,        who dissented when the court turned down a Justice Department appeal seeking to reinstate federal law barring certain ex-offenders from possessing firearms. The Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, found that the ex-offenders\u2019 crimes were too minor to justify denying them access to weapons.Taken together, the denials suggest the court\u2019s reluctance to add explosive questions of firearms regulation to a docket already growing with divisive issues following Justice Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation\u2014perhaps because neither advocates nor skeptics of increasing access to guns feel confident of pulling a majority to their views. Four votes are required to add a case to the docket, but it takes five to win the case.The California law generally prohibits carrying firearms, concealed or openly, in urban areas but permits local authorities to make exceptions, allowing individuals to carry concealed weapons in some circumstances if they demonstrate \u201cgood cause.\u201dThat responsibility for granting such licenses typically falls to the sheriffs of the state\u2019s 58 counties or to police chiefs in its hundreds of incorporated cities. While some jurisdictions recognize a general interest in self-defense as reason enough, others require more, such as a specific threat that would justify special precautions.Gun owners challenged such requirements in San Diego and Yolo counties, contending that when read together with statewide laws, they effectively eliminated most individuals\u2019 ability to carry firearms for self-defense outside the home.The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument. Hearing the case as an 11-member panel, the appeals court found no constitutional right to carry concealed weapons outside the home, and held it improper to expand the case to review California\u2019s statewide weapons-regulation system.Judge       William Fletcher       based his opinion on an effort to determine what the Constitution\u2019s framers had intended, much as Justice       Antonin Scalia       did in his 2008 opinion that, by a 5-4 vote, found the Constitution provided individuals at least the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.The Ninth Circuit, voting 7-4, looked to English statutes and royal proclamations dating from the 13th century, acts of the American colonies before 1776, and application of weapons rights after the country\u2019s independence to conclude that the framers didn\u2019t understand the Constitution as including a right to carry concealed weapons.The appeals court\u2019s dissenters agreed that there was no constitutional right to carry concealed weapons, but said the legal analysis should go further to look at the effects of the local regulations in light of statewide gun laws.The Third Circuit, in contrast, found that federal law swept too far in denying guns to ex-offenders who didn\u2019t appear more dangerous than law-abiding citizens.One of the ex-offenders, Daniel Binderup, had been convicted in 1998 of corrupting a minor when, at age 41, he had a consensual sexual relationship with a 16-year-old employee of his bakery. He received three years probation and a fine and has had a clean record since.Julio Suarez received similarly lenient punishments for carrying a gun without a license in 1990 and drunken driving in 1998, and likewise has been clear since.Those misdemeanors \u201cwere not serious offenses,\u201d Judge Thomas Ambro wrote.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-refuses-to-review-california-concealed-weapon-restrictions-1498488131", "news_title": "Supreme Court Refuses to Review California Concealed-Weapon Restrictions", "keywords": "california,carrying,concealed ,court,gun control,guns,high,san diego,scotus,second amendment,supreme,weapons,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,judicial branch,firearms,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}, {"content": "For decades American conservatives have sought to restore meaning to the 10th Amendment, which recognizes the states\u2019 right to manage their affairs free from Washington\u2019s interference. Passing the Republican Senate\u2019s health-care bill would represent historic progress toward that goal.In nearly every state, Medicaid is either the largest or second-largest budget line, as well as the fastest-growing category. Every year state lawmakers, trying to carry Medicaid\u2019s heavy burden, are forced to make difficult choices about what else to cut: education, roads, public safety.Especially frustrating is that state officials have little control over how to manage their Medicaid programs. The 1965 Medicaid law contains dozens of limits on what states can do to avoid waste, fraud and abuse. In the half-century since, Washington has added to that burden with more laws and regulations.Governors and state legislatures ask Washington every year for the right to receive their Medicaid funds in the form of a block grant, which would give them autonomy to manage the spending as they see fit. The Senate bill, for the first time, would allow that.States that forgo the block grants would still receive additional flexibility through per capita allotments, an idea first proposed by President Clinton in 1995. The Senate bill would limit the growth of federal spending on each able-bodied enrollee to the rate of medical inflation, and on elderly and disabled enrollees to medical inflation plus 1%. After 2025, per-enrollee spending would be tied to overall inflation. The net effect would be to reduce overall federal spending on the pre-ObamaCare Medicaid program by up to 2% from projected levels over the next 10 years.In exchange for putting Medicaid on a budget, states would gain substantial latitude to use funds more efficiently. Example: Thanks to ObamaCare, states are permitted to verify a recipient\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid only once a year. As a result, scarce dollars continue going to people who become ineligible. Of the 10% (or more) of Medicaid spending that is improper, the majority goes to ineligible recipients, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The Senate bill would liberate states from many other ObamaCare burdens. It would oblige the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant all state waiver requests unless they increase federal spending, and to issue a final decision on waiver applications within six months of receiving them. Under current law, waivers are at the secretary\u2019s discretion and there is no deadline.The new waiver process would let states reduce premiums and health-care costs by bypassing a broad array of ObamaCare provisions, including benefit mandates and requirements that all individual policies be part of a single risk pool. Waivers would last eight years, with the option to renew.All of this new flexibility would substantially improve Washington\u2019s fidelity to the 10th Amendment. It would give governors and state legislators the ability to reduce health-care costs for those who\u2019ve struggled in the ObamaCare era. It would help them devote limited resources to those most in need.There\u2019s always more to be done. To the degree Republican senators can further expand state flexibility without running afoul of Senate parliamentary rules, they should do so. For one thing, the federal Medicaid law prohibits states from making eligibility changes prospectively\u2014meaning they cannot make changes for future enrollees while grandfathering in current ones. Senators should consider amending their bill to eliminate this constraint.But even in its current form, the GOP health-reform effort represents the greatest expansion of state sovereignty in generations. It\u2019s one of the primary reasons the left hates the bill and one of the most important reasons conservatives should support it.Mr. Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, was a policy adviser to       Mitt Romney,       Rick Perry       and       Marco Rubio.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 19:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-senate-saves-the-10th-amendment-1498518832", "news_title": "The Senate Saves the 10th Amendment", "keywords": "center for medicare and madicaid services,healh-care reform,health care,health-care bill,health insurance,medicaid,medicare,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,life sciences,financial services,government sponsored health insurance"}, {"content": "BeirutIn the violent Middle East, Lebanon looks like a miracle. A mix of Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims who have fought a brutal civil war, and have weathered aggressive outside interference, Lebanon is still puttering along as a semifunctioning democracy. To encourage and strengthen the Lebanese Armed Forces, the U.S. has given more than $1 billion over the last decade.But looks are deceiving. In Lebanon, despite America\u2019s help, Iran has won.Step back a few decades and remember the pitched battles of the Lebanese civil war\u2014Sunni vs. Shiite vs. Christian. The kidnapping and killing of countless innocents; the murder of the CIA station chief in Beirut; and finally, the end of the civil war with the 1989 Taif Accords, a rare Arab-led initiative, which dictated terms that enabled weary Lebanese fighters to lay down their arms.The many militias that had grown up as appendages of the Lebanese political process were disarmed, the army was successfully deconfessionalized, militias melted into the Lebanese Armed Forces, Shiites were reassigned to Sunni units, Christians to Shiite ones and so on. The fighting ground to a halt. Israelis, and eventually even Syrian occupying forces, withdrew.Except for Hezbollah. This Shiite militia was created by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to be an Iranian proxy, nominally \u201cresisting\u201d Israel, but in fact resisting the normal governance of Lebanon by its people. After more than 30 years, Hezbollah is still in Lebanon, sacrificing lives, resisting democracy, dictating foreign policy and corrupting the true Lebanese Armed Forces. For the past six years, it has been fighting assiduously on behalf of Iran and the Assad regime in Syria.On a recent visit, my first after a long lapse, I found a palpable change in tone: Lebanese officials once privately noted their hostility to Hezbollah and Iranian interference. No longer. Now Hezbollah is something to accommodate, part of the \u201cfabric of Lebanese life,\u201d as one senior military official put it. Since the 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah has rearmed dramatically, with an estimated 150,000 missiles, including short-range Katyusha-type rockets and thousands of medium-range missiles capable of striking Tel Aviv. Thousands of Lebanese have either volunteered or been forced to fight in Syria for       Bashar al Assad.Even the Lebanese Armed Forces, long considered a pillar of the state, is now cozy with Hezbollah, as the latter\u2019s leader,       Hassan Nasrallah,        affirmed in a recent speech. And contrary to the oft-expressed hopes of senior U.S. officials, not only has the army failed to limit Hezbollah\u2019s reach within Lebanon, but reports suggest it may also have shared weaponry. A recent Hezbollah military parade in Syria showed U.S.-sourced M113 armored personnel carriers of the kind supplied by Washington to Beirut. Senior Lebanese officials insist the APCs \u201ccould have come from anywhere.\u201dIran is pursuing a similar strategy in Iraq. As in Lebanon, irregular militias have been part of the political and military scene since       Saddam Hussein       ruled. But since the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011 and the rise of Islamic State, some militias have proved useful to the Iraqi government\u2014and to the U.S.\u2014in taking on ISIS, much as Hezbollah proved itself useful to Beirut in ousting Israel from southern Lebanon.The Baghdad government has accommodated the so-called Hashd al Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Forces; and Grand Ayatollah       Ali Sistani,        one of Shiite Islam\u2019s greatest eminences, has blessed their fight. The Iraqi legislature has approved the PMF\u2019s nominal incorporation into the Iraqi army, even as Iraqi government officials acknowledge that 30% of the PMF are under Iranian government control. Once the fight with ISIS ends, what will happen to these militias?There\u2019s already a hint of how the future of the PMF will play out: Like Hezbollah, some units are fighting at Iran\u2019s behest in Syria on behalf of Mr. Assad. Iraqi leaders, as their Lebanese counterparts once did, are fretting about the future of Iran\u2019s proxies. The Iraqis rightly see the militias as instrumental in the counter-ISIS battle, and also rightly judge them a danger when that fight is done. Perhaps, with the help of Ayatollah Sistani, some of the PMF will be legitimately incorporated into the Iraqi army\u2014subsidized by U.S. taxpayers to the tune of $715 million in the last fiscal year alone\u2014and answerable in its chain of command. But Iraqi leaders know full well that some will not.That is why more must be done soon to ensure that the Iraqi leadership understands, as the Lebanese government does not, that the continued existence of Iranian proxy forces within and working alongside its military is incompatible with long-term assistance from the United States.Congress can predicate assistance and weapons transfers on clear assurances that Iran and its proxies are not indirect beneficiaries. If it does not, Iraq, like Lebanon before it and others to come, will become yet another pawn in Iran\u2019s Middle East game.Ms. Pletka is a senior vice president at the American Enterprise Institute.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 19:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-won-in-lebanon-what-about-iraq-1498518304", "news_title": "Iran Won in Lebanon.

On June 27, 1967, a Barclays Bank branch in London unveiled the world\u2019s first automated teller machine. It solved a common problem: In much of the world, cash could be obtained only when a bank was open, typically weekdays between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., known as \u201cbankers\u2019 hours.\u201d The limited schedule often meant long lines. And it could be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain money from a bank other than your own.The engineer often identified as having developed the first ATM,       John Shepherd-Barron,        said that his \u201caha\u201d moment was a byproduct of arriving at his bank one minute after it closed. \u201cThat night I started thinking that there must be a better way to get cash when I wanted it,\u201d he told the BBC in 2007. \u201cI thought of the chocolate vending machine, where money was put in a slot and a bar dispatched. Surely money could be dispensed in the same way.\u201dThe first ATM had limited functionality; it neither accepted deposits nor dispensed more than \u00a310 (then worth $28) at a time. Still, ATMs quickly gained popularity. They were convenient and thus contributed to customer loyalty, and they helped reduce bank operating costs. In 1969 the ATM crossed the Atlantic. A Chemical Bank branch in Rockville Centre, N.Y., announced in a newspaper advertisement: \u201cOn Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\u201dBy 2015 there were 3.2 million ATMs world-wide, and they\u2019re found on all seven continents, including Antarctica. They\u2019ve become part of the fabric of life\u2014one company has sold ATM Halloween costumes\u2014while helping to spur a self-service culture that\u2019s been extended to gas stations and airport check-ins. Globally, there were close to 100 billion ATM transactions in 2015, and $13.2 trillion in withdrawals. For the U.S. alone, these figures were 5.8 billion and $700 billion.Paul Volcker,        a former Federal Reserve chairman, quipped in 2009 that \u201cthe most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine.\u201d And like any great product, the ATM has had to evolve. No longer just cash machines, customers can use them to pay bills, get a new card, tap a line of credit, and even chat by video with a human teller hundreds of miles away. Some banks in India use their ATMs to extend loans in a matter of seconds.What is the future of ATMs?

For       Scott Nations,        a Chicago-based financial engineer, it is but one of a series of meltdowns that have periodically shaken the country\u2019s financial stability. In \u201cA History of the United States in Five Crashes,\u201d he provides crisp profiles on the crashes in 1907, 1929, 1987 and, yes, 2008, along with the 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d\u2014all in a lean, drive-ahead writing style that is a pleasure to read.His account of the 1907 crash opens with Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s attempts to impose rules of competition on the country\u2019s enormous business combinations. Railroad and copper wars were an unbridled spectacle of greed, even as the economy was rattled by the colossal 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Mr. Nations generally argues from the premise that, in nervous times, underlying imbalances are turned into catastrophic tsunamis by the mediation of a \u201cfinancial contraption.\u201d The contraption of 1907 was the trust companies, ostensibly staid entities that administered trusts and wills. The more adventurous ones gradually added deposit-taking and lending services.Since trust companies had no reserve requirements, they had a cost advantage over conventional banks, which some exploited to the hilt. Foolish lending on paper-thin reserves created a string of trust-company insolvencies that threatened to engulf both the regulated banks and the New York Stock Exchange, setting the stage for the heroics of J.P. Morgan. Ill and turning 70, he peremptorily summoned leading bankers to his library and masterminded the capital infusions that ended the crisis.Mr. Nations ascribes the 1929 market debacle primarily to the policies of the Federal Reserve, particularly those of       Benjamin Strong,        the imposing president of the New York Fed, who Mr. Nations believes fueled the stock-market bubble by easing interest rates in the mid-1920s in order to help Britain return to the gold standard. (Depression scholars still debate the question.) The \u201ccontraption\u201d driving the 1929 crash was the investment trust, effectively a mutual fund that sponsors had \u201cbulled\u201d by means of insider trading, driving trust valuations far above that of the individual securities in the portfolio.By Scott Nations  William Morrow, 336 pages, $28.99When the market finally broke, Mr. Nations tells us, the Stock Exchange closed its public gallery after \u201cvisitors watched a trader run screaming from the floor.\u201d A physician at the exchange reported treating traders for the shell-shock symptoms he had treated in World War I. Although Mr. Nations\u2019s account of the crash is excellent, he makes little attempt to connect it to the world depression that followed.The market crash of 1987 occurred when markets were still working off the leveraged-buyout boom and other excesses of the 1980s. Two academics,       Hayne Leland       and Mark Rubinstein, came up with algorithms for hedging stock-market risk by selling offsetting options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The catch was that they could only be implemented by computers. As the idea spread, it acquired the name of \u201cportfolio insurance\u201d and was catnip to big investors.During the second week of October 1987, falling markets triggered the \u201cinsurance\u201d algorithms, launching wave after wave of option sales in Chicago. Alas, there weren\u2019t enough options in the world to meet the flood of orders. \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d Oct. 19, saw the steepest one-day drop in history. But it is hard to point to any damage to the economy. From 1986 through 1989, real U.S. growth came in at a boringly steady 3.5%, 3.5%, 4.2% and 3.7%, relegating the 1987 crash to a sideshow.The episode that may best fit Mr. Nations\u2019s paradigm\u2014underlying instability and a new \u201ccontraption\u201d\u2014is the Great Recession of 2008-09. By the mid-2000s, the world had been sufficiently lulled by the Greenspan-Bernanke \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d to accept that the idea that wisely applied monetary policy\u2014feeding liquidity into the economy in measured doses\u2014could smooth the unruliest economic tides. The \u201cfinancial contraption\u201d of the day was the structured securitized bond. Banks discovered that if they sold off their loans, after collecting hefty fees they could make higher profits without tying up their balance sheets. Securitizing mortgages and business loans made good sense so long as the underlying loans were sound. But in the absence of any regulatory oversight, shoddy, often fraudulent, paper came to dominate the market and was sold all over the world, with dire effects second only to those of the Great Depression.Mr. Nations\u2019s last example, the 2010 \u201cflash crash,\u201d is quite dramatic, but like the 1987 market crash doesn\u2019t seem to have been especially consequential. A Kansas mutual fund with Greek exposure contracted with Barclays bank to exit a $4 billion position. Barclays had built algorithmic trading technologies for managing massive portfolio adjustments without human intervention. When Barclays switched on the trading robots in the afternoon of May 6, the stock, options and futures markets went crazy. Perfectly sound companies saw their shares gyrate between $1,000 and a penny within minutes. While estimates that as much as a trillion dollars was lost in minutes are likely true, the losses were mostly recovered a few minutes later, and the most ridiculous trades were reversed by the end of the trading day.One takeaway from Mr. Nations\u2019s chronicle is that finance is a dangerous industry for the simple reason that\u2014as we can see in each of his episodes\u2014it employs enormous leverage. Today the biggest banks have balance sheets in the trillions, 90% of it borrowed. When the bull starts roaring, and the money is flowing, calamity is usually not far behind.Mr. Morris\u2019s most recent book is \u201cA Rabble of Dead Money,\u201d a history of the Great Depression.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'The Market In Nosedive.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-market-in-nosedive-1498518080", "news_title": "The Market in Nosedive", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Try a thought experiment: Consider immigrants in the U.S. from Algeria, Israel and Japan and rank them, from highest to lowest, by educational attainment. Here\u2019s the correct order, according to data from the Census Bureau: Algerians have average schooling of 14.7 years, followed by Israelis with 14.5 years, and Japanese with 14.3.Surprised? Consider an additional fact: Algerians represent about 1 in 2,500 immigrants in the U.S., whereas Israelis are 1 in 350 and Japanese 1 in 100.Here\u2019s another counterintuitive result: The average educational level in Mexico, 8.5 years, is almost twice that of India, 4.4 years. Yet Indian immigrants in the U.S. average 16 years of schooling, whereas Mexican immigrants average nine years.What explains this? America\u2019s immigration policy is far from evenhanded. A potential immigrant\u2019s country of origin is an important determinant of his or her likelihood of being admitted.The U.S. rations its immigration slots, granting permanent residency to about one million people a year. But demand is so high that more than four million are denied residency and remain in the queue. Some origin countries are highly favored, and others are implicitly penalized. If immigration reflected the world population, India would send four times as many people to the U.S. as it actually does; Mexico would send 1/15th as many.Immigrants from the least-favored countries tend to be the elite. For example, immigrants in the U.S. from the former Soviet Union have the highest educational attainment, 16 years on average. But they account for only about 0.14% of immigrants overall. They are rare because they had to obtain permission not only to enter the U.S. but also to leave the Soviet Union. Many were highly educated dissidents, accomplished academics or other professionals. The same is true, perhaps to a lesser extent, of immigrants from countries like Algeria.The effect works the other way for immigrants from countries that are overrepresented. Tonga makes up 0.0015% of the world population but accounts for 0.04% of U.S. immigrants, and those people earn less than $20,000 a year on average. In contrast, Nigeria is 2.6% of the globe but only 0.5% of U.S. immigrants, and they earn more than $41,000 a year. This is true even though Tonga\u2019s average level of education is 9.4 years and Nigeria\u2019s is just 5.2 years.One factor driving these patterns is American policies that favor family reunification. In most years more than 60% of entering immigrants have relatives already in the U.S. Family reunification is a worthy goal, not only for humanitarian reasons but because people in intact families perform better in society. But focusing too heavily on reunification creates a disadvantage for would-be immigrants whose countries are not already well-represented in the U.S. It also pushes down the average achievement among immigrants.Taking a more balanced approach would have several positive effects. First, it would improve the success of immigrants when they arrive in the U.S. Researchers have shown that immigrants in general, but especially those who are admitted based on their skills, are likelier to start businesses and patent inventions.Second, this increased success would spill over to the native-born population. An immigrant who creates a thriving company or a better way of doing business improves the standard of living for all Americans.Third, accepting skilled immigrants from many different countries would reduce the brain drain on any single one of them. If the U.S. switched to a skills-based system but still favored family reunification, it could quickly deplete countries like El Salvador, which today is 31-times overrepresented among U.S. immigrants. Because America is in the enviable position of being the destination of choice for people willing to move, it can surely afford to be evenhanded toward source nations.Some caution is warranted because immigrants from overrepresented countries have become central to the American economy. If productivity is reflected in wages, then immigrants from Mexico add about 1.5 times as much to gross domestic product as those from the next-highest source country, India, because there are so many more Mexican natives in the U.S. Furthermore, immigrants are well-integrated into the labor force. In the U.S., the unemployment rate among immigrants is about 10% lower than that for the native-born population.Still, the relative achievement of immigrant groups is determined in large part by immigration policy. Almost every country can supply talented people who would like to come to America. Moving toward a fairer and more balanced treatment of these nations can improve the success of U.S. immigrants\u2014which in turn would make the native born population more welcoming.Mr. Lazear, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (2006-09), is a professor at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business and a Hoover Institution fellow.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surprising-factor-for-immigrant-success-1498517898", "news_title": "The Surprising Factor for Immigrant Success", "keywords": "algerian immigrants,educated immigrants,immigrant education,immigration,mexican immigrants,us immigration,political,general news,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "So       Anthony Kennedy       is apparently sticking around.For a while Democrats who have lost the House, lost the Senate and lost the White House were having conniptions over the thought they might soon lose what Justice       Antonin Scalia       once described as their \u201csuper-legislative\u201d power: the Supreme Court. At the Washington Post       Ruth Marcus       called the prospect of Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u201cterrifying and terrible.\u201d Because notwithstanding his many sound opinions\u2014this is the same justice who gave us Citizens United, upholding First Amendment speech rights\u2014on the court he nevertheless plays an indispensable role for American progressives: culture warrior.On issues best fitted for federalist solutions, such as abortion and marriage, Justice Kennedy has proved himself a reliable voice for the animating impulse of modern American progressivism. This is the idea that the American people cannot be trusted to decide certain issues and so must yield, as he once put it, to the \u201cenhanced understanding\u201d of unelected justices such as himself.It started, of course, with abortion. One does not have to be pro-life to recognize that the reasoning of Roe v. Wade was absurd. In fact, in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court more or less confirmed this recognition when it upheld the outcome of Roe while substituting an entirely new rationale for it.In that case Justice Kennedy was at first a vote to reject what had been an egregious and unconstitutional power grab. But somewhere along the way he flipped. In the end, he would be the deciding vote in a plurality decision that called on \u201ccontending sides of [this] national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate\u201d the court had found for them.In a withering dissent, Scalia pointed out the toxic effect this approach has had on America\u2019s public life:\u201cBy foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.\u201dFor \u201canguish,\u201d substitute \u201cculture wars.\u201dTurned out Justice Kennedy was just getting started. Having reaffirmed a constitutional right to privacy that       James Madison       and the other Founders had somehow neglected to include in their draft, the court with Justice Kennedy\u2019s assistance would soon unearth another constitutional right unmentioned in the Constitution: dignity.A more modest justice might have concluded from the 40 years of Roe warfare that the court would be wise to avoid making the same mistake with marriage. Especially at a time when both the states and public opinion were moving in the direction of same-sex marriage anyway. But Justice Kennedy was determined to get there first.The result was Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which instituted same-sex marriage in every state. Had this come through state legislatures, the laws would likely have included compromises that would ensure gay Americans would have no obstacles to getting married but those who wished not to be a part of it might have their consciences respected.Not so in the America Justice Kennedy has ushered in. Now we jail county clerks who don\u2019t want their names on such certificates and ruin people who don\u2019t want their businesses to participate in same-sex weddings. Indeed, the court has just agreed to hear an appeal from a baker who declined to make a cake for a gay couple in Colorado\u2014and Justice Kennedy in all likelihood will once again be the deciding vote.What makes issues such as abortion and marriage so contentious is that the opposing moral positions cannot be reconciled. The beauty of democratic politics, however, is its recognition that what free people want and what they will settle for as reasonable are two different things. Justice Kennedy\u2019s unfortunate legacy on these hot-button issues is to take compromise off the table and thus ensure anger and ill will.And why not, when the sides are depicted as the enlightened versus the bigots? Though he walked it back in Obergefell, in which he conceded that many who opposed same-sex marriage were acting from \u201chonorable religious or philosophical premises,\u201d in the 2013 decision overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, Justice Kennedy asserted that the only possible motivation for such a law was a \u201cbare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\u201dAnthony Kennedy is an educated man who writes in the smooth tones of Stanford and Harvard Law. The effect, alas, is no less noxious. Next time America\u2019s corrosive politics comes up, it\u2019s worth remembering that the justice so often hailed as a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d has done as much as any to fan the flames of America\u2019s raging culture war.Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthony-kennedy-culture-warrior-1498517767", "news_title": "Anthony Kennedy, Culture Warrior", "keywords": "anthony kennedy,antonin scalia,justice kennedy,justice scalia,supreme court,supreme court justice,Citizens United,Anthony Kennedy,abortion,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,ethical issues,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,judicial branch,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court on Monday began the process of rebuking lower courts for usurping the political branches on national security. The entire Court, even the four liberals, agreed to hear the       Trump       Administration\u2019s appeal of appellate-court rulings blocking its immigration travel ban, and the Justices allowed nearly all of the 90-day ban to proceed in the meantime.This is a victory for the White House, though it is more important for the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. President Trump\u2019s ban is neither wise nor necessary, but that is not an invitation for judges to become back-seat Commanders in Chief. Yet that is precisely what liberal majorities on both the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal did in blocking the travel bans, and the Supreme Court is saying those rulings will not be the last judicial word. The Court\u2019s unsigned per curiam opinion set the case for an early hearing on the legal merits in the next term that begins in October.Justice       Clarence Thomas,        joined by       Justices Samuel       Alito and       Neil Gorsuch,        wrote a concurrence arguing that the Court should have lifted the lower-court injunctions in toto. He also added a cheeky aside that \u201cI agree with the Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits\u2014that is, that the judgments below will be reversed.\u201dSome Justices might not agree with that, but it\u2019s notable that Chief Justice       John Roberts       managed to corral a unanimous Court for lifting nearly all of the injunctions. That means even the liberals understand that injunctions need to be issued with care, especially on national security where judges lack the knowledge and electoral accountability of the executive and Congress.The High Court\u2019s precedents are clear, especially Kleindienst v.       Mandel       (1972) that said courts should defer to the executive if there is a \u201cfacially legitimate and bona fide\u201d justification on national security. Judges can\u2019t run roughshod over the Constitution merely because an unpopular President issued the travel order.Democrats and the media will now begin a ferocious lobbying campaign to turn five Justices against these precedents, in particular the Chief Justice and Justice       Anthony Kennedy.

The church\u2019s application ranked fifth in quality out of 44, but the state denied its application under language in the state constitution that \u201cno money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion.\u201d That is a relic of the anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments that swept the country in the late 1800s to deny public funds to religious schools. (Trinity Lutheran v. Comer).Chief Justice       John Roberts       overruled the state, noting that the church isn\u2019t seeking a subsidy but only to participate in a public program \u201cwithout having to disavow its religious character.\u201d Denying it participation for that reason violates the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause. The state \u201chas not subjected anyone to chains or torture on account of religion,\u201d Justice Roberts writes. \u201cBut the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.\u201dMissouri tried to evade this logic by arguing that the case follows Locke v. Davey (2004) when the Court ruled that Washington state could bar a public scholarship program from being used to pursue a theology degree. This is different, Justice Roberts explained. \u201cDavey was not denied a scholarship because of who he was; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed to do\u2014use the funds to prepare for the ministry. Here there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because of what it is\u2014a church.\u201dOne surprise in the ruling is that the majority included liberal       Justices Elena Kagan       and       Stephen Breyer.       They may have been appeased by an intriguing footnote in which Chief Justice Roberts avers that the case \u201cinvolves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\u201dThat suggests a narrow opinion that isn\u2019t opening the door to other religious uses of state funds, such as school choice. But       Justices Clarence Thomas       and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately to draw out the broader principle that government may not exclude a group from a public benefit based on religion, period. The Justices are likely to see new challenges in this area, which may explain the ferocity of Justice       Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s       dissent.

Much of their capital will be wiped out. The problem is that Rome is still spending a bundle of taxpayer money to close down two midsize banks that aren\u2019t systemically important while sparing bondholders from so much as a minor haircut.After the European Central Bank on Friday deemed the pair \u201cfailing or likely to fail,\u201d Rome stepped in to wind them down in accordance with Italian bankruptcy laws. Formally, the two banks have ceased to exist. The government will transfer a portfolio of good loans worth around \u20ac12 billion to             Intesa Sanpaolo,       Italy\u2019s largest bank. The bad assets that contributed to the banks\u2019 combined 37% proportion of nonperforming loans will be transferred to a bad bank.But this is a liquidation with an Italian twist. Intesa bought those assets for \u20ac1, after a week-long bidding process in which it was apparently the only buyer. In reality, Rome is paying Intesa. The bank will receive \u20ac5.2 billion to shore up its capital base in light of the new assets it\u2019s acquiring, to cover the costs of laying off thousands of staff and to account for potential losses on the loan portfolio.Italian taxpayers are also on the hook for the whole value of the nearly \u20ac12 billion in loans Intesa is acquiring. Together the cash and guarantees come to \u20ac17 billion. That\u2019s roughly 1% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product, so let\u2019s hope the Italian government is right when it says the guarantee will never need to be exercised.This episode suggests that Europe\u2019s no-bailout rules have failed an early test. The EU\u2019s new Single Resolution Board declined to get involved Friday on grounds that neither bank is systemically important. That spared them having to include a haircut for creditors that the European Union theoretically requires before taxpayers can be asked to support an institution.Italy feared the political consequences of such a \u201cbail-in\u201d because Italian mom-and-pop investors own a disproportionately large share of the bonds. But apart from the false advertising of disguising a bailout as a liquidation, this sends a signal to other bank creditors that they\u2019ll always be rescued too. Watch other banks in trouble hawk their paper with abandon knowing that the more widespread the placement the more likely they\u2019ll be spared.The larger story is that Europe keeps hamstringing its banks. Italy\u2019s bankruptcy laws make it expensive and time-consuming to clear the books of nonperforming loans, and ultralow interest rates by the European Central Bank make it difficult for struggling institutions to earn their way back to health. Slow growth weighs on the balance sheets of many banks despite repeated rescue attempts\u2014including several billion euros last year for these two banks from a government-backed investment fund.Europe lacks the political will to enact policy reforms that European banks and economies need.

None of those charged could be reached for comment.About 96,500 people live in the township, which has seen a rapid influx of Orthodox Jewish families in recent years. Many households have large numbers of children and rely on public assistance.Prosecutor       Joseph D. Coronato       said in a release that he warned Lakewood residents in 2015 that such assistance programs were designed for those truly in need, and anyone seeking to profit from them would be penalized. His office said the arrested couples collected a total of about $1.2 million in housing, health and food benefits by understating their incomes.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Trenton also took part in Monday\u2019s operation.According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Rachel and       Mordechai Sorotzkin       received Medicaid for themselves and their children from 2011 through 2014. Officials said the couple earned more than $1 million yearly in 2012 and 2013 but didn\u2019t report all their income, and received about $96,000 of Medicaid benefits for which they didn\u2019t qualify.Fred Zemel,        attorney for Ms. Sorotzkin, said he was \u201cconfident she will be vindicated\u201d and that Mr. Sorotzkin also contended he wasn\u2019t guilty in a federal court appearance in Trenton.Yocheved and       Shimon Nussbaum       received Medicaid, food stamps and housing aid by underreporting their income, which hit $1.8 million in 2013, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said. The Nussbaums used funds from their business accounts to cover personal expenses, and defrauded the government of about $178,000, officials said.The Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office said it arrested Mordechai and Jocheved Breskin for allegedly getting $585,662 in Medicaid, food stamps, housing and social security benefits from 2009 through 2014. The office said Zalmen and Tzipporah Sorotzkin wrongfully collected $338,642 in aid during that time.Their lawyers couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Raymond Coles,        mayor of Lakewood, said he didn\u2019t know the specifics of the allegations. \u201cTens of thousands of people who moved here over the years work as hard as any of us to put food on the table and make sure their kids get a good education,\u201d he said. \u201cNo town\u2019s image should be tarnished by the actions of a small number of people.\u201dWrite to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rabbi-7-others-charged-with-public-assistance-fraud-in-new-jersey-1498516913", "news_title": "Rabbi, 7 Others Charged With Public Assistance Fraud in New Jersey", "keywords": " food stamps,medicaid fraud, welfare fraud,Fred Zemel,Joseph D.

No big deal, you might say. Except that the author is       Christopher Hill,        the former State Department grandee who offered North Korea a cascade of concessions to freeze its nuclear program in the mid-2000s.Mr. Hill is entitled to change his mind. But the U.S. wouldn\u2019t be in such a pickle today if he had realized a decade ago that the Kim regime will never voluntarily give up a nuclear program that he now calls \u201cinherently aggressive.\u201d In the years since Mr. Hill was negotiating, Pyongyang has made itself more lethal by miniaturizing its warheads and developing long-range missiles to deliver them.The mistakes made by Mr. Hill and his boss,       George W. Bush,        are relevant today because President Trump is now being asked to go down the same road. China is trying to bring the U.S. and the North back to the negotiating table, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who will visit the White House later this week, recently floated the idea that the U.S. should offer to scale back military exercises with the South in return for more nuclear promises from Pyongyang.This is a failed strategy, and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to waste more time on it. Over the past quarter century, the U.S. has repeatedly propped up the Kim regime while the North failed to keep its promises. In the 1994 Agreed Framework,       Bill Clinton       gave       Kim Jong Il       a stream of oil shipments in return for a nuclear freeze. In 2002 the North Koreans admitted to Mr. Hill\u2019s predecessor       Jim Kelly       that they had a secret program to enrich uranium, but media and foreign-policy elites refused to believe it and blamed the Bush Administration.Mr. Bush held the line on North Korea for six years, until       Condoleezza Rice       persuaded him that a deal with North Korea could bolster his legacy. Mr. Bush\u2019s insistence that the North make a full declaration of its program fell by the wayside, but the U.S. gave the North multiple carrots, including removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and the release of assets from a money-laundering probe.That deal foundered because the North refused to accept even watered-down U.S. demands for inspections. In 2008 Mr. Hill mocked his critics who \u201cimagine there is a building somewhere with a secret door they can open and find a group of scantily clad women enriching uranium.\u201d A year later the North Koreans showed an American scientist a huge array of gas centrifuges\u2014which had not been part of its declaration. Ms. Rice and Mr. Hill won the inside debate over       Dick Cheney       and       Robert Joseph,        who have since been vindicated.In 2012       Barack Obama       reached his own deal with the North for a freeze on nukes and missile development in return for aid. The North Koreans promptly continued testing missiles under the guise of launching satellites. They evidently expected the U.S. to look the other way, and after so many State Department climbdowns it\u2019s hard to blame them.Thanks in part to Mr. Hill\u2019s misjudgments while he was in power, the U.S. has few good options to stop North Korea from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and putting American cities at risk.

ARNC 0.96%       said it has stopped selling panels used on the exterior of high-rise buildings that are suspected of contributing to the spread of a deadly fire in a London apartment tower earlier this month.The U.S.-based aerospace and building materials specialist on Monday said the decision reflected \u201cinconsistency\u201d in building codes around the world. The fire that killed 79 people in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower on June 14 has already prompted a widespread review of construction safety standards in the U.K.The move by Arconic triggered a sharp fall in its shares, as analysts questioned whether its role in supplying the panels could entail potential liabilities and affect its search for a new chief executive following a tumultuous six months that included a proxy battle with activist investors.Arconic, formerly part of             Alcoa Corp.        AA 0.19%      , produces panels under the Reynobond PE brand that go into cladding for buildings. Reynobond PE panels aren\u2019t allowed by regulators on tall buildings in the U.S. and some other countries because of the potential fire hazard. The panels have been widely used in the U.K., including the recently refurbished Grenfell Tower.\u201cBecause of the inconsistency of building codes across the world and issues that have arisen in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy regarding code compliance of cladding systems, Arconic is discontinuing global sales of Reynobond PE for use in high-rise applications,\u201d the company said in statement. A spokesman said the panels would still be sold for use on low-rise buildings that are generally more accessible for firefighters.\u201cOur product is one component in the overall cladding system; we don\u2019t control the overall system or its compliance,\u201d the company said later in a statement.Reynobond PE consists of two aluminum sheets sandwiching a polyethylene core. The Grenfell Tower\u2019s facade is suspected of having aided the fire\u2019s advance. Investigators suspect the blaze spread through a narrow gap between the burning polyethylene core in the Reynobond panels and a layer of insulation attached to the exterior of the apartment building.Arconic\u2019s involvement in the cladding used on the building had been known for some days, but its decision to halt sales and concerns about potential liability cut about $600 million from the company\u2019s market value on Monday.The stock ended down 6% at $24.01 in very heavy trading, with seven times the usual volume of shares changing hands.Analysts said Arconic\u2019s involvement raised questions over how building-products manufacturers could be exposed to potential liabilities after installation.\u201cThis is more than just Arconic,\u201d said Josh Sullivan at Seaport Global Securities. \u201cI\u2019ve got to think the big material manufacturing companies around the world are going fight this.\u201dJ.P. Morgan analysts said in a client note that \u201cseveral entities\u201d were involved in the decision to use the cladding panels in Grenfell Tower, many of which may bear \u201csignificantly more responsibility\u201d than Arconic.Reynobond PE is marketed around the world. In the U.S., its use is generally limited to lower buildings because of fire-safety concerns.U.K. officials have said the material didn\u2019t meet building standards for towers whose height exceeds 18 meters, or about 59 feet. But U.K. building industry experts and the company that supplied the material to contractors working on Grenfell Tower maintain that it is compliant with current building codes.In the wake of the fire, the U.K. government has identified about 600 social-housing towers\u2014properties owned by local authorities as well as nonprofit housing associations\u2014across the country that have installed similar cladding. So far it has tested samples from 75 for inflammability, and all have failed the tests,       Sajid Javid,        minister for communities and local government, said in Parliament Monday. The government hasn\u2019t specified whether the samples tested were Reynobond PE.Arconic makes other varieties of Reynobond that feature a fire-retardant filling. Those weren\u2019t used in the Grenfell Tower refurbishment.The Reynobond line is part of Arconic\u2019s transportation and construction products business, which generated $1.8 billion of sales last year, about 15% of the company\u2019s total revenue. The construction portion of the transportation and construction unit accounted for about 55% of the sales.The Reynobond issue poses a new distraction for a company trying to steady itself after a long, bitter proxy fight earlier this year with activist investors that resulted in the resignation of longtime CEO       Klaus Kleinfeld.       He was replaced by veteran aerospace executive and Arconic board member       David Hess       as interim CEO.\u201cArconic\u2019s search for a permanent, operating-focused CEO is made harder by this incident,\u201d said analyst       Gautam Khanna       at Cowen & Co.\u2014Wiktor Szary contributed to this article.Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Fire Puts Arconic on Its Heels.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arconic-ceases-sale-of-cladding-involved-in-london-tower-fire-1498490993", "news_title": "Arconic to Stop Selling Panels Involved in London Tower Fire", "keywords": "cladding,facade,grenfell tower,london apartment fire,no longer selling,Arconic,ARNC,Alcoa,AA,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,primary metals,non-ferrous metals,basic materials,resources,building materials,products,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Learning to dress, bathe and feed older adults might not be every high-school student\u2019s idea of fun. But for a group of New York City teenagers participating in an unusual workforce development program, a few weeks of hard work now could pay off in a big way later\u2014with a job.The year-round program at the New Jewish Home, an elder-care nonprofit with headquarters in Manhattan, trains teens to work in a nursing home, while providing mentoring, school tutoring, college prep and life-skills training.The free program, called Geriatric Career Development, has dual goals: Teens get a pathway to a career, and the New Jewish Home has a supply of workers in an industry where there is exploding demand.According to LeadingAge New York, an advocacy group, baby boomers in their early 70s will start entering their 80s in 2026, creating a huge need for people to work caring for older adults. At the same time, the availability of younger New Yorkers to provide formal and informal care will be at its lowest point, and on the decline.The ratio of people aged 18 to 64 compared with the population 65 and over, is expected to decline from 4.31 in 2015 to 3.05 in 2030, according to the New York State Office for the Aging.There already is a shortage of skilled workers to fill entry-level positions caring for older adults, experts say. Those jobs generally start at minimum wage, which means the industry competes with the fast-food and retail sectors for employees. \u201cUnless we start getting creative about how we provide care and getting people in the workforce, we are going to have a real problem in the next 10 years,\u201d said Ami Schnauber, vice president of advocacy and public policy at LeadingAge.Elsewhere, organizations serving elders will offer signing bonuses, flexible hours and additional education opportunities to attract and retain employees. Recognition of hard work is an essential tool to keeping staff, said Al Cardillo, executive vice president of the Home Care Association of New York State, an industry group.For a senior like       Ashley Salgado-Almazan,        a 17-year-old who lives in the Bronx, the training program at the New Jewish Home offers an opportunity, she said, to pursue a career in medicine or business. While in the nursing home, she said, she enjoys the conversation and time spent with older people.\u201cBeing here 24-hours a day their whole life, they don\u2019t get a sense of being human\u2026being outside in the world,\u201d said Ms.\u00a0Salgado-Almazan.\u00a0\u201cI want to help them to not feel depressed.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, Ms.\u00a0Salgado-Almazan\u00a0was perfecting her technique for measuring blood pressure and making beds, careful never to let the sheets touch the floor and frequently washing her hands. The drills are part of a summer curriculum that includes taking classes at a nearby college to earn a Certified Nursing Assistant certificate, a critical part of getting a job in a nursing home or as a home health aide.After finishing the drills, Ms.\u00a0Salgado-Almazan\u00a0spent time with her elder mentor,       Dominga Marquez.       The two work together on crocheting and looming projects, Ms.\u00a0Salgado-Almazan\u00a0acting as a set of hands for Ms. Marquez who, because of a stroke years ago, has limited use of one hand. The regular weave-and-chat sessions cheer Ms. Marquez, who noted her mentee\u2019s punctuality and calm, sweet manner.The New Jewish Home spends some $5,000 annually per teen, with private philanthropy covering additional costs. There are 57 students participating in Ms.\u00a0Salgado-Almazan\u2019s\u00a0class this year; more than 500 students have completed the Geriatric Career Development program since its inception in 2006, according to a spokeswoman for the New Jewish Home.The program accepts New York City public-school students beginning in the sophomore year and of any academic level, as long as there is genuine interest to work in the field and to graduate high school.Over the years, almost every student in the program has graduated from high school, and 94% are enrolled in college or employed, with some going to work for the New Jewish Home, a New Jewish Home official said. Two students have gone on to medical school and two others are pursuing Ph.D. degrees in pharmacology.Audrey Weiner,        chief executive of the New Jewish Home, said the overall hope is to create a pipeline of people with skills to do the work, but also encourage \u201cothers to work toward more highly-skilled and high-paying positions\u2026as doctors, nurses and physical and occupational therapists, also needed to care for the growing number of older adults.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/program-creates-a-path-for-nyc-teens-in-geriatric-care-field-1498515967", "news_title": "Program Creates a Path for NYC Teens in Geriatric-Care Field ", "keywords": "elderly care,high-school students ,nursing homes ,nyc geriatric education,LeadingAge,Ashley Salgado-Almazan,Audrey Weiner,Dominga Marquez,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "CNN\u2019s       Jake Tapper      speaking at the Los Angeles Press Club, June\u00a025:On this day in 1903, a future journalist named       Eric Blair       was born, better known as       George Orwell.

It was the latest leg of the peso\u2019s 16% rally against the greenback in 2017. One dollar bought 17.87 pesos.The election of President       Donald Trump       battered the Mexican currency. The peso fell to a record low against its U.S. counterpart in January as investors bet the enactment of protectionist policies by the new administration would damage Mexico\u2019s economy. Since the inauguration, though, the peso has strengthened as Mexico\u2019s central bank lifted rates and investors soured on the \u201cTrump trade.\u201dSpeculative investors turned bullish on the Mexican currency in April after steadily wagering against it for more than two years.Hedge funds and other money managers recently held a net 95,814 contracts betting on a stronger peso, the largest bullish position in the currency since 2013, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\u201cThe peso is still one of the most undervalued currencies in the world,\u201d said       Marc Chandler,        global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.The peso\u2019s rise is also representative of the broader rally in emerging-markets currencies. The Russian ruble is up 4% against the dollar in 2017, while the Korean won has gained 6.6% and the South African rand 6.5%. When those currencies fell after the election, it raised concerns across developing economies.But among emerging-markets currencies, the peso\u2019s reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise has been the sharpest, as he discussed policies such as building a wall at the Mexican border and pulling the U.S. out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. During the election, the peso was closely linked with Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects for winning the election, and it weakened sharply after his win in November.Analysts say many of the fears that drove the peso to its record low of about 22 pesos per U.S. dollar haven\u2019t panned out.The White House in April walked back its threat to pull the U.S. from Nafta, saying that the Trump administration would instead focus on renegotiating the pact with Mexico and Canada to \u201cmake all three countries stronger and better.\u201dMexico\u2019s economy has been surprisingly robust, expanding at a pace of 2.7% in the first quarter as the weak peso boosted exports.The Bank of Mexico lifted rates on Thursday to 7%, the highest level since 2009, and the seventh consecutive increase.Some of the most popular postelection trades have reversed course alongside the peso\u2019s rebound. Benchmark Treasury yields have been declining since March, erasing much of their rise following Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. And bank stocks are off their postelection highs. The S&P 500 is still up 14% since the election.The U.S. dollar also has fallen 1.5% this year relative to its Canadian counterpart. The loonie has strengthened alongside a rebound in the Canadian economy and signals that the country\u2019s central bank could be getting ready to lift rates soon.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Mexican Peso Rises to Highest in a Year.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexican-peso-rises-to-highest-against-dollar-in-a-year-1498515861", "news_title": "Mexican Peso Rises to Highest Against Dollar in a Year ", "keywords": "currencies,foreign exchange,fx,mexico,peso,trump trade,Mexico's central bank,Donald Trump,Marc Chandler,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "BOSTON\u2014A pharmacist involved in selling a contaminated pain medication that caused a deadly U.S. outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2012 was sentenced to nine years in prison Monday.The sentencing in U.S. District Court in Boston came after a jury convicted       Barry J. Cadden       of racketeering, mail fraud and other crimes but acquitted him of second-degree murder in March.Mr. Cadden co-owned the New England Compounding Center, a now-closed Framingham, Mass., pharmacy that made injected steroid pain medication that caused 750 cases of fungal meningitis in 20 states, including at least 64 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Federal Judge Richard G. Stearns delivered a sentence that was less than the 35 years the government sought. His decision followed an emotional hearing at which several people affected by the outbreak asked the judge to lock the pharmacist up for life.Judge Stearns said he found a \u201cgreat deal of negligence and even gross negligence\u201d by Mr. Cadden, but that he concluded the jury\u2019s acquittal on second-degree murder didn\u2019t allow for the longer sentence prosecutors wanted. The judge said he wasn\u2019t acting based on anger and personal outrage but on the law.Speaking before he was sentenced, Mr. Cadden, dressed in a gray suit, wiped his eyes with a tissue and said the burden of the tragedy is something that he will carry for the rest of his life.\u201cI am so sorry for your extraordinary loss,\u201d he said.The judge ordered Mr. Cadden to report to prison at noon on August 7.The outbreak exposed a little known corner of the healthcare system\u2014compounding pharmacies that create alternate formulations of medications tailored to individual patients. Congress passed legislation in 2013 giving the FDA more authority to regulate quality at certain compounding facilities, but not all.U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found unsanitary conditions and contaminated batches at the compounding center, according to an FDA report.Defense lawyers had argued that three years would be an appropriate sentence for Mr. Cadden, who is 50 and a married father of three.\u201cAs the jury found, Mr. Cadden is not a murderer,\u201d his lawyers wrote in a recent court filing.\u201cNone of this is to say that Mr. Cadden is guilt-less,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHe did things, and particularly failed to do things, that in hindsight he deeply regrets.\u201dFederal prosecutors had asked that Mr. Cadden spend no less than 35 years in prison, writing in court documents that his \u201ccriminal conduct was an unprecedented public health crisis in our nation\u2019s history.\u201dThe victims had received steroid injections at doctors offices and pain clinics for back and joint pain.In a lengthy June 22 sentencing memorandum, the government described painful deaths and the fallout for survivors, including financial ruin, suicide attempts and chronic pain.\u201cThe magnitude and ripple effects of the pain caused by the loss of life is immeasurable,\u201d prosecutors wrote.Penny Laperriere, whose husband Lyn died 41 days after he received a tainted shot for back pain, appeared in court Monday to deliver an impact statement before the sentencing. She told the court she had to sell the couple\u2019s home, auction off their belongings and give away their two dogs because she could no longer pay the bills.Dabbing her face with a tissue, Ms. Laperriere described how she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and how a full night\u2019s sleep still eludes her.\u201cI can\u2019t put into words how much my heart has broken and how much Mr. Cadden has destroyed me,\u201d she said.Scott Shaw testified that his mother died after an agonizing battle of more than 50 days \u201cwith the fungus that was trying to consume her.\u201d When Mr. Shaw stepped off the elevator at the hospital, he could already hear his mother\u2019s wailing coming from her room down the hall.

It returns the \u201cAuld Mug\u201d to New Zealand, a country that prides itself on sailing prowess and has reached the finals regularly in recent decades, but hasn\u2019t won the regatta since 2000.The Kiwis\u2019 win also marks an abrupt departure for the event from the stewardship of Ellison, who has enjoyed the winner\u2019s privilege of setting the regatta\u2019s course since first capturing the trophy off Valencia, Spain in a massive trimaran in 2010.Ellison sought to recast sailing as an extreme spectacle, akin to Formula One on water, with ultra-fast catamarans soaring above the waves on hydrofoils, close enough to shore for to be seen by spectators in grandstands and illuminated for television viewers by high-tech, on-screen graphics.The result was a revolution in sailing that nearly tripled the top speed of Cup boats. Many sailors have celebrated the innovations, which they credit for boosting interest in the sport. The khakis and railway engineer\u2019s hat worn by Ted Turner during his winning campaign with Courageous 40 years ago have given way to body armor and crash helmets, along with the occasional spectacular wipeout.Yet Turner said recently he counts himself among the traditionalists who prefer the old Cup boats, slower but more nimble and more familiar to everyday sailors.Per tradition, New Zealand will now lead the effort to determine the timing, location and rules\u200b of the next Cup. Team officials said in a post-race news conference that the Kiwis would reveal details of their plans over the next couple of weeks. New Zealand has accepted a challenge for the trophy from the Italian Luna Rossa syndicate headed by Prada chief executive       Patrizio Bertelli,        and the regatta will ultimately take place somewhere in New Zealand.Kiwi team principal Matteo de Nora said the two syndicates share a common vision about what\u2019s important for the future of the regatta and wanted to \u201cdo the right thing for the Cup rather than a specific team.\u201dAsked if the regatta would continue to use hydrofoils, which have burgeoned throughout sailing since the Kiwis added them to their boat during the 2013 Cup, Dalton said he wasn\u2019t sure. The foils produce thrilling and fast boats, but tended to cut down on the impact of individual sailors, who spent much of their time in this regatta charging the hydraulics used to control those systems, he said.\u201cI think that just pumping oil around the boat isn\u2019t necessarily yachting,\u201d he said, adding that the flying boats worked spectacularly in the sheltered waters of Bermuda\u2019s Great Sound, but might be too fragile for the rough seas off New Zealand. \u201cThey might go straight down the mine.\u201dDalton also said the Kiwis would seek to bring costs down for the next regatta, which could increase the number of teams competing, though he said that as a top international competition, \u201cit is never going to be cheap.\u201dSailors and analysts have speculated other changes could include stronger rules requiring sailors to represent their own countries. While the U.S. squad was populated heavily with Australians, including Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill, New Zealand\u2019s crew was almost entirely Kiwis, with the notable exception of skipper Glenn Ashby.Several sailors have argued that interest in the Cup was strongest under such nationality rules, including in the 1980s when Dennis Conner lost the trophy to the Australians and then regained it in a boat called Stars & Stripes. The trophy\u2019s founding document holds it should be contested as a \u201cfriendly competition between foreign countries.\u201dEllison\u2019s own plans also remained unclear Monday. Spithill said he talked recently with Ellison, but didn\u2019t know if the U.S. team would mount a challenge to try to recapture the trophy.\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoke at all about what the future holds for the team and the guys involved,\u201d he said. As to the event\u2019s future, he said the Kiwis had earned the right to determine it with their victory, but he felt this was the strongest Cup to date and \u201cI think the sport\u2019s in a really healthy place right now.\u201dFor now, the Kiwis will return to New Zealand next week for what promises to be a hero\u2019s welcome. And Dalton said just because the Kiwis hadn\u2019t agreed with other teams ahead of the competition to push forward with Ellison\u2019s plans regardless of who won, that didn\u2019t mean they planned to scrap the entire structure of the regatta.\u201cWe have to create an event that takes a lot of the good that has happened here, because there has been a lot of good here,\u201d he said.Write to Aaron Kuriloff at aaron.kuriloff@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Kiwis Claim America\u2019s Cup As U.S. Comeback Fizzles.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-zealand-cruises-to-win-americas-cup-1498499667", "news_title": "New Zealand Cruises to Win America\u2019s Cup", "keywords": "Larry Ellison,aquatics,water sports,sports,recreation,yachting,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider whether the Constitution\u2019s religion clauses allow a bakery to deny service to gay couples.A Colorado court found that the state\u2019s antidiscrimination laws require retail shops like bakeries to serve customers regardless of sexual orientation. But Jack Phillips, an evangelical Christian who runs the Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakeland, Colo., contends that requiring him to decorate cakes that celebrate same-sex weddings would violate his First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.The grant came on the second anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case in which the court, by a 5-4 vote, held that the Constitution provides same-sex couples the same right to marry that heterosexuals enjoy. Another decision announced Monday, requiring Arkansas to treat gay couples the same way it does straight partners when recording their children\u2019s births, suggested the court wasn\u2019t stepping back from that holding.In general, when a child is born, Arkansas lists the mother\u2019s husband as the father, regardless of biological connection. The state refused to list a lesbian mother\u2019s female spouse as a parent when she gave birth through artificial insemination.\u201cAs a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as opposite-sex parents to be listed on a child\u2019s birth certificate, a document often used for important transactions like making medical decisions or enrolling a child in school,\u201d the court said in an unsigned opinion. \u201cObergefell proscribes such disparate treatment.\u201d The majority found the issue clear-cut enough that it ruled on legal filings alone, without oral argument.The newest justice,       Donald Trump       appointee       Neil Gorsuch,        dissented, arguing that the law on same-sex marriage wasn\u2019t sufficiently settled to allow for summary judgment.\u201cTo be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a state must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question of whether [the Arkansas birth certificate regulation], or a state supreme court decision upholding it must go,\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both of whom dissented from Justice       Anthony Kennedy\u2019s       majority opinion recognizing same-sex marriage.But while Obergefell found that the Constitution provides gay couples \u201cthe constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage,\u201d it said nothing about their right to purchase wedding cakes or flower arrangements from their preferred vendor. That has sparked several disputes involving bakers and florists who have invoked their religious opposition to gay marriage to refuse service to same-sex couples.The bakery case reflects the rapid change in the legal and cultural landscape over gay marriage. Through the early 21st century, religious conservatives were largely successful in passing legislation that enshrined conventional morality by denying marital rights to a minority population, gays and lesbians.Now, however, religious opponents of same-sex marriage have adopted the mantle of a disfavored minority, required by antidiscrimination laws in some states to endorse, at least implicitly, a practice they abhor.Federal law doesn\u2019t directly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, but Colorado, along with some 20 other states, provides at least some civil rights protection to gays and lesbians.In 2012, Mr. Phillips refused to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins. The couple complained to the state civil rights agency, which found that the cake maker\u2019s religious beliefs didn\u2019t exempt him from the Colorado Antidiscrimination Act. It requires businesses to serve customers without regard to race, color, disability, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, creed or marital status. A state appeals court upheld the agency.In appealing to the Supreme Court, Mr. Phillips argued that he was no ordinary tradesman but an artist, and that the First Amendment free speech clause prevents the state from compelling him to express a particular idea through his creative work\u2014in this case, that a marriage of two men should be celebrated.\u201cCake making dates back to at least 1175 B.C. Of any form of cake, wedding cakes have the longest and richest history,\u201d Mr. Phillips\u2019s brief argues. \u201cOnly a wedding cake communicates this special celebratory message, slicing a pizza or a pot roast would not have the same effect.\u201dPlenty of other bakeries were willing to take the couple\u2019s business, the brief noted. It also said he will sell other cakes to gay customers, as long as they don\u2019t involve weddings.In urging the court to reject the case, the state of Colorado noted that there had been no discussion of what the cake might exactly say, or even if it would have any specific message at all, so that Mr. Phillips had no ground to complain about compelled speech.The American Civil Liberties Union, representing Messrs. Craig and Mullins, argued that the state\u2019s interest in eradicating discrimination outweighed whatever religious discomfort Mr. Phillips might feel from serving the couple.\u201cIt is no answer to say that Mullins and Craig could shop somewhere else for their wedding cake, just as it was no answer in 1966 to say that African-American customers could eat at another restaurant,\u201d the ACLU argued, recalling an argument made against the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited most retail businesses from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in a similar case from New Mexico, where the state supreme court upheld a discrimination finding under state law against a wedding photographer who refused to shoot a same-sex ceremony.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Justices to Weigh Right to Deny Service.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 18:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-hear-case-of-baker-denying-cake-to-gay-wedding-1498486327", "news_title": "Supreme Court  to Hear Case of Baker Denying Cake to Gay Wedding", "keywords": "court,decision,high,scotus,supreme,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "General Motors Co.       expects industry vehicle sales to fall short of its original forecast for the year, the latest sign of a slowdown in the U.S. auto market after a record run.GM               now expects U.S. light-vehicle sales in the \u201clow\u201d 17-million range, down from an earlier expectation that this year\u2019s tally would roughly match the 17.55-million record from last year, finance chief       Chuck Stevens       told analysts during a conference call Monday.Mr. Stevens also said U.S. pricing has become \u201cvery, very competitive\u201d amid slowing sales during the first several months of the year. But he said incentives have moderated recently, a sign that car makers aren\u2019t willing to cut into profitability to maintain market share as demand cools.\u201cIt appears the industry is becoming a bit more rational,\u201d Mr. Stevens said.Industry sales in each month so far this year have fallen from a year earlier. In a note to investors Monday, Barclays analyst       Brian Johnson       said he expects the seasonally adjusted sales rate to ease to 16.5 million in June. That would mark the fourth straight month that the pace of sales fell below 17 million, the slowest stretch since mid-2014.But Mr. Johnson agrees that auto makers \u201cmay be drawing the line\u201d on big discounts that have helped fuel sales over much of the past year. He said incentives in June were at the lowest levels in about a year. Auto makers also are pulling back on less-profitable sales to rental companies, a tactic long deployed to sustain sales volumes during a market downturn.Separately, GM raised its estimate for special charges it will incur from the sale of its Opel AG European division, to $5.5 billion, about $1 billion higher than originally expected. Mr. Stevens said heavier costs linked to the consolidation of some vehicle programs under the deal is a primary factor, describing the charges as \u201clargely noncash.\u201dGM announced the deal in March to sell Opel to France\u2019s         Peugeot               for about $2.1 billion, exiting a business that has suffered billions of dollars in losses over nearly two decades. Mr. Stevens said the sale is on track to close by the end of the year.He said GM will report Opel results as discontinued operations beginning with the auto maker\u2019s second-quarter earnings, scheduled for July 25.GM also said it will tap about $3 billion in short-term debt to help pay for pension-funding obligations that Peugeot will inherit once the deal closes.Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 17:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/general-motors-lowers-outlook-for-industry-vehicle-sales-1498513985", "news_title": "General Motors Lowers Outlook for Industry Vehicle Sales   ", "keywords": "cfo,forecast,general motors,gm,industry outlook,projections,sales estimates,seasonally adjusted,us sales,vehicle sales,General Motors,GM,Chuck Stevens,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday partially revived President       Donald Trump\u2019s       executive order suspending travel from six countries and halting refugees resettlement.The ruling freed the Trump administration to enforce his executive order against foreigners who have \u201cno tie\u201d to the U.S, pending the outcome of a constitutional challenge the high court is expected to hear in the fall.But the court also stated that the travel ban \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201dWhat is a bona fide relationship? The court offered some examples by way of explanation.\u201cFor individuals, a close familial relationship is required,\u201d the court said. A foreigner who wishes to enter the U.S. to live with or visit a family member would qualify, the justices noted.\u201cAs for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading [the executive order],\u201d the court wrote. \u201cThe students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.\u201dLawyers for refugees resettlement groups challenging the ban said the vast majority of refugees and visa seekers would remain protected under the high court\u2019s order.

Consumers already are grappling with confusion and delays on recalls of the air bags linked to at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries around the world. In some cases, they aren\u2019t expected to be replaced for several years.Betty Niver had two vehicles equipped with recalled Takata air bags. \u201cMy 2013 Acura RDX was the first to get a recall notice,\u201d said Mrs. Niver, a 62-year-old retired librarian living in Tulsa, Okla.Faced with the prospect of having what some officials have called \u201cticking timebombs\u201d sitting in her driveway while their local dealership awaited parts needed for repairs, the grandmother of three opted to trade it in for a new car. The dealership offered her substantial discounts on a 2016 Acura. \u201cThey bent over backward to get it resolved to make sure she was not driving a car around, with grandchildren in it, that was defective,\u201d said her husband, Dennis Niver, 69.The couple\u2019s second vehicle still is awaiting replacement air bags.Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan on Sunday and Monday, respectively, with plans to sell the lion\u2019s share of its business to rival Key Safety Systems Inc. for around $1.6 billion. Under the Japanese supplier\u2019s current plan, a reorganized Takata will handle liabilities not assumed by Key Safety, specifically producing the inflaters for continuing recall repairs, according to bankruptcy-court documents.Takata\u2019s U.S. arm faced \u201cinsurmountable claims and liabilities\u201d estimated at billions of dollars owed to auto makers shouldering recall costs, according to court documents.A haggard-looking       Shigehisa Takada,        Takata\u2019s president, bowed deeply at a press conference Monday and pledged production would continue. \u201cWe will deeply apologize from the bottom of my heart to all of the relevant people and creditors who have been supporting and cooperating with us,\u201d he said.By the end of 2019, the U.S. recall will expand to cover nearly 70 million air bags\u2014in 42 million cars\u2014from about 46 million air bags currently. Only around one-fifth of the eventual total had been repaired as of May 26, according to U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data. Consumers have complained of parts shortages at repair facilities, and some bags may need to be replaced more than once, as early replacements\u2014deemed still problematic\u2014age and the explosion risk grows.The recall\u2014the largest-ever automotive-safety campaign in the U.S.\u2014affects cars from 19 manufacturers, from luxury makers like             BMW AG       and             Tesla Inc.       to             Ford Motor Co.       and             Honda Motor Co.Car makers in theory could seek compensation from Takata for their recall costs or simply take their business elsewhere. Thus far, they appear more concerned about making sure Takata\u2019s factories keep churning out replacement parts.Japanese car companies have said that they will continue to purchase replacement parts from Takata, and in filings on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday indicated they expect most of their recall costs won\u2019t be reimbursed by Takata.Those companies include Honda, the maker most exposed to the recall. It has set aside 556 billion yen ($4.9 billion) over two years to cover its recall costs, fueling losses as its peers have enjoyed record profits from strong U.S. car sales and a weak yen.But Honda is further ahead in the recall than others, having repaired more than 10 million of the currently recalled air bags, or roughly 59% of its share. That compares with 34% for             Toyota Motor Corp.       and 29% for             General Motors Co      , according to the NHTSA\u2014and only 2% for             Daimler AG\u2019s       Mercedes-Benz.The slow pace of the recall effort is one reason why some car makers are saying they will continue to buy replacement parts from Takata.Two years into the U.S. recall, lawmakers are critical of the progress. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pick up the pace on boosting production of replacement inflaters and assisting consumers who need to get their vehicles fixed,\u201d said Sen.       Bill Nelson       (D., Fla.) in a written statement earlier this month.The problem is more pressing in states like Mr. Nelson\u2019s, where heat and high humidity increase the likelihood the Takata air bags will explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel inside the vehicles. Regulators have made these regions the priority.In Japan, three-quarters of Takata\u2019s recalled air bags have been replaced. Car makers credit the country\u2019s mandatory vehicle-safety inspections. There are also significant numbers of recalls elsewhere, including Europe.Takata isn\u2019t the only company supplying replacements for the recalled air bags. Larger rival             Autoliv Inc.       has reported a surge in air-bag orders in the past two years, in part due to the recall.Takata expects to be producing replacement parts at least until March 2020, according to replacement plans from car makers.Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Takata Vows to Meet Recall Needs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 17:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-air-bag-maker-takata-means-to-keep-limping-along-1498477869", "news_title": "With 54 Million to Go, This Airbag Recall Is Never Going To End", "keywords": "air-bag deaths,air-bag explosion,air-bag recall,air bags,explosive air bags,shrapnel,takata air bags,takata bankruptcy,Takata,7312.TO,JP:7312,Key Safety Systems,bankruptcy,product,consumer safety,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,product recalls,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "A senior executive of Australian casino company             Crown Resorts Ltd.        CWN -1.11%       pleaded guilty Monday to gambling crimes in China and was sentenced to 10 months in prison, capping an episode that has chilled efforts by casinos to lure Chinese high-rollers.Jason O\u2019Connor, Crown\u2019s head of international VIP operations, was charged along with 18 other current and former Crown employees who also pleaded guilty during a three-hour trial before Criminal Court No. 1 in Shanghai\u2019s Baoshan district.In addition to Mr. O\u2019Connor, four others received 10-month sentences and 11 were given nine-month sentences, with credit for time served since mid-October, Crown said. Three administrative employees who have been free on bail weren\u2019t sentenced.The arrests followed an investigation that tracked 69 big-spending Chinese gamblers from 2015 to 2016 as they were coaxed to Crown\u2019s Australia resorts with free airline tickets, visas and hotel accommodations and gambled tens of millions of Australian dollars, authorities said in court Monday, according to a person present. Crown has casinos in Melbourne and Perth.Casino gambling is illegal in China, except in the special administrative region of Macau. Foreign casinos aren\u2019t allowed to advertise gambling, but they can promote their destinations more broadly, for example promoting beaches and shopping.The defendants could have been sentenced for up to three years in prison, according to lawyers following the case, making Monday\u2019s terms seem relatively light\u2014especially in comparison with higher-profile cases involving foreign and Chinese employees of             GlaxoSmithKline                   PLC and             Rio Tinto                   PLC. Australian Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu, for example, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in China for accepting bribes and stealing commercial secrets.Crown\u2019s decision to sell its stake in a Macau casino operator after the detentions likely helped influence the lenient sentences, said Hans Hendrischke, professor of Chinese business and management at the University of Sydney Business School.Crown was \u201csending a very strong signal that they take this seriously and they want this to be resolved as soon and as smoothly as possible,\u201d Mr. Hendrischke said. \u201cThis is very much the way things operate in China, and it would confirm that if you respond adequately as Crown has done, you can get an adequate return from the Chinese side.\u201dNicolas Groffman, an attorney at Harrison Clark Rickerbys, noted that other gambling cases have included charges of embezzlement or bribery, which didn\u2019t happen here.\u201cMaybe there isn\u2019t motivation anymore to go after them hard because they\u2019ve got other big fish to fry,\u201d Mr. Groffman said. \u201cThere was no need to hang these people and give them anything beyond the normal sentences.\u201dIn a statement, Crown said the 16 employees who were sentenced to jail terms were also fined the equivalent of 1.7 million Australian dollars ($1.3 million) in total. The company said it would pay the fines on their behalf.Crown shares closed up 0.3% Monday at A$12.79 on the Australian stock exchange.The case has been closely watched by the gambling industry. Crown and competitors in Australia and New Zealand reported declines in their VIP businesses after the arrests.Macau, in contrast, is on a 10-month revenue winning streak that analysts say has been partly driven by high-rollers who have returned there from other gambling meccas.Crown has said visitors from mainland China comprised less than half of the company\u2019s international VIP revenue, and that mainland Chinese VIPs accounted for about 12% of the company\u2019s A$3.6 billion in total revenue for the 2016 fiscal year.But in the six months ending Dec. 31, Crown\u2019s most recent financial result, the company said its overall VIP program revenue in Australia fell 45%.Most of the Crown employees detained held sales and marketing positions targeting different regions of China, according to the person present in the court. The three employees who weren\u2019t sentenced or fined were administrative workers, this person said. Aside from the three Australians, one detainee was Malaysian and the others were Chinese, people familiar with the case have said.Crown said 17 are currently employed and two are former staff.The trial was closed to the public and no charging documents were released Monday, although an official accounting of the charges and sentences is likely to be released later, the person at the court said.Crown and other casino operators have long gone to extraordinary lengths to court wealthy Chinese gamblers to their baccarat tables and other games of chance. The blandishments typically include free food and drink, Chinese-speaking service staff and complimentary hotel suites, people in the industry say.For the biggest spenders, a chartered jet flight from China to Australia wasn\u2019t uncommon, these people say.Crown, controlled by billionaire       James Packer,        has also pulled out of a casino project in Las Vegas, signaling a curtailment in its global ambitions. The company is building a casino and resort complex on Sydney\u2019s waterfront and developing a new hotel at its main casino in Melbourne.\u2014Junya Qian in Shanghai contributed to this article.Write to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com and Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 17:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-court-sentences-crown-resorts-senior-executive-to-10-months-in-prison-1498453081", "news_title": "China Court Sentences 16 Crown Resorts Employees to Prison", "keywords": "china anticorruption crackdown ,chinese high-roller gamblers ,crown resorts china ,crown resorts snagged in china ,james packer,jason o'connor,suspected gambling crimes ,Crown Resorts,CWN.AU,AU:CWN,Hans Hendrischke,Jason O'Connor,Nicolas Groffman,corporate crime,legal action,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,gambling industries,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "A North Carolina man was sentenced to 10 years in prison\u00a0Monday\u00a0for his role in trafficking 33 guns from his home state to Brooklyn.Marcus Gamble,        24 years old, pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal sale of a firearm last month.\u00a0Mr. Gamble was one of two dozen suspects arrested in March and accused of running an interstate gun-trafficking ring that brought 217 weapons into New York City, the authorities said.\u201cToday\u2019s sentencing is further evidence of our commitment to stop illegal guns from being sold on the streets of Brooklyn,\u201d said       Eric Gonzalez,        the acting Brooklyn district attorney. \u201cLax gun laws down South are responsible for most of the guns used to commit crimes here.\u201dAn attorney representing Mr. Gamble didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Brooklyn prosecutors said that on two occasions in December, Mr. Gamble sold loaded guns to an undercover police officer.

House Republicans are likely to set nonmilitary spending at $511 billion, which is below the limit of $516 billion under current law.\u201cThis is so important for our country,\u201d House Budget Committee Chairwoman       Diane Black       (R., Tenn.,) said last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that we have a fiscally sound country moving forward and at the same time, strengthening our military and getting to where we can do tax reform.\u201dThe budget resolution, a largely symbolic document, carries unusual importance this year, because Republicans plan to use it to help pass an overhaul of the tax code without Democratic support. The budget resolution will lay out the measuring sticks and revenue targets for the tax plan, which top Republicans are trying to write now. If the House and Senate both adopt the same budget, that unlocks the so-called reconciliation procedures that can allow a subsequent tax bill to pass on a party-line vote.While the spending levels House Republicans are mapping out are likely to change during the course of negotiations over the summer and early fall, other directions included in the budget resolution could eventually become law. Although the budget can get adopted on a party-line basis, actual spending bills will require Democratic support.For instance, Republicans are planning to include instructions to shave off at least $200 billion over a decade from mandatory spending, the money the federal government automatically spends for the major safety-net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.Legislation tied to the budget process can pass both chambers of Congress under a special process known as reconciliation. That enables certain measures to pass with just a simple majority in the Senate, where 60 votes are usually needed to clear procedural hurdles. Republicans hold 52 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats.The spending levels close to finalization in the House would be used for two things: the budget resolution that maps out the GOP\u2019s fiscal plan for the next decade and the establishment of the amount of money to be divvied up in detailed spending bills, which provide the money to run government agencies in fiscal year 2018. Congress must pass those spending bills, in some form, before current funding expires on Oct. 1. Unlike the budget resolution, which doesn\u2019t require a presidential signature, spending bills go to the White House and need 60 votes in the Senate. As a result, Democrats\u2019 support will be needed to pass spending legislation.It would take a bipartisan agreement to alter the spending limits established in 2011 as part of a deal to raise the debt limit. Negotiations between leaders of both parties are expected to ramp up later this summer.House Republicans have acknowledged that the spending levels they set in the House GOP budget are unlikely to represent the final outcome. Democrats are willing to boost military spending, but only if matched by an increase in nonmilitary spending.\u201cWe must provide equal relief for both defense and non-defense programs that power our local economies,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), Sen.       Patrick Leahy       of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois,       Patty Murray       of Washington and       Debbie Stabenow       of Michigan, all members of Democratic leadership, wrote to Senate GOP leaders in a letter Monday. The Democrats also objected to funding       Mr. Trump\u2019s       proposed wall along the border with Mexico.Many Republicans said last week they wanted to crystallize their priorities, including boosts to military spending and trims elsewhere in the budget, ahead of bipartisan negotiations with Democrats later this year. Others said they would rather begin the talks with Democrats sooner than later.\u201cWe will once again spend a lot of time and energy on the first launch knowing damn well that the final bill will be at a number higher than what we\u2019re discussing here today\u201d on nondefense spending, said Rep.       Charlie Dent       (R., Pa.), a key centrist who has been urging GOP leaders to begin discussions with Democrats. \u201cThere will be a negotiation. It\u2019s just a matter of when,\u201d he said. \"Everybody knows it.\u201dDefense hawks had hoped to include even more military spending, around $640 billion, so the $621.5 billion marks something of a compromise with those concerned about the impact on the federal budget deficit. In his budget released earlier this year, President Donald Trump proposed setting military spending at $603 billion plus an additional $65 billion in defense emergency war spending, which isn\u2019t subject to the caps established in the 2011 deal.House Republicans are expected to boost defense emergency war spending by $75 billion, according to House GOP aides.\u201cThere is a clear realization we have been neglecting defense,\u201d Rep.

Bernie Sanders deplored the actions of his former campaign volunteer       James T. Hodgkinson,        who was killed after opening fire on participants at a congressional baseball practice for Republicans on June 14. More recently, Mr. Sanders has been accusing his Republican colleagues of hatching a plan that will result in thousands of deaths.The anti-Trump \u201dresistance,\u201d still smarting from its recent loss in a Georgia House race, has apparently decided that it needs someone more radical than Rep.       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.) to lead the opposition to GOP health care reforms. So the organization MoveOn.org has been staging a multi-state tour with Mr. Sanders as the headliner.The basic Sanders argument, which he has been articulating in various fora in recent days, is that fewer people on government insurance plans will mean more people dying. It seems likely that any health reform plan that makes it to the President\u2019s desk will no longer force people to buy ObamaCare plans, and will give states at least some flexibility in choosing not to provide insurance to people who aren\u2019t sick, aren\u2019t poor and don\u2019t have children.But will fewer people on government-mandated insurance plans automatically make them less healthy? Mr. Sanders appears to be convinced. He tweeted on Friday: \u201cLet us be clear and this is not trying to be overly dramatic: Thousands of people will die if the Republican health care bill becomes law.\u201d Asked to defend such remarks on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, Mr. Sanders said:Speaking of studies, all of America has been participating in an experiment since 2010 to see if a federal effort to extend government-mandated insurance coverage to millions more people can improve our lives. Last year the Obama Administration bragged that 20 million adults had gained health insurance as a result of Mr. Obama\u2019s so-called Affordable Care Act.Given the Sanders logic, one might have expected to see a corresponding improvement in public health. But so far evidence that ObamaCare made us healthier has proven elusive, to say the least. In December the             New York Times                   was among the many news outlets that had to share the embarrassing news:It sure is. One thing on which researchers seem to agree is that there has been a deterioration in the health of middle-class whites. Why is this group seeing higher mortality rates? In a recent paper for the Brookings Institution, Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and his Princeton colleague Anne Case write:Much of Mr. Deaton\u2019s research over the years has examined the way that people around the world get healthier as they get wealthier. Republicans should note that expanding employment is a great way to improve wellness. This is of course the opposite of the agenda embedded in ObamaCare, which discouraged employment. It\u2019s hard to tell if Mr. Sanders will regret raising the question of whether government insurance programs are the key to health and longevity. But it\u2019s an argument he is not going to win.***Bottom Stories of the DayQuestions Nobody Is Asking  \u201cHow \u2018Gay\u2019 Should a Gay Bar Be?,\u201d New York Times, June 24Generalissimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead  \u201cHillary Is Just as Unpopular as She Was After the Election, New Poll Shows,\u201d Fox News, June 22Gone in 60 Minutes  \u201cDrug bust in The Villages uncovers possible golf cart chop shop,\u201d Palm Beach Post, June 23Retirees Gone Wild  \u201cCoffee-seeking 81-year-old leads Denton police on low-speed chase,\u201d Dallas Morning News, June 23News of the Tautological  \u201cA Key Challenge for America\u2019s Cup Crews: Don\u2019t Fall Overboard,\u201d New York Times, June 24And Even Without Yoga  \u201c\u2018Beer Yoga\u2019 is now a thing in London,\u201d WTTG, June 22***Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

The case was heard in February by an eight-member court, which apparently divided evenly on the issue. Justice       Neil Gorsuch,        confirmed in April, likely will provide the deciding vote when the case is argued again in the term that begins in October.The cross-border shooting case was among the most dramatic heard by the court during the term that ended Monday. According to the suit, 15-year-old       Sergio Hernandez       and his friends were playing a tag-like game in the dry concrete culvert built to channel the Rio Grande, dividing the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico.Border Patrol agent       Jesus Mesa Jr.       arrived on a bicycle and seized one of the youths, but when Sergio escaped to the Mexican side of the culvert, fatally shot him in the face.Had the victim been in the U.S. or held American citizenship, or had the shooter worked for a state or local agency, the parents most likely could sue for damages.But Congress hasn\u2019t explicitly authorized lawsuits against federal officials for violating constitutional rights, and the Supreme Court has found only narrow circumstances when they potentially are liable for such misconduct.Monday\u2019s unsigned decision directs the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, to re-examine whether the Hernandez killing falls into such circumstances, especially under an opinion the high court issued last week further elaborating the \u201cspecial factors\u201d that determine whether federal officials may be sued.\u201cThe facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life,\u201d the court said. Whether Sergio\u2019s parents \u201cmay recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions\u201d the appeals court should first address.Although unsigned, Monday\u2019s decision was adopted by a 5-3 vote.In dissent, Justice       Stephen Breyer,        joined by Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        said the parents should have been permitted to press their claim at trial. Among other reasons, Mr. Mesa \u201cknowingly shot from United States territory into the culvert,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote, without knowing on which side of the border the bullet would land\u201d or \u201c \u201cwhether he was shooting at a citizen of the United States or Mexico.\u201dJustice Breyer\u2019s dissent included a 1963 blueprint showing a cross-section of the culvert, to buttress his argument that Sergio had been more in an international no-man\u2019s-land than deep into a foreign country, and a photo of President Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson viewing the channel in 1968.Justice       Clarence Thomas       dissented on the other side, writing briefly that the Fifth Circuit properly dismissed the case.

Even as conservative groups celebrated the decision, they were unsure of its impact in other cases, including fights over using state money for students to attend private religious schools.\u201cI do believe it will have an effect whenever religious people and organizations see themselves being discriminated against,\u201d\u00a0David Cortman, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the Missouri church, said of the ruling.\u201cThe next question is, what can that money be used for? I think that\u2019s another case for another day,\u201d he said.Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union program on freedom of religion and belief, said the ruling was \u201cdisappointing\u201d but also stressed its narrowness. The civil rights group objects to the ruling because it says the decision dilutes the nation\u2019s founding principle separating church and state.\u201cSome proponents of government-funded religion will surely seek to use this case to attack similar no-aid provisions in states around the country,\u201d Mr. Mach said. \u201cBut the court went out of its way to clarify that today\u2019s decision concerned only grants for playground resurfacing\u201d and other \u201cprograms that have no religious context.\u201dThe ruling was part of a landmark day for religious expression issues at the Supreme Court.In addition to the decision in favor to the Missouri church, the justices also agreed to hear the case of a Colorado baker who has refused to make cakes for same-sex weddings, citing his religious beliefs. Lower courts decided against the baker.The Supreme Court will also review President Trump\u2019s travel ban, which many Muslims say is motivated by animus against their religion.Travis Weber, direct of the center for religious liberty at the Family Research Council, a conservative lobbying group, said the issues involved in the case of the baker were different from the ones in the case decided\u00a0on Monday. Still, he hoped the \u201cprinciple\u201d the justices had embraced would \u201ccarry over to other cases.\u201d\u201cA lot of these issues deal with religious people trying to live their lives in peace, but due to cultural changes, they\u2019re getting sued,\u201d he said.The court ruled 7-2 in favor of the Missouri church. More than 30 state constitutions include prohibitions on funding religious programs, some of which may now be jeopardized, legal scholars said.Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, school of law, said that the decision\u00a0on Monday\u00a0could compel states to include churches and other religious institutions for state and local funding of various kinds.For example, if churches applied for earthquake retrofitting grants, he said, they couldn't be turned down simply because they are religious.Annie Laurie Gaylor,        co-founder of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said she feared the ruling could be \u201cof a fatal blow to the state constitutional prohibitions on funding religion.\u201dBy the court\u2019s reasoning, she said, taxpayers \u201ccould be asked to fund everything the church wants to do.\u201dSince taking office, President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to expand protections for religious groups, including those that engage directly in politics.Last month, he signed an executive order \u201cpromoting free speech and religious liberty.\u201dBut\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump\u2019s clearest contribution to growing religious influence on public life became apparent:       Neil Gorsuch.The open Supreme Court seat during the election, which Mr. Gorsuch has now filled, was the reason many conservative Christians cited for supporting Mr. Trump.Mr. Gorsuch was prepared to go further in defense of churches seeking public funding than the majority of the court. He rejected a footnote in the opinion that said the court wasn\u2019t addressing \u201creligious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\u201dMr. Gorsuch, in his concurrence, \u201cis strongly supporting religious freedom,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Write to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 16:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-decisions-on-religious-issues-hearten-conservatives-1498508652", "news_title": "Supreme Court Decisions on Religious Issues Hearten Conservatives ", "keywords": "gay wedding cake,missouri church,muslim travel ban,playground,religious rights,separation of church and state,Alliance Defending Freedom,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,religion,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Monday to review and allow partial enforcement of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from six predominantly Muslim countries inspired dueling narratives that hinted at new litigation likely to unfold over the summer.For Mr. Trump, the order amounted to a \u201cclear victory for national security\u201d that \u201callows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective,\u201d according to the president\u2019s statement after the ruling.Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing groups challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s directive, said the high court\u2019s order, \u201cproperly construed, should really allow for only the narrowest implementation of the ban.\u201dTwo federal appeals courts blocked the administration from enforcing the ban, prior to Monday\u2019s order, in challenges brought by Hawaii, refugee-resettlement groups and legal residents whose relatives are seeking entry into the U.S. The lawsuits allege Mr. Trump\u2019s order is motivated by an animus toward Islam, as opposed to concerns about national security. The president has asserted authority to exclude broad groups from the country in order to keep it safe.The Supreme Court, departing from the lower courts, freed the Trump administration to enforce the ban when \u201cthere is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.\u201dBut the justices added that Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201cmay not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201dMr. Trump read the court\u2019s order as freeing his hand. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation\u2019s homeland,\u201d he said in his statement.Attorney General Jeff Sessions saw a prelude to victory, saying in a statement that the Justice Department was \u201cconfident the United States Supreme Court will uphold this constitutional and necessary executive order.\u201dBut officials for the groups challenging the travel ban, and even some of the justices, predicted a clash with the administration in the lower courts over who qualifies as having a bona fide relationship with people and groups in the U.S.Justice       Clarence Thomas,        writing in a separate opinion, said he would have fully reinstated the ban.

It was the yield\u2019s lowest close since Nov 10, 2016.The 30-year Treasury bond was the best performer, with its yield settling at 2.696%, compared with 2.715% Friday. It was the yield\u2019s lowest close since Nov 8, 2016.Yields fall as bond prices rise.Higher interest rates from the Fed reduce money flowing into the broader economy and tend to shrink the value of outstanding U.S. government bonds.Yet the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen this year even as the Fed has raised interest rates three times since December, pointing to the central bank\u2019s limits in influencing long-term bond yields. The 10-year yield traded at 2.446% at the end of last year.A number of factors have sent the 10-year yield lower this year: skepticism over President       Donald Trump\u2019s       capability to push through his fiscal agenda; questions toward how robustly the U.S. economy has been expanding after a soft patch during the first three months of the year; and slowing inflation over the past few months despite signs of the labor market approaching full employment.Reflecting investors\u2019 doubts over the Fed\u2019s rate-hike plan, a $26 billion sale of two-year Treasury notes Monday afternoon drew the strongest demand since Nov 2015.A $34 billion sale of five-year notes is due Tuesday, followed by a $28 billion sale of seven-year notes Wednesday. Traders said the looming supply contained the bond market\u2019s price strength on Monday.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       is scheduled to speak Tuesday in London. Investors will zero in on whether the Fed chief sticks to her expectations that slowing inflation would be temporary, which supports her case to continue raising short term rates in a gradual manner.Lower bond yields suggest that some investors aren\u2019t buying the Fed\u2019s inflation outlook. Inflation is the big threat to long-term government debt as it chips away investors\u2019 purchasing power over time from their fixed income investments. Investors who buy long-term Treasurys expect slowing growth that will ease inflation pressure.The Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index, which measures investors\u2019 expectation of price swings in the Treasury bond market, settled at 51.1318 last Thursday, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That marked the lowest reading since its record low of 48.8695 set on May 9, 2013.\u201cBond investors don\u2019t anticipate that yields will move significantly higher or lower\u201d due to moderate growth, contained inflation and a Fed that intends to remove monetary accommodation at a very gradual pace, said       Donald Ellenberger,        senior portfolio manager at             Federated Investors.Some analysts warn that the low volatility reading suggests investors are complacent.\u201cBonds investors could be in for a rude awakening later this year if they engage in excessive risk taking at this time,\u2019\u2019 said Andrew Pace, vice president at Performance Trust Capital Partners LLC.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 16:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bonds-strengthen-on-larger-drop-in-durable-goods-orders-1498489500", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Strengthen on Drop in Durable Goods Orders", "keywords": "bonds,bond yields, credit markets, interest rates, treasuries, treasury, treasury notes, u.s. government bonds,Performance Trust Capital Partners,Federated Investors,FII,Janet Yellen,Donald Ellenberger,Thomas Roth,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,consumer goods,durable household products"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that President Donald Trump\u2019s revised executive order on visas and refugees can take effect while the justices consider the case.

The commission\u2019s decision, made under former Chairman       Mary Jo White,        to expand its use of administrative courts fed complaints that SEC lawyers enjoy a home-court advantage there.In 2015, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles showing that the SEC was sending more cases to its in-house judges and enjoying a higher success rate there than in federal courts. The Journal also explored the constitutional questions that some lawyers raised about the system.The SEC tribunals are run by officers who have career appointments, such as U.S. district judges, but are classified as employees of the agency. Critics say they exercise enough power that, under the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause, they should have been hired by the SEC\u2019s commissioners.

One of the ironies of the election of a fierce nationalist in the U.S. is that it coincided with what looked like a recovery in global trade, after years of stagnation.We\u2019ll find out in coming days if President Donald Trump and his administration are willing to jeopardize trade by slapping tariffs on steel on national security grounds\u2014bypassing international rules and opening the way to a tit-for-tat response. But even without new tariffs, the nascent trade recovery isn\u2019t all it seems.Investors have rightly seen tariffs as good for U.S. steel stocks, which have been pummeled by international competition and weak balance sheets. But there seems to be little fear of a full-blown trade war developing, either in steel\u2014where investors in shares of major foreign competitors have seemed oblivious\u2014or more widely.Why aren\u2019t investors more concerned about the risk of globalization being put into reverse gear? One answer is that few really believe Mr. Trump wants to start a trade war. His campaign rhetoric led investors to dump the Mexican peso after he won, anticipating trade troubles. But the peso is now stronger than it was before the November election, and the first tariffs he imposed were on Canada, not the target his voters expected. Aside from Canada, his trade actions have so far mostly involved fiddling around the edges, commissioning reports and improving the enforcement of existing rules.Another answer is that investors have been discussing \u201cdeglobalization\u201d for a long time, so the idea of increased trade friction comes as no surprise (though a full-on trade war would be a shock). The 2007-2008 financial crisis led to a collapse in global trade, and after a brief recovery it flatlined for years. Banks also retreated from financial commitments abroad, and there has been no return to the pre-Lehman days of grand cross-border banking acquisitions. Creeping protectionism has been visible in the rising number of minor trade disputes.The data showed a clear pickup in trade in the first quarter, with 5.7% year-over-year growth in March the highest for six years, according to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. But April data was weaker, and the shipping sector is suffering.Trade acceleration is good news for investors, as more globalization means faster economic growth and more efficient use of productive assets and workers (who may not be so happy). The twin dangers for investors are that the recent recovery proves to be a mirage, or that Mr. Trump brings it to an end.The global trade recovery might be less than it seems if it is merely a reflection of China\u2019s stimulus last year. Oxford Economics estimates that as much as 70% of the trade growth comes from the knock-on effects of Chinese demand, which few expect to last. As China put the monetary brakes on in recent months, the Baltic Dry index of shipping costs has tumbled, and the Dow Jones Global Shipping index shows the sector\u2019s stocks have fallen a tenth from this year\u2019s high. South Korea\u2019s trade volumes, used by many as a leading indicator of global trade, have fallen back after hitting a new high in March.If Mr. Trump goes ahead with his steel tariffs, the bet is whether it leads to a creeping deglobalization with a steady ratcheting-up of trade restrictions, or a trade war.The lesson of the 1930s is that trade wars hurt everyone, so my money would be on more subtle forms of retaliation. But politicians can best show they mean business by striking back publicly. In Europe, attacking Mr. Trump looks especially like a vote winner.

Typographically, at least, a panic button had been pushed. The German military, it turns out, might come under fire in Syria.It was front-page news last week in Bild, the biggest-selling newspaper in Germany, a country where the army and air force basically do not fight.After a U.S. jet shot down a Syrian fighter aircraft on June 18, Russia warned that any plane flying into a designated zone over Syria would be targeted. Bild said that German reconnaissance Tornados\u2014no gunfire, please\u2014would soon have to fly their missions for the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition by passing through \u201cthe defined danger zone.\u201dWhile the coalition\u2019s American and French special forces operate inside Syria with combat air support from Belgian, Danish and Dutch allies, Germany\u2019s air force does photo reconnaissance and its armed forces train Kurdish fighters beyond the frontiers of the Russian-backed dictatorship.As for the principle of shared risk, basic to the coherence and symbolism of the West? The Allies mostly look away, although adversaries such as Russia or Islamic State can revel in the reality of a nonlethal German player on every front. Pacifism is the reflexive German excuse.But last week\u2019s decision by the European Union to step up defense cooperation and put big money into the effort\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t see danger to NATO in it,\u201d said       Kurt Volker,        a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance\u2014is nudging the German issue into the open.France\u2019s President       Emmanuel Macron,        for one, sees enhanced credibility in acknowledging the softness of German engagement rather than evading it while attempting to build a European military with, of course, France as its primary player.Mr. Macron took the truth to French troops last month in Mali, where they are fighting Islamist forces. \u201cLet me be straight about this,\u201d he said, referring to European support, including Germany\u2019s dispatch of up to 1,000 troops. \u201cWe do what\u2019s purely military, and they take care of the development missions.\u201dMr. Macron was more specific last week, saying, \u201cGermany is lucid on the limits of action . . . notably in the area of military intervention. To protect itself, to protect Europe, it needs France.\u2019\u2019That\u2019s a generous way of addressing German irresolution, and avoids any reference to what American attitudes might be. The single universally dissuasive element of a prospective EU military is its firm relationship with the U.S.Eastern European alliance members in the Russian line of fire recognize this. In an article from Lithuania, where a German-led NATO battle group is operating, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported over the weekend that there was widespread pressure for the \u201clife insurance\u201d of a company-level American presence in the region\u2019s three similar NATO formations. U.S. troops are currently deployed only in Poland\u2019s battle group.Both the Americans and French noted with muffled despair last year that the first German military doctrine issued in a decade spoke of Russia as a \u201cchallenge\u201d rather than the \u201cthreat\u201d referred to in NATO\u2019s 2016 Warsaw summit declaration. This is a nonstrategy, without the red-lines Mr. Macron favors. It is mirrored by polls over three consecutive years that report a majority of Germans saying Germany should not defend the Baltic States or Poland if Russia attacks them.You might think Mrs. Merkel would have expressed her dismay about Germans unwilling to fight for their friends. But a debate on the issue has never been considered. Instead, Mrs. Merkel defends the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany natural-gas pipeline project deplored by the U.S. Senate, alongside conservative and Greens groups in the European Parliament.Three months before her likely re-election, Ms. Merkel is a chancellor whose projection of calm precludes dealing with casualties, discussing Russia in military terms or saying \u201cfor shame\u201d to a single quivering voter.It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the Christian Democrat president of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign-affairs commission and a Merkel loyalist, told me: \u201cWe have to define the role of the Bundeswehr,\u201d referring to Germany\u2019s armed forces, \u201cas an instrument in our foreign and security policy, and we have to start to think strategically instead of pursuing interests piecemeal. Nobody likes conflict. But turning a blind eye and conflict aversion may eventually come at a much higher cost.\u2019\u2019This is self-awareness. It brings to mind potential new German engagement rid of its passivity as Berlin\u2019s way to give substance to a European defense initiative.But it leaves for now a Germany unable to win Russia\u2019s respect militarily or provide greater credibility to the West\u2019s challenged deterrence.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 15:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-pacifism-comes-under-fire-1498504035", "news_title": "German Pacifism Comes Under Fire", "keywords": "germany, nato,norbert rottgen, pacifism, syria,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has made its second big real estate bet in two weeks.On Monday, real-estate investment trust Store Capital Corp. disclosed Berkshire has purchased a 9.8% stake in the firm.

In a short response Monday, Nestl\u00e9 said it keeps an \u201copen dialogue with all our shareholders\u201d but remains \u201ccommitted to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value.\u201dThe Swiss-based company said it had no further comment on Mr. Loeb\u2019s stake.Third Point\u2019s stake amounts to just 1.25% of Nestl\u00e9, but that makes Mr. Loeb one of the company\u2019s top 10 investors. His recommendations come at a time when Nestl\u00e9 shareholders could find them hard to ignore: Years of slow growth have shaken Nestl\u00e9 and its consumer-goods competitors, as they contend with changing consumer tastes, a raft of new upstart rivals and other headwinds.Shareholders welcomed the Third Point investment, sending Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stock up more than 4% Monday.Mr. Schneider, 51 years old, took the top job at Nestl\u00e9 in January. Third Point has been accruing shares since the start of the year, encouraged by the possibilities that come with a new CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s board plucked Mr. Schneider out of the health-care industry to help diversify from its slow-growing cash cows to healthier foods and products. He moved quickly to shake things up. Shortly after becoming CEO, he abandoned Nestl\u00e9\u2019s longstanding annual growth target, after years of shortfalls. Earlier this month, he put Nestl\u00e9\u2019s U.S. confectionery business up for sale.But he has also resisted some of the more radical approaches taken by competitors. He is an outspoken critic of so-called zero-based budgeting, the cost-cutting technique applied by Brazilian fund 3G Capital at some of the U.S. consumer-goods businesses it steers.Messrs. Schneider and Loeb met in Switzerland about two weeks ago, according to one of these people, to discuss the investor\u2019s ideas for how the company can grow.Third Point surmised that new management, already motivated to boost margins, was ready to take the steps it was suggesting, according to people familiar with the matter. But the hedge fund wanted to make its views public to rally shareholder support for the changes, one of these people said. Third Point also has concerns about the makeup of the board, which it believes lacks packaged-food and financial expertise, the people said.Nestl\u00e9 declined to comment.Third Point\u2019s letter to investors on Sunday identified \u201ca familiar set of conditions that make [Nestl\u00e9] ripe for improvement and change.\u201d The fund said: \u201cOur recommendations to Nestl\u00e9 management, if taken together, would dramatically improve both the growth profile and earnings power of the company.\u201dThird Point has tapped       Jan Bennink,        a food-industry veteran, as its adviser on the investment. While Third Point hasn\u2019t specified whether it would seek a board seat at Nestl\u00e9, it listed Mr. Bennink\u2019s expertise in packaged foods and shareholder returns in its letter. Often activists name advisers as a signal of who they hope to be named to the board down the road.The hedge fund raised a special $1 billion investment fund for Nestl\u00e9 in a matter of a week, the people said. EnTrustPermal, an investor in hedge funds that is majority owned by             Legg Mason Inc.,        LM 1.50%       put $650 million in that fund, according to people familiar with the matter\u2014a sizable sum for a single investor. EnTrustPermal co-owner Gregg Hymowitz confirmed the firm had invested in the activist play.In an open letter, Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point fund made these demands of Nestl\u00e9:Jefferies analyst       Martin Deboo       said Mr. Schneider has some room to maneuver. \u201cWe view [Nestl\u00e9] as a proud company with an enduring model,\u201d said Mr. Deboo. \u201cWe expect them to be wary of bending too readily, too publicly, to the views of an ultimately small shareholder.\u201dMr. Schneider, a dual U.S. and German citizen, spent the 13 years before Nestl\u00e9 heading German health-care giant             Fresenius SE,       which runs hospitals, makes medical equipment and supplies drugs and nutritional products. There, he earned a reputation for deal making and cost-cutting, catching the attention of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s board. Mr. Schneider is the Swiss company\u2019s youngest pick for the top job in 50 years and its first outsider CEO since 1922.Mr. Schneider quickly decided to scrap the \u201cNestl\u00e9 model\u201d\u2014the company\u2019s long-running target of boosting organic sales by 5% to 6% each year\u2014after it fell short of the target for the fourth year in a row.This month, Nestl\u00e9 said it would look to sell its U.S. confectionery arm, which has lagged behind             Hershey Co.      , Mars Inc. and             Lindt & Spruengli AG      .The two moves were deemed sensible ones by many analysts, but Nestl\u00e9 critics, including some shareholders, have long said it needs bolder moves.Last year, before Mr. Schneider took over, Bernstein analyst       Andrew Wood       warned Nestl\u00e9 \u201cmay suffer a slow slide to mediocrity\u201d after receiving responses from 75 of the Swiss giant\u2019s investors in a poll. Their worries included a weak commitment to cutting costs and rising competition. The polling also revealed frustration about return of capital and mixed views on the company\u2019s push into health sciences and skin care.Mr. Wood hailed Mr. Schneider\u2019s appointment, but wrote that the new CEO faced \u201cfundamental operating issues\u201d across Nestl\u00e9\u2019s business units and said any turnaround would \u201clikely take years not months.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Wood in a note said \u201cThird Point is just saying (perhaps just louder) what others have been thinking and saying for some time.\u201dNestl\u00e9 has said it is working to cut costs and sell noncore assets and is exploring innovative ways of reaching customers. It recently took a stake in subscription meals service Freshly and has teamed up with street vendors to sell noodles brand Maggi. The company has also been reducing the salt and sugar in its food and has made a $50 million investment in research and development to turn around its flagging frozen-food business.Consumer-goods giants the world over are struggling with global markets marked by weaker growth, volatile currencies, political instability and changing consumer tastes. In many places, they are hard-pressed to raise prices in the face of low inflation. Packaged-foods companies are in an even tougher spot. Consumer preferences for healthier, fresher food have forced many to pour money into cutting sugar and salt, without compromising on taste, and to create new brands appealing to preferences for organic or healthy food.Delivery companies, subscription meals services, private label brands and small, local companies are all now competing for consumers who were once predictable grocery-store buyers of Nestl\u00e9 brands.Mr. Schneider has indicated he gets it.\u201cSize alone does not protect us from the winds of change,\u201d Mr. Schneider said at an industry conference in Berlin last week, adding that Nestl\u00e9 is facing \u201ca constant need to evolve.\u201d\u2014Juliet Chung contributed to this article.Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Nestl\u00e9 Braces for Investor Battle.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 14:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-unmoved-by-third-point-demands-1498480636", "news_title": "Nestl\u00e9 Unmoved by Demands From Activist Investor Third Point", "keywords": "Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,L'Oreal,OR.FR,LRLCY,Third Point,Legg Mason,LM,3G Capital,Gregg Hymowitz,Jan Bennink,plans,strategy,output,production,management,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,cosmetics,toiletries,food,beverages,tobacco,food preserving,speciality foods,frozen food,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances"}, {"content": "Martin Marietta Materials Inc.

That list also includes public urination, rising utility bills, subway delays and traffic congestion.\u201cThe hard-working people of this city are fed up,\u201d she said.Ms. Malliotakis, a 36-year-old Republican, is focusing her race to become the next mayor of New York City on quality-of-life concerns, homing in on a potential vulnerability for Mr. de Blasio.Her campaign is resonating strongest on Staten Island, her home borough, where many of its roughly 500,000 residents contend the city\u2019s left-leaning officials often neglect them.\u201cMayor de Blasio doesn\u2019t appear to me to be interested in regular citizens,\u201d said       George Parsons,        an 86-year-old military veteran and Staten Island voter. Mr. Parsons supports Ms. Malliotakis, he said, because she \u201cconsiders the citizens of Staten Island.\u201dStaten Island\u2019s conservative voters are a sliver of the city\u2019s roughly 5 million registered voters, and Ms. Malliotakis faces a steep uphill climb trying to topple an incumbent Democrat. In an increasingly liberal city, Democrats hold a roughly six-to-one advantage.But even if she loses, her campaign is bringing to the fore a criticism of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s management capabilities that has dogged him during his first term, and may continue to in a second, analysts said.In the process, Ms. Malliotakis may solidify her appeal at home, which could help with any future campaigns.\u201cHammering de Blasio is a good way to set yourself up on Staten Island,\u201d said       Richard Flanagan,        an associate professor of political science at the College of Staten Island. \u201cNo matter how hard he tries, they just won\u2019t let him into their hearts.\u201dA spokesman for the de Blasio campaign,       Dan Levitan,        disputed that quality of life has declined on the mayor\u2019s watch. \u201cNew York City has expanded graffiti removal, sidewalk washing and litter basket service,\u201d he said.Mr. Levitan also noted Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts for Staten Island, including new ferry access, repaved roads and programs to combat a heroin epidemic.\u201cNo one fights harder for outer-borough New Yorkers than Mayor de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Levitan said.To face off with the mayor, Ms. Malliotakis would first have to win the Sept. 12th primary against       Paul Massey.       Mr. Massey, a businessman, has framed himself as more of a moderate Republican with the potential to win Democratic votes in Manhattan.\u201cPaul has an innovative vision to unite the city and grow jobs,\u201d said       Mollie Fullington,        Mr. Massey\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cNew Yorkers don\u2019t need another failed professional politician in City Hall.\u201dThe primary is still anyone\u2019s to win, but Mr. de Blasio remains the overwhelming front-runner in November\u2019s general election.Ms. Malliotakis\u2019 run is the latest move in her political climb. Though she sits in a small minority conference in the state Assembly and has few levers of power, she has used her bully pulpit to push ethics measures and criticize Democrats.\u201cAnyone who\u2019s spent time with her realizes the sky\u2019s the limit for her political career,\u201d said Republican Assembly Minority Leader       Brian Kolb.The daughter of Cuban and Greek immigrants, Ms. Malliotakis took office in 2011, and is touted by conservative strategists as diversifying the GOP and bringing in younger people.She also has clashed with Democrats and some moderate Republicans in Albany, N.Y., and City Hall, who say her record is thin, and her positions are too far right for New York.They point to her vote against gay marriage, which passed a bipartisan New York Legislature in 2011; and her lawsuit to stop the mayor from destroying identification-card records that could be used by federal officials to find illegal immigrants.\u201cShe clearly is out of touch,\u201d said City Council Speaker       Melissa Mark-Viverito,        a Democrat. \u201cShe represents a [President Donald] Trump point-of-view\u2026and that definitely is not aligned with the values of this city.\u201dMs. Malliotakis said Ms. Viverito is a \u201cradical\u201d and that being considered too conservative by the speaker is \u201cthe best endorsement I can receive.\u201dShe supported Mr. Trump but said she would work to change his mind on some issues, including proposed changes to tax law that experts believe could burden blue states.Running for citywide office, Ms. Malliotakis has focused on quality-of-life concerns New Yorkers of all stripes gripe about.Some of the issues she highlights pose widespread problems for the mayor, including congested streets, unreliable subways and rising homelessness.She also opposes Mr. de Blasio\u2019s moves to lessen penalties for public urination\u00a0and public alcohol consumption.\u201cVoters care about quality of life so she\u2019s on the right track,\u201d said       Bradley Tusk,        an independent political strategist who actively has worked to defeat the mayor. \u201cBut it is very rare to see an incumbent lose unless there\u2019s a public safety crisis\u2026or they\u2019re mortally wounded by a scandal.\u201dFor Staten Island conservatives, just having someone in the running with their interests at the heart of her campaign has been galvanizing.Those voters gave Mr. Trump his only general-election win in the five boroughs, and lauded Ms. Malliotakis for her work on local issues such as superstorm Sandy recovery and veteran\u2019s services.Linda Aiello,        a 63-year-old Staten Island Trump supporter, said Ms. Malliotakis helped secure public funding for repairs after homes were destroyed by Sandy, and other officials didn\u2019t.

Those included new incentives, such as giving tipsters a portion of the penalties imposed on firms if they report misconduct to the SEC. It also included new penalties for employers seen as discouraging the reporting of misconduct\u2014so-called anti-retaliation provisions.Monday\u2019s case narrowly focuses on whether such anti-retaliation provisions apply to people who report misconduct to their employers, but not to the SEC. The high court will consider the matter in the fall of 2017 when it meets for its next term, giving the justices a platform to potentially narrow the scope of protection in this area.The appeal was brought by a company called             Digital Realty Trust Inc.,       a San Francisco-based real-estate investment trust that owns and develops data centers. The company was sued in November 2014 by a former executive the company had fired in April of that year.The former executive,       Paul Somers,        had complained to senior management shortly before being fired that his supervisor had eliminated certain internal controls and had engaged in other alleged misconduct, including hiding substantial cost overruns on a project in Hong Kong. Mr. Somers\u2019s suit against the company asserted that it had retaliated against him as a whistleblower in violation of Dodd-Frank.The company moved to dismiss the case, on the grounds that Mr. Somers wasn\u2019t a whistleblower because he didn\u2019t report the alleged misconduct to the SEC. A federal trial court disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss. It found that Congress\u2019s overall purpose was to protect those who report violations internally as well as those who report to the government\u2014an approach accepted by an appellate court in San Francisco earlier this year.The SEC has backed Mr. Somers\u2019s view of the law, having issued regulations in May 2011 that say employers cannot retaliate against workers who sound the alarm internally. In a legal brief filed in response to Digital Realty Trust\u2019s appeal, the agency argued its rules were intended to ensure that employees would still report wrongdoing internally, despite the allure of a potential monetary windfall if they filed a valid claim with the SEC.\u201cIndividuals who make internal reports of possible securities law violations are protected under the commission\u2019s whistleblower rules,\u201d former SEC Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney said in a September 2016 speech.Digital Realty argued the conflict is \u201cripe\u201d for the high court to resolve because the statute has been interpreted different ways by federal courts.A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June 2018.\u2014Dave Michaels contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 14:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-consider-how-broadly-a-whistleblower-provision-applies-1498486211", "news_title": "Supreme Court to Consider How Broadly a Whistleblower Provision Applies ", "keywords": "digital reality trust,dodd-frank,finanical regulation,finreg,sec,securities and exchange,supreme court,whistleblowers,Securities and Exchange Commission,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,securities fraud,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "It was a big day Monday at the Supreme Court, which delivered the final opinions for the 2016-17 term and also revealed which cases it would take on in the fall.Here\u2019s a rundown of court news:Allowing a Partial, Temporary Travel BanThe high court allowed President       Donald Trump       to implement part of his temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries because of terrorism concerns, and said it will review lower court rulings that found the president\u2019s actions likely to be unlawful. The justices narrowed the scope of the ban for now, saying the president cannot deny entry to people \u201cwho have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\u201d with someone or some organization in the U.S. The court\u2019s action, which partially stayed lower courts\u2019 rulings against Mr. Trump, signals that the president has a fair shot of prevailing at the Supreme Court on an issue where he has been stymied by lower courts.Church Playground Can\u2019t Be Denied State FundsThe Supreme Court also ruled that Missouri can\u2019t exclude a church school from a program that funds playground resurfacing, finding that discrimination based on \u201creligious identity\u201d violates the Constitution. However, the ruling did not \u201caddress religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination\u201d apart from the playground program, according to the opinion, by Chief Justice       John Roberts.       Two conservative justices broke with that footnote, but agreed with the broader opinion.Justices to Take On Wedding-Cake CaseThe Supreme Court found in 2015 that the Constitution provides same-sex couples the same right to marry that opposite-sex partners enjoy. But there have been several disputes involving bakers and florists, who have invoked their religious opposition to gay marriage, to refuse cakes and flower arrangements to same-sex couples. On Monday, the court agreed to consider whether a bakery can deny services to gay couples. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in a similar case from New Mexico, where the state Supreme Court upheld a discrimination finding under state law against a wedding photographer who refused to shoot a same-sex ceremony.Court Passes on Gun RestrictionsThe court continued its streak of staying mum on the Second Amendment as it declined to review California\u2019s concealed-weapons restrictions. The court hasn\u2019t spoken on the Second Amendment since 2010, when it extended a 2008 opinion voiding the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handguns. Gun-rights activists saw the case as a possible path to expand the individual right to possess firearms that the justices first recognized in 2008. On Monday, Justice       Clarence Thomas,        joined by the newest justice, Trump appointee       Neil Gorsuch,        said the court should have taken the case.No News From Justice KennedyOne more thing: The was no announcement from Justice       Anthony Kennedy       on whether he plans to retire, following speculation he might do so as the court ended its session. Such a move would provide Mr. Trump with a big opportunity to drastically change the makeup of the Supreme Court, where Justice Kennedy, 80 years old, often serves as a swing vote between the court\u2019s liberal and conservative wings.Write to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 14:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-headlines-on-supreme-courts-busy-final-day-1498500890", "news_title": "Five Headlines on Supreme Court\u2019s Busy Final Day", "keywords": "supreme court,Donald Trump,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "When Saniya Jaffer arrived for a job interview at             Unilever        UL 0.13%       PLC\u2019s Englewood Cliffs, N.J., office last October, she was a finalist for a summer position in information technology. After three rounds of interviews and assessments, the Chicago-native was about to encounter the first human in the process.Before then, 21-year-old Ms. Jaffer had filled out a job application, played a set of online games and submitted videos of herself responding to questions about how she\u2019d tackle challenges of the job. The reason she found herself in front of a hiring manager? A series of algorithms recommended her.A radical hiring experiment is under way at the London-based maker of Dove soap and Axe deodorant. To diversify its candidate pool for early-career roles that are a fast track to management, Unilever has ditched resumes and traditional campus recruiting. Its new process relies on algorithms to sort applicants and targets young potential hires where they spend much of their time: their smartphones.The company has made more than 450 hires across the globe this way since the fall of 2016. Its experiment provides a glimpse of a tech-fueled future of recruiting in which humans write job descriptions and make the final decisions, but software and algorithms do the rest.             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\u2019s       Jet.com have begun using similar digital tools to hook young workers and broaden their candidate base.Since young people live their lives online, Unilever decided to use the internet to recruit beyond the eight or so schools where recruiters had traditionally sought hires, said       Mike Clementi,        a Unilever human-resources executive.\u201cWith all of the information readily available to us today about job candidates, why would we still choose to go to a small handful of college campuses?\u201d Mr. Clementi said.To get the word out about jobs, Unilever placed targeted advertisements on Facebook and career-advice sites such as WayUp and the Muse. Those who clicked on the ads were directed to a career site where they could apply for entry-level jobs and internships in just a few clicks, since Unilever pulls information from the candidate\u2019s LinkedIn profile to fill out the application. An algorithm scans those applications\u2014275,400 in all so far\u2014to surface candidates who meet a given role\u2019s requirements. The software weeds out more than half of the pool, according to Unilever spokeswoman Joelle Hutcheon.Candidates are then asked to play a set of 12 short online games designed to assess skills like concentration under pressure and short-term memory. The top third of those students or fewer are invited to submit video interviews on HireVue, through a website or app, answering questions about how they would respond to business challenges encountered on the job.At both steps, artificial-intelligence can filter anywhere from 60% to 80% of candidates, Ms. Hutcheon said. To determine which candidates are most likely to be successful at Unilever, the AI uses data points such as how quickly they respond to questions, their facial expressions and vocabulary.The first step involving direct human judgment is the last step, a final in-person interview with Unilever human-resources executives and managers. Last fall across the U.S. and Canada, around 300 candidates interviewed in person for 200 positions.Unilever says hiring has become faster and more accurate\u201480% of applicants who make it to the final round now get job offers, and a similar number accept\u2014and saved on recruiting costs, too, though Mr. Clementi wouldn\u2019t say how much. Applicants hailed from more than 2,600 colleges for positions in the U.S. and Canada, tripling the numbers of schools in its previous applicant pool.\u201cIt was definitely a weird feeling to know that robots are judging you,\u201d said Jordan Vesey, 21, a Pennsylvania State University student currently interning with Unilever\u2019s customer-development team in New Jersey.Andy McAllister, a Unilever director of supply chain, was skeptical that algorithms could successfully choose his interns. Having attended University of Maryland job fairs and other events for years, \u201cit felt like we were taking away the personal touch,\u201d he said.Mr. McAllister became a convert after meeting the program finalists last fall. The caliber of students visiting the Englewood Cliffs headquarters for interviews with Unilever employees was as strong, or stronger, as the candidates he had hand-selected the prior year, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous opportunity here,\u201d said Mr. McAllister, adding the changes prompted him to realize that the previous recruiting tactics left room for bias, since recruiters often compare applicants against their own experiences and unconsciously root for students they personally interview.Algorithms alone cannot remove bias in the hiring process, since humans choose the traits they want software to look for, said Jeanette Maister, whose London-based staffing firm             World Careers Network                   PLC recently began selling AI-enhanced recruiting services.Unilever spokeswoman Ms. Hutcheon said it\u2019s too early to say whether the new hiring practices correlate with stronger employees, adding that the company is closely tracking those hires\u2019 success. Still, the company is rolling out its digital recruiting program world-wide, hiring for entry-level roles this way from Brazil to Indonesia.\u201cThe new generation of matching technology is like Google in the world of Yellow Pages\u2014we had a way of finding things before, but Google found a way to do it better,\u201d said Frida Polli, chief executive of Pymetrics, which made the games used in Unilever\u2019s hiring.Write to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Radical Hiring Experiment: R\u00e9sum\u00e9s Are Out.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 14:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-unilevers-radical-hiring-experiment-resumes-are-out-algorithms-are-in-1498478400", "news_title": "In Unilever\u2019s Radical Hiring Experiment, Resumes Are Out, Algorithms Are In", "keywords": "unilever hiring,unilever jobs,Unilever,ULVR.LN,Andy McAllister,Frida Polli,Jeanette Maister,Joelle Hutcheon,Mike Clementi,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,recruitment,political,general news,career planning,general labor issues,food,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "Senate Republican leaders added a provision to their health-overhaul legislation on Monday that would impose a waiting period on coverage of six months for people who let their insurance lapse, a penalty aimed at keeping premiums affordable by making sure consumers maintain coverage when they\u2019re healthy.The six-month waiting period had initially been considered for the bill, which was released Thursday ahead of a likely vote this week, but was omitted. The health-insurance industry had been pressuring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to include the measure in any revisions as a way to help ensure people maintain continuous coverage, according to several people close to the insurance industry.Individuals who had a break in continuous coverage for 63 days or more in a prior year would have to wait six months before coverage begins, according to the change, but they wouldn\u2019t have to pay premiums during that time.The Senate GOP health bill would repeal large portions of the Affordable Care Act, including a requirement that most people have coverage or pay a penalty. Without that mandate, insurers have been concerned that young and healthy people, who help offset the costs of older and sicker consumers, wouldn\u2019t obtain coverage. That would push premium costs higher because the Senate legislation also requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions.The addition of the waiting period aims to fix that gap, mandating that people wait six months before getting coverage on the individual market. Republican leaders have told insurers on Friday that the waiting period would be inserted, according to several people familiar with the talks.It remains unclear whether the provision will meet the procedural rules that Senate leaders are using to push the bill through the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the usual 60.A House bill that passed last month would let insurers temporarily charge higher premiums to people who had a break in coverage. It would apply to individuals who had a lapse of 63 days or more. People with pre-existing conditions in those cases could be charged more for a year.The change comes as Mr. McConnell engages in high-stakes negotiations to get the votes needed to pass the bill this week. Senate GOP leaders have been working with Republican senators who have voiced concerns, focusing on those who say they won\u2019t vote for the bill as currently written\u2014Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin,       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and Dean Heller of Nevada.Republican leaders also are rejecting calls from some quarters to postpone Thursday\u2019s scheduled vote to allow for more deliberation. \u201cI am closing the door. We need to do it this week before double digit premium increases are announced for next year,\u201d Majority Whip       John Cornyn      \u00a0(R., Texas) tweeted on Monday.The leaders hope a vote this week will put pressure on lawmakers to wrap up their negotiations. Mr. Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, had previously said a vote was needed by the end of July.But Republicans for now remain short of the 50 votes they need to pass the bill, with some GOP senators, including Mr. Johnson, requesting more time to analyze it. Mr. Johnson is one of a group of four conservatives who said last week they couldn\u2019t support the bill in its current form.\u201cLike Obamacare, it relies too heavily on government spending, and ignores the role that the private sector can and should play,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an op-ed piece on Monday in the             New York Times.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it would release on Monday afternoon its analysis of the Senate health bill, assessing its likely impact on the federal budget and the number of uninsured.If the CBO finds many fewer people would have coverage under the Senate bill than under the ACA, that could complicate Senate leaders\u2019 effort to rally support among the GOP holdouts.The American Medical Association said Monday in a letter to Senate leaders that it opposes the health bill, saying the legislation would \u201cexpose low and middle income patients to higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care.\u201dThe Senate bill, like the House version, would provide tax credits to people who don\u2019t get insurance from their employer, and it would impose deeper cuts to Medicaid than the legislation that passed the House.The Senate bill also would let state governors obtain waivers enabling them to opt out of many of the ACA\u2019s insurance regulations and consumer protections, including the mandate that insurers cover specific benefits such as maternity care.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 14:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-senators-add-waiting-period-penalty-to-health-care-bill-1498500389", "news_title": "Republican Senators Add Waiting-Period Penalty to Health-Care Bill ", "keywords": " gop senators, health insurance, new provision, penalty,republican health care bill, waiting period,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "LISBON\u2014European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       defended the impact of the bank\u2019s stimulus policies on Europe\u2019s youth Monday, arguing that keeping interest rates low had helped create jobs and reduce inequality.The rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Draghi, at a university in Lisbon, comes at a sensitive time for the ECB, which is preparing to discuss how to start withdrawing policies such as negative interest rates and a \u20ac2.3 trillion ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying program.Pressure is mounting in Northern Europe for a policy change from Frankfurt, but Southern European countries face a different economic reality, with youth unemployment rates reaching up to 45%.Mr. Draghi argued that the ECB\u2019s easy-money stance helped address the problem of inequality in Europe, which he described as a \u201chighly destabilizing phenomenon.\u201d\u201cThe biggest cause of inequality is unemployment,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cTo the extent our policy fights unemployment, it fights inequality.\u201dWhile he didn\u2019t directly address when the central bank might start withdrawing its stimulus, he indicated it would be counterproductive to do so too soon.Tackling a question from Germany on how millennials could build up wealth in an environment of low interest rates, Mr. Draghi argued that those young people \u201cwho got a job thanks to our monetary policy\u201d might not be so opposed to low rates.German officials have attacked the ECB\u2019s easy-money policies in recent years, arguing that they harm savers and pensioners.\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that savings come from growth,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cInterest rates have to be low for growth to recover.\u201dWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 13:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/draghi-says-ecb-policy-has-helped-reduce-inequality-1498499845", "news_title": "Draghi Says ECB Policy Has Helped Reduce Inequality", "keywords": "draghi,draghi lisbon,draghi speech,ecb,ecb draghi,Mario Draghi,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BMW AG             is the latest auto maker to commit to new jobs at a U.S. factory following criticism from President       Donald Trump,        saying Monday it will create\u00a01,000 American jobs through 2021 as it works to boost its production of sport-utility vehicles in South Carolina.The jobs are part of a $600 million investment planned for the German auto maker\u2019s Spartanburg, S.C. factory.

But a revelatory exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum proves that Raphael\u2019s drawings sweep away any reservations we may harbor about his paintings. Whether working with ink or chalk, he never stopped searching for fresh ways of defining his restless vision. Raphael was always pushing himself, right up until the tragic moment in April 1520 when a high fever killed him at the age of 37.Raphael: The DrawingsAshmolean Museum  Through Sept. 3Even the first exhibit in \u201cRaphael: The Drawings,\u201d a probable self-portrait made in 1500-01 when he was only 17, is filled with mature confidence. Focusing on his head, Raphael defines its essential features with cool authority and summarizes his long, flowing hair in a series of linear flourishes. The teenager who had grown up in Urbino may well be celebrating his new status as an independent \u201cmaster.\u201d Yet there is nothing complacent about Raphael\u2019s draftsmanship. He had a deeply enquiring mind, and after encountering Michelangelo\u2019s work in Florence he became charged with dynamism. Even his studies for the Christ child (c. 1507) are energetic in the extreme, as he tries several times on the same sheet of paper to catch the vivacity of the infant\u2019s thrusting toes.The Ashmolean is lucky enough to own no less than 50 Raphael drawings, acquired in 1845 from a collection amassed by the portrait painter Sir Thomas Lawrence. But this exhibition has also borrowed 70 other drawings, most notably from the Albertina Museum in Vienna. Taken together, they testify to Raphael\u2019s obsession with sensuous female beauty, male musculature, maternal tenderness, childish energy, horrifying violence and, finally, a spellbound sense of wonder.An early ink drawing inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d (c. 1504-05) is handled with such assurance that we wonder why Raphael did not also become a prolific sculptor. His full-length chalk \u201cStudy for Adam in the Disputa\u201d (c. 1508-10) was made for an ambitious fresco he painted within the pope\u2019s private library at the Vatican Palace. But this drawing could easily have been produced in preparation for a major carving. Adam\u2019s highly developed physique is celebrated here, and yet he looks melancholy as well. Raphael was intensely aware of the aggressive and destructive urges lurking within humanity, and he explores them with alarming power in several studies for the \u201cMassacre of the Innocents.\u201d Drawn between 1509 and 1510, they concentrate on the crucial moment when mothers are still struggling to clasp, defend and hide their children from the assailants. But these beefy murderers will not be stopped, and their swords are seconds away from butchering the terrified infants\u2019 flesh.After gazing at these studies, we view Raphael\u2019s drawing of \u201cA seated mother embracing her child\u201d (c. 1512) in a more fearful way. The young woman looks very urgent as she clasps her little son. Raphael uses the folds in her drapery to emphasize the protective urgency of her gesture, and the child adds to this sense of alarm by grabbing her veil and pulling it over his head. Looking at these drawings, it is easy to imagine ourselves watching the artist himself hard at work. One sheet, alive with closely related studies of a seated male nude, shows Raphael changing his mind as the figure twists on a lump of rock and flings up his right arm in a defensive maneuver.This mood could hardly be more different from the sublime \u201cStudy for an angel\u201d (1515-16), where another seated figure raises both arms upward as if to bless an unseen gathering below. Raphael was adept at expressing joy, nowhere more vividly than in an astonishing \u201cStudy for the Three Graces\u201d (c. 1517-18) where his red chalk celebrates the women\u2019s erotic allure. But in a 1513-14 chalk study of \u201cA man carrying an older man on his back,\u201d the helpless figure is so heavy that he seems overwhelmingly burdensome, and his bearer appears to be on the verge of collapse.Raphael would doubtless have sympathized. By this time, he had been appointed architect of St. Peter\u2019s as well, and success threatened to overwhelm him with an excessive workload. But his prowess as a draftsman never stopped increasing, and the Ashmolean\u2019s show terminates with the finest drawing of all: \u201cThe heads and hands of two apostles\u201d (c. 1519-20). Made in preparation for a monumental painting, \u201cThe Transfiguration of Christ,\u201d it shows both men in a profound state of awe. Unable to believe the miracle he is witnessing, one of them touches his own body as if to convince himself of his physical reality. The other flings his fingers out into space, perhaps imagining how Christ himself would float through the air toward heaven. Raphael died very soon after the painting itself was completed, and his sudden loss seems even more deplorable when we visit this enthralling exhibition.\u2014Mr Cork\u2019s latest book, \u201cFace To Face: Interviews With Artists,\u201d was published by Tate in 2015.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 13:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/raphael-the-drawings-review-beyond-the-brush-1498498941", "news_title": "\u2018Raphael: The Drawings\u2019 Review: Beyond the Brush", "keywords": "arts in review, ashmolean museum,raphael, renaissance, the drawings,Ashmolean Museum,Raphael,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Retail and wholesale food seller             Supervalu Inc.\u2019s        SVU 2.48%       chief financial officer is resigning, the third industry executive to step down within the past week amid turmoil in the grocery industry.Bruce Besanko,        who also was the Minnesota-based grocer\u2019s chief operating officer, will step down July 5 \u201cto pursue an opportunity outside the company,\u201d Supervalu said.The grocery industry is struggling with increased competition and prolonged food-price deflation that has eroded company margins.

Mr. Moorman, a longtime freight railroad executive, will serve as co-CEO with Mr. Anderson through the end of the year, overseeing some ongoing Amtrak projects, including critical repair work at New York\u2019s Penn Station.Amtrak officials say that Mr. Anderson is the sort of leader Mr. Moorman had been tasked with recruiting when he arrived last year: a veteran of a competitive industry with the experience of passengers at its heart.\u201cHe literally took a company out of bankruptcy and made it one of the more efficient air carriers in the world,\u201d said       Anthony Coscia,        chairman of Amtrak\u2019s board of directors, referring to Mr. Anderson\u2019s career at Delta. \u201cThat\u2019s an accomplishment in an industry that\u2019s just as difficult if not more difficult than passenger rail.\u201dMr. Anderson has shown a knack for hard jobs and unconventional risks. He left the airline business after 14 years at Northwest Airlines to work in the health insurance industry, before returning to Delta and orchestrating its purchase of Northwest, his former employer. He sparred with Middle East air carriers over efforts to break into the U.S. market. Irked by rising fuel prices in 2012, Delta announced it had purchased an oil refinery near Philadelphia to produce its own fuel.In an interview, Mr. Moorman said that Mr. Anderson had learned of Amtrak\u2019s CEO search and volunteered to be considered. \u201cRichard stuck his hand up,\u201d Mr. Moorman said.At Amtrak, Mr. Anderson will come aboard a railroad under both operational and political pressures. Those include the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to slash the railroad\u2019s federal subsidy, and a rash of track failures at New York\u2019s Penn Station that have caused widespread delays and forced a summerlong program of repair work that has angered local politicians.Both New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       have threatened to withhold the rent due to Amtrak for their states\u2019 respective commuter railroads, because of the service disruptions caused by the track issues and repair work at the station, the busiest in the country.Mr. Anderson and Mr. Moorman will also be tasked with securing funding for the biggest item on Amtrak\u2019s wish list: the so-called Gateway Program. That project would add two new tracks beneath the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, allowing the railroad to perform a badly needed overhaul of the railroad\u2019s 106-year-old existing tunnels, and eventually to run more trains on the busy Northeast Corridor.\u201cIt is an honor to join Amtrak at time when passenger rail service is growing in importance in America,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in a news release.Mr. Anderson will begin work July 12. When Mr. Moorman leaves the co-CEO position at the end of the year, he will then become an adviser to the railroad, Amtrak said.Leading Delta for nine years, Mr. Anderson transformed the airline after its exit from bankruptcy into a leader in profitability. In 2016, Delta reported 209.6 billion miles flown by paying passengers, putting the airline in second place in the U.S., behind             American Airlines Group Inc.Mr. Anderson retired as CEO in May 2016, then served as executive chairman of the Delta board of directors.

The company said it chose Avis for its experience in quickly fixing and cleaning rental cars and for its presence across the U.S. and abroad, which can help Waymo expand its program to other cities.Avis, which also owns the rental-car service Zipcar, said that under the multiyear agreement, it is modifying some rental-car locations to park Waymo\u2019s vehicles and service them, including oil changes, tire rotations and cleaning.The companies didn\u2019t disclose financial terms of the deal or specify its length. The deal isn\u2019t exclusive, so Waymo can still establish partnerships with other fleet-management firms.Avis shares rose 14% Monday, as the deal gives the company a lead on other auto companies hoping to enter the business of managing driverless-car fleets, a service that could include everything from arranging for financing and insurance to\u00a0providing maintenance for fleet operators.Shares of rental-car rival             Hertz Global Holdings Inc.

More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today\u2019s UK position,\u201d Mr. Barnier tweeted.The U.K. government said in a 24-page paper that EU nationals will able to apply for permanent \u201csettled status\u201d in the U.K. for themselves and their families if they have lived in the U.K. for five years or more before a specified cutoff date yet to be agreed with the EU.The U.K. said the cutoff date will be no earlier than March 29, when it formally notified the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to leave, and no later than withdrawal itself, expected around March 2019.The U.K. said EU citizens will have as long as two years following Brexit to apply for residency. Settled status will confer on EU nationals the same rights as British citizens in areas including health care, education, employment and social-security benefits, the paper said.Temporary residency will be available to EU citizens who arrived less than five years before the cutoff date and to those who arrive during the two-year grace period following Brexit, the government said.The proposals are broadly in line with the EU\u2019s position on citizens\u2019 rights, but some specific areas of disagreement remain.EU officials said they remained concerned that the U.K. said the agreement would only be enforceable in U.K. law and there would be no role for the European Court of Justice, the EU\u2019s top court, in protecting citizens\u2019 rights. They said the U.K. Parliament is free to make or unmake laws and therefore guarantees could be undone later.The U.K. said however it would \u201cbe ready to make commitments in the Withdrawal Agreement which will have the status of international law.\u201dGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s point man on Brexit, said on Monday that while he welcomed the U.K. proposal, \u201ca number of limitations remain worrisome and will have to be carefully assessed.\u201d\u201cThe European Parliament will act to protect the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. and defend the integrity of EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its enforcement framework,\u201d he said, in reference to the ECJ.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'EU Urges \u2018More Ambition\u2019 on Citizens\u2019 Rights in Brexit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-brexit-negotiator-urges-u-k-to-show-more-ambition-on-eu-citizens-rights-1498496580", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Brexit Negotiator Urges U.K. to Show \u2018More Ambition\u2019 on EU Citizens\u2019 Rights", "keywords": "political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Citigroup Inc.       has hired a high-profile former             J.P.

The aim is to help strengthen the bank\u2019s corporate and investment-banking business in EMEA.Many of the board members already have roles at Citi. The bank hopes the board\u2019s creation will give members more opportunity to share ideas that the bank can take advantage of to help foster client relationships. Citi executives also sitting on the board include       James Cowles,        chief executive for EMEA, Manuel Falco, who oversees corporate and investment banking for the region, and       Luigi de Vecchi,        chairman of corporate and investment banking for continental Europe.The effort comes as Citi\u2019s business advising on M&A in the EMEA region is having a strong year. It is ranked atop the M&A league table for the region and last week it lured a senior investment banker from UBS Group AG to head up its EMEA M&A advisory business. The bank\u2019s business underwriting initial public offerings in EMEA also holds the top spot so far this year, according to Dealogic.Though currently based in London, Mr. Altenburg, 54 years old, brings with him deep knowledge of the German and surrounding markets. He was most recently Deutsche Bank\u2019s co-head of corporate finance in EMEA before retiring in late 2015.That decision followed the restructuring of the Germany-based bank\u2019s investment bank into two operations: one focused on investment banking and the other on trading and global markets. In March, Deutsche Bank moved to recombine the two units. Before joining Deutsche Bank, Mr. Altenburg had headed J.P. Morgan\u2019s operations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.The new advisory board highlights the challenges and opportunities that events such as Brexit and the presidential election in France present for investment banks in Europe. The uncertain fallout from the Britain-EU divorce talks threatens to dampen M&A activity in the U.K., while the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasts that the country\u2019s economic growth will slow to 1% in 2018 from 1.6% this year.At the same time, France\u2019s election in May of       Emmanuel Macron       as the country\u2019s new president promises a more pro-business government. A former investment banker, Mr. Macron is expected to push for lower taxes and measures that make it easier for employers to hire and fire. That plan was bolstered this month after Mr. Macron\u2019s party and its centrist ally won a majority in parliamentary elections.\u201cThe world is getting interesting around Brexit and where Europe is going to go with Macron,\u201d Citi\u2019s Mr. Falco said last week.In addition to Mr. Altenburg, Citi\u2019s new advisory board comprises Anders Borg, who served as Sweden\u2019s finance minister between 2006 and 2014; William Hague, former U.K. foreign secretary from 2010 and 2014; Mervyn King, a former longtime governor of the Bank of England, Charles-Henri Filippi, chairman of Citi France, Michel de Carvalho, chairman of Citi\u2019s private bank in EMEA, Alberto Verme, Citi\u2019s chairman of corporate and investment banking for EMEA and       Stefan Wintels,        head of Germany for Citi.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/citi-taps-former-senior-j-p-morgan-deutsche-bank-banker-for-advisory-role-1498496401", "news_title": "Citi Taps Former Senior J.P.

Mr. Advincula couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. It wasn\u2019t clear from the account of his testimony whether the captain was saying he was on the bridge of the vessel at the time.In response to the account, U.S. military officials said there had been no communication between the two ships before the collision and the cargo ship\u2019s loud collision alarm never sounded. They raised questions particularly about the commercial ship captain\u2019s reported contention that his ship tried to signal the warship for at least 10 minutes before hitting it.The officials said they were perplexed by the reported statement from the Crystal\u2019s captain. Tracking data indicates that the cargo ship continued sailing on essentially the same course for about another 30 minutes before turning around and returning to the position where the collision occurred.\u201cWe think the timing and the substance is a little odd,\u201d an official said of the report. \u201cThis is all what the investigations will uncover.\u201dNavy officials have said they aim to complete initial assessments of what happened by the end of the summer.Along with the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, Japanese Coast Guard and Japan Transport Safety Board are investigating the incident.Representatives for all have said they won\u2019t comment or speculate on the cause of the collision.A spokesman for Nippon Yusen K.K., which chartered the Crystal during the recent journey, declined to comment.The reported account from Mr. Advincula is consistent with speculation from some former captains of commercial and military ships who have said the Fitzgerald may have breached a maritime regulation of giving way to other ships approaching on the starboard, or right, side.Other experts say there may have been other complicating factors, including insufficient crew on watch on either or both ships and the density of ship traffic in the region where the incident occurred.Andrew Kinsey,        a captain who spent 23 years in the U.S. Merchant Marine and Naval Reserve, described the area around the crash site as one of the world\u2019s most densely used shipping lanes. He said coordination between commercial and military vessels is made harder because Navy vessels don\u2019t transmit information to other ships about their location.Around 400 vessels a day pass through the region where the collision took place, around 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, according to the Japanese Coast Guard.Hajime Yamamoto,        a navigation safety officer in the Japanese Coast Guard, said the region where the collision occurred is busiest between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. because cargo ships aim to arrive in nearby Tokyo Bay for unloading early in the morning.Between 2007 and 2016, 30 collisions occurred in the region, he said, including the collision of two cargo ships in September 2013 that killed six sailors.On Tuesday, the U.S. Seventh Fleet will hold a memorial service in its home port of Yokosuka for the seven sailors who died in a sleeping cabin after the Crystal rammed the Fitzgerald. The collision is one of the worst incidents in recent U.S. Navy history.The 20 Filipino crew members of the Crystal were unharmed.Details of Mr. Advincula\u2019s report on the collision were first reported by Reuters.\u2014Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com, Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Captain Says Ship Warned U.S. Vessel.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 13:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/freighter-captain-says-u-s-destroyer-ignored-warnings-1498494443", "news_title": "Freighter Captain Says U.S. Destroyer Ignored Warnings ", "keywords": "acx crystal,japan,navy,ship collision,shipping,u.s.,uss fitzgerald,Navy,Ronald Advincula,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport"}, {"content": "Anthem Inc.        ANTM 0.44%       said it believes that the Senate Republicans\u2019 health bill will bolster the individual insurance market, an endorsement for the legislation as many other insurers have suggested it could undermine the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.In a statement, Anthem said it believed the bill \u201cwill markedly improve the stability of the individual market and moderate premium increases,\u201d because it allots billions to help stabilize the markets, eliminates a tax on health insurance plans and works on \u201caligning premium subsidies with premium costs.\u201dAnthem said it would work with \u201cour government partners\u2026to navigate the challenges the current bill proposes to the Medicaid program,\u201d saying it is important \u201cto achieve the necessary funding\u201d and access to health services for recipients.The statement didn\u2019t mention a feature of the bill that many insurers said would strongly undermine the individual market\u2014it dumps the mandate for people to have insurance, which insurers say is important to getting young, healthy people into the market. Many insurers say that the bill\u2019s other provisions, including the stability funding, aren\u2019t strong enough to cancel out the impact of getting rid of the ACA\u2019s coverage requirement.Responding to those concerns, Republicans on Monday added a requirement that people who have a break in their coverage must wait six months to buy a new plan. That provision is designed to encourage people to maintain continuous coverage.The big insurer\u2019s views on the bill will likely be closely watched because it is a major player both in Medicaid and in the ACA marketplaces. The company has already announced plans to withdraw from the exchanges next year in three states\u2014Indiana, Wisconsin and Ohio\u2014moves that quickly became talking points for both Republicans and Democrats in the battle over health legislation. Anthem has said it is making its exchange decisions on a state-by-state basis.Anthem\u2019s withdrawals appear to leave counties in both Ohio and Indiana poised to be without exchange insurers next year, some of the approximately 47 counties at risk, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation and state regulators.In a sign of how fluid the insurance marketplace situation remains, Washington\u2019s insurance regulator announced that two insurers,             Molina Healthcare Inc.       and BridgeSpan, a unit of Cambia Health Solutions, will offer exchange plans in Klickitat County, the state\u2019s sole remaining county that had appeared at risk of having no marketplace plans available in 2018.\u201cEvery county needs coverage and today, we have that,\u201d said       Mike Kreidler,        the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, in a statement.The movement in Washington shows how state regulators, on the front lines as some insurers have announced plans to pull out of the exchanges, are working behind the scenes to fill bare spots on their maps. Earlier, Washington\u2019s regulator announced that Premera Blue Cross would remain in Grays Harbor, another county that had been at risk of lacking an exchange insurer. Tennessee also was able to get an insurer to offer plans in the Knoxville region after             Humana Inc.       said it would leave.Even as some insurers pull back, others are expanding their exchange footprints\u2014notably             Centene Corp.       and Oscar Insurance Corp., a high-profile startup.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 12:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-says-senate-health-bill-will-bolster-individual-insurance-market-1498495265", "news_title": "Anthem Says Senate Health Bill Will Bolster Individual Insurance Market ", "keywords": " aca, ahca,health bill, health care bill,health insurers,insurance marketplaces, obamacare, senate bill, senate health bill,Anthem,ANTM,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       lashed out on Monday at his predecessor over his handling of Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the U.S. election and denied any collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.Mr. Trump, writing in a series of statements on Twitter, also said he didn\u2019t try to obstruct the federal investigation into the matter.A former Obama administration responded on Monday that \u201cthe administration\u2019s attacks on President Obama\u2019s response to Russia cyber meddling is a transparent effort to distract from the terrible impact of their ACA [Affordable Care Act] repeal bill.\u201dMr. Trump wrote that \u201cunder a magnifying glass, they have zero \u2018tapes\u2019 of T people colluding.

Mr. Comey has testified that Mr. Trump said he hoped Mr. Comey would back off from investigating former National Security Adviser       Michael Flynn.Mr. Flynn is one of the Trump associates whose actions are part of the federal investigation of various conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition period, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

Javits Convention Center in Manhattan through\u00a0Tuesday. The annual show, considered one of the largest gourmet-trade events in the world, is organized by the New York-based Specialty Food Association.The 63-year-old event attracts a dizzying array of about 2,600 exhibitors from 46 countries. Their goal: To convince the estimated 25,000 attendees\u2014mainly buyers for gourmet and other food markets\u2014to carry their products. The show is closed to the general public.For the most part, vendors showcase standard gourmet fare. Think imported cheeses, high-end olive oils and chocolates of all kinds, from bars to truffles. The show also has acquired a reputation for featuring quirky treats that may, or may not, be the next big thing in food.Like those protein bars made from crickets. They come courtesy of Nutribug, a British company that touts the health benefits of eating insects, which indeed are high in protein and low in carbohydrates.Such bug-derived foods could be \u201cvery popular with people trying to bulk up on muscle,\u201d said David Binns, a managing partner with the company on hand for the show.The stakes can be high in this world of fancy food. U.S. sales of gourmet products climbed by 15% during the last two years, reaching $127 billion in 2016, according to the Specialty Food Association.But to have a shot at retail success, the makers of gourmet products often feel compelled to have a presence at the Fancy Food Show, where exhibit space starts at $3,400 for the smallest booth, about 100 square feet, and can quadruple that for larger spaces. Admission starts at $55.For attendees, the event isn\u2019t just about considering what to carry in their stores. It is something of a foodie haven, an all-day noshing affair in which one could make a meal of all those samples\u2014cricket-enhanced protein bars included. (They taste pretty much like any standard protein bar. Any \u201cbuggy\u201d flavor is masked by other ingredients.)Ken Blanchette, a sourcing director for online grocer FreshDirect, says he comes especially to spot trends. A big one this year, he notes, is a new wave of Asian products, from spicy Korean sauces to an organic ramen mix.Mr. Blanchette also says he\u2019s careful about overindulging during the show. \u201cI don\u2019t come to eat.

He\u2019s currently trying to learn Mandarin and piano by setting aside 30 minutes a day to work on each. He says his progress has been \u201cslow and steady. It\u2019s just a matter of time under tension equals results.\u201dMr. Cena recently talked about \u201cAmerican Grit,\u201d his return to the wrestling ring, and his philosophy of time management. An edited transcript follows.How do you find the time to juggle TV, movies and wrestling?I like to do all the stuff I\u2019m doing. I learned at a very young age that there\u2019s no substitute for hard work. So the cool thing is I don\u2019t have to do anything I don\u2019t want to do, but I\u2019m also getting a lot of opportunities to do a lot of stuff that I do like. I say yes to everything and then figure it out later.Is there a connection between all the things you do?I\u2019ve spent 15 years as a storyteller. I\u2019m in the storytelling business. So when I choose to be a part of a movie, it\u2019s because I like the story. That\u2019s why I like doing \u201cAmerican Grit\u201d so much. I get to oversee all the challenges and try to draw things out of these people to help them right their wrongs, to help them weave a great end to a wonderful story. So when you talk comedy or drama or action or WWE or \u201cAmerican Grit,\u201d it\u2019s all based off of stories.How did you end up doing the voice of the bull in the animated adaptation of the kids book \u201cThe Story of Ferdinand\u201d?The voice-only stuff was great. It\u2019s a lot of long hours and it\u2019s a labor of love and I love the story. It\u2019s about someone, Ferdinand, the bull, who is perceived to be something but is so much more than just what it appears on the surface. I\u2019ve struggled with this a lot in my career at WWE. I\u2019m well aware of the stereotypes and preconceived notions that folks that don\u2019t know what we do have about our business.So what\u2019s going to happen when you go on \u201cSmackDown Live\u201d on July 4th?I don\u2019t know what to expect and that\u2019s why \u201cSmackDown Live\u201d is awesome and WWE is awesome. This is the longest I think I\u2019ve been away healthy from the WWE in 15 years, so I\u2019m ready to get back. I\u2019m very, very excited about Independence Day.You and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson had some epic wrestling battles, but I\u2019ve read that the animosity became real outside the ring. What kind of relationship do you two have?The Rock has always been an inspiration in my career. He helped me very early on without knowing it\u2014he really kind of poked the bear so to speak, so he couldn\u2019t help but get agitated.

It is demanding a series of moves to boost shareholder return, including a review of the Swiss food giant\u2019s \u20ac24.4 billion, or about $27.4 billion, stake in French cosmetics firm L\u2019Or\u00e9al.Nestl\u00e9 hasn\u2019t commented specifically on its intentions but said in a brief statement Monday that it \u201cremained committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value.\u201d The company\u2019s newly installed chief executive,       Mark Schneider,        has made a number of big moves in recent months amid flagging growth.Shares of Nestl\u00e9 rose 4% Monday after news of Mr. Loeb\u2019s investment, adding pressure on Mr. Schneider to take action. Shares of L\u2019Or\u00e9al were up 3.9%.Nestl\u00e9 and France\u2019s Bettencourt family, heirs of L\u2019Or\u00e9al founder Eug\u00e8ne Schueller, held roughly equal stakes in the cosmetics giant for decades. In 1974, the family sought an outside investor amid fears at the time over French government nationalization.For almost as long, the two companies have resisted pressure from analysts and investors to decouple. Critics complain the two don\u2019t share common strategic goals and would be better untethered.In 2014, L\u2019Or\u00e9al bought back 8% of shares held by the Swiss company in exchange for cash and part of their dermatologic joint venture, Galderma. As part of its partial retreat, Nestl\u00e9 gave up one of its three board seats, but continued to own 23% of L\u2019Or\u00e9al. All that raised new questions about whether Nestl\u00e9 would remain a major shareholder much longer.In recent quarters, L\u2019Or\u00e9al has pulled away from competitors in terms of organic sales growth by investing in the marketing of its brands, which include Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9, Kiehl\u2019s and Garnier. But the investment has affected margins growth, which has lagged behind historical levels. Many of its rivals, meanwhile, have been cutting costs to boost profits.If Nestl\u00e9 does move to rid itself of L\u2019Or\u00e9al shares or further cut its stake, there are several ways it could do that. An outright sale might be difficult, considering the size of its stake, which is currently worth $27.4 billion\u2014a big price tag for noncontrolling ownership.Although Nestl\u00e9 has an agreement with the Bettencourt family setting rules on what it can do with its stake, some of those provisions expired in 2014. Nestl\u00e9, for example, no longer needs to offer the shares first to the Bettencourts if it decides to sell them.Nestl\u00e9 could offer the L\u2019Or\u00e9al shares in exchange for Nestl\u00e9 ones, as per Mr. Loeb\u2019s suggestion. Or, a more likely option, L\u2019Or\u00e9al could simply buy back Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stake.To do so, it may need to sell some of its shares of French drugmaker             Sanofi SA      . L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Sanofi stake was worth about \u20ac10.4 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Chief Executive       Jean-Paul Agon       has long said that the Sanofi investment, which the company took on after merging pharmaceutical business Synth\u00e9labo with Sanofi in 1999, is financial, not strategic.L\u2019Or\u00e9al spokespeople declined to comment on the company\u2019s intentions. A spokeswoman for Sanofi also declined to comment.\u201cFinancially, if L\u2019Or\u00e9al wants to buy it all, they can afford to do it,\u201d said Marion Boucheron, an analyst at financial-services firm Raymond James. \u201cThe question is whether it\u2019s in their best interest strategically, rather than investing in other assets.\u201dWrite to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Nestl\u00e9 and L\u2019Or\u00e9al Have Long History, Too Long for Loeb.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 12:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-third-points-nestle-move-could-affect-loreal-1498494338", "news_title": "Third Point Move Could Lead to Nestl\u00e9-L\u2019Or\u00e9al Decoupling", "keywords": "daniel loeb,l'oreal,nestle,sanofi,share sales,third point,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,L'Oreal,OR.FR,LRLCY,Daniel Loeb,Mark Schneider,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,cosmetics,toiletries,beverages,tobacco,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,beauty,personal care,alternative investments,business,consumer services,consumer goods,make-up products,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances,specialized consumer services"}, {"content": "There is an understandable temptation to compare one government program to another.       Walid Gellad       does as much in \u201cMedicare Could Learn a Thing or Two From the VA\u201d (op-ed, June 15), in which he argues Medicare should adopt a prescription-drug system specifically tailored for the Department of Veterans Affairs. His piece illustrates the difficulty with those comparisons.For starters, Medicare is much bigger than the VA, covering approximately 42 million seniors and people with disabilities compared with the roughly 8.4 million people covered by the VA. And many of those people covered by the VA have outside plans to cover their prescription-drug costs. For example, a third of those in the VA system have plans under Medicare\u2019s popular Part D program, according to a 2016 survey of veterans\u2019 health coverage.The VA negotiates special discounts with the manufacturers of prescription drugs that are meant to recognize veterans\u2019 sacrifice for our country. The discounts were never intended to be extended to the broader public. If they are, manufacturers will face financial pressure to end them, resulting in higher prices for the VA and the veterans that agency serves. The Government Accountability Office confirmed that view the last time Congress considered this change.The VA and Medicare are two very different programs. Applying the rules of one program to the other could complicate health coverage for millions of Americans covered by either.Anthony PrincipiSt. Michaels, Md.Mr. Principi is a former secretary of Veterans Affairs.The VA operates a single, national formulary and, as a result, limits patient choice, with the government deciding for all VA beneficiaries which medicines it will and will not cover. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have an average of 22 plans to choose from in each region in 2017.One analysis found importing VA-style price controls for Part D would result in a 25% reduction in the number of new treatments available, leading to a nearly two-year decrease in life expectancy for future beneficiaries. Since Part D began, life expectancy for beneficiaries has increased 3.3 years, surveys show about 90% beneficiary satisfaction, and there is evidence of robust negotiation occurring within the program.It\u2019s no wonder over half of veterans get non-VA supplemental coverage, like Part D, to access their medicines. Why consider changes to Part D that would reduce choice?Lori M. ReillyPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of AmericaWashingtonDrug companies large and small have to offer the VA a price at least 24% lower than the best private-sector price. Excluding some drugs lets the VA get even bigger discounts, but such limits come at a great cost to patients. A study by economist Frank Lichtenberg found that only 20% of drugs approved since 2000 were covered by the VA, and that the limited access was associated with lower life expectancy over age 65 compared with Medicare beneficiaries. The innovation gap has increased since.A recent Avalere Health study forum revealed that \u201cThe VA national formulary covers 54% of drugs available on the California public employee retiree plan formulary, including 46% of brand drugs (102 of 222) and 61% of generic drugs (174 of 287).\u201d And it covers 50% fewer medicines than most state Medicaid plans.The VA represents 2% of total drug spending. Since new medicines are what reduce the total cost of care and mortality, Mr. Gellad\u2019s idea would darken the lives of millions.Robert GoldbergCenter for Medicine in the Public InterestNew York", "news_time": "2017-06-26 12:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-extend-va-drug-pricing-formulary-1498493961", "news_title": "Don\u2019t Extend VA Drug Pricing, Formulary ", "keywords": "Department of Veterans Affairs,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,veterans affairs department,letters,routine general news,pharmaceuticals,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicare"}, {"content": "As representatives of the Plan Sponsor Council of America, we\u2019d like to respond to \u201cRoth vs. Traditional 401(k)s\u201d (Journal Report, June 12). It is true that if investors save 10% pretax and continue to save 10% after switching to a Roth 401(k) because of a \u201crule-of-thumb\u201d regardless of tax treatment, then they will be saving more. But they also will have less net pay every week. For the majority of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck, that may not be affordable. Individuals who are in a lower tax bracket and most likely to benefit from a Roth account may need to cut contribution rates to maintain a certain monthly income.Among 401(k) plans that offer Roth as a choice, 80% of participants choose pretax contributions over Roth. Unfortunately, there is discussion in Washington focused on limiting or taking away that choice and requiring the use of a posttax Roth. Those who choose Roth must have adequate discretionary income to boost current savings rates. Surveys consistently show that more than half of Americans, including many who save in employer plans, spend every penny of take-home pay. While many could benefit from electing Roth contributions, it is really only those with adequate disposable income who are free to choose that option. Many Americans may suffer if pretax contributions are curtailed\u2014either in reduced savings, or worse, a decision to stop saving.Ken RaskinNew YorkStephen McCaffreyBrooklyn, N.Y.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 12:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/best-plan-depends-on-individuals-situation-1498493828", "news_title": "Best Plan Depends on Individual\u2019s Situation", "keywords": "political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,letters,routine general news"}, {"content": "Regarding your editorial \u201cA Terrorist\u2019s Guide to New York City\u201d (June 19): New York City Democratic City Councilman Daniel Garodnick will undermine public trust with his sponsorship of an absolutely ridiculous bill that will only aid terrorists.

But if she had lost, they would have been there for weeks talking about this. This would have been the greatest defeat of American politics.DAVID ASMAN       : Hello, everybody. Welcome to the \u201cJournal Editorial Report.\u201d I\u2019m David Asman, in this week for       Paul Gigot.That was President       Trump       taking a victory lap on Wednesday night at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa following two big special elections wins this week for Republicans. Karen Handel staved off a strong challenge from Democrat       Jon Ossoff       in a closed watched race for HHS Secretary       Tom Price\u2019s       seat in Georgia. And in South Carolina, Ralph Norman held on to White House Budget Director       Mick Mulvaney\u2019s       seat for the GOOP.Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi,        under fire from a lot of fellow Democrats, downplaying this week\u2019s losses as well as special election defeats earlier this year in Montana and Kansas. Take a listen.HOUSE MINIORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI:By all accounts, if you\u2019re a Republican, this is not good news to you, tonight\u2019s pyrrhic victory, two pyrrhic victories, because it shows where the vulnerability is on the Republican side.ASMAN: Joining the panel this week, \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist and deputy editor,       Dan Henninger      ; columnist,       Bill McGurn      ; editorial board member,       Mary Kissel      l; and assistant editorial page editor,       James Freeman.Dan, a lot of fun stuff to talk about. But I love Nancy Pelosi saying it was a pyrrhic victory. Oh, wait, it was four pyrrhic victories. Maybe you can have one pyrrhic victory, but four in a row, that\u2019s kind of hard to take.DAN HENNINGER: Yeah, the old saying goes, David, four more victories like this and we are undone.Why is Nancy Pelosi, a savvy politician, saying such ridiculous things? And I think the reason is because she has nothing else to offer. What they have been doing in all of these elections is teeing it up on a national election, a referendum on Donald Trump. And since the election, the Democrats, whether in Washington or anywhere else, have been running solely against Donald J. Trump. What we discovered in Georgia, that\u2019s not working. The Democrats have to come up with something else, and at the moment, it is well known, they don\u2019t have much of anything else in terms of substance or policy.ASMAN: And, Bill, the question is whether they need somebody else, and particularly somebody other than Nancy Pelosi. Donald Trump is having a field day. He came out with a tweet about Nancy Pelosi, kind of pleading with her to stay. Let\u2019s put up the tweet if we can. Essentially, please let -- \u201cI certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P. out, that would be very bad for the Republican Party. Please let \u2018Cryin\u2019 Chucky; stay!\u201dBILL MCGURN: He set up a race as special election. The arrogance of the Democrats running a guy who didn\u2019t even live in the district and so forth, you\u2019re going to get Donald Trump gloating when he\u2019s vindicated. He\u2019s going to fun with this.In fairness, I say Nancy Pelosi herself isn\u2019t the problem. And if you look at how they played her in the election, the Republicans, it was San Francisco values. So the problem, I think, the Democrats have so twofold. On the one hand, they have liberal values that are not the values of most Americans. America is a center-right country. So it doesn\u2019t play outside San Francisco.Second, what\u2019s their strategy? Resistance. It\u2019s just not -- it\u2019s not a persuasive thing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone, maybe -- well, Jon Ossoff doesn\u2019t live in the district --I was going to say, whether there\u2019s anybody who cares about the Russian investigation of Trump. And if you look at the -- if you take Donald Trump and       Hillary Clinton       and Nancy Pelosi out of the equation, the Democrats lost a thousand seats.That\u2019s not because Republicans are geniuses. It\u2019s because people saying what you\u2019re offering is not for me.ASMAN: There is also the attack on the brand of Trump. They thought that was a winning thing even though that brand, by the way, the Trump name has made billions of dollars for the Trump family over the years. It was part of the reason he was elected. But now some Democrats are having second thoughts about beating up on the brand itself. Democrat       Tim Ryan,        who, we should mention, is looking for Nancy Pelosi\u2019s job, came out with an interesting comment saying that, essentially, the Democratic Party is now more toxic than Donald Trump, to which you say?MARY KISSEL: To which I say, again, it\u2019s not just the brand. It\u2019s the ideas that are behind the brand. And essentially, the Democratic Party is a party of coastal liberal elites. A third of the House delegation is from New York, California and Massachusetts. And I\u2019m waiting personally for the Democratic Party to rediscover its inner       Bill Clinton,        you know, the pragmatist, the guy who doesn\u2019t just resist, who is genial, who identifies with average Americans, who doesn\u2019t just want to spend money all of the time, who could get on board with something like welfare reform or a pragmatic fix to Obamacare. I just don\u2019t see those people in the Democratic Party anymore. Jon Ossoff tried to go there late in the campaign in Georgia --and nobody believed him.ASMAN: Well, where do there go? By the way, the four losses they\u2019ve had, James, two of those candidates, the Democratic candidates, where on the left of the spectrum, two were trying to convince people they were moderates, so they don\u2019t succeed no matter which ideology they try to use.JAMES FREEMAN: I think they do want to rebrand. They want a more moderate image. But they do have the challenge. And the reason Nancy Pelosi is still the leader and the public face is she\u2019s the greatest fundraiser in political history outside of presidential candidates.ASMAN: That\u2019s true.FREEMAN: More than 500 million bucks over the years. She has pulled money out cities like this, L.A. and San Francisco. So are they really going to turn away from that funding constituency more towards a voting constituency? And that\u2019s not an easy thing to do.Well, Dan, one point is this may stop the obstructionism. At least the Democrats seem to realize that just being obstructionist, having no message, just being anti-Trump doesn\u2019t win elections.HENNINGER: Yeah, it might at the Senate level. I think they are pretty dug in over in the House. But at the Senate, you know, moving forward to tax bill, it\u2019s possible that some of the Democrats that are on the bubble, like Manchin in West Virginia,       Heidi Heitkamp,        in North Dakota,       Joe Donnelly       in Indiana, may decide they have to move towards the center. The difficulty there is, the economy is strengthening, and if the Republicans do pass the tax bill, give another booster shot to the economy, the Democrats, unless we have been saying here in the past five minutes, come up with something stronger, they could have a really difficult time in 2018.ASMAN: Bill, very quickly, incentives matter, whether you\u2019re talking economics or politics, and the one incentive that politicians have above all others is getting reelected.MCGURN: Right.ASMAN: If they try obstructionism and it doesn\u2019t get them elected or reelected, they are going to turn to something else.MCGURN: Yeah, although I think, look, something like 95 percent of guys get elected. Now we have been so polarized that a lot of people are in semi-safe seats and so forth. Mrs. Pelosi, she doesn\u2019t have to change. Her seat is safe. It\u2019s just not going to play in Iowa. They freaked out over a guy running in the mayoral primary who was pro-life in Omaha. This is not a party that is open to diversity.ASMAN: Very interesting task.When we come back, as the GOP tries to push ahead with its agenda, Senate Republicans releasing their health care bill. Details coming next.SENATE MAJORITY LEADER       MITCH MCCONNELL      : Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are, for our constituents, for our states and for our country.ASMAN: Senate Republicans released a much-anticipated discussion draft of the health care plan on Thursday seven weeks after the House passed their own plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. So what\u2019s inside the Senate\u2019s bill and how does it differ from the House\u2019s version?Let\u2019s ask Tevi Troy. He is the president of American Health Policy Institute and the former deputy secretary and health and Human Services under President       G.W. Bush.Tevi, first of all, how would it change Obamacare?FORMER HHS SECTRETARY TEVI TROY: David, thanks for having me on. In contrast to Nancy Pelosi, as you say, what they want is not any anything less. They want an actual victory. How this would change in contrast to Obamacare is it would reduce taxes and reduce spending and reduce mandates and reduce the overall size of the deficit and, hopefully, reduce premiums, thereby, requiring the government to subsidize less. That\u2019s the overall big picture of the bill. Let\u2019s hope it works out once they start to release details.ASMAN: One thing it would not reduce, and some it\u2019s critics have pointed to this, some conservative critics, is money for insurance companies. There\u2019s an extra $50 billion, by my account, over next five years help for insurers that are going to be forced to continue to pay for folks with preexisting conditions, right?TROY: Yeah, I think you\u2019re talking about the Stabilization Fund.ASMAN: Yeah.TROY: The fear is that the insurers will continue to exit the market as they have been doing in the Affordable Care Act. We just saw Anthem recently. So the problem is that the insurers are very nervous about the markets remaining stable and so they are putting this money into make sure the insurers stay in the game for now.ASMAN: Is it fair for critics, whether on the left or right, to call this aa bail-out of insurers?TROY: You know, politics being politics, you\u2019re definitely going to get some of that. But I think the overall goal, if you can get the markets stabilized, then over time, you won\u2019t need to provide any additional money for insurers, but they can get their money through premiums or reduced that so people are incentivized to purchase them on their own again without subsidies.ASMAN: The dirty little secret about Obamacare, among others, was the fact that Medicaid was used, an expanded version of Medicaid, to ensure people who couldn\u2019t be insured directly within the Obamacare system. What\u2019s happening with Medicaid in the Senate bill?TROY: That\u2019s a really good point. We\u2019ve had a little bit of a game where we\u2019ve had people in Medicaid and expanded Medicaid be cynical, kind of gets rid of that fiction, if you\u2019re in Medicaid or you\u2019re in Medicaid as it is, and other people are supposed to get tax credits to get them into the individual market. Also, the big changes in Medicaid are coming a little later, so governors can deal with it. And you\u2019re having a little more experimentation by governors so governors can be innovative in having to design the system as they see fit and not necessary what the federal government wants to do.ASMAN: Then there are things that are not that big in terms of money, but have a lot of significance for social conservatives, things like eliminate at least for one year, the money for Planned Parenthood, right?TROY: Yeah. It\u2019s only for one year, so it\u2019s a symbolic victory for Republicans, but there\u2019s divisions within Republicans. Again, the game is to get to 50 Republican votes. They have no Democrats working with them. They\u2019ve got to make sure they get 50 Republicans on board, and I think the Planned Parenthood compromises a way of getting the symbolic support that they want, but it\u2019s not necessarily going to change the game long-term for Planned Parenthood.ASMAN: The key political factor in what they want to do is lower premiums. That\u2019s the thing that hurts Americans most. In fact, premiums have gone up, deductions, Medicaid has gone up more percentage-wise, but will this do anything to get premiums and deductions down?TROY: The theory is that it will. We have some evidence in that the CMS Actuary, part of HHS, but a non-political part of HHS, scored the House bill, which is similar but not the same, and said that would reduce the growth size of premiums, reduce the amount of premiums, and so that is a good thing. If you reduce premiums, you don\u2019t have to subsidize as much. But you never know how these things are going to play out until the legislation is actually written and signed by the president and implemented.ASMAN: There\u2019s another thing. Since a lot of doctors tell me that they are thinking of quitting being doctors because of malpractice laws are so generous in this country. England has ways to prevent that, loser pays and stuff, that maybe won\u2019t be a part of this. Anything in the Senate bill that would adjust frivolous lawsuits brought as malpractice suits?TROY: You\u2019re talking about malpractice reform, which is a part of the Republican plank overall. It\u2019s not something they could get in this bill because of the 60-vote threshold. It\u2019s not something that would fit with the so-called budget reconciliation rules, or as I call them, the budget reconciliation limitations. That\u2019s something that Republicans are going to continue to pursue, but it\u2019s a very heavy lift as the trial lawyers are big funders as the Democratic Party and so they\u2019re not going to give up on that easily.ASMAN: Democrat and Republican, they own the Beltway, let\u2019s be honest about it. It\u2019s a tough haul.All right, selling insurance across state lines, on the House side, they said is going to have to wait for another -- another version of an Obamacare clean-up before we get it done. Does the Senate address this at all?TROY: It\u2019s the same problem, David. It\u2019s the budget reconciliation limitation that don\u2019t allow them to do something that\u2019s not within the budget context. That\u2019s not going to be in there.However, I think that\u2019s something that could be attached to a piece of legislation down the road, a must-pass piece of legislation, and put it up for a vote and see if you can get it that way. So, I think, \u201cThe Journal\u201d editorial said this is not a free market utopia, but I think this is a step and then they can do additional steps down the road, given the regulatory powers they have, in trying to do it.ASMAN: So this is not the end, but it\u2019s the beginning of the end, right?TROY: Perhaps the end of the beginning.ASMAN: Tevi Troy, great to see you. Thank you very much for coming in. I appreciate it.TROY: Thank you.ASMAN: When we come back, Republicans are facing a long, hot summer as they try to deliver on some key campaign promises. So from the health care overhaul to tax reform, can they count on members of their own party to move their agenda forward?HOUSE SPEAKER       PAUL       RYAN: It\u2019s not enough just to pass a bill that has Obamacare repeal in the title. We\u2019ve got to actually have legislation that fixes the underlying problem.SEN.       RAND PAUL      : I just didn\u2019t run on Obamacare lite. I didn\u2019t run on replacing it with more government programs. I didn\u2019t run on allowing the death spiral of Obamacare to continue just to subsidize with taxpayer money. I think we can do better than this. And my hope is not to defeat the bill but to make the bill better.ASMAN: That was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, just one of the Republicans opposing the health care plan that was released this week. As the GOP tries to move forward this summer on two campaign promises, repealing and replacing Obamacare and overhauling the tax system, can they count on support from their own members?We are back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn, Mary Kissel and James Freeman.Mary, it\u2019s not going to be a slam-dunk?KISSEL: It\u2019s a do-or-die moment for the Republican Party. Either they are going to repeal or replace Obamacare with something better or they\u2019re going to have to prop up Obamacare because the exchanges are failing and, politically, you cannot afford that millions of people in American without access to insurance.Look, Donald Trump is going to do a deal. If he doesn\u2019t do a deal with the right, he is going to do the deal with the left.ASMAN: That\u2019s right.KISSEL: And health care is going to be key to the tax reform.ASMAN: And, Bill, the president has already begun to sell the plan and he\u2019s talking nice about some of his Republican critics, which he hasn\u2019t always done. Let\u2019s play a little snipped of an interview he had an \u201cFOX & Friends\u201d on Friday.PRESIDENT TRUMP: They are also four good guys, and four friends of mine, I think they will probably get there. We will have to see. But I think we will get there. We have four very good people that -- it\u2019s not that they are opposed. They\u2019d like to get certain changes and we will see if we can take care of that.ASMAN: We are going to take care of that, we can make a deal.MCGURN: Look, he\u2019s the deal-maker and you don\u2019t get a deal by trashing the people that you want to persuade to support you.I think Republicans have to realize this is an Irish choice, not perfect -- verses something that is probably going to be a lot worse, like -- the alternative is not a better bill. It\u2019s not a better bill. I think that relates to the elections later.You know, we talk about the symbolism or the politics of the moments. At the end of the day, the Republican\u2019s fortunes are going to be made on whether ordinary people, who are now struggling in this economy, feel more opportunity and better about the future, and that means lower premiums for a lot of people, and it means tax cuts, you know, that help revive the economy. And that\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s not just the legislation. We need to do something to do this. And I hope President Trump realizes that this legislation is not just something Congress is doing. At the end of the day, he\u2019s going to be judged by this, by whether he can produce.ASMAN: James, Bill just talked about taxes. Paul Ryan came out this week and talked about, you know, really pushing forward on taxes, in a way that I haven\u2019t heard from anybody except from people in the Trump administration. That was great to hear. He did not mention the border tax. Is that --FREEMAN: Right.ASMAN: Did they finally weak up to the fact that people don\u2019t want another tax?FREEMAN: I think they are waking up to the idea that they are going to jump this Beltway custom that, if you\u2019re going to cut some taxes, you to raise other taxes over here. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing from Paul Ryan, from the Freedom Caucus, not just tax reform, but tax cuts. And I think that ought to be their focus. If he\u2019s --ASMAN: Not creating a whole new tax that didn\u2019t exist before, like the border tax.FREEMAN: Right, right. And I think they have to focus on their political futures. We\u2019ve been talking about what these special elections mean, what\u2019s going to happen next year. They have got to get the economic reform, the economic revival program going if they want to get reelected next year, if they want to keep control of the Congress, and that starts with a big tax cut.ASMAN: Dan, it is across the board. Paul Ryan was saying it\u2019s going to be corporate, it\u2019s also going to be individual. He mentioned the fact that eight of 10 companies in America are not incorporated. They pay taxes as individuals. So it\u2019s a real sort of Reagan-esqe plan across-the-board tax plan.HENNINGER: Yeah. It\u2019s across the board. They try to extend it out as far as they can. We have to point out that in the health care bill, they have taken a start. They have eliminated Obamacare\u2019s taxes. They also eliminated the 3.8 percent surcharge on investment income for higher-income people. That will help the economy. So I think between the two bills, they are headed in the right direction.I have to say, Senator Rand Paul sounds like a man from Mars, as though he wants to just start all over again, that there\u2019s no Congress to deal with. They have got an opportunity to show that they can get something. If they don\u2019t, the Democrats are sitting there with universal health care, which they will propose immediately.ASMAN: But, Mary, interestingly, there were some Democrats -- we use today call them blue dogs -- the more moderate Democrats who, this week, announced that they were meeting with the Trump team. In fact, they met with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and some others on tax cuts. So is it conceivable, particularly in light of the Georgia election, that they may get some Democrats coming on their side?KISSEL: Well, I would hope so. What has been lacking, of course, is bipartisanship, and it\u2019s not on the Republican side. I think the Republicans are very happy to do deals with Democrats, for instance, on the tax plan, getting tax cuts in exchange for more infrastructure spending.ASMAN: There\u2019s a deal.KISSEL: Look, Democrats want to get reelected. They are not going to get reelected on the platform of       Barack Obama.       We have seen that in the last several races. There\u2019s an opportunity for them to step forward and say, look, we want to have policy victories to take to our voters, too, to run on next year.ASMAN: Very quickly, Bill, I think it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re going to get some Democrats on taxes, but it doesn\u2019t seem that they\u2019ll get any on health care, right?MCGURN: Probably not. Look, to me this is a scene from \u201cOn the Waterfront\u201d with       Marlon Brando       and       Karl Malden.ASMAN: One of my favorites.MCGURN: Marlon Brando is all upset and he wants to shoot the gangster, and Karl Malden says, \u201cYou want to get even, you really want to get even? Testify in court.\u201d That\u2019s what they have to do to President Trump. This is key not just to the Republicans in Congress but to the president. He wants to get even, stop worrying about Russia, stop worrying about       James Comey.       Gets these two bills through and they can --ASMAN: Well, Russia\u2019s not getting Democrats anywhere.So maybe it\u2019s smart on that one.Still ahead, tensions between former Cold-War rivals are heating up, with Russia saying they\u2019re going to target U.S. war planes in Syria. Former U.N. Ambassador       John BOLTON       joining us next.DAVID ASMAN: The long-simmering tensions between the U.S. and Russia erupting this week following the American military\u2019s downing of a Syrian war plane. Moscow is now threatening to target aircraft flown by the U.S. and its allies west of the Euphrates River.John Bolton is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a FOX News contributor.First of all, Ambassador, what happened to the narrative of the Trump administration and Russia being hand in glove?AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON: Well, I don\u2019t think it ever was hand in glove. I think       Vladimir Putin       pursues, with absolute clarity, what he sees as Russia national interest, and the only appropriate American response to that is to do the same on our side. And right now, I think, in the context of the war against ISIS and in the region more broadly, I think the Defense Department, the State Department are still basically on auto pilot from the Obama administration. There is not a new administration strategy, and we need one, not one that\u2019s dictated by the tactics of Russian or American planes in the sky over the region, but by a notion on how we want to defeat ISIS and what\u2019s going to come after it.ASMAN: Right. Well, ISIS -- as I mentioned, Russia now created this new rule that no U.S. or NATO planes can fly south of Euphrates. That\u2019s essentially Assad territory, the guy who controls Syria, the guy who they\u2019re allied with. Is it possible, can we just stay north of the Euphrates and avoid any conflict with Russia?BOLTON: It\u2019s not for Russia to tell us where to fly.ASMAN: Absolutely.BOLTON: And this is one of the legacies of Barack Obama. He allowed a Russian air base to be built at Latakia.       John Kerry       famously said, when asked, what\u2019s that base for, he said, oh, for force protection. What, to protect the Russian forces that ought to be in Russia and not Syria? We are not looking for military action, let\u2019s be clear, but I think we want to build up an American presence that says to the Russians, we will fly where we want to fly. And the people you ought to worry about de-conflicting are Syrian and Russia pilots. But again, this has to be a piece of a larger post-ISIS strategy to prevent Russia\u2019s key allies, the Assad regime in Syria, and the Iranians, from building an arch of control through the Baghdad government in Iraq, through Assad\u2019s control in Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to set the stage for the next conflict in the region. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s where they are going. I don\u2019t think we have a response.ASMAN: Well, we have taken out a Syrian plane, in air. We don\u2019t know what happened to the pilot. We\u2019ve taken out many planes on the ground when they used chemical weapons. What happens if, somehow, a Russian gets in the mix and there\u2019s a Russian death? What happens between our two nations?BOLTON: Well, again, we are not looking for it, but rule number one is we will protect American forces. We will protect them against Syrian military, against Syrian planes, Syrian drones, or anybody else\u2019s planes or drones that we deem threatening to them. But to me, this is one argument why we have to have a better understanding of what exactly the forces we are using to help des<B>TROY</B> ISIS, the Kurds. Yes, some have their own trouble but, by in large, the Kurds are with us. Helping the Baghdad government is equivalent, sad to say, to helping the ayatollahs in Iran. I think we need more Arab forces from the gulf states, from Egypt, from Jordan, and less reliance on some of the dubious Syrian groups. But that strategy has not yet emerged from State or Defense.ASMAN: By the way, it\u2019s not just in the Middle East. There was confrontation over the Baltic Sea in which a Russian fighter jet came within five feet of a U.S. plane. That\u2019s pretty damn close.BOLTON: It\u2019s extraordinarily dangerous. And they have done this in numerous instances both with respect to plane and our ships in the Baltics. The Russians are still pushing for -- let\u2019s not mistake Vladimir Putin here for somebody warm and fuzzy. He\u2019s tough as iron. He\u2019s totally cynical. He\u2019s still pushing to see how far he can get. As of yet, he is still to see any material pushback from the administration.ASMAN: Meanwhile, the shake-up in the Middle East, to kind of realignment, continues with the Saudi king appointing his 31-year-old son as the crown prince, kind of taking out an older guy, a cousin that was in there before. I\u2019m just wondering, any connection between the Trump visit a few weeks ago and this move?BOLTON: Well, it\u2019s possible, but I think this has also been in the making for a while. I have to say, I am worried about it, not because I disagree with the modernizing agenda of the king and the new crown prince. There\u2019s a lot to be said for what they want to do. But the balance of power within the extraordinarily large Saudi royal family has been negotiated out for a long period of time. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of this succession struggle. And while I certainly welcome modernization in Saudi Arabia, let\u2019s be clear, the Salafist clerics, the Wahhabis still hold enormous power. And I very much fear that if the modernization is not done carefully, we are going face a shah-of-Iran situation in Saudi Arabia. And to see that project collapse and to see a religious extremist regime take power would wreak havoc with the global economy.ASMAN: I want to put a little more optimistic spin on this, and maybe it\u2019s not political spin, but the fact is the realignment does bring together former enemies. I mean, Israel and Saudi Arabia have never been closer, because they have this common enemy of Iran. And, of course, the United States is much stronger in the mix, not only because of what we did, what we proved we would do in Syria, but because of our commitment to our Arab allies in the Middle East. This realignment could be the beginning of something extremely positive, no?BOLTON: Well, if it continues. There\u2019s nothing like a religious extremist with nuclear weapons to concentrate your attention in Saudi, in the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Israel. But if the Saudi regime, through personal ambition or family ambition, ends up destabilizing, everybody in the gulf on the Arab side could be trouble, and the opportunity for both Sunni extremists and the ayatollahs in Tehran could be formidable.ASMAN: I try to give you an out so you could end on a positive note. You didn\u2019t take it.But, Ambassador, it\u2019s good to see you anyway. Thank you very much for coming in. I appreciate it.BOLTON: Thank you, David.ASMAN: Still ahead, the horrific death of       Otto Warmbier       just the latest reminder of North Korea\u2019s brutal ways. So what\u2019s the next step in reigning in that rogue regime? Can we count on China at all to help?PRESIDENT TRUMP: You look at North Korea, what\u2019s going - look at       Otto,        beautiful Otto. Went over there a healthy, wonderful boy, and you see how he came back. You see how he came back. So we\u2019ve been given a bad hand but we will take that bad hand and it\u2019ll all be good.ASMAN: President Trump reacting this week to the tragic death of Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old student who was held in a North Korean prison for 17 months, who died on Monday, just less than a week after he was released and returned home to Cincinnati. Just the latest reminder of the brutal nature of that rogue regime and the urgent need to stop its nuclear ambitions. So can the Trump administration count on China for help?We are back with Dan Henninger, Mary Kissel and Bill McGurn.Mary, first of all, the focus on Otto Warmbier, sometimes when you focus on one American, who has been terribly mistreated, as he was, to the point of death, it\u2019s personal. We got to know the family. We got to know Otto. We were pulling for him to pull through, which, of course, he didn\u2019t. The significance of that?KISSEL: Well, North Korea is a closed regime and foreign journalists who go to North Korea are not allowed to go deeply into the country, so we are not shown the reality of the life in North Korea today. What happened to Otto is happening to tens of thousands of North Koreans. And you said in the introduction, David, that we have to stop their nuclear ambitions. Let\u2019s remember, too, that there are working on biological, chemical weapon. We saw the chemical weapons used in Kuala Lumpur to kill Kim\u2019s brother. And, look, they have the delivery systems now, too. They are working on ballistic missile programs. They could take balloons and send them over Seoul and drop chemical weapons all over Seoul. This shows the kind of individual, the kind of regime that wants those nuclear weapons.ASMAN: You can\u2019t negotiate with these people. I mean, Otto Warmbier\u2019s father, Bill, was very clear about the fact -- I mean, he pulled no punches in saying that he had no respect for the Obama method of dealing with then with kid gloves. It was only when Trump got tough with them that they got anything --MCGURN: Two points. One is, absolutely right. This is more than an individual strategy. It also illustrates the world is a more dangerous place when regimes like this think they can molest Americans. When you look at countries like Iran, taking hostages, releases them and take more, it\u2019s not a coincidence that the most belligerent guy in Asia, is a guy that has brutalized Americans.Second, Donald Trump also had a statement about China not being helpful. And a friend of mine,       Mark Simon,        from Hong Kong, suggested, you know what might be a good measure for China? Revoke the student visas for all those children of --MCGURN: -- Chinese leaders coming to the United States. That might get their attention.ASMAN: Dan, the president did take this very personally, as we all did, as I think all Americans did. When he takes things personally, he does act on them. So the chances there will be some change in our relations with China, no?HENNINGER: You just showed meeting with President Xi of China and he tweeted earlier this week that it hasn\u2019t worked out in getting China to help with North Korea. The next day, however, Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       and Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said we are still working the problem. What they mean is they are working on imposing sanctions on about 10 companies, Chinese companies that do business with the North Koreans. This is not a large problem.ASMAN: No.HENNINGER: The issue is whether the Chinese will help us with that and, if not, whether we should unilaterally impose sanctions on Chinese companies.ASMAN: You know, Mary, no American, after what happened, has any doubt of the horrible nature of this regime. It might be Otto Warmbier\u2019s legacy. He might actually have left behind a legacy that will allow an American president to deal with North Korea in a way other American presidents haven\u2019t.KISSEL: I agree with Dan that we need to increase sanctions on companies or banks that do business with North Korea. There\u2019s a lot more we can do. North Korea gets tens of millions of dollars from its slave labor income all over the world. We can stop the kids of North Korean elites from studying abroad. We could stop and search their ships. We\u2019ve had ships stopped by, for instance, the Panamanian authorities. They found two disassembled MIG fighters in the belly of a North Korean ship. There\u2019s a lot we can do, short of an attack, or what Obama did, nothing.ASMAN: And, Bill, the fact is that Americans use to care, it seems to me, or at least politicians used to care more about what happens to a single American than they do now. This may have changed this week.MCGURN: Let\u2019s be clear, when we look out for American citizens -- it\u2019s a dangerous world. I spent more than 12 years of my life overseas. Those ex-pat Americans are very exposed. But when we go after regimes that go after our people -- you know, like Roman citizens, don\u2019t touch them -- other people are safer, too. It\u2019s not just the Americans who benefit.ASMAN: When we come back, Amazon ruffling feathers in the retail community with its acquisition of             Whole Foods.       So is this move good for consumers or is the online giant betting too big? Our panel weighing in, next.ASMAN: Amazon CEO       Jeff Bezos       looking to extend his already vast empire, announcing last week that the online giant would like to buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The acquisition could have a huge impact on eCommerce as well as brick-and-mortar retailers.But Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       told             FOX Business Network\u2019s      Stuart Varney       this week he didn\u2019t see any anti-trust issues with the deal. Take a listenCOMMERCE SECRETARY       WILBUR       ROSS: I think it\u2019s a very clear move to marry together a very good, high-quality niche retailer with the very broad-brush approach of marketing everything that Amazon has done so well, but I surely don\u2019t see any anti-trust implications in that.ASMAN: Sounds like a green light to me.We are back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and James Freeman.James, Silicon Valley did not greet the Trump administration with open arms. But did they finally realize that maybe they have a friend in the White House?FREEMAN: It is nice to see a change in tone, where businesses, kind of look at generally as a helpful productive thing, instead of --ASMAN: Shock.FREEMAN: -- something that needs to be controlled and really diminished. So I think in any administration, there\u2019s really no anti-trust case here, because although Whole Foods takes a lot of your paycheck when you shop there, it doesn\u2019t have a huge market share. You\u2019re talking about still Amazon and Whole Foods together, single-digit percentage of the U.S. grocer market. But really interesting to think about what Amazon is going to learn from all the consumer data that they can get out of these affluent, often, liberal customers at Whole Foods.ASMAN: Dan, the Obama administration killed off dozens of deals. There were tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars just in kill fees alone that these corporations and we, stockholders, had to pay for that. This administration, it\u2019s day and night, is it not?HENNINGER: Well, it is day and night, David, for sure. But the Obama administration was basically attacking banks and airlines and things like that.I am really intrigued by the fact that you\u2019ve got three massive companies, like Amazon, Google,             Facebook,       absorbing all of the business in their space, and nobody on the left is screaming about the robber baron this time, the way they did about 125 years ago when we were building steel and auto industries.ASMAN: Yeah.HENNINGER: And I think that\u2019s because everyone sort of feels these companies are doing something good in their lives. And mainly, with Amazon is doing is giving us the seeming idea that we have more time. Instead of having to go out shopping, you click. And everyone who sort of feel like       tum       is rushing upon them these days think that Amazon is creating time for them. And the big goal here is to do that with shopping for food as well.ASMAN: Well, Bill, Dan brings up a great point, the fact is that the profit margins of Apple have always been 20 or 30 times bigger than the oil companies who got nothing but disdain heaped upon them for decades, and they don\u2019t care about profit if it\u2019s so-called green company, right?MCGURN: We\u2019ll see. I think, sooner or later, if they\u2019re successful and innovative, you become an enemy of the people.ASMAN: Even Bezos and Amazon?MCGURN: Maybe. We will see. What we have is not just about food. I\u2019m old enough to remember Amazon when it first started, and it was just books. And now so much my family\u2019s life is geared -- I hardly -- I go --ASMAN: Even if you want to buy a pack of chewing gum --MCGURN: Yeah.ASMAN: -- you\u2019re Amazon Prime, you order from Amazon.MCGURN: I have a Whole Foods two blocks away from me, so it may not change that. But we don\u2019t know where this is going to lead, where the innovation is going to lead and where you find certain things that can be adaptive to other areas as well. So it\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s what innovation is. You see the competition is no longer between two people in the industry. It\u2019s a cross industry. It\u2019s just changing everything.ASMAN: James, bringing it back to the top of Silicon Valley and their initial disdain for the Trump administration, they still have problems with the social views of the -- the conservative social views. But will that be trumped, if you pardon the pun, by the focus on allowing Silicon Valley to do whatever they want?FREEMAN: I would think they would -- when they look at it, they would see a lot to like in the Trump administration. When you think about tax reform, lowering that corporate rate, inviting to bring cash back from overseas to invest in the U.S., the biggest names on the list in terms of cash, stuff overseas, is Apple,             Microsoft.       These are companies who really would benefits and could invest a lot more in the U.S. with tax reform. And then on the immigration stuff, Trump really is no worse than Obama on letting the high-skilled workers come here. I wish he was a lot better, but it\u2019s really status quo, basically.ASMAN: The last word from James.We have to take one more break. When we come back, \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.ASMAN: And it\u2019s time now for our \u201cHits & Misses\u201d of the week.James, first you. Hit or a miss?FREEMAN: This is a hit, David, to the president of the United States for his tweeting. I know we often criticize him, saying the tweets are a little maybe misguided, impulsive, but we\u2019ve got to give him credit. Five years ago, this week, he said now\u2019s the time to buy housing before values are fully recovered.ASMAN: Wow.FREEMAN: Remember, I told you so. He was right on the money.ASMAN: Unbelievable.ASMAN: I wish I had followed his advice.Mary, you\u2019ve got a surprising hit.KISSEL: Yeah. Surprise, I\u2019m giving a big hit to New York Governor       Andrew Cuomo       for bringing in a man named       Joe Lhota       to fix that seventh level of hell known as the New York City subway.ASMAN: Which both of us use every day.KISSEL: Yes. Every day, I\u2019m strap hanging every day, and Penn Station. We\u2019re going to have a summer of hell here in New York as they try to fix both of these messes. Joe Lhota kept the trains running after Superstorm Sandy. He says he\u2019s going to do it again. Again, as a strap- hanger, I hope he\u2019s successful.ASMAN: He wasn\u2019t a great candidate for mayor. He didn\u2019t win --ASMAN: All right, Bill, hit or miss?MCGURN: Big hit to       John Cass,        \u201cThe             Chicago Tribune                  \u201d columnist. This week, he wrote a piece on how to solve the problem of a bankrupt Illinois, which he calls the Venezuela of the Midwest.His answer is very simple. Dissolve it and let the surrounding states, you know, Iowa, Kentucky --ASMAN: Oh, my gosh, actually, we have a graphic on it, don\u2019t we?MCGURN: It\u2019s a great solution.ASMAN: Have it melt away into the adjoining states.MCGURN: He leaves little carveouts, like Romania, named for       Rahm       Emanuel.I think he envisions a country where he could be the --MCGURN: Anyway, great column.ASMAN: Our sympathies, by the way, to the taxpayers in Illinois. They are suffering.Dan, you\u2019ve got a hit or a miss?HENNINGER: Well, I have a miss for       Mary Jane,        also known as marijuana. And everyone has been wondering, since legalization, how that was going to work out. Well, the Highway Loss Data Institute has been looking into it, and they have studied the states of Washington, Colorado and Oregon, where marijuana has been legalized, to see what the collision rates look like. Well, they\u2019ve gone up about 3 percent compared to states without marijuana. So I think the lesson here is, high on the highway, David, does not work.ASMAN: Yeah.

It said eight noted cancer experts had been assigned to treat him.A poet and literature professor, Mr. Liu was detained in late 2008 shortly after he led the drafting of a pro-democracy manifesto that spread widely in Chinese intellectual circles. He was declared guilty on Christmas Day the following year and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. Writers including Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood lobbied for his release.In 2010, Mr. Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that deeply angered China, which described Mr. Liu as a \u201ccriminal.\u201d Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, Liu Xia, has since been under house arrest.In a smartphone video posted to the             WeChat                   instant messaging app by a family friend on Monday, Ms. Liu appears distraught over news of her husband\u2019s illness. \u201cHe can\u2019t undergo surgery, or do chemotherapy or radiation therapy,\u201d she says in tears.Those in the human-rights community who hoped global condemnation would pressure China into softening its treatment of political dissidents have been disappointed.\u201cThe world community has largely forgotten       Liu Xiaobo,       \u201d said Jerome Cohen, director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York University. He said Mr. Liu\u2019s fate was a sad reminder of longstanding oppression in China.In the years since Mr. Liu was arrested, Beijing has seen its international clout grow. Chinese investment has poured into Africa, across Asia and elsewhere and Beijing has become more assertive about wielding that economic influence to further strategic interests. Criticism of its imprisonment of Mr. Liu and other dissidents has grown fainter.\u201cChina has paid a very small price for imprisoning Liu Xiaobo,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the rise of China. We see most countries don\u2019t want to pick a fight with the Chinese,\u201d he said.Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a China-backed resolution affirming Beijing\u2019s long-held position that held up development as promoting human rights. A plan by the European Union to condemn China\u2019s human-rights record at the U.N. body was blocked by Greece, a destination for heavy Chinese investment.In the U.S., the Trump administration has focused its dealings with China on trade and enlisting China\u2019s help in reining in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program rather than human rights.Neither the U.S. nor the European Union signed a joint letter from 11 embassies in March criticizing Beijing over allegations that it was using torture to extract confessions from detained activists and human-rights lawyers.The U.S. Embassy in Beijing didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Liu\u2019s release or criticism the U.S. could do more to press China on human rights. In the past the State Department has said it routinely raises human rights in meetings with Chinese officials.Mr. Liu was the first Chinese citizen to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, although the       Dalai Lama,        the exiled Tibetan religious leader, received the prize in 1989. The Nobel committee recognized Mr. Liu, who was represented at the award ceremony in the Norwegian capital of Oslo by an empty chair symbolizing his imprisonment, for his \u201clong and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\u201dChina denounced the government of Norway and curtailed imports of Norwegian salmon, even though the Nobel committee is independent of any government. Relations between Beijing and Oslo only recently thawed after Norway made several concessions. Those included Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg\u2019s decision not to meet with the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers a dangerous separatist, when he visited the country in 2014.Norway\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Liu\u2019s release. An official at the Norwegian Nobel Institute said the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize hadn\u2019t issued any comment about Mr. Liu.International human-rights groups reacted sharply to the news of Mr. Liu\u2019s release.\u201cLiu Xiaobo should never have been jailed in the first place,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, Asia director for Human Rights Watch.\u00a0That he was released with late-stage cancer \u201cshows all the pathologies of human rights in China today,\u201d she said.Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty International, called on Chinese authorities to ensure Mr. Liu received adequate medical care and access to his family.Some of Mr. Liu\u2019s relatives had been to see him 10 days ago and described his situation as \u201crelatively stable,\u201d according to Mr. Mo. The lawyer declined to elaborate and said Mr. Liu\u2019s relatives wouldn\u2019t comment.A spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said at a regular press briefing on Monday that he wasn\u2019t aware of Mr. Liu\u2019s situation.Mr. Liu participated in the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square, and wrote extensively about them after China\u2019s military was called in to crush them. \u201cThe day seems more and more distant and yet for me it remains a needle inside my body,\u201d he wrote in a poem years later.The manifesto Mr. Liu helped write, \u201cCharter 08,\u201d called for a broad set of changes in China, including a new constitution, to bring about a more democratic system, though it stopped short of calling for the overthrow of the Communist Party.Since coming to power in 2012, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has moved aggressively to quash dissent, with a crackdown on hundreds of activists and human-rights lawyers.\u201cThings have become even worse under Xi,\u201d said Mr. Cohen of New York University.Chinese authorities say they have treated the detained lawyers and activists in accordance with the law.\u2014David Gauthier-Villars in Stockholm contributed to this article.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com and Te-Ping Chen at te-ping.chen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'China Releases Dissident After Cancer Diagnosis.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 12:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/liu-xiaobo-released-from-chinese-prison-following-cancer-diagnosis-1498468110", "news_title": "Dissident Liu Xiaobo Released From Chinese Prison Following Cancer Diagnosis", "keywords": "liu xiaobo,liu xiaobo has cancer ,liu xiaobo released from prison ,nobel peace prize ,United Nations Human Rights Council,cancer,political,general news,society,community,health,human rights,civil liberties,medical conditions"}, {"content": "As a sixth-grader in South Carolina in the 1940s,       Herma Hill Kay       won a classroom debate in which she was the only student willing to argue that the South shouldn\u2019t have won the Civil War.Her civics teacher told her afterward, \u201cIf you were my daughter, I\u2019d send you to law school.\u201dMs. Kay\u2019s mother, however, said it was silly to think she could make a living as a lawyer. \u201cI think she had a sense of what the world was like for professional woman,\u201d Ms. Kay said in a 2003 interview.Shrugging off that early resistance, Ms. Kay attended the University of Chicago Law School on a full scholarship and graduated in 1959, where she was one of four women in her class. She became one of the first women to lead an elite law school, serving as the dean of UC Berkeley School of Law from 1992 to 2000.Ms. Kay taught at Berkeley for more than 50 years. Her expertise in family and antidiscrimination law made her a pioneer in legal teaching and helped influenced a wide range of legislation.Ms. Kay, who married three times, was particularly focused on making marriage and divorce safer for women. In the 1960s, she helped draft and lobbied for a new law that made California the first state to allow couples to get divorced without showing a \u201cfault,\u201d such as adultery. Within the next two decades, nearly every U.S. state enacted similar laws.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.\u201cI\u2019ve always felt very strongly...that women ought to be free and conscious actors,\u201d Ms. Kay said in 2003. \u201cSo I was very opposed to anything that would stand in the way of their self-realization,\u201d she added.Ms. Kay died at her home in San Francisco on June 10, after a short illness. She was 82 years old.At the time of her death, she had been working on a book about the history of women in legal teaching.Born on Aug. 18, 1934, in Orangeburg, S.C., Ms. Kay was the only child of her father, a Methodist minister, and her mother, an elementary schoolteacher. Her parents both had college degrees, a rarity among her childhood peers. She moved every few years within South Carolina, following her father wherever he preached.As a college student at Southern Methodist University, Ms. Kay joined the boys\u2019 debate team and worked at the urging of her debate coach to lose her Southern accent. An English major, she was briefly a cheerleader and joined a sorority that \u201cplayed a lot of bridge,\u201d she has said.Law school in Chicago was the first time Ms. Kay traveled outside the South. After a poor performance on a law school exam, one professor told her it was difficult for women to succeed in law and advised her to drop out.Ms. Kay began her legal career in 1959, at a time when Wall Street law firms weren\u2019t hiring women. She clerked for California Supreme Court Justice Roger Traynor, who endorsed her to join the Berkeley Law faculty in 1960.One of her biggest challenges as dean was working to attract a diverse student body after California voters in 1996 passed a measure banning affirmative action at public universities. She was especially known for her mentorship of women students and younger law faculty.\u201cShe was incredibly generous and supportive, in particular to women entering the teaching profession,\u201d said Eleanor Swift, who served as Ms. Kay\u2019s associate dean at Berkeley Law and knew her for more than 30 years.Ms. Kay had a longstanding friendship with Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        after they first met at a legal conference in 1971 when the justice was a professor at Rutgers Law School. They were among the three co-authors of the first law school course materials on sex discrimination.\u201cThere is a certain chemistry involved when one meets her, something that magically makes you want to be on her side,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said in a 2015 speech, when presenting Ms. Kay with a lifetime achievement award in legal education.In that speech, Justice Ginsburg called Ms. Kay \u201ca woman of style,\u201d saying Ms. Kay drove around San Francisco in a yellow Jaguar and flew a Piper Cub plane with her private pilot\u2019s license. Ms. Kay also enjoyed swimming and gardening.Ms. Kay is survived by three children and four grandchildren.

She had less than six months to live.\u201cI have always promised you when it\u2019s time to have difficult conversations, I wanted to be open with you to have them. Is that OK?\u201d       Jordan Asher,        an internal medicine doctor, asked Ms. Gray.\u201cSure. Absolutely,\u201d she said, nodding.He tells her the cancer treatments have stopped working.Absorbing the news, minutes later she asks, \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing else you can do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do, but there\u2019s not a lot we can do concerning the cancer,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do to help you to be with your family, there\u2019s a lot we can do to help you remain comfortable. And there\u2019s a lot we can do to\u2026. get you to enjoy what time we have left.\u201dThe conversation wasn\u2019t real. It is part of a new simulation lab launched by Alive Hospice in Nashville to train doctors and other health-care providers in how to deliver news about terminal diagnoses. Ms. Gray is really       Eileen Johnson,        senior director of quality and data analytics at Alive. And Dr. Asher is chief clinical officer of Ascension Care Management, a subsidiary of Ascension, a Catholic health care system that is planning to use the training for health providers at five of its sites across the country.The room is designed to simulate a doctor\u2019s office on one side and a hospital bed on the other. Behind a pane of glass there is a row of headphones where outsiders can listen in.More Your Health columns by Sumathi ReddyA television screen plays back the four scenarios that the trainee practices with one or more employees playing the role of a patient or family member. The trainee and a facilitator review what went right and wrong and where improvements might be made.The scenarios include telling a patient of a terminal diagnosis; dealing with a patient who is asking off-topic questions (Will raw beets cure my cancer?); responding to angry family members; and how to handle another physician who may have a different opinion on a patient.The doctors and facilitator discuss everything from the importance of silence and how to handle the placement of tissues to answering questions with succinct responses and communicating non-verbally (maintain eye contact, lean forward slightly, sit up straight).Traditionally, doctors have gotten very little formal training in how to communicate end-of-life news. But increasingly, the medical world is paying more attention to the importance of communicating difficult information to patients with training sessions and programs at academic and teaching hospitals.VitalTalk, a nonprofit, unconnected to Alive Hospice, also trains medical professionals in giving serious news and prognosis information. It has trained more than 400 faculty, who are now training physicians and nurse practitioners across the country, said       Robert Arnold,        co-founder of VitalTalk and a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.\u201cI think this is something that\u2019s very hard for clinicians to do without training,\u201d said Dr. Arnold. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say the words and to say them in a clear and understandable way. And it\u2019s also hard to know how to deal with the emotional reaction you get.\u201dAnna-Gene O\u2019Neal,        president and CEO of Alive Hospice, conceived of the simulation lab and is one of the facilitators.She pointed out that in January of 2016 Medicare, the government-funded health insurance for elderly individuals, added a billing code for advanced directive conversations. That means doctors could sometimes get paid for having talks dealing with end-of-life care. But many physicians weren\u2019t using it because they weren\u2019t comfortable talking about such issues, said Ms. O\u2019Neal.She realized there was a need for more training. She got a grant from the local Memorial Foundation which Alive used to develop the simulation lab last year. They piloted the program in the fall, and invited local physicians and other health care providers to do both group and individual training sessions.The simulator just officially launched and is offering both individual and group training on-site in Nashville, as well as off-site locally and nationally.Jennifer Domm,        a medical director of pediatrics, hematology and oncology at HCA Healthcare in Nashville, said she did the simulation lab training about six months ago. She found the scenario with angry family members the most helpful\u2014a situation she\u2019s confronted with a lot.\u201cI think part of the grieving process is anger and that can be really difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to become a little bit defensive but I think it\u2019s important to try to take yourself out of the situation. Just have patience and try to be empathetic and think about where they\u2019re coming from.\u201dDr. Domm said she\u2019s never had any formal training in delivering end-of-life news so being able to watch herself do it and getting it critiqued was useful. \u201cThere were times I didn\u2019t necessarily mean to cut them off and I felt like maybe I was too quick to jump in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was reinforcing some of the things that I knew or would teach a mentee.\u201dFor Dr. Asher, the simulator felt real, he said. He said the training helped him realize the importance of de-escalating the emotional response of a patient and their angry family member.\u201cI will think about that and as I work with people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will help them understand that point\u2014of being able to look for the signs of escalation versus de-escalation.

She didn\u2019t make it. Immediately, her face popped up on two video screens above the street. \u201cJaywalkers will be captured using facial-recognition technology,\u201d the screens said.Facial-recognition technology, once a specter of dystopian science fiction, is becoming a feature of daily life in China, where authorities are using it on streets, in subway stations, at airports and at border crossings in a vast experiment in social engineering. Their goal: to influence behavior and identify lawbreakers.Ms. Gan, 31 years old, had been caught on camera crossing illegally here once before, allowing the system to match her two images. Text displayed on the crosswalk screens identified her as a repeat offender.\u201cI won\u2019t ever run a red light again,\u201d she said.China is rushing to deploy new technologies to monitor its people in ways that would spook many in the U.S. and the West. Unfettered by privacy concerns or public debate, Beijing\u2019s authoritarian leaders are installing iris scanners at security checkpoints in troubled regions and using sophisticated software to monitor ramblings on social media. By 2020, the government hopes to implement a national \u201csocial credit\u201d system that would assign every citizen a rating based on how they behave at work, in public venues and in their financial dealings.China\u2019s technology companies are helping lead the way, scooping up unprecedented data on people\u2019s lives through their mobile phones and competing to develop and market surveillance systems for government use.Facial-recognition technology is one of the most powerful new tools in the surveillance arsenal. Fueled by advances in artificial intelligence, these systems can measure key aspects of a face, such as distance between the eyes and skin tone, then cross-reference them against huge databases of photographs collected by government agencies and businesses and shared on social media.Other countries also have begun experimenting. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses the technology to help identify criminal suspects, and the Department of Homeland Security is deploying it in airports to track when foreign visitors leave the country. Its use is expected to grow world-wide as a tool for law enforcement and personal identification, and U.S. companies are among those using it in pilot programs.China, however, stands apart in harnessing facial recognition as a cudgel to influence behavior. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security\u2014its national police force\u2014and other agencies called in 2015 for the creation of an \u201comnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable\u201d nationwide video-surveillance network as a public-safety imperative. In a policy statement, the agencies included \u201cfacial comparison\u201d in a list of techniques to be used to improve surveillance networks.\u201cThese security steps appear in American movies,\u201d said Xie Yinan of Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese tech startup that sells facial-recognition systems to private and public enterprises. \u201cBut in China, it\u2019s actually being used in real life.\u201dChinese government agencies including the public-security ministry, the central planning agency and the ministry in charge of information technology either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls.On Chongming Island near Shanghai, a new running course has been outfitted with a facial-recognition system to ensure runners don\u2019t take shortcuts through the foliage during timed competitions, said       Chen Zhixian,        a manager at the company that built the track.Jogger       Chen Xiang,        42, said he was aware of the system but wondered why it was needed. \u201cRunning is an activity, and we\u2019re just out here to have fun,\u201d he said.Facial-recognition cameras are being used in China for routine activities such as gaining entrance to a workplace, withdrawing cash from an ATM and unlocking a smartphone. A KFC restaurant in Beijing is scanning customer faces, then making menu suggestions based on gender and age estimates. One popular park in the capital has deployed it to fight toilet-paper theft in restrooms, using face-scanning dispensers that limit each person to one 2-foot length of paper every nine minutes.A world where everyone can be tracked by their face wherever they go is still a long way off, and will require much better algorithms and cameras than currently exist, said       Anil Jain,        the head of Michigan State University\u2019s Biometrics Research Group.China is moving in that direction, abetted by a vast surveillance network. Industry researcher             IHS Markit Ltd.       estimates China has 176 million surveillance cameras in public and private hands, and it forecasts the nation will install about 450 million new ones by 2020. The U.S., by comparison, has about 50 million.It isn\u2019t known how many cameras in China are enabled for facial recognition, but any high-definition camera can potentially be linked to such a system.The sprawling camera network has spawned anxiety in some quarters. One night in early May, government cameras in the coastal city of Wenzhou kept watch as dozens of people filed into a Protestant church for an emergency meeting called following the installation of the cameras near and inside the church compound the previous month.The growing appeal of religion in China has unsettled the country\u2019s officially atheist leadership. Three years ago, authorities began removing crosses from many places of worship in Wenzhou, and last year China\u2019s State Administration of Religious Affairs ordered major churches, mosques and temples to be \u201cfully covered\u201d by surveillance cameras. Cameras were installed at the Wenzhou church holding the meeting and at others, including some trained on pews.In an interview before the meeting, the pastor said local authorities told him the video feed went to police headquarters. \u201cI assume the cameras have facial recognition. Why wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cI have Communist Party members and prominent business owners in my congregation. If they think their faces are being scanned when they walk through the door on Sunday, of course they\u2019re going to stop coming.\u201dPolice authorities in Wenzhou declined to comment on church surveillance.Elsewhere in China, an outspoken government critic said in an interview he had been tracked and detained by police while traveling in southwestern China despite taking steps to cloak his whereabouts by using an anonymous SIM card in his phone and traveling on a fake ID.Police refused to say how they found him, he said, but in previous encounters authorities told him they had facial-recognition systems. Local police once even bragged about their ability to track him, he said. \u201cThey told me that whenever I walked through certain intersections, a computer system would alert them to my location,\u201d he said.Facial recognition works by breaking down a face into a series of measurements and using them to create a template that can then be compared with others in a database.Early systems could only compare two photos taken in relatively ideal conditions. The application of artificial-intelligence techniques such as deep learning, which uses software to mimic the way neurons in the brain process information, has revolutionized the technology. Algorithms can now pick out and manipulate patterns on their own, making it easier to detect and identify faces turned to the side, smiling or frowning, or weathered by age.China has access to immense amounts of data\u2014photos uploaded by the country\u2019s more than 700 million internet users and a centralized image database of citizens, all of whom must have a government-issued photo ID by age 16.This year, China set up a government-funded laboratory to push the development of facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence. China hopes to become a leading innovator in those technologies.\u201cThe things we\u2019ve been able to do in this space surprise me, and I\u2019ve been in this business a long time,\u201d said       Lin Yuanqing,        a computer scientist for internet search company             Baidu Inc.       and a member of the team overseeing the lab.The Chinese startups say their best customers are local police bureaus, which are under pressure from central authorities to identify and squelch threats to social stability.At a recent security-equipment conference in Chengdu, displays of facial-recognition systems were popular. At one booth, a promotional video by Intellifusion Technology Co. showed a police officer directing a squadron of facial-recognition drones for crowd surveillance. \u201cThat\u2019s a little ways into the future,\u201d said       Huang Fan,        a marketer for Intellifusion, the company that installed the jaywalking-detection system in Shenzhen.The company\u2019s current systems can track an individual\u2019s movements inside a building through facial recognition and alert authorities if that person attempts to access restricted floors.In May, facial-recognition systems were used at the Belt and Road Forum hosted by President       Xi Jinping       in Beijing to promote old Silk Road trade routes. At entrances to the event, paramilitary police stood next to face-detecting video consoles linked to cameras trained on the doors.\u201cIt\u2019s really advanced,\u201d a guard said as the system snapped images of two people who had approached the screening area. In an instant, the screen pulled up their names, photos and profiles, verifying them as invited guests.Several dozen Chinese police agencies are either testing or using facial-recognition systems, according to facial-recognition firms and state media reports.In Chongqing, two systems identified 69 criminal suspects during the first 40 days they were in use last year, according to       Xu Li,        a co-founder of SenseTime Group Ltd., which provided the systems. Mr. Xu showed a letter from the local police crediting it with the detention of 14 suspects.During the Group of 20 international summit in Hangzhou last fall, Megvii and other firms worked with local police. Surveillance cameras scanned the faces of pedestrians, which an artificial intelligence system checked against a list of criminal and terror suspects. Police were alerted each time the system found a match, leading to the detentions of more than 60 people over a month, according to tallies from the companies.Police in Hangzhou, Chongqing and several other cities identified by companies and state media as using facial recognition didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.For 33-year-old Fu Gui, the technology proved life-changing in a positive way. He was 6 years old when he was kidnapped from his village in Chongqing and sold to a family in faraway Fujian province, according to Fu Guangyou, his aunt and caretaker at the time he was abducted. Years later, he provided his photo at age 10 to a nonprofit group that reunites stolen children with their families. His aunt says she contacted the same group a few years later, submitting a photo of Mr. Fu at age 4.Early this year, the nonprofit got access to Baidu\u2019s facial-recognition program, which matched Mr. Fu\u2019s photos.\u201cI immediately called his father,\u201d Ms. Fu recalled. \u201cFu Gui\u2019s dad didn\u2019t even believe me.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Kim Eckart.Succession planning is important for any family-owned business. But to a family farm, the succession question often has an extra emotional component since ties to work and land can go back several generations. For an adviser, working with these clients is often about finding ways to protect this deep sense of heritage.Business owners in plenty of industries fund their retirement by selling the business to an outside party. That happens in farming, too, when a smaller farm sells to a larger one or to an agricultural corporation. Often, however, farmers wish to keep the farm intact and avoid selling their legacy. The challenge, then, is how to pay for retirement while passing on the business to the next generation.One option may be tapping into the value of farm equipment instead of the land. For example, while most of a farm\u2019s value is typically in the ground, today\u2019s high-tech machinery is so valuable that it also can be part of succession planning. The retiring farmer might hand over land but sell the machinery to the next generation, collecting payments on it over time. That arrangement lets the retiring farmer draw income from something other than the business itself.Another key piece of succession planning is deciding who will inherit the farm. Not every son or daughter stays local; often at least one child stays on the farm, while others pursue separate homes or careers. Should the child who stayed inherit the farm? Or should the business be divided equally among all the children?In cases like these, I\u2019ve found that life insurance can be a useful tool. Say a farm family divides the business between a child who wants to work at the farm and one who doesn\u2019t. The farming heir can buy a life-insurance policy on his parents and eventually use the benefits to buy out the nonfarming heir.Farmers may also decide to protect their land and keep it in the family by putting it into a corporation. In this case, a farmer typically skips a generation, gifting shares to their grandchildren so that the land stays in the family in the event that the farmer\u2019s children divorce. If the grandchildren aren\u2019t farmers, they would rent it out to someone to farm. Ultimately, if the land is sold, the profits may be divided.Planning for the future of any family business requires a big-picture perspective on the part of the adviser. Dollars and cents may drive business decisions, but there are always emotions behind them. Learn family dynamics and what each family member wants for the farm. That will help you guide the strategies the client ultimately pursues.-30-", "news_time": "2017-06-26 11:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-farm-and-fortune-planning-for-succession-in-the-family-business-1498491646", "news_title": "On Farm and Fortune: Planning for Succession in the Family Business", "keywords": "Daniel S.

Also the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber that is strongly anti-Brexit, is also likely to claim more scope to hold up or amend legislation proposed by a minority government.Big questions remain, too, about Mrs. May\u2019s future as leader. Those have been amplified by her unsure handling of the fire in the Grenfell Tower apartment building that killed at least 79 people.Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group consultancy described the Conservative Party\u2019s mood as volatile, saying \u201ca change of Tory leader is still possible within months.\u201d In any event, he wrote in a research note, Mrs. May is unlikely to survive long enough \u201cto do Brexit.\u201d The U.K. expects to leave the EU in March 2019.He said one factor helping her hang on was the absence of a natural successor among leading Conservative politicians.Some Conservatives are also concerned about creating further uncertainty with Brexit negotiations under way, and eager to avoid a further general election in which the main opposition Labour Party could gain further ground and could even lead a new government.David Davis, the Brexit minister and a likely candidate to succeed Mrs. May, said on Sunday that talk of replacing her was \u201cself indulgent.\u201dSpeaking outside Downing Street after the agreement with the Conservatives was announced, DUP leader       Arlene Foster       said the pact \u201cwill operate to deliver a stable government in the United Kingdom\u2019s national interest at this vital time.\u201dThe party agreed to back the Conservatives\u2019 tax and spending proposals and other crucial votes that governments in the U.K. must win to stay in office. It also has agreed to support the government on all legislation pertaining to Brexit, according to a three-page document setting out the terms of the pact. Support on all other policies will be determined \u201ccase by case,\u201d the agreement said.In return, London pledged an extra \u00a31 billion ($1.27 billion) of public spending in Northern Ireland over the next five years in areas including infrastructure, education, health and economic development. Mrs. Foster said the Conservatives also agreed to ditch proposals on overhauling benefit payments for retirees that the DUP opposed.Mrs. May sought to ease concerns that the deal with the DUP would undermine the U.K. government\u2019s role in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998, the British and Irish governments act as impartial mediators between the main Protestant and Catholic parties.Mrs. May said the U.K. remains steadfast in its commitment to the peace process and the revival of Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved government in Belfast, where power is shared between mostly Protestant pro-British political parties including the DUP and Irish nationalists such as Sinn F\u00e9in. The assembly has been suspended since February amid recriminations over a botched renewable-energy plan and other disagreements.The Conservatives won 317 seats in a national election June 8, falling short of the 326 needed for an outright majority in the U.K.\u2019s 650-seat House of Commons. Adding the DUP\u2019s 10 to Mrs. May\u2019s tally gives her a working majority of 13, because Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s seven elected lawmakers don\u2019t take up their seats and three others serve as Parliamentary officers and don\u2019t participate in votes.Sinn F\u00e9in criticized the pact. \u201cIt provides a blank check for a Tory Brexit, which threatens the Good Friday Agreement,\u201d said the party\u2019s president,       Gerry Adams.However, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister,       Simon Coveney,        said he welcomed both parties\u2019 recommitment to the Good Friday Agreement as well as \u201cthe commitment by the British Government to govern in the interests of all parts of the community in Northern Ireland.\u201dWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Conservatives Reach Deal to Rule.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 11:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theresa-may-clinches-deal-with-northern-irish-party-to-support-minority-government-1498473399", "news_title": "Theresa May Clinches Deal With Northern Irish Party to Support Minority Government", "keywords": " brexit, conservatives, dup, miniority government,theresa may, tories,Mrs. May,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Carrie S. Gallaway       is managing partner and an adviser at YorkBridge Wealth Partners in New York. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Jacob Meade.Clear communication between partners about money is important no matter where that money comes from. When money comes from only one spouse, however, a lack of transparency often causes fear and uncertainty for the other spouse\u2014which is where financial advisers can be a big help.I work with a number of married couples who have just one income-producing spouse. With these types of clients, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s crucial that both partners be equally able to engage in conversations on their finances.When couples aren\u2019t open with each other about their finances, the non-income-producing husband or wife can become anxious about cash flow and the bigger picture. Such anxiety stems from a lack of insight on savings and 401(k) contributions, while the income-producing spouse\u2019s access to these details tends to make him or her feel more secure. This disparity puts the non-working spouse in a position of having to ask the working spouse for information if he or she wants to know where they stand. The resulting dynamic can leave the non-breadwinner feeling powerless, causing unnecessary tension and conflict.To help address and avoid these issues, we\u2019ve created a formal structure at my firm based on healthy, regular communication. We actively manage interactions so both spouses are always on the same page with their finances. A cornerstone of this method is making sure that annual face-to-face meetings happen with both spouses in the room. We use the meetings to make sure everyone is up-to-date on the couple\u2019s progress, and go in-depth as far as listening to each partner\u2019s current fears and concerns.We also gain insight on these clients by having them fill out a worksheet on their communication preferences. The exercise gives us actionable knowledge on how each individual prefers we interact with them and at what frequency. When both spouses have the same communication preferences, that gives us a framework to set our appointment schedule. But when their preferences differ, we have to figure out a more sophisticated system of communication, to ensure both partners stay equally informed on their own separate schedules.For example, a non-income-producing client recently came to us worrying that her husband might be investing assets too aggressively. Because she preferred not to join our quarterly calls with her husband, we set up a system where after each call we would draft and email her a summary memo of the discussion. She told us it\u2019s a major relief getting to review these summaries and see how everything is getting done responsibly. The feedback was a reminder how when it comes to client communications, a small change like this can deliver a large benefit.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 11:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-work-with-one-income-couples-1498140001", "news_title": "How to Work With One-Income Couples", "keywords": "Carrie S.

Falcon Heights is patrolled by police from St. Anthony. Mr. Yanez fatally shot Mr. Castile when he informed the officer that he had a gun.Mr. Castile was legally permitted to carry the gun.Mr. Castile\u2019s death drew extra attention because his girlfriend,       Diamond Reynolds,        filmed the aftermath of his shooting on her smartphone and posted it live to             Facebook.       The video was watched by hundreds of thousands of people.A jury earlier this month found Mr. Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter over Mr. Castile\u2019s death, prompting an outcry and protests in St. Paul, Minn.The settlement between the city of St. Anthony Village and Ms. Castile will avoid a wrongful-death lawsuit over the incident.\u201cThe City and the Trustee were able to reach this agreement avoiding a federal civil rights lawsuit which may have taken years to work its way through the courts, exacerbating the suffering of the family and the community,\u201d said the joint statement.The settlement will be paid through the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust, the statement added, and no taxpayer money will be used to fund the settlement.\u201cNo amount of money could ever replace Philando,\u201d the joint statement added. \u201cWith resolution of the claims the family will continue to deal with their loss through the important work of the Philando Castile Relief Foundation.\u201dThe nonprofit was established by family to help victims of gun violence and their families.The city of St. Anthony dismissed Mr. Yanez as an officer shortly after his acquittal.

Now, that work could limit his oversight of some major investigations if he is confirmed as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.While Mr. Wray\u2019s confirmation process is expected to focus on the abrupt firing of the last FBI director,       James Comey,        lawmakers are also likely to raise questions about Mr. Wray\u2019s high-profile defense work.\u201cA thorough hearing process considering any nominee\u2019s background will look into potential conflicts of interest,\u201d said Sen.       Chris Coons,        a Delaware Democrat who is on the Judiciary Committee, which will consider Mr. Wray\u2019s nomination.The White House hasn\u2019t formally sent Mr. Wray\u2019s nomination to the Senate, and no hearings have been scheduled.Mr. Wray recently represented New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closure controversy, and Credit Suisse AG in a major tax investigation in which the Swiss bank pleaded guilty\u2014both matters that faced federal probes. He oversaw a group of lawyers at the firm King & Spalding that specializes in representing clients under criminal investigation, including by the FBI.Under ethics rules, Mr. Wray would automatically be barred from having any involvement in matters he handled personally, and Justice Department officials also are generally blocked for two years from investigations into people or companies represented by their former law firms.Mr. Wray\u2019s firm biography lists more than a dozen recent representations in Justice Department and other investigations, including five Fortune 100 firms, several pharmaceutical companies and a telecommunications company. It is unclear which matters may still be ongoing.Mr. Wray isn\u2019t speaking to the media ahead of confirmation hearings, but       John Richter,        who worked with him at the Justice Department and at King & Spalding, said many of the matters handled by Mr. Wray at the firm wouldn\u2019t cross the desk of the FBI director.\u201cChris is very familiar with the ethics rules that will govern him as FBI director and will consult closely with DOJ ethics personnel so as to avoid conflicts,\u201d Mr. Richter said.Jeff Danik,        a retired FBI supervisor, said Mr. Wray would clearly have to abstain from involvement in some cases.\u201cThere are a significant number of current FBI investigations listed on the King & Spalding website, where surely they have been paid large fees and are responsible for defending those clients,\u201d Mr. Danik said. \u201cThat\u2019s a serious conflict for him as FBI director, and I don\u2019t see how those conflicts are all resolved without recusal on his part.\u201dMost senior FBI executives come from within the agency and have limited issues with former client recusals. Mr. Comey came to his FBI post from a hedge-fund firm, Bridgewater Associates LP. The previous FBI director,       Robert Mueller,        served as U.S. Attorney in San Francisco before his nomination to the job in 2001.The agency has, however, come under scrutiny recently over other potential conflicts.       Andrew McCabe,        now acting director, helped supervise the investigation into Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       email use after his wife had received large donations from a Clinton ally for her state Senate campaign. The FBI\u2019s ethics office had cleared his involvement, but Republicans and others criticized Mr. McCabe for his role in the probe.King & Spalding\u2019s \u201cspecial matters\u201d group was created by Griffin Bell, who was attorney general under President       Jimmy Carter,        and has been led in recent years by Mr. Wray. It has represented a host of clients, including             AT&T,Bank of America,Chevron,       Ernst & Young,             Deutsche Bank,       UPS and             Wells Fargo,       according to the firm\u2019s website.Clients currently listed on the group\u2019s website include a global food-and-transportation company facing criminal and other investigations into alleged immigration and other issues, and a laboratory-services company confronting federal criminal and other investigations into alleged kickbacks, according to the website.The group, made up of 79 lawyers around the world, boasts of handling investigations before 73 of the 93 U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices and every litigating division at the Justice Department. It was named a \u201cwhite collar group of the year\u201d by Law 360, a legal newswire.\u201cWe worked on a mixture of matters over the past year, ranging from life sciences all the way to prominent individuals like Governor Christie...it covers a lot,\u201d Mr. Wray told Law 360 in February.Mr. Wray\u2019s practice has been a lucrative one; the firm averages $2.5 million in profits per partner, according to American Lawyer magazine. Mr. Wray billed the state of New Jersey more than $2.1 million over 1\u00bd years for work on the Bridgegate matter, at a discounted rate of $340 an hour, according to state records.He represented Credit Suisse in a landmark agreement under which the bank pleaded guilty in 2014 to helping American taxpayers hide money overseas and agreed to pay $2.6 billion. Similar conduct has surfaced recently in another of the bank\u2019s units.Mr. Wray also served as a special master in a dispute between Life Care Centers of America Inc. and the Justice Department in a yearslong overbilling investigation that ultimately led to a $145 million civil settlement to resolve allegations that the company had billed Medicare and Tricare, a health plan for military personnel, for unnecessary therapy.Clients currently listed on the group\u2019s website include a global food-and-transportation company facing criminal and other investigations into alleged immigration and other issues, and a laboratory-services company confronting federal criminal and other investigations into alleged kickbacks, according to the website.The group is also representing multiple federal and state public officials in public corruption investigations by federal authorities. The FBI is usually the lead investigator on such inquiries.Still, Mr. Wray\u2019s potential recusals are likely to only impact a \u201cfragment of the FBI\u2019s work,\u201d given the agency\u2019s wide portfolio, said       Ronald Hosko,        a former head of the bureau\u2019s criminal investigative division. But he said the recusals could be an issue when it comes to public corruption cases, since the director is regularly briefed on those.The director also gets involved in investigations when there are disagreements between agents and prosecutors over how to proceed, Mr. Hosko said.Former Attorney General       Eric Holder       may be the government official whose position most closely resembled Mr. Wray\u2019s in recent years. When taking office in 2009, Mr. Holder came from the law firm Covington & Burling, where he had a high-profile criminal defense practice with a focus on marquee clients.Within weeks of his appointment, Mr. Holder removed himself from an investigation into UBS Group AG\u2019s tax evasion because he had represented the Swiss bank on separate employment issues.Mr. Holder also recused himself from any final decision on whether to charge former baseball star       Rogers Clemens       with lying to Congress about steroid use, since Covington & Burling had represented Mr. Clemens.

Now when the bill arrives, she sits still, not even attempting what some call \u201cthe reach.\u201d\u201cIf you reach, you could end up with the entire bill,\u201d said the 23-year-old in Provo, Utah. \u201cNo one is going to stop you.\u201dLove in the time of Tinder is upending an age-old tradition between men and women: that moment when the bill arrives and the woman feints for her wallet\u2014but expects the guy will insist on paying.The popularity of the dating app and others like it means single people are going on more first dates than ever. Many women say they have stopped doing the reach because they are not only more likely to end up splitting the bill, but also more liable to cover all of it. Now when the check arrives, both people often brace themselves for a gunfighter\u2019s staredown.On her 18th birthday, Jaclyn Suchta, an account supervisor in Rochester Hills, Mich., found herself on the losing side. She said she was invited to a movie that day, but at the ticket counter, her date looked at her blankly for several uncomfortable moments, until she ponied up cash for both tickets, plus popcorn and sodas.\u201cIt was so awkward,\u201d she said. \u201cWho makes you pay on your birthday?\u201dAlex Paull, 19, said she recently went on a date with a man she met on Tinder and chose not to reach for the check since he had picked the place and initiated the date.After the man took her home, he sent her a $20 invoice via the mobile-payment app Venmo for her portion of the meal, she said. The West Virginia University student said she blocked him on Venmo and didn\u2019t pay the bill.On Grindr, a dating app primarily for gay men, people are often opting for cheaper dates, such as coffee and cocktails, said Byron Norton-Wolf, a 51-year-old in Orlando, Fla.It is a \u201cgood thing\u201d when both people do the reach at the same time, the singing waiter said, though he added age can be a determinant on same-sex dates. \u201cThe person who doesn\u2019t reach is usually younger.\u201dOne of his dates, however, circumvented the whole process. Before the check arrived, he went to the restroom and said he would be waiting outside.The rules aren\u2019t complicated, according to etiquette experts. \u201cIf you invite, you pay,\u201d said Diane Gottsman, author of \u201cModern Etiquette for a Better Life.\u201d \u201cBut the reality is that the other person may not know the rules or realize it\u2019s a date.\u201dAlexz Poole, a 30-year-old lawyer, said that since moving to New York four years ago, she has noticed a gradual change in the way the reach was being received. At first, her dates would typically intervene and pay the bill, she said, but over time she ended up covering more than her fair share.At a recent drinks meetup, she asked her date if they were planning to order food since they hadn\u2019t specified beforehand. His response: \u201cDon\u2019t you have food at home?\u201dThanks to the growing number of online dating services, the economic dynamics of playing the field have changed. According to analysis conducted by             Deutsche Bank,       paying for two people in New York or San Francisco to go to a movie and have a meal, plus a few beers and taxi rides, comes to about $130. Three of those a week can cost more than $20,000 a year.Some people say they are embracing what they consider to be a more progressive view on gender roles. \u201cI almost feel like it\u2019s rude not to let them pay,\u201d said Miles Bird, a 27-year-old who works in venture capital in San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019d be falling into stereotypes.\u201dMr. Bird said he usually suggests splitting the check before the reach is an option, though he has been forced to pay the entire bill on occasion.\u201cNot reaching when reaching is expected is a kind of reverse power play,\u201d said Chase Amante, founder of Girls Chase, a website aimed at providing dating advice to men. \u201cRather than the man asserting power by paying, the woman asserts power by forcing the man to pay.\u201dA woman who refuses to reach, however, could come off as a \u201cgold digger,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain subset of the population looking for free meals.\u201dThe custom of a man paying on a date is a relic of chivalry that is several centuries outdated and connotes ownership, said Julia Long, a sociology lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University who specializes in feminist theory. \u201cWomen are not commodities to be bought.\u201dMs. Zandamela, who considers herself a feminist, said that since women still tend to earn less than men, it isn\u2019t unreasonable for guys to cover dinner and a movie. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge gender pay gap,\u201d she said. \u201cThe least a guy can do is pay for a date that he initiates.\u201dSome men say they expect to cover the check on a first date, but still hope the woman will reach. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re being used,\u201d said Amir Nobakht, a medical doctor in Los Angeles.He said his guest on a recent date ordered two entrees\u2014pasta to eat at the restaurant and a grilled fish to go. When she went to the bathroom, he asked for separate checks, he said. \u201cI always pay on the first date, but you have to draw the line somewhere.\u201dThe practice of a man paying on a heterosexual date has proved more resistant to change than other gendered norms, said David Frederick, a psychology professor at Chapman University. In a 17,600-person study he published with colleagues in 2015, 39% of the women surveyed said they hoped the man would decline an offer to help pay the bill.\u201cI never expect them to let me pay, but more often than not, it\u2019s happened,\u201d said Katie Hart, an accounts payable manager in Indianapolis. \u201cThey\u2019re like, sure, and, I say, oh, OK, sure.\u201dThe 37-year-old recently went on a date to a downtown restaurant, and the man suggested splitting a burger and fries. When the burger showed up, she said, \u201che cut it very unevenly, looked at it for a few minutes and then took the bigger side.\u201dWhen the check arrived, Ms. Hart said she performed the ritual reach for her credit card, and he agreed to let her pay half without any hesitation. \u201cEven the waitress looked at him, like, are you serious?\u201d\u2014Brian Baskin contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Who Pays on the First Date?

He wanted to learn about Sale\u2019s preparation routine, his strategy for attacking opposing lineups and, most important, which pitches he preferred to throw in various situations.Leon had posed these questions to every starter who joined his team. No one had ever responded like Sale.\u201cHe told me, \u2018I don\u2019t shake, so that\u2019s on you,\u2019\u201d Leon said.Indeed, Sale has established himself as one of baseball\u2019s most dominant pitchers by following a simple, but bizarre rule: Don\u2019t shake off the catcher. Ever.\u201cThat\u2019s the way he is,\u201d Leon added.Most pitchers work in tandem with their catcher but won\u2019t hesitate to request a different sign until they receive the pitch they want to throw. The catcher offers suggestions based on his knowledge and expertise, but the pitcher, the man with the ball in his hand, ultimately calls the game.Not Sale.He will unleash the first pitch his catcher proposes in whatever location his catcher proposes without even the slightest thought, regardless of the batter, the base-runners or the count. Leon confirmed that heading into Monday night\u2019s outing against the Minnesota Twins, Sale hadn\u2019t shaken off once. Tyler Flowers, who was behind the plate for 8,726 of Sale\u2019s pitches for the Chicago White Sox between 2010 and 2015, said that over that entire span, Sale shook him off exactly once, sometime around 2014.\u201cI don\u2019t want to disclose the reason,\u201d said Flowers, now with the Atlanta Braves. \u201cBut there was one time, and it was for a specific reason.\u201dSale\u2019s unusual approach on the mound extends into his work between starts, which goes against every principle of the modern major-league regimen. He doesn\u2019t look at scouting reports on the hitters he will face and virtually never uses video, a staple for players across the sport. Before every game, Red Sox pitching coach Carl Willis convenes with the catcher, the bullpen coach and that day\u2019s pitcher to review the game-plan. Sale declines to attend the meeting. He doesn\u2019t see the point.Those close to Sale in Boston say they don\u2019t know of any other pitcher who goes about his business quite this way. Willis said that during his tenure as Seattle Mariners pitching coach, star right-hander Felix Hernandez would often skip pre-start meetings, but he didn\u2019t mind shaking off the catcher. Leon said that Red Sox pitcher Rick Porcello will sometimes go long stretches without shaking, but he still watches film and studies batters.Sale does none of that. In this age of information, where pitchers have access to mountains of data on every hitter at their fingertips, Sale goes out of his way to avoid it all.\u201cIt just clears his mind,\u201d Willis said. \u201cHis basic thought is, \u2018Whatever I throw, you\u2019re not going to hit it.\u2019\u201dTo Sale, it doesn\u2019t matter what pitch he throws\u2014as long as he throws it well. Thinking about anything else only serves as a distraction. (His commitment to minimizing distractions might also explain why he comfortably shook off an interview request for this story.)A.J. Pierzynski, the retired catcher who caught Sale with the White Sox 83 times between 2010 and 2012, said he recalls Sale occasionally shaking him off very early in his career. That changed as Sale grew closer to Mark Buehrle, a veteran left-hander who overlapped with Sale in Chicago for Sale\u2019s first two big-league seasons.Buehrle, who had his number retired by the White Sox in a ceremony last Saturday, worked quicker than any pitcher in recent memory, turning his rapid pace into a weapon. He accomplished this by putting his full trust in his catcher and refusing to shake off.Pierzynski said Buehrle shook him off just one time, in an exhibition during a MLB tour of Japan in 2002. The batter, future New York Yankees slugger Hideki Matsui, promptly knocked Buehrle out of the game by smacking a line drive off his shoulder.\u201cHe was like, \u2018See why I don\u2019t ever shake off?\u2019\u201d said Pierzynski, now an analyst for Fox Sports.When Sale reached the majors in 2010, the White Sox assigned him a locker near Buehrle, who preached the gospel of working quickly and the value of a pitcher keeping his mind free of clutter. Buehrle also stopped sitting in on pregame meetings after pitching coach Don Cooper noticed he didn\u2019t pay much attention in them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give him any information after that,\u201d Cooper said.Before long, following Buehrle\u2019s lead, Sale stopped shaking catchers off entirely. When Buehrle left the White Sox in 2012, Sale took over his old locker. Entering Monday, Sale averaged 20.3 seconds between pitches, third-fastest in the American League.\u201cHe wanted to go out there and say, \u2018Tell me where you want me to put this fastball, tell me where to put this breaking ball, and I\u2019ll do that.\u2019\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe thing that can apply to anybody is throwing every pitch with the utmost confidence, conviction and belief behind it.\u201dNobody can argue with the results. In his first year with the Red Sox, Sale leads the majors in strikeouts to go along with a strong ERA, making him a favorite to start for the AL in next month\u2019s All-Star Game. He leads the AL in ERA and WHIP since 2010.Since catching Buehrle and Sale, Pierzynski said he has recommended the no-shake strategy to other pitchers. They typically refuse, Pierzynski said, \u201cbecause they were all taught to overanalyze.\u201dGranted, few pitchers possess the stuff of Sale, who boasts a mid-90s fastball, a devastating slider and a Bugs Bunny changeup. He has good reason for feeling confident in all of his pitches at all times\u2014even the bad ones aren\u2019t easily hit.But those who have worked with Sale say the benefits are undeniable. The worst thing for any pitcher is to second guess a pitch selection, to wonder after the fact if he should have thrown something different.Sale never has that problem.\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019d suggest a pitcher not shaking just for the sake of not shaking,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cBut if you have that kind of trust not just in your own stuff, but in your catcher, why not go for it?\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 10:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-chris-sale-never-shakes-off-his-catcher-like-ever-1498487868", "news_title": "Why Chris Sale Never Shakes Off His Catcher.

That has precipitated a round of backbiting and second-guessing, and a debate about whether the party\u2019s success lies in staking out the political center, to claim the votes of independent and moderate Republicans put off by the coarseness and unpredictability of Mr. Trump, or in moving left to capture and spread the passion of those who want a clean and sharp break from the status quo.Democrats might want to pause, though, to consider a broader problem: Why has their hold on the middle class loosened?This is the trend that made the Trump phenomenon possible, and that Mr. Trump in turn appears to have exacerbated. The scope of Democrats\u2019 problem is visible in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Less visible is what the party can do to reverse it.For more than a quarter of a century, the Journal/NBC News poll has been asking Americans which party\u2014the Democrats or the Republicans\u2014would do a better job of looking out for the middle class. In 1990, the Democratic advantage was enormous: By a whopping 29-point margin, 47% to 18%, Americans said the Democrats would do the better job for the middle class.By 2011, the Democratic margin had shrunk to 20 points. Now, in the latest survey completed last week, the Democratic advantage has shrunk to 13 points, the smallest gap ever.This isn\u2019t an incidental data point. In American politics, the middle class occupies hallowed ground that parties yearn to control. Americans with lower incomes want to become part of the middle class, and thus are drawn to the party that can pave the way there. Those already in the middle class want to be assured they won\u2019t slip backward and out of it. And at least some of those who have risen above the middle class are grateful to whichever party and policies gave them the chance to do so.So just about every economic policy from both parties is pitched as a magic elixir for the middle class.\u00a0The question for Democrats is why their pitch doesn\u2019t have the same resonance as before.Part of the answer may lie in the party\u2019s priorities. Democrats\u2019 signature domestic achievement in recent years, the Affordable Care Act, was designed in large measure\u2014and admirably so\u2014to extend health coverage to Americans who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford it. But while providing health security to many low- and middle-income people, it also produced a fair amount of health insecurity to others in the middle class, through higher insurance premiums and shrinking coverage options.Similarly, Democratic efforts to raise the minimum wage speak more loudly to low-income Americans than to the middle class.By contrast, middle-class worries trend more toward finding a way to buy a home and paying for college costs. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel says that\u2019s a reason one of the most politically successful initiatives he has pursued has been a program to provide tuition-free community-college educations to city high-school graduates.Increasingly, middle-class voters also worry about job security. That\u2019s where Mr. Trump has sapped away some of Democrats\u2019 middle-class appeal, particularly with his tough trade rhetoric.\u201cEspecially in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, there is a real belief the country hasn\u2019t stood by them,\u201d says Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, an activist group that has absorbed much of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cIn Iowa, somebody said to me, \u2018We like to make things and grow things.\u2019 Well, good luck making things today.\u201dPart of the issue is cultural. As the Democratic Party has become more centered in urban areas and along the coasts, it has cemented its connection to younger and more highly educated Americans but has lost its appeal to some middle-class and would-be middle-class voters.Hints of all these effects lie within the Journal/NBC News poll. Belief that Democrats are the champions of the middle class is notably low in the Midwest (33%), among rural voters (31%) and among white men with less than college educations (25%). Taken together, those voters make up the core Trump constituency.The problem as well as the potential for Democrats can be found in another set of numbers. Just 20% of self-identified political independents say Democrats do a better job at looking out for the middle class. But belief in the Republicans is almost identically low. Perhaps the Democrats\u2019 challenge is less to move left or right than to craft a message that appeals to them.Write to Gerald F.

He charged that the companies leading the U.S. shale fracking revolution were \u201call hat and no cattle,\u201d failing to meet the basic business requirement of returning more cash to investors than they consumed. The biggest offender, he said, was             Pioneer Natural Resources                  \u2014the \u201cmother-fracker.\u201dWas he right? The price of an exchange-traded fund that tracks the industry, the Van Eck Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF, ticker symbol FRAK, has shed half of its value since his presentation.             Pioneer                   actually did somewhat better. But benchmark U.S. oil prices dropped from nearly $60 a barrel at the time to just over $26 the next February and are 30% lower today\u2014a factor that weighs heavily on energy shares.The heart of his argument is worth examining, though, as U.S. oil output is poised to surpass its 2015 record amid a renewed drilling boom in places like the Permian Basin. Over the past decade\u2014roughly the history of the shale boom and two intervening busts\u2014eight leading U.S. shale producers have collectively generated $414 billion in revenue but had negative free cash flow of $68 billion.There were signs the industry could break that streak this year as technological innovation and a plunge in service costs brought the break-even oil price down by about a third in some locations. Yet analyst free cash flow forecasts for fiscal year 2017 compiled by FactSet show that cumulative expectations for the same eight companies have dropped from just over $1 billion in February to less than $60 million. The obvious explanation is that oil prices have dropped. A big reason for that, though, is shale\u2019s surprising success which has offset supply cuts by big oil exporters.Oil producers will argue that individual projects have had good returns when planned and that their companies are profitable. Yet free cash flow is a bedrock principle in any investment, even if it seems to matter less in some industries. For example, Tesla and Netflix have burned $6 billion and $1.17 billion more in cash than they have generated in the past decade, respectively, yet their shares are near all-time highs. But both can point to a far off, theoretical profit bonanza. Oil producers don\u2019t have that luxury. Measured by the duration of cash flows from a given project, shale producers have the shortest window among energy producers to recover their investment.Yet another shale boom may become a victim of its own success.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 10:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shale-produces-oil-why-not-cash-1498486995", "news_title": "Shale Produces Oil, Why Not Cash?

Durable-goods orders rose 2.8% in the first five months of 2017 compared with a year earlier.

World oil prices stabilized, though they have moved lower in recent weeks. The dollar\u2019s value jumped after last year\u2019s presidential election but has moved lower this year.Total U.S. industrial production rose 2.2% in May from a year earlier, including 1.4% growth for manufacturing output, according to Federal Reserve data. A private-sector gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity, produced by the Institute for Supply Management, showed expansion in May for the ninth consecutive month.Capital expenditures have rebounded modestly, too.

The 300-yard tee shot now feels so routine that it\u2019s easy to forget how exceptional it was 20 years ago. Yet the conclusion of the Travelers Championship on Sunday in Cromwell, Conn., served as a master class on how little that aspect of the game can matter.It wasn\u2019t just what Jordan Spieth did to win in a sudden-death playoff against Daniel Berger: he holed a bunker shot, a feat outdone only by his club-chucking, airborne celebration with caddie Michael Greller. It was also what Spieth didn\u2019t do.No one will remember that Spieth\u2019s first shot on that winning hole veered left, hit a tree and landed only around 265 yards from the tee, requiring a lucky bounce to find the fairway. But the arc of that playoff hole for him was telling.For the tournament, Spieth lost .26 strokes to the field per round with his tee shots. It marked only the fourth time this season that a player has won on the PGA Tour while losing strokes off the tee. But he was that much better than the rest of the field in the other aspects of his game, notably around-the-green shots (1.5 strokes gained per round) and approach shots (1.2).The result was Spieth\u2019s 10th victory at the age of 23. Since World War II, only       Tiger Woods       got to double-digit wins at a younger age.Contrast that outcome with the performance of Rory McIlroy, who gains an enormous advantage over the field with his driver but watches it slip away on the green. McIlroy, the four-time major champion, put on a familiar ball-striking show at TPC River Highlands, where his tee-to-green performance was the best in the field.Yet McIlroy was a non-factor on Sunday and finished tied for 17th. How? His putting performance ranked just 69th in the field. He didn\u2019t just look shaky on the greens. He looked lost, at least from equipment standpoint, using three different putters over four rounds. Shortly before his third round, Golf Channel showed him trying out five different putters on a practice green.In 2016, after missing the cut at the PGA Championship, a disheartened McIlroy said, \u201cI just need to figure out what to do on the greens. I need to have a long, hard think about that.\u201dEleven months later, coming up on three years since McIlroy\u2019s last major title, not much has changed.The lesson isn\u2019t that power off the tee doesn\u2019t matter, or that it matters less than what a player does on and around the green. It\u2019s that there is more than one way to win in golf, and to lose. There is no advantage in one area that can\u2019t be offset by deficiencies elsewhere. There is no disadvantage that can\u2019t be countered by enough excellence in other parts of the game.Especially if you can hole a bunker shot in a sudden-death playoff.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 09:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-jordan-spieths-tee-shots-didnt-matter-1498484585", "news_title": "Why Jordan Spieth\u2019s Tee Shots Didn\u2019t Matter", "keywords": "golf,jordan spieth,pga,pga tour,spieth,travelers championship,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "In Capri, a squabble between two mayors\u2014who are also cousins\u2014highlights a larger debate throughout Italy. While tourism is an important revenue source, many Italians up and down the Italian peninsula would like tourists\u2014at least some of them\u2014to stay away.Last year,       Giovanni De Martino,        the mayor of Capri, was fed up. He watched as ferries arrived from the Italian mainland in rapid succession, disgorging tourists\u2014many budget day-trippers\u2014every five minutes, only to face hourlong waits to board the cable car from the port to the town\u2019s center.Worried that the hordes were endangering the island\u2019s charm and exclusivity, Mr. De Martino launched a push to reduce the frequency of the ferry arrivals to every 20 minutes.But the mayor soon faced a bitter foe: his own cousin,       Francesco Cerrotta,        mayor of Anacapri, the only other town on the island. Mr. Cerrotta immediately took up the fight against his cousin\u2019s attempt to slow the tide of visitors.\u201cSomeone in Capri still dreams of Jacqueline and Onassis strolling along Via Camerelle,\u201d Capri\u2019s main drag, Mr. Cefrotta told Italian media. \u201cCapri needs glamour. But it also needs to fill hotels, restaurants and shops.\u201dStill, recent incidents, such as two tourists swimming nude in the Trevi Fountain and another diving off Venice\u2019s Rialto Bridge, have only strengthened officials\u2019 determination to find ways to keep the hordes at bay. The number of tourists arriving in Italy topped 52 million in 2016, up nearly 30% since 2000.But authorities are finding it devilishly difficult to stop tourists from coming. Efforts to limit incoming visitors are colliding with legal, business and practical challenges.In Florence, a 2016 city decree raising the cost of entry tickets for tourist buses was, in part, struck down by a regional court. The city appealed the decision, winning a temporary suspension of the ruling.The Cinque Terre, the tiny fishing villages on the Italian Riviera, drew 2.5 million visitors last year, 500 times the local population. In response, local officials unveiled a plan this spring to cap the number of tourists allowed onto the picturesque walking trails connecting the five towns. Despite protests, the system got under way in June.Venice, which each year sees 15 million day trippers pour into an area five times the size of New York\u2019s Central Park, has heard more calls from locals and some politicians to limit access to the floating city. But the idea has gone nowhere, in part due to legal hurdles.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to close the city,\u201d said       Paola Mar,        head of tourism for the city. \u201cAnd the law doesn\u2019t permit it.\u201dEarlier this month, Venetians held a symbolic referendum calling for something to be done about the huge cruise ships that disgorge millions of tourists each year and sail perilously close to St. Mark\u2019s Square. They are angry that a 2012 government decree calling for them to be rerouted is so far a dead letter.Some smaller destinations enjoy a special legally protected status that gives them a free hand in checking the flow of tourists. For instance Pinosa, a small island off the Tuscan coast, accepts only 330 people a day, while its neighbor Montecristo allows 1,000 a year. Video surveillance cameras help authorities to enforce the limits.In Capri, Mr. De Martino\u2019s plan to limit ferry service was squelched by regional authorities. But the two cousins have continued to fight over everything from limiting the circulation of huge tourist buses to improving the port to accommodate the flow. \u201cCapri has borne the brunt of unchecked arrivals\u2026we need to do something,\u201d Mr. De Martino argues.This spring, when a fresh surge in crowds on the island sparked new calls for a cap on the number of visitors, the two cousins were again at odds. Over a long holiday weekend in June, almost 45,000 people, mostly day trippers, came to Capri, three times the local population.Write to Pietro Lombardi at Pietro.Lombardi@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Arrivederci, Tourists.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 09:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arrivederci-tourism-1498482003", "news_title": "Their Towns Overrun With Tourists, Some Italians Cry, \u2018Basta!\u2019", "keywords": "capri,isle of capri,italian tourism,italy travel,overcrowded european travel,rome,tourist destinations,tourist overcrowding,tourists in italy,venice,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014            Glencore        GLNCY 1.02%       PLC suffered another setback Monday in a bidding war for Australian coal mines, after the commodity giant\u2019s rival Rio Tinto PLC said it would rather take a sweetened offer from a Chinese company.Rio Tinto restated its preference for             Yancoal Australia Ltd.\u2019s        YAL -11.25%       offer after the company improved its bid to $2.69 billion. Rio Tinto had agreed to sell its Australian coal business, Coal & Allied Industries Ltd., to Yancoal in January for $2.45 billion, but Glencore swooped in earlier this month with its own offers, pushing the price up.The bidding demonstrates renewed appetite for deal-making by Glencore Chief Executive       Ivan Glasenberg       almost two years after the Switzerland-based commodity giant experienced a downward spiral in share price. Glencore has since cut its debt almost in half after selling assets, eliminating its dividend and issuing new shares.Mr. Glasenberg has long wanted to buy Rio\u2019s coal business because the assets sit near Glencore\u2019s Australian coal operations, offering opportunities for synergies. Mr. Glasenberg rose through Glencore as a coal trader, and the company is among the biggest traders of the commodity in the world.,Glencore has now twice unsuccessfully tried to outbid Yancoal for Rio\u2019s Coal & Allied business.The Switzerland-based company first bid $2.55 billion earlier this month, after Yancoal revised its offer to make its $2.45 billion payable upfront. Escalating the bidding on Friday, Glencore submitted an all-cash offer of $2.68 billion, saying its bid was fully funded and worth at least $225 million more than Yancoal\u2019s.Yancoal countered with a bid Rio says is worth around $2.69 billion, comprising $2.45 billion in cash payable in full on completion, as well as $240 million via unconditional guaranteed royalty payments of which $200 million will be received before the end of 2018.Rio Tinto on Monday confirmed its recommendation that shareholders vote in favor of the sale of C&A to Yancoal on the grounds that the sweetened China-backed offer had a strong chance of completing.

Caudill,        chief operating officer for TK Holdings, one of the Takata units that took cover from creditors Sunday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.A forced liquidation would erase thousands of jobs and jeopardize the largest car recall campaign ever launched in the U.S., without doing much for creditors, according to Takata.If the sale strategy fails, Takata will be vulnerable to renewed criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, which has settled accusations the company misled car makers about the dangerous defect, court papers say.Inflator devices in Takata-made air bags can explode, sending shrapnel flying inside autos. At least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries have been linked to the defect. Takata has been sued, but so have the car makers that installed the flawed air bags.Support from car makers will be crucial to getting Takata\u2019s survival plan through the U.S. courts. Honda,             Toyota,Mazda,Nissan,BMW,       Ford and other manufacturers caught up in the recall and air bag litigation top the list of unsecured creditors owed undetermined amounts.In the wake of the bankruptcy filing, some car makers have said they don\u2019t expect to get back what they have spent cleaning up the Takata air bag problem.Unsecured creditors occupy a powerful position in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, one that calls for them to be consulted on major decisions. According to Mr. Caudill, major car makers have been at the bargaining table with Takata for more than a year, working on a way to keep the business alive. No documents have been signed yet, but Takata expects to line up the signatures in time to finalize a U.S. support agreement \u201cno later than July 17.\u201dDriving the negotiations was the need to make good on a $1 billion plea deal with the Justice Department. Takata agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud to settle a two-year government criminal probe.Takata still owes $850 million as part of the plea deal, with the money earmarked for car makers that have been bearing the brunt of the recall.If the company doesn\u2019t pay up, U.S. prosecutors could tear up the plea deal and pursue criminal charges, ending Takata\u2019s hopes of saving its parts-making business.In addition to the billions of dollars owed car makers and car owners, the Takata units involved in the U.S. bankruptcy owe suppliers $118 million. One of the first orders of business in the Takata bankruptcy will be to get permission to pay $36 million quickly to vendors the company deems essential, according to court papers.Takata launched its insolvency proceedings in Japan and the U.S. before all the documents were signed because word of the pending bankruptcy had vendors anxious, Mr. Caudill said in court papers.In both the U.S. and Japan, Takata has struck deals with car makers for purchase commitments and fast payments that will go far to keeping the company going and the supply lines open.The Takata units involved in the U.S. bankruptcy have no funded debt. However, the ultimate parent company has $590 million in funded debt, including $320 million in bank debt and $269 million in unsecured bonds.Takata is being advised by the law firms of Weil Gotshal & Manges and Richards Layton & Finger in the U.S. chapter 11 proceeding, case no. 17-11375.\u2014Sean McLain and Mike Spector contributed to this articleWrite to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Parts Maker Seeks Pledges in Support.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 09:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/takata-counting-on-car-maker-support-to-save-its-business-1498483055", "news_title": "Takata Counting on Car Maker Support to Save Its Business", "keywords": "air bags,auto recall,auto safety,car makers,inflators,Key Safety Systems,TK Holdings,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court could see a blockbuster day\u00a0Monday, facing several major issues to resolve on the last day of its 2016-17 term.The high court has six remaining cases to decide, though the court is being watched most closely for a case it has yet to consider, involving President       Donald Trump\u2019s       plan to temporarily ban travel for people from six Muslim majority countries.Mr. Trump has asked the high court to hear the case and to let his travel ban go into effect before it reaches a final decision.\u00a0\u00a0The president says the ban is needed for national security but lower courts have blocked it, some on the grounds that Mr. Trump improperly targeted Muslims.The justices could say as soon as\u00a0Monday\u00a0morning what they will do with the case.\u00a0\u00a0The court could also say whether it will add other major new cases to its docket for next term, including on gun rights.Of the six cases due for decisions\u00a0Monday, the most prominent is a separation-of-church-and-state matter from Missouri about state grants for playgrounds. The court is considering whether government officials can exclude churches from secular aid programs.It\u2019s also possible that some of the six remaining cases could be deadlocked 4-to-4, because they were argued before Justice       Neil Gorsuch      joined the bench in April, and he would not take part in those decisions.

The company issued $3.8 billion of new debt and exchanged $2.8 billion of old bonds into new debt, paying coupons of up to 8.75%.Still, the bonds fell sharply in their first few days of trading, and on Monday, just days after the issue, they were still trading below their face value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Such a price fall is unusual for newly issued bonds, market analysts say.Evergrande\u2019s bond deal comes on top of a dizzying amount of dollar-bond issuance by Chinese companies this year. Collectively, they have sold about $90.5 billion in dollar debt, nearly as much as the $102.8 billion issued in all of 2016 and already more than the $84.8 billion issued in 2015, according to Dealogic. The year-to-date issuance is a record this century, based on Dealogic data.Alongside the surge, Chinese regulators have in recent months tightened scrutiny over companies wishing to issue bonds overseas. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that China\u2019s banking regulator is checking the borrowings of some of the country\u2019s biggest overseas deal makers, including property giant Dalian Wanda Group. The offshore bonds of many of those companies were hit hard last week, according to research firm CreditSights.Market participants said the fall in Evergrande\u2019s bonds appeared to be mostly due to a large amount of bonds being allocated to buyers. Investors often place larger orders for new bond issues than they want to receive, because they don\u2019t expect to get the full amount of their order.\u201cThe price reaction was predominantly because of the very large volume,\u201d said       Rick Mattila,        international head of market strategy at MUFG Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cInvestors ended up with more bonds than they would have perhaps liked.\u201dEvergrande couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Chinese companies have turned to offshore markets for funding in recent months as Beijing takes steps to bring down the country\u2019s lofty debt levels. Rising yields in China\u2019s government-bond market have made it more expensive for Chinese companies to borrow onshore, since investors generally demand even-higher yields to own corporate bonds because of the risk of default.Falling U.S. Treasury yields have made it more attractive for Chinese companies to issue U.S. dollar debt. The yield on the 10-year Chinese government bond has risen to 3.566% on Monday in Hong Kong from 3.07% at the end of 2016, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has fallen to about 2.135% from 2.43% in the same period, according to Thomson Reuters data.\u201cOne consequence of the deleveraging campaign by the [Chinese] government: Companies have been able to borrow more cheaply offshore than onshore,\u201d said Teresa Kong, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia in San Francisco, adding that she owns some dollar-denominated debt issued by Chinese companies.Much of that dollar debt is being snapped up by Chinese investors who have stashed dollars away offshore, and are familiar with the companies raising debt, market participants say.Some say investors could now become more choosy about dollar debt issued by Chinese companies. \u201cFor high-quality names, the appetite is still there,\u201d said Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Hong Kong.The boom has caught the Chinese authorities\u2019 attention. The National Development and Reform Commission, the country\u2019s economic planning ministry, has required most Chinese companies to register their plans to issue offshore bonds since September 2015. That has operated more like an approval process recently, market participants say.In recent months, the NDRC has cracked down on foreign-debt issuance by property companies and financing vehicles linked to local governments, according to Ying Wang, a senior director at Fitch Ratings in China. On June 12, the ministry issued a statement naming companies that hadn\u2019t complied with registration requirements, and warned others from doing the same.Still, if the debt has a maturity of less than one year, it doesn\u2019t need such approval for issuance, according to the NDRC\u2019s official rules from 2015.Some Chinese companies have recently issued bonds with maturities just shy of one year\u2014including by just a day.             Fantasia Holdings Group Co.       Ltd., which focuses on property, this month issued 364-day notes that pay a coupon of 5.5%. Also in June, Hainan Airlines Hong Kong Co. Ltd. issued 364-day U.S. dollar senior notes that pay a coupon of 5.5%, and Greenland Global Investment Ltd. issued 363-day U.S. dollar senior notes that pay a coupon of 4%.Some analysts are warning investors to be careful of such bonds.\u201cI am generally a bit of a skeptic on this,\u201d said       Harsh Agarwal,        head of Asia credit research at Deutsche Bank. \u201cIf this avenue closes down, you have to be sure that the company can repay the bond.\u201dWrite to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'In China, Debt Boom Is Losing Its Rumble.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 09:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fall-in-evergrande-bond-price-adding-to-market-strains-1498481640", "news_title": "Strains Emerge as China\u2019s Dollar Debt Piles Up", "keywords": "bonds,chian evergrande,corporate bonds,evergrande,China Evergrande Group,HK:3333,Harsh Agarwal,Rick Mattila,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "At             Nestl\u00e9,        NSRGY 0.52%      Dan Loeb       is pushing on a half-open door. That improves the chances of success\u2014but reduces the prospect of big profits.Third Point posted an open letter Sunday evening announcing a $3.5 billion investment in Nestl\u00e9. That may be the activist\u2019s largest ever initial bet, but it only buys a little over 1% of the Swiss packaged-food giant, which is easily Europe\u2019s most valuable company. Most activist campaigns in Europe have relied on much larger stakes.However, that doesn\u2019t doom it to failure. The changes Mr. Loeb is proposing\u2014particularly cost-cutting and the sale of low-growth businesses\u2014aren\u2019t controversial. Investors already expected Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new chief executive,       Ulf Mark Schneider,        to shake the company up, particularly after his announcement early this month that U.S. candy brands like Butterfinger and Baby Ruth are for sale. With a bit of diplomacy, Mr. Loeb can probably count on support from fellow shareholders and cooperation from Mr. Schneider.Nestl\u00e9 has a world-beating portfolio of food brands, including KitKat and Nespresso, but for several years has been plagued with slowing organic growth. It has been more reluctant than peers like Kraft Heinz or\u2014since Kraft Heinz threatened it with a takeover\u2014            Unilever                   to resort to cost-cutting and increasing debt to revive profits. Mr. Loeb clearly has one eye on Unilever\u2019s rocketing share price since Kraft Heinz came calling.The activist\u2019s most awkward demand is that Nestl\u00e9 sell its $31 billion stake in cosmetics giant             L\u2019Or\u00e9al.      Liliane Bettencourt,        the French company\u2019s now 94-year-old minority owner, asked for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s help when trying to fend off political interference in the 1970s. Nestl\u00e9 will be forced to defend its outdated line that the stake is \u201cstrategic.\u201d The market is sniffing action: L\u2019Or\u00e9al stock rose 4% Monday morning. Mr. Loeb wants Nestl\u00e9 to buy back stock with the disposal proceeds.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stock rose 4%, too, to the equivalent of 23 times prospective earnings\u2014its highest since the dot-com era and a premium to the consumer sector. This is the real problem with Third Point\u2019s latest investment: A lot of change has already been priced in since the well-regarded Mr. Schneider\u2014the first outsider to lead Nestl\u00e9 for almost a century\u2014took the reins in January.Investors tempted to ride on Mr. Loeb\u2019s coattails shouldn\u2019t expect quick gains.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 08:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/easy-money-gone-loeb-has-a-tough-road-at-nestle-1498480786", "news_title": "Easy Money Gone, Loeb Has a Tough Road at Nestl\u00e9 ", "keywords": "baby ruth, butterfinger, nestle shareprice, nestle stake, shareholder activists,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,Dan Loeb,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate funding,share capital,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,management,corporate actions,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,food,beverages,tobacco,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Europe\u2019s solution to the failure of two small Italian banks poses two big questions: why weren\u2019t they dealt with under the tough new resolution regime and how did             Intesa Sanpaolo        ISNPY 0.10%       get such a good deal to take on their good assets?The answer to the first is pragmatic and investors might find a worthwhile lesson in it. The answer to the second is more worrying and looks like a backward step for European finance.The two failing banks, Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, are being liquidated under normal bankruptcy rules and Intesa is taking their good assets with a \u20ac4.8 billion cash subsidy. Of that, \u20ac3.5 billion will support Intesa\u2019s capital ratio so it isn\u2019t dented by the extra assets on its balance sheet and \u20ac1.3 billion is to cover the cost of closing two-thirds of the Veneto banks\u2019 branches and offering voluntary layoffs to one-third of their staff. There are also billions of euros of unfunded guarantees against legal and other risks.This deal will boost Intesa\u2019s earnings by 5% to 7% by 2020, according to analysts, without costing the bank a penny in financial effort.Europe\u2019s resolution authorities said the banks needn\u2019t face the resolution process because they weren\u2019t a risk to financial stability. But there is a big contradiction here: Intesa\u2019s CEO,       Carlo Messina,        said the banks\u2019 failure would have hurt the entire Italian banking system and threatened Italy\u2019s recovery.In truth, it is the resolution regime that was most likely to provoke financial crisis by enforcing losses on senior bondholders and depositors. This is because a resolution requires that at least 8% of all liabilities of a failing bank must suffer losses before any public money can be used. The equity and junior debt in these two banks didn\u2019t cover that, which would have left owners of the senior bonds and the banks\u2019 deposits facing losses. And that risked creating a broader panic in Italy.Normal bankruptcy avoids this and pragmatically that is surely the right choice. The relief is palpable in a broad rally for Italian bank stocks on Monday.Investors could foresee similar action in future by checking where that 8% mark sits in their banks. However, resolution authorities have hurt their reputation by not explaining this plainly. Regulators should have discretion to act in the wider interest, but transparent reasoning is crucial to public trust.However, none of this explains why Intesa got such a good deal and why state aid was allowed. Granted, Italy will end up with fewer branches and bank workers, which is good in an over-banked country.But while Intesa is being paid to look after senior bonds and depositors, it has promised \u20ac5 billion of new credit in the Veneto region this year in return for that support. That looks like state-directed help for companies through cheaper access to funding than the market alone would provide.European governments have a long history of helping banks fund industry cheaply. Such indirect state aid perpetuates the link between public money and banking in dangerous ways, which is precisely what global rewriting of bank rules since 2008 was meant to stop.Europe\u2019s competition authorities, who rule on state-aid matters, appear to have given tacit approval to the old ways of doing business. Its decision on these small banks sets a worrying precedent.Write to Paul J.

Alissa Newendorp has her eyes on the University of Northern Iowa and eventually New York City.\u00a0Natasha Shipp imagines working as a lobbyist in Des Moines or Washington, D.C.\u201cHow are we going to replace that workforce?,\u201d said Clow\u2019s chief talent strategist, Tiffany Tremmel. \u201cThere are a lot of people leaving the community, and they\u2019re not coming back.\u201dAs more young people decide to pursue four-year degrees, college towns are siphoning students out of the rural heart of the Farm Belt and sending them, degrees in hand, not back to\u00a0Oskaloosa\u00a0but to the nation\u2019s urban centers.Overwhelmingly, University of Iowa students after graduation either stay near the university or scatter to Chicago,\u00a0Des Moines or other big cities, according to Emsi, a Moscow, Idaho, advisory firm that analyzes labor markets. In 2014, Mahaska County sent some 170 people to Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa, according to Census data, while Johnson County sent only about 20 people back. As recently as 2000, Mahaska County was sending 73 people to Johnson County and nearly as many, or 71, came back.The outflow of young adults is one reason the population of Mahaska County is standing still.\u00a0It has dipped 1% since 2000, while Johnson\u2019s population has grown 32%.Other states are struggling with rural population outflow to state-university towns. In 2014, Georgia\u2019s rural Pike County sent roughly 116 more people to Clarke County, home of the University of Georgia, than Clarke County sent back. In Pennsylvania, small-town Clarion County sent about 101 more people to Centre County, home of Penn State, than it got back. In Kansas, Barton County sent some 46 more people to Douglas County, home of the University of Kansas, than it got back.Many young people in rural communities now see college not so much as a door to opportunity as a ticket out of Nowheresville. The result is a redistribution of educated graduates to urban areas, which is helping to widen the divide in educational attainment between urban and rural areas.Cargill\u2019s plant in Eddyville. which processes 8 million bushels of corn a month into corn oil, citric acid, cattle feed and other products, is more dependent than ever on college graduates to run its increasingly high-tech operations. Craig Ambrose, a facilities manager there, said he has jobs to offer, some requiring college degrees: 47% of the plant\u2019s 500 employees have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and an additional 21% have a two-year associate\u2019s degree. He is struggling to find college-graduate candidates for two senior electrical engineer positions.\u201cWhen you are trying to attract high-school and college grads, they want to be close to entertainment, to night life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at Eddyville on a map, it\u2019s not so easy to draw them in.\u201d Mr. Ambrose says he has seen the phenomenon with his own children, including a son now at the University of Iowa.His son\u2019s plans after graduation? \u201cHe\u2019s not completely sure,\u201d Mr. Ambrose said with a laugh. \u201cBut I can tell you it\u2019s not southern Iowa.\u201dAt Musco Lighting, which builds lighting systems for businesses and sports facilities, Shelly Herr, human resources manager, says the Oskaloosa company keeps an eye on local high-school students who show promise in engineering and establishes contact with them early, in some cases before graduation. The company also forms relationships with engineering professors at Iowa State University in an attempt to find students interested in Mahaska County\u2019s rural lifestyle.\u201cIf there is an Iowa State engineering student who wants to stay in Iowa, we\u2019re going to start talking to that kid as a freshman,\u201d\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Herr said.Some students talk about coming back to raise a family\u2014if they can find a job in their chosen field.\u00a0And not everyone is leaving. Oskaloosa\u00a0High grad Josh Van Donselaar plans to take a part-time job at Agriland FS, an agriculture-supply company in the area, while working on the family farm with an eye toward taking it\u00a0over\u00a0someday. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to stay home\u00a0from\u00a0college,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t like school that much. I came to the realization one day that there is room on the farm for me, so I decided to stay home.\u201dBut in bypassing higher education, Mr. Van Donselaar is the exception among his fellow graduates.Mark Willett, general manager at the Clow Valve plant, grew up about an hour north of\u00a0Oskaloosa in tiny Victor, Iowa. At his father\u2019s urging, he went to Simpson College, a\u00a0small liberal-arts school near Des Moines, the first in his family to earn\u00a0a four-year degree. \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t interested in me staying there and farming,\u201d Mr. Willett said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go, but he wanted me to go out and make something of myself.\u201dAfter years of traveling the country, working at jobs from plant to plant, Mr. Willett worked his way back to rural Iowa, near where he started. He says he sees that path as less likely for the current generation: His 11-year-old son is already telling him he wants to go the University of Southern California.Mr. Willett says children are more connected to the broader world than they used to be, with a better understanding and a hunger for the world outside their immediate experience: He recalls it wasn\u2019t until he got to college that he even saw cable television; now, school children have the world brought to small screens they keep in their pockets.Whatever the pull, most of\u00a0Oskaloosa High School\u2019s recent grads see their futures somewhere else.\u201cWe have, like, five restaurants in town. Every time you go out, it\u2019s like a reunion,\u201d said 2017 grad John Hirl, who is heading to Drake University in the fall because he wants to live in Des Moines. \u201cIt\u2019s all just very predictable.\u201dWrite to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'In Rural America, Students Chase Big-City Dreams.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rural-youth-chase-big-city-dreams-1498478401", "news_title": "Rural Youth Chase Big-City Dreams", "keywords": "millennials,rural counties,rural population,state college,state university,u.s. population trends,urban population,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "The Swiss lender             Credit Suisse                   denied receiving excessive fees for its role in arranging a controversial $2 billion loan package to the southern African nation of Mozambique.The risk management firm Kroll Inc. said in a summary of an audit released Saturday that at least $500 million of the package was unaccounted for and that government officials have failed to adequately explain how the rest was spent.Kroll said Credit Suisse and Russia\u2019s VTB Capital had charged nearly $200 million in fees to help arrange the loans from private sector investors abroad, which were directed to the tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management, an amount it said was far in excess of the market average.Credit Suisse late Sunday denied the allegation, saying the assertion that it took in $100 million for its role in securing the loans was \u201cincorrect and misleading.\u201d\u201cBanking fees for Credit Suisse totaled $23 million\u2014roughly 2.3% of the total financing and in line with comparable emerging market financing transactions,\u201d it said. The bigger part of the fees were \u201ceffectively passed on to syndicate loan members or, in the case of EMATUM, to note investors that purchased the debt,\u201d it said.Discovery of unapproved loan credits to the three companies in 2013 and 2014 led the IMF and Western donors to halt budget support to Mozambique last year, a move that has plunged the country into a budget crisis.The IMF said it intends to send a staff mission to Mozambique next month to discuss the Kroll audit and \u201cpossible follow-up actions, including working with the authorities to address concerns related to the management of public resources.\u201dThe audit by Kroll, which was financed by the Swedish embassy in the Mozambican capital Maputo, said EMATUM, Proindicus and MAM had almost no revenue. It also accused senior officials of the companies of concealing facts and avoiding auditors.It also said that surveillance vessels and other assets that were purchased by Mozambique the Abu Dhabi-based Privinvest using the loan money were overpriced.Privinvest, said in a statement that it was \u201cdisappointed to see that the grant of a valuable intellectual property was not included as a valued asset, as enabling the creation of a shipbuilding and maintenance capability.\u201dThe chief executive of the three firms,       Antonio do Rosario,        who is a senior official at the country\u2019s secret service, declined to comment.Write to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 07:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-denies-charging-excessive-fees-in-mozambique-loan-scandal-1498478383", "news_title": "Credit Suisse Denies Charging Excessive Fees in Mozambique Loan Scandal", "keywords": "mozambique economy,mozambique politics,Kroll,Credit Suisse Group,CSGN.EB,CS,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,banking,commercial banking,insurance,financial investments,risk management,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,credit,business consultancy,financial services,integrated banks,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Good morning. Back to the grind today after (hopefully) a productive week at the Cannes Lions ad fest. You can find the official list of all the big awards winners here.You\u2019re not a digital player these days unless you\u2019re going after high-quality video content. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joe Flint and Deepa Seetharaman have the skinny on Facebook\u2019s discussions with Hollywood studios and agencies to produce TV-quality original programming, which the social network wants to target at 13 to 34-year-olds by late summer. Facebook has indicated it is willing to commit to production budgets of up to $3 million an episode, according to people familiar with the situation, which is similar to high-end cable TV shows. The social network is also after short-form (mostly unscripted) videos, where it\u2019ll guarantee a minimum ad revenue share of $5,000 to $20,000 an episode to content producers such as BuzzFeed, ATTN and Refinery29.\u2014Viewability\u2014Facebook will be hoping original shows make people stop in their tracks and pay attention to videos and ads, rather than scrolling through the feed at a million miles an hour. Digiday reports that some agency execs who have been using Facebook\u2019s recently allowed third-party measurement capabilities have been surprised to find that viewability rates on video ads can be \u201cas low as 20%, going up to 30%.\u201d Measurement firm Integral Ad Science says the average rate for video ad viewability on other sites around the web is 50%.Google said it will stop scanning people\u2019s email for keywords in order to deliver more relevant ads to them, WSJ reports. Free Gmail users will still see ads above their emails, but the ad targeting now will be based on the other data Google holds about them, ranging from their location to their internet searches and web history. Scanning the contents of emails has been contentious ever since Google launched Gmail in 2004, and the company is subject to a federal lawsuit that accuses the firm of violating privacy laws for mining the emails of non-Gmail users. Google, which is trying to sell more technology to businesses, doesn\u2019t scan the emails of its corporate accounts for ad targeting. As WSJ\u2019s Jack Nicas wrote: \u201cGoogle appears to be betting that reassuring its lucrative corporate customers that their emails are safe is worth the trade-off.\u201d Nobody wants to look creepy, after all.If you weren\u2019t at Cannes\u2014or you were there, but too busy to get a sense of the big themes from the festival\u2014my CMO Today colleague Suzanne Vranica has you covered. The discourse was decidedly bleak this year, with the biggest talking points including Madison Avenue\u2019s lack of diversity, a shortage of transparency in the digital ad business and the power of the Google and Facebook \u201cduopoly.\u201d And then there was that small matter of Publicis stating its plans to sit out the festival next year.

The \u201ccontent recommendation\u201d space\u2014companies that provide those sponsored recommended article links you see on publisher websites\u2014has become ever more crowded in recent years. The bigger players have been looking to broaden their scope beyond just offering those formats in order to stand out and prevent becoming commoditized. Outbrain had recently expanded into offering tools to help editors manage and personalize their homepages and had been experimenting with publisher chatbots, but it\u2019s now pulling back following a lack of demand. The company now wants to focus efforts on programmatic ads and its data products. Outbrain began letting AppNexus customers bid on its inventory in May this year, so offering up programmatic inventory to third parties outside its closed marketplace is a relatively new thing too.Pandora co-founder Tim Westergren is reportedly planning to step down as CEO once a replacement is found.

Politics are checked at the dock, with no talk of rebels or the regime, say the Syrian entertainers on board, who hail from different political backgrounds. And out of sensitivity to the war\u2019s tragedy, the organizers strain to curb the debauchery common to Istanbul\u2019s party boat scene.\u201cThis was a challenge for us,\u201d said       Ahmad Abdul Ghani,        the business\u2019s 33-year old founder.\u00a0\u201cWe put our heads together and decided the best way would be to focus on folklore and culture, rather than a party environment.\u201dMr. Abdul Ghani began the cruise in 2015 with dual aims: to bring Syrians who fled the war to Turkey together and to draw other Arabs enchanted by\u00a0Syria\u2019s\u00a0cultural traditions but now also locked out of the country.The boat\u2019s advertising slogan for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan is \u201cour joy is in\u00a0being together,\u201d a jingle that rhymes in Arabic. The cruise has been packed throughout the holy period, which ended on Saturday, due to a discounted price and the lure of traditional entertainment.On a recent evening, Syrian entertainers dressed in baggy\u00a0shirwal\u00a0pants roamed the boat twirling their theatrically upturned mustaches, a throwback to when such facial hair was the measure of a man\u2019s dignity and authority.A\u00a0hakawati, or storyteller, regaled the audience with\u00a0morality tales, evoking traditional wise men of Damascus. A three-piece band sang classic Arabic tunes as guests dined on specialties from Homs and Aleppo.Ruba Khawaja,        who left Damascus two years ago with her three school age children, snapped selfies. \u201cThis is a way to remember the good old days,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get out of our pain.\u201dThe cruise isn\u2019t without controversy. Another\u00a0family from Damascus watched the entertainment disapprovingly, without standing or clapping, saying Ramadan was a time of reflection and austerity.When a woman began to shimmy slowly around her dance partner, her hips moving in an Arabic belly dance, the entertainment troupe gathered quickly around them with their drums and swords, pushing the duo into a group procession.\u201cWhen something starts to go overboard, we rush in there with our swords to say: \u201cRemember, this is a cultural performance,\u2019\u201d said       Mohammad Rifai,        procession chief, chuckling.On a Facebook page for the cruise, some Syrians called it expensive and inappropriate. One Turkish user wrote that the Syrians should \u201cgo home.\u201dHalf of Syria\u2019s prewar population of 23 million has been displaced since 2011 when the war began, and around 3 million now live in Turkey, more than in any other nation. Turkey has proudly embraced them, even as both sides acknowledge mutual weariness in a war with no end in sight.The cruise staff tout their accomplishments. The business gives jobs to dozens of Syrians who had otherwise struggled to find work in Turkey, they say, and it has reaffirmed apolitical cultural pride among exiled Syrians.\u201cIt\u00a0caught\u00a0people\u2019s attention,\u201d Mr. Abdul Ghani said, who left Damascus in 2013. It shows that \u201cSyrians aren\u2019t just here as refugees.\u201dThe four-hour cruise\u2019s regulars, who can afford the normal $50-per person fee, include Arab tourists and\u00a0wealthier Syrian families. There also is a younger crowd for which the evening is a splurge, but also a catharsis.Young Syrians like       Mohammed Fadel,        who left his family behind in Aleppo, stomp and sing the night away. Mr. Fadel initially struggled to learn Turkish and settle in when he arrived four years ago, but now works two jobs, as a paralegal and a translator.\u201cI miss my country. I miss my family,\u201d he said, catching his breath and mopping his brow after dancing with friends from his hometown. \u201cBut at the same time, I am happy we are gathered together here.\u201dAs the cruise neared Turkish land, the mood swung from upbeat to somber at the last performance:\u00a0a scene drawn from a popular Arabic television series set in a fictional Damascus neighborhood between the world wars.Dramatized by a melancholy Syrian melody,\u00a0the scene involved a dispute over gold between two neighbors\u2014the moral evoking peace and forgiveness.\u201cThis is how the people of Syria were raised: on\u00a0truthfulness, loyalty,\u00a0forgiveness, and generosity,\u201d the lead actor proclaimed to claps and tears from the audience.Write to Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 07:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exiled-by-war-syrians-in-turkey-take-cruise-down-memory-lane-1498477633", "news_title": "Exiled by War, Syrians in Turkey Take Cruise Down Memory Lane", "keywords": "syria crisis,syrian civil war,syrian conflict,syrian rebels,turkey and syria,political,general news,national,public security,cruises,migration,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,risk news,travel,military action"}, {"content": "Both Adam Price, chief executive of Homer Logistics, and television show host Conan O\u2019Brien, had been turned away by incredulous customers when the men tried to deliver restaurant meals in New York.While Mr. O\u2019Brien attempted to deliver Chinese food for laughs, Mr. Price was cycling around Hell\u2019s Kitchen to figure out if his startup idea would work back in 2014. He says Homer\u2019s logistics software, whose goal is to maximize deliveries per hour, has been developed to be useful in real-life situations.Now Homer employs about 300 couriers in New York, who fulfill orders for restaurant, liquor and grocery customers. FreshDirect\u2019s Food Kick program is a customer, for example.The startup has been capitalizing on the broader drive toward delivery across consumer products. Companies like McDonalds,             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       and others are booting up local delivery efforts. So are order aggregators like             GrubHub,       which have been adding delivery management as well.Unlike many other companies offering local delivery services, Homer hires its workers as W-2 employees, and provides them with benefits and even stock options.\u201cYou don\u2019t see that on the West Coast,\u201d said Maria Gotsch, president and CEO of the Partnership Fund for New York City. Ms. Gotsch said that the way Homer treats its couriers is a primary reason her fund, which has a social mission, just backed the company.Homer has just closed its Series A round at $8.5 million. Two Sigma Ventures led the round, with participation from Lerer Hippeau Ventures and RSE Ventures. Besides Partnership Fund for New York City, new investors also include Rosecliff Capital and Drake Capital Management. Homer has raised $14.5 million to date. Earlier investors include Brooklyn Bridge Ventures, Rugged VC and Haystack Fund II.Employee couriers make for a more profitable and ethical business, Mr. Price said. Each Homer delivery is profitable on a unit-economics basis, he said. Businesses pay $5 to $12 per order. However, he did admit fast growth is unlikely.\u201cUsing contractors lets you scale faster, and removes a huge amount of red tape around compliance issues,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cIf you want to sacrifice a hundred years\u2019 of worker\u2019s rights,\u201d he said, you\u2019d get a scalable business. But it\u2019s unlikely to be sustainable, he added.Several service startups like HomeTeam and Managed by Q use W-2 workers, but relying on freelancers is still a major way in which on-demand businesses operate.Homer fulfills between 100,00 and 200,000 orders per month, both using its own workforce and by licensing its software to other delivery companies. It fulfills orders that come from a variety of consumer-facing ordering applications.Besides on-demand delivery startups like DoorDash and PostMates, Homer is also facing competition from upstart logistics software providers like Bringg and Onfleet Inc.", "news_time": "2017-06-26 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/homer-logistics-aims-to-make-delivery-good-for-workers-and-business-1498476601", "news_title": "Homer Logistics Aims to Make Delivery Good for Workers and Business", "keywords": "final-mile delivery,food delivery,last-mile delivery,new york startups,on-demand startups,GrubHub,GRUB,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Homer Logistics,corporate funding,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,employee benefits,private equity,venture funding,recruitment,small business start-up capital,small,medium businesses,workers pay,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,caterers,mobile food services,couriers,messengers,freight transport,logistics,leisure,arts,hospitality,transportation"}, {"content": "SAN JUAN DEL RIO, Mexico\u2014Mescal, tequila\u2019s smokier cousin, has made the leap from the rugged mountains of Mexico to trendy bars from New York to Los Angeles.But the world\u2019s biggest liquor companies are struggling to parlay its popularity into substantial profits. The factors driving mescal\u2019s rise\u2014its handcrafted production, its connection to Mexico\u2019s indigenous village culture and the long growing time required of the agave used in its distillation\u2014are also why the spirit is hard to produce on a large scale.That isn\u2019t keeping the industry from trying. Earlier this month, France\u2019s             Pernod Ricard SA       said it bought a controlling stake in Del Maguey Single Village\u00a0Mezcal, Mexico\u2019s largest\u00a0mescal\u00a0exporter. Del Maguey was founded in 1995 by Ron Cooper, an itinerant surfer and artist from Los Angeles.Pernod Ricard joins Bacardi Ltd., Jose Cuervo and             Diageo                   PLC, which all have either acquired, launched or struck distribution deals with high-end mescal brands in the past three years.It is too early to say whether these investments will prove profitable. But as U.S. consumers drink more cocktails, rising sales of mescal could help pad liquor firms\u2019 earnings amid sluggish growth in other big alcohol categories, such as rum and vodka, said Milena Redzic, an associate analyst with AllianceBernstein in London.A steady decline in world-wide alcohol consumption accelerated last year, falling 1.4%, according to industry research firm IWSR, due mainly to flagging interest in beer and wine. Cocktails, however, have been a rare bright spot, especially in the U.S., where sales of spirits grew 2.6% last year, more than double the growth of wine sales.Globally, mescal sales have increased 17% annually, on average, in the last decade, Ms. Redzic said.\u201cIt definitely fits very well in the overall consumer preferences in the U.S., where people want a lot of provenance and a lot of story in what they\u2019re drinking,\u201d she said.Export demand for mescal surpassed domestic consumption in Mexico for the first time last year, according to the country\u2019s\u00a0mescal\u00a0regulator. Producers sold a record 640,000 cases both inside and outside Mexico. Exports to the U.S. rose 27% to 140,000 cases.Even with the consistent growth, mescal had just $124 million in sales last year, according to IWSR. In comparison, tequila, which is made from a single variety of agave known as Weber Blue, had $6.9 billion in sales. Single-malt scotch, another premium liquor with humble roots, posted sales of $5.9 billion.AllianceBernstein estimates that Pernod Ricard might have paid between $30 million and $40 million for Mr. Cooper\u2019s\u00a0mescal\u00a0brand, based on typical gross sales margins and valuations in the premium-spirits market. Mr. Cooper and Pernod Ricard declined to comment on the deal\u2019s terms.Pernod Ricard acknowledges that\u00a0mescal\u00a0is still a tiny market, but cited growth potential in its decision to buy Del Maguey, which sold 35,000 cases worth $15.4 million last year, almost all of it in the U.S.\u201cIn the U.S.\u00a0mescal\u00a0is still under 150,000 cases a year,\u201d said       Jeff Agdern,        a senior vice president with Pernod Ricard USA. \u201cThere was a time when Irish whiskey was under 200,000 cases a year and look where it is today.\u201d Some 3.8 million cases of Irish whiskey were sold in the U.S. last year.Many producers and industry watchers don\u2019t think\u00a0mescal\u00a0can grow at anything like the pace of whiskey.\u201cThis stuff is made by farmers, not in factories,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, Del Maguey\u2019s founder. \u201cWe\u2019re exporting more\u00a0mescal\u00a0because people want to drink the good stuff, the artisanal, handmade stuff.\u201cHow could you scale up and still have good quality? That would make it tequila, amigo.\u201dHere in San Juan del Rio, a village of roughly 2,000 people about three hours from the state capital of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, indigenous families have made\u00a0mescal\u00a0by hand for hundreds of years.Workers harvest enormous agave plants from mountainside plots, then use mules to haul them to family-run copper-pot distilleries called palenques, many of them far from paved roads. There the plants are ground into a pulp and fermented naturally, with no yeast or other additives, then distilled into the clear, strong spirit.Mescal is of similar strength to tequila, ranging from 40% to 50% alcohol content by volume.Santiago Su\u00e1rez, a 31-year-old Mexico City native, founded\u00a0Mezcal\u00a0Amores, which last year sold 11,000 cases of its Amores and Amaras brands to U.S. importers for about $3 million.This year, he launched a new factory near Oaxaca City to produce a lower-priced brand of\u00a0mescal\u00a0known as Verde, aimed at bartenders. He hopes the new line can produce big volumes without sacrificing quality, to help cut costs through economies of scale.But getting small palenques to meet monthly production targets is a constant struggle, Mr. Su\u00e1rez said. He said some master distillers of mescal and agave growers have borrowed money from him, purportedly for new distilling equipment, but ended up spending it on new cars, washing machines or lavish village weddings and baptisms.On a recent afternoon here, Mr. Su\u00e1rez tried to explain mescal math to three of his producers. Roberto Luis Hern\u00e1ndez, a farmer who has been making mescal for 60 years, asked why Mr. Su\u00e1rez couldn\u2019t pay him more.Mr. Su\u00e1rez explained that, to cover the costs of logistics, marketing and markups charged by importers and distributors in the U.S., he already has to charge a retail price of more than $40 per bottle, which is at the high end for mescal. Even so, his firm, Mezcal Amores, has been losing money for five years.\u201cIf I raise my prices, even by a few dollars per bottle, there are 50 other brands of mescal waiting to sweep in and sell their product to the same restaurant,\u201d Mr. Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cThe competition is brutal.\u201dWrite to Robbie Whelan at robbie.whelan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Liquor Companies Go on a Mescal Binge.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/liquor-companies-binge-on-mescal-but-cant-get-enough-1498474801", "news_title": "Mescal Math: Why It\u2019s So Hard to Profit From Tequila\u2019s Smokier Cousin", "keywords": "agave,cocktail recipes,mescal,mexican fire water,mexico liquor,mezcal,tequila,Diageo,DEO,Pernod Ricard,RI.FR,Del Maguey Single Village\u00a0Mezcal,Bacardi,Jose Cuervo,Mezcal\u00a0Amores,Milena Redzic,Santiago Su\u00e1rez,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,beverages,tobacco,distilling,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"}, {"content": "Puerto Rico has no cash and can\u2019t borrow money anymore. So it is looking to sell itself off in parts.The troubled U.S. territory is preparing to seek bids in coming months from private companies willing to operate or improve seaports, regional airports, water meters, student housing, traffic-fine collections, parking spaces and a passenger ferry, according to a government presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The goal is to attract more than $500 million in investment starting this summer, according to a spokesman for the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority. Future possibilities include the island\u2019s power utility, water and sewer system and waste management, according to presentations made in April to private investors.Puerto Rico officials haven\u2019t disclosed exactly how they plan to use any proceeds. The government currently needs cash to pay down debt, run operations and for other purposes.Potential deals are a cornerstone of a new plan to revitalize the territory, which in May was placed under court protection, the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 predicts public-private partnerships launched over the next three years will bring $5 billion in new investment and 100,000 jobs to Puerto Rico. Economic projections in the commonwealth\u2019s revitalization plan are based in part on the completion of public-private partnership deals.It\u2019s an ambitious goal. U.S. public-private transportation projects\u2014the most common type of partnerships\u2014have attracted about $30 billion in total private and public investment since 1993, according to Public Works Financing newsletter\u2019s P3 Projects Database.\"I hope it happens but I recognize it\u2019s aggressive,\u201d former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortu\u00f1o, who created the Public-Private Partnerships Authority, said of the $5 billion target.In public-private partnerships, the government allows private firms to lease and operate public infrastructure for decades in exchange for upfront cash or a promise of long-term improvements. Some arrangements also involve building new infrastructure. Unlike municipal bonds, public-private partnerships insulate investors from the government\u2019s financial distress: The money typically flows straight to the private operator without ever passing through government officials\u2019 hands.Proponents say privately run projects are typically more efficient and well-run than public projects, creating savings that lower the overall cost.Critics of the partnerships say governments are pledging away revenues they need to fund core services in exchange for infrastructure improvements that could cost less if publicly financed. In one example, after Chicago leased its parking meters to a private firm in 2008, the city\u2019s inspector general found the firm\u2019s $1.157 billion upfront payment was $974 million less than what the city would have gotten from operating the meters itself.\u201cJust as it is imprudent to sell your house to make a monthly credit card payment, valuable governmental assets shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a one-shot budget solution,\u201d said Chris Hamel, head of municipal finance at RBC Capital Markets, speaking generally about public-private partnerships.Puerto Rico has had issues in the past with private partners.Former Gov.       Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla       tried to find partners for a passenger ferry from the mainland to the islands of Culebra and Vieques. But the government couldn\u2019t afford to put down collateral to guarantee to a private operator that it would make payments to supplement ferry fares, and prospective partners lost interest.Rick Newman, a developer and owner-operator of hotels in Puerto Rico who runs a private ferry service, opted against bidding to operate the Culebra and Vieques ferry under Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s plan. He said the proposed partnership carried too much risk. He said he would consider a new partnership, but not if the private partner is expected to rely solely on passengers for revenue.\u201cIf the request for proposals comes out and says you have to live off of the fare box, the government may not find a private operator,\u201d Mr. Newman said.Other public-private partnerships in Puerto Rico have done better.In 2009, then-Gov. Fortu\u00f1o pushed through legislation creating an authority that could move forward with public-private deals without legislative approval. Puerto Rico\u2019s largest airport is run by a public-private partnership.The authority\u2019s first major deal was a decision to lease the island\u2019s busiest road, the Jos\u00e9 de Diego Highway, and a shorter nearby road. Puerto Rico got $1.08 billion in upfront cash\u2014almost all of it went to pay off debt\u2014and a promise from the private firm, Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico LLC, to invest about $350 million in the roads, according to the Federal Highway Administration.The private firm made a range of improvements, paving and widening the expressway and enhancing toll-collection efforts. It also raised prices for drivers by 20% since 2011; driving from end to end now costs $4.45.Mr. Fortu\u00f1o said without private investment, he wouldn\u2019t have had the upfront capital to make needed safety improvements. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said.The private operator\u2019s owners, Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners and the Spanish infrastructure firm             Abertis,       each received about $40 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from the road last year, according to people familiar with the matter.Prices on the toll road\u2019s bonds have risen by about eight cents on the dollar since October and now are trading at par value. Puerto Rico highway bonds, in contrast, are trading at close to 50 cents on the dollar after the island\u2019s highway authority entered a court-supervised bankruptcy process last month.\u201cThis is the solution that Puerto Rico has to move forward,\u201d said Wilson Ortiz-Vega, advisory leader with the insurance brokerage             Aon,       which worked on a previous public-private partnership with Puerto Rico.\u201cThey don\u2019t have access to capital markets at a reasonable rate, and they don\u2019t have the resources.\u201dEven so, Carlos A. Col\u00f3n De Armas, a professor of finance at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Business, said the commonwealth would have been better off continuing to operate the Jos\u00e9 de Diego Highway. His 2011 study found the present value of the revenue the government would have collected over 40 years was $2.1 billion.Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'For Sale: Puerto Rico\u2019s Parts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-sale-puerto-rico-1498474800", "news_title": "For Sale: Puerto Rico ", "keywords": "infrastructure,private-public,public-private,puerto rico,Rick Newman,Chris Hamel,Wilson Ortiz-Vega,commodity,financial market news,water utilities,waste management,recycling services,business,consumer services,environment,utilities"}, {"content": "The world\u2019s most-indebted property developer, China Evergrande, has broken another debt record. There is some hope investors are at last getting wise.The fact that Evergrande managed to raise $6.6 billion of dollar-denominated bonds last week\u2014the largest bond-raising ever by a property developer globally, according to Dealogic\u2014might suggest bond buyers are just as gullible as ever. Around 40% of the money raised replaces old debt, but the company\u2014China\u2019s biggest developer by assets\u2014added $3.8 billion in new borrowings.The jumbo deal was in part thanks to Evergrande\u2019s opportunism. As usual with bond issues, investor orders exceeded the amount the company was planning to sell. Bond issuers normally leave some money on the table, so as not to test the market\u2019s generosity. Evergrande, though, simply took the chance to raise the amount of debt it issued.Still, the bonds\u2019 poor performance suggests investors\u2019 patience has been stretched. On Monday, the eight-year bonds, for example, were trading 1.8% below their issue price, an unusually big drop for a new bond issue.The price decline should hardly be surprising. Evergrande\u2019s record bond issuance came despite its promise in March to bring down its debt. True, the new bonds, with coupons of up to 8.75%, will help reduce its financing expenses as it retires more expensive perpetual securities. The sale of a 26% stake in its subsidiary, Hengda, for 70 billion yuan ($10 billion) and the expected mainland listing of that unit may also lower its leverage.But there is only so much financial engineering like this can achieve. The only sustainable way for companies to reduce debt is to generate positive free cash flow. There is little evidence that Evergrande has improved its ability to do so: Indeed, the company\u2019s operating cash flow has been negative every year since it listed in Hong Kong in 2009.Evergrande may have got away with a massive bond issue this time. Unless it proves it can do more than just replacing old debts with new debt, investors should stop giving it the benefit of the doubt.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 06:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-the-music-stopped-for-evergrandes-debt-dance-1498473615", "news_title": "Time the Music Stopped for Evergrande\u2019s Debt Dance ", "keywords": " bonds, china,china evergrande, debt, heard on the street,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Good morning,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants a vote on the chamber\u2019s health-care bill late Thursday or early Friday, before Congress\u2019s July 4 recess, but at least eight Republican senators have publicly expressed misgivings about the legislation. Among holdouts\u2019 demands in exchange for their votes is the addition of funds for particular areas, such as opioid treatment. Also, GOP senators are particularly divided over the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor that covers one in five Americans.

The investment increases pressure on the world\u2019s largest packaged-foods company to find ways to accelerate growth. The stake amounts to about 1.25% of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s shares, but it\u2019s an unusually big bet for a U.S. activist fund in Europe, where American investors\u2019 sometimes aggressive approach has had mixed success. Third Point outlined an array of changes it believes the consumer-goods giant could make, including improving margins, innovating in its core business and selling noncore assets and its 23% stake in French cosmetics company L\u2019Or\u00e9al. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new chief executive, Mark Schneider, a health-care veteran, recently said the company would look to sell its U.S. confectionery business that includes famous brands such as Butterfinger and Baby Ruth.Two botched attacks in Europe in recent days signal that Islamist terror has entered a new phase, security officials say, one that is more disorganized and less sophisticated but risks spawning more attackers determined to kill using any means at their disposal. Because of a lack of direct training and know-how, many of this new breed of assailant fail. Still, the absence of a connection to terror networks makes it difficult for intelligence services to track these individuals, and their often unsophisticated weapons\u2014such as knives or cars\u2014are easy to obtain. So authorities fear the attacks will increase. \u201cWe may be entering an era not of lone wolf, but stray dog attacks,\u201d said one Western security official. The changing nature of the attacks also reflects improved security in Europe, but officials warn it would be reckless to underestimate the continuing threat of extremist groups.As the iPhone marks the 10th anniversary of its first sale this week, it remains one of the most successful consumer products in history.

Shipping data firm AXS Marine reports 49 crude and products tankers ordered in the first four months of this year, up from just 12 at the same point a year ago. One potential driver: declining fuel prices and freight rates have helped make storage of crude on tankers more economical than land storage.The Trump administration\u2019s move toward imposing steel tariffs on national security grounds is drawing resistance from within the U.S. Senior lawmakers from both parties are raising concerns that other countries could use the same argument to block exports from their states, the WSJ\u2019s William Mauldin reports. The warnings include a caution from Rep.       Kevin Brady,        the Texas Republican who chairs the House committee that oversees trade policy, who joined critics in saying the moves could raise domestic prices for steel and undercut jobs and wages. The pushback from Congress could slow White House efforts to redraw the direction of global steel trade, a pillar of the global industrial economy, by erecting barriers to imported steel. U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer       says steel and aluminum are national security issues, a rarely-used characterization that could set the groundwork for tariffs. For some lawmakers, however, the economic impact of steel shipping may carry more weight.For the slew of startups targeted in e-commerce consolidation, there is a sober reality to being acquired by             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       Very sober. Workers at Jet.com Inc. found that one early change after Wal-Mart bought the Hoboken, N.J.-based business last year was that the office booze disappeared, the WSJ\u2019s Sarah Nassauer and Brian Baskin write, and that the startup\u2019s regular Thursday evening happy hour was moved out of the office. Those kind of office-culture changes aren\u2019t necessarily noticeable to customers, but they\u2019re getting greater attention as traditional companies use acquisitions to catch up to online commerce trends and run into the free-wheeling, casual practices at startups. The questions of culture arose in the             United Parcel Service Inc.       buy in 2015 of Coyote Logistics, a young freight brokerage with an energetic culture that UPS absorbed. For Wal-Mart, issues such as office happy hour were big enough to address in the buyout talks, and the 67-year-old retailer bent a bit without quite breaking its strict rules.\u2018I would not say it\u2019s a party culture, but not the opposite of that.\u2019Year-over-year growth in volume of U.S. waterborne imports in May, according to Panjiva.New-home sales rose in May and prices hit a record level, signaling strong demand and tight inventories in the U.S. housing market.

The deliveries are helping fuel an opioid crisis that claims tens of thousands of U.S. lives each year, prodding congressional lawmakers to propose tougher rules and new resources to try to stop the flow.Seizures of fentanyl arriving by both international mail and express carriers reached nearly 37 kilograms in the U.S. overall in fiscal 2016, compared with 0.09 kilogram five years earlier, according to Customs and Border Protection data.While Mexican drug cartels usually transport synthetic opioids like fentanyl in bulk by land across the southern U.S. border, many American dealers and users use the mail to receive smaller supplies of the drugs, officials say. In the past year, authorities have arrested such alleged dealers in cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Kearny, N.J.Mail and private express services are \u201cattractive options for smugglers,\u201d said       Salvatore Ingrassia,        acting assistant director for trade and cargo at CBP\u2019s New York field office. He said there has been a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in synthetic opioids arriving in packages.Customs officials rely on X-ray machines and visual scans to find the contraband at nine international mail facilities around the country. With 621.4 million international packages and mail pieces arriving through the U.S. Postal Service alone in fiscal 2016, it is like finding a needle in a haystack.The chemicals are so lethal, drug-sniffing dogs aren\u2019t trained to identify them for fear of death.\u201cThis manual process...coupled with the tremendous volume of inbound mail to the United States, creates a daunting task for CBP,\u201d said       Robert Perez,        the agency\u2019s acting executive assistant commissioner for operations support, at a May Senate hearing on opioid mail shipments.Continuing coverage of how synthetic painkillers became a global menaceA measure sponsored by lawmakers including Sen.       Sherrod Brown       (D., Ohio) would provide customs officials with more screening equipment and lab resources to detect fentanyl arriving by mail or at ports of entry. Another bill in the Senate, sponsored by Ohio Republican       Rob Portman,        would require overseas shippers that use the U.S. Postal Service to provide certain pieces of information, transmitted electronically to CBP before parcels arrive in the country.Sen. Portman\u2019s measure seeks to address a problem that customs officials and others have complained about for years: Unlike private carriers like FedEx and UPS, the Postal Service doesn\u2019t always provide CBP with advance data like a shipper\u2019s name and address and a description of contents. Run through software programs, the data can help flag warning signs such as an address or neighborhood known to be the origin of previous shipments of chemicals.At the recent Senate hearing, a UPS official called advance data \u201cthe cornerstone of effective risk assessment.\u201d Mr. Perez from CBP also highlighted the data\u2019s importance.The Postal Service says it is more limited than private carriers because it has to work with foreign postal operators. It has been pushing overseas operators to provide such information and now receives data for 40% to 50% of inbound packages, said       Robert Cintron,        the agency\u2019s vice president for network operations, at the hearing.The Postal Service is obligated under international agreements to accept incoming mail from nearly every country, Mr. Cintron said. He added that the blanket requirements of Sen. Portman\u2019s bill are impractical and would undermine the Postal Service\u2019s ability to compete with private shippers.Moreover, sellers routinely falsify the sender\u2019s name and address and the description of the contents, authorities say. On the receiving end, buyers often misrepresent themselves as well, and may use numerous mailboxes to evade detection.\u201cThough the express carriers typically require additional data to ship parcels, it is still rather difficult for these carriers and law enforcement to detect and intercept opioids,\u201d the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy wrote in a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March.Spokespeople for UPS and FedEx said the companies comply with law enforcement\u2019s legal requirements on imports.In the March arrest of alleged drug dealer       Chukwuemeka Okparaeke,        it was his unusual behavior at post offices in the Middletown, N.Y., area that helped tip off authorities.They said the 28-year-old, known to online customers as \u201cFentmaster,\u201d dropped bags of envelopes in collection bins while wearing latex gloves. He also bought more than $7,500 worth of stamps at a time online.Mr. Okparaeke ordered fentanyl variants online from vendors in China in one-kilogram quantities and had them shipped to a UPS store mailbox, according to authorities. He then repackaged the powder into two-milliliter plastic bags and shipped them through the post office to scores of customers around the U.S., authorities said. The envelopes had fictitious return addresses like \u201cMiddletown Sweets\u201d and \u201cNorth Jersey Plastics Co.\u201dIn April, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Mr. Okparaeke on charges including intent to import and distribute controlled substances. He pleaded not guilty.

What it hasn\u2019t become is a huge moneymaker for parent             PayPal Holdings Inc.        PYPL -1.03%Historically, that hasn\u2019t been much of a concern for PayPal, although that is starting to change. Making money might matter even less to the big tech and finance firms like             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       and             J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co., that are going after Venmo\u2019s business.Those firms are trying to prevent Venmo from becoming to person-to-person payments what Google is to search or             Facebook                   is to social media. The reason: even if such services aren\u2019t profitable today, companies believe they are vital to getting and keeping consumers, especially coveted millennials.\u201cWe don\u2019t charge customers,\u201d Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking at J.P. Morgan, said at an investor conference while describing the bank\u2019s efforts in person-to-person payments. \u201cSo you all quite rightly will ask me, \u2018Well, what\u2019s the revenue model?\u2019 And the revenue model is that the customer is engaged on our banking app.\u201dJ.P. Morgan this month connected its smartphone apps to a new money-transfer network called Zelle, which is owned by several banks and will eventually reach 86 million consumers. That followed an announcement from Apple that it was also getting into person-to-person payments.Behind the companies\u2019 zeal is rapid growth in digital person-to-person payments. Consumers made $147.1 billion in such transactions in 2016, up 47% from the year before, according to consulting firm Aite Group LLC.But Venmo won\u2019t be easily pushed aside. It is growing faster than the overall market, handling $17.6 billion in such payments in 2016, more than double its $7.5 billion in 2015.With these payment services, consumers link a bank account, debit card or credit card to a smartphone app and can send money to anyone else with just the email address or phone number of the recipient. Venmo and the other services typically eat the charges that banks or card networks impose on transfers that move over their payment rails.\u201cIt\u2019s been all cost and no revenue, but a tremendous acquisition tool and a tremendous engagement tool,\u201d PayPal CEO       Dan Schulman       told a separate investor conference last month. He added the typical user opens Venmo two or three times a week.Venmo was an afterthought for PayPal when it acquired the service as part of a roughly $800 million deal for Braintree Payments Solutions LLC in 2013. Braintree\u2019s primary business was enabling tech companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. to accept online and mobile payments. Braintree had paid around $26 million for Venmo in 2012.Users liked that Venmo didn\u2019t require the sender and recipient to belong to the same bank, a stipulation that doomed earlier payments services. Another feature within the app displayed transactions of friends and relatives in a news feed, which proved to be a hit with college students and recent graduates used to sharing minutiae on social networks.Starting this quarter, PayPal plans to ramp up its effort to make money from Venmo by trying to persuade merchants to accept it as a form of payment\u2014and charging them a typical fee of 2.9% plus $0.30. Early adopters include online fashion marketplace Poshmark Inc., online bulk retailer Boxed.com and hamburger chain White Castle Management Co.Banks and technology companies are increasingly encouraging customers to use new digital payment services to send money to friends and other contacts. But which is the best approach? All bring similar benefits\u2014not needing to carry cash or write a check. But there are distinct advantages and setbacks for some of the leading products as well.VENMO\u2014Pros: Works across several types of mobile devices and bank accounts. Funds can immediately be used to shop with Venmo. Social-media-like features are a hit with millennials.\u2014Cons: Users have to initiate transfers from Venmo to their bank accounts, which can take a day or more to clear. It also can be difficult to retrieve money mistakenly sent to the wrong person.APPLE\u2014Pros: Service works with Apple\u2019s iMessage, so users don\u2019t need to download a separate app. Funds can immediately be used to shop with Apple Pay.\u2014Cons: Both sender and recipient must have Apple devices that run the latest operating systems, so the user base is limitedZELLE\u2014Pros: Will work within the apps of the biggest banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Funds are deposited directly into bank accounts within minutes.\u2014Cons: Banks have a lukewarm record in digital payments, and customers of banks outside the Zelle network will need to download and register a separate app.\u201cPeople really value [person-to-person payments], but there\u2019s so much more they want to a digital commerce experience,\u201d Bill Ready, PayPal\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview.Apple is also angling to use person-to-person payments to boost usage of Apple Pay, which was launched in 2014. The goal: Apple keeps a slice of the transaction fee charged to merchants when its users tap their iPhones to pay for goods and services in stores, online and in smartphone apps.Funds that an iPhone user receives will be stored on a virtual card issued by             Green Dot Corp.      , that can be used to shop with Apple Pay. Rather than building a distinct smartphone app, Apple is integrating its money-transfer service with its iMessage and Siri products later this year. (Venmo also works with iMessage and Siri.)So far, Apple Pay\u2019s overall progress has been slow; only 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have activated the service, according to Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research. Person-to-person payments could spur more sign-ups, but because it works through iMessage, the service\u2019s user base is limited to people who have newer iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.\u201cThe big disadvantage of the Apple product is it\u2019s Apple only,\u201d said Craig Maurer, an analyst at Autonomous Research.With Zelle, banks are trying to be as inclusive as possible. The seven banks that own Early Warning Systems LLC, the entity that owns the Zelle network, have the largest U.S. customer bases. The member banks, which include J.P. Morgan,             Bank of America Corp.       and             Wells Fargo                   & Co., plan to integrate Zelle within their own smartphone apps. Unlike with Venmo and Apple Pay, customers using Zelle won\u2019t have to initiate separate transfers to get money they received into their bank account.Customers of other banks can access Zelle through a stand-alone app, but that isn\u2019t due to launch until later this year. Those transfers won\u2019t run on Zelle, but through             Visa\u2019s       and             Mastercard\u2019s       real-time payments networks. This week, Venmo said it would also move money to their bank accounts on those faster networks for a fee of 25 cents per transaction.Zelle potentially could be put to commercial use in the future for things such as commercial payments or paying bills online. But even if a business case isn\u2019t immediately apparent, executives now view digital person-to-person payments as a service like mobile banking that consumers will come to expect from their financial institution.\u201cWe can\u2019t allow people like Venmo or PayPal or others to intermediate us and our customers,\u201d said       Tim Spence,        chief strategy officer at Fifth Third Bancorp, which is participating in Zelle. \u201cThe economics of relationship-based banking, the value you can deliver to the customer, are vastly greater than being a utility operating in the background.\u201dWrite to Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Apple, Banks Envy PayPal\u2019s Venmo Tool.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apple-and-j-p-morgan-are-chasing-venmo-1498469401", "news_title": "Why Apple and J.P.

KHC 0.11%      ,             Kellogg Co.        K 0.14%      , and             Mondelez International Inc.        MDLZ 0.78%       They also face growing competition from store brands and upstarts.Now, Amazon is preparing to expand into the sector with its proven history of aggressively driving down prices.Amazon\u2019s deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc. for $13.7 billion, including debt, was disclosed about six weeks after its first meeting with executives. Because the deal came together so quickly, Amazon hasn\u2019t yet had the time to develop a complete strategy, according to people familiar with Amazon\u2019s thinking. But the company is likely to leverage its negotiating expertise and the combined scale of the business to push for lower prices from suppliers, they said.Amazon \u201cwill keep squeezing national brands on pricing,\u201d said       James Thomson,        a former senior manager in business development at Amazon and now partner at brand consultancy Buy Box Experts.Amazon\u2019s initial priority will likely be to lower             Whole Foods                        \u2019 operating costs so that it can charge less for groceries, in hopes of winning more customers, according to the people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.Amazon and Whole Foods declined to comment for this article.Whole Foods Chief Executive       John Mackey       told employees earlier this month that one of Amazon\u2019s core values was \u201cfrugality,\u201d hinting at a greater focus on cutting costs and lowering prices for shoppers.Whole Foods\u2019 sales have suffered over the past two years, partly because of a perception among shoppers that its offerings are too expensive.\u201cIf Amazon steers Whole Foods away from its \u2018whole-paycheck\u2019 image, and successfully sells Whole Foods\u2019 products online, then \u2018Big Food\u2019 faces the threat of losing even more market share,\u201d said Rabobank food analyst       Nicholas Fereday.Mondelez\u2019s comparable sales in North America declined by 1.9% in its most recent quarter. Kraft Heinz\u2019s U.S. comparable sales fell 3.5%, and Kellogg recently lowered its 2017 comparable sales growth forecast to negative 3%, excluding currency rate fluctuations. Most packaged-food companies have turned to cost-cutting to boost their profit margins\u200b.Amazon has worked on developing its own private-label, and last year made a big push into perishable food. Analysts and former employees expect the company to use Whole Foods to build out its own labels and capitalize on the grocer\u2019s success with its 365 brand, which accounted for 15% of its most recent fiscal year\u2019s sales.Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods deal could also widen the reach of natural and organic brands by putting them online, making them more competitive with traditional, ubiquitous brands.Alexander Pease,        chief financial officer of pretzel maker         Snyder\u2019s-Lance Inc.,       said at a conference last week that the deal would generate another \u201clevel of discussion with [retailers] around price.\u201dBut Susquehanna Financial Group analyst       Pablo Zuanic       says Amazon and Whole Foods\u2019 combined share of about 4% of U.S. grocery sales hasn\u2019t enough \u201cclout\u201d to hurt big food companies in the way of bargaining power.It could also take time before food makers start feeling pressure, because the deal hasn\u2019t been completed, and Amazon\u2019s strategy for Whole Foods could shift, the people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking said. The deal is expected to be completed later this year.Companies such as         PepsiCo Inc.       and Mondelez, which have top-selling brands and a global presence, are best positioned to withstand the impact of a combined Amazon and Whole Foods, some analysts said.But mainstream brands with less market share are likely to get squeezed by niche organic options on the high end and private-label copycats on the low end, they said.UBS analysts see         Campbell Soup Co.       and\u00a0        Conagra\u00a0Brands Inc.,       two less diversified players which are already facing big problems as consumers move away from packaged-foods, as some of the companies that could suffer most from the combination of Amazon and Whole Foods. Campbell\u2019s comparable sales fell 1% in the latest quarter. Conagra\u2019s comparable sales fell 4.8% in its last reported quarter.\u201cWe enjoy good working relationships with both Amazon and Whole Foods and expect that to continue,\u201d a Campbell spokeswoman said. Conagra declined to comment.In the past, Amazon has been willing to lower price tags at the expense of margins to gain traction in a new market. Amazon\u2019s stock has risen even when profits didn\u2019t, indicating investors\u2019 patience with the company\u2019s strategy to push for long-term gains.Mr. Thomson the former Amazon manager, said that in its bread-and-butter online retail business, Amazon has taken a tough stance to match or beat competitors, even if that meant prices dropped below a brand\u2019s minimum. The company also typically attempts to negotiate lower prices with brands each year, he said.And when it comes to private label, \u201cAmazon will move much faster at building new brands than any national brand can today,\u201d Mr. Thomson said.Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the June 27, 2017, print edition as 'Food Brands Face Amazon Squeeze.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-grocery-ambitions-spell-trouble-for-big-food-brands-1498469402", "news_title": "Amazon\u2019s Grocery Ambitions Spell Trouble for Big Food Brands ", "keywords": "amazon,food brands,groceries,price war,private labels,whole foods,Amazon.com,AMZN,Mondelez International,MDLZ,Kraft Heinz,KHC,Kellogg,K,Whole Foods,WFM,Whole Foods Market,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,generic products,retail sales,food,beverages,tobacco,breakfast cereals,wooden furniture,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,etailing,consumer goods,e-commerce,food products,furniture,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdog will as soon as Tuesday hit         Alphabet Inc.      \u2019s Google with a fine of more than \u20ac1 billion ($1.12 billion) and demand changes to the company\u2019s business practices, according to people familiar with the matter.The European Commission, which has for roughly seven years been investigating Google for breaching the bloc\u2019s antitrust rules in various areas, is poised to announce as soon as Tuesday that Google has manipulated search results to favor its own comparison-shopping service. Other formal EU probes into Google\u2019s behaviors with its Android mobile-operating service and AdSense advertising service are continuing.The antitrust penalty against Google is expected to surpass the EU\u2019s previous record fine imposed on a company for allegedly abusing its market position: \u20ac1.06 billion against             Intel Corp.       in 2009.\u201cWe continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and we believe strongly that our innovations in online shopping have been good for shoppers, retailers and competition,\u201d said Google spokesman       Al Verney.The EU will also likely demand Google give rival comparison shopping services such as Foundem.co.uk and Kelkoo.com Ltd. equal treatment in its search results. Complainants in the case allege that Google both demotes competitors\u2019 offerings in search rankings and artificially inserts its own service in a box above all other search results, regardless of their relevance.A decision in the comparison-shopping case could create precedents for Google\u2019s behavior with its other search services, such as travel and maps, which the EU is also scrutinizing.The move against another powerful American company is likely to stoke accusations across the Atlantic that the EU disproportionately targets American companies, especially tech firms, to protect its own European-grown industries. The European Commission has already hit             Apple Inc.,Facebook Inc.       and             Starbucks Corp.       with various decisions for breaching the bloc\u2019s competition rules, hitting their financial accounts. The regulator also continues to probe             McDonald\u2019s Corp.       and             Amazon.com Inc.       for allegedly not paying enough taxes in Europe.In the Google case, some large U.S. companies, including Yelp Inc., complained alongside European firms to the EU about the company\u2019s behavior in the hopes that Brussels would take action.Microsoft Corp.       initially also took part but hasn\u2019t been lobbying against Google in Brussels after the two companies ended a long-running feud last year.News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, has also formally complained to the EU about Google but over the company\u2019s handling of news articles on its search service.U.S. antitrust authorities in early 2013 decided to end their own investigation into the company after Google agreed to some voluntary changes to its practices.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-26 05:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-could-be-days-away-from-1-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-1498463970", "news_title": "Google Could Be a Day Away From At Least $1 Billion EU Antitrust Fine ", "keywords": " alphabet's google, antitrust, competition policy in europe, consumer rights, european antitrust, google,google faces record eu fine this week, kelkoo, online shopping, price comparison sites, search engines,European Commission,European Union,Alphabet Cl C,GOOG,Intel,INTC,Google,GOOGL,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,anti-competition issues,corporate,industrial news,regulatory breach,internet search engines,e-commerce,industrial electronics,industrial goods,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "As Beijing looks to rein in companies that have splurged on overseas deals, it is talking up the systemic risks to its financial system. But just how serious is the problem?After all, for years Beijing has urged leading companies to \u201cgo global,\u201d and encouraged banks to support them with lending. Its words were taken to heart: Companies like sprawling conglomerate HNA Group and insurer Anbang pushed the country\u2019s outbound acquisitions to more than $200 billion last year, according to Dealogic. Now, as The Wall Street Journal reported last week, regulators are investigating leverage and risks at banks associated with China Inc.\u2019s bulging overseas deals.It\u2019s clear that Chinese banks are already heavily exposed to China\u2019s big deal makers through basic lending. Chinese lenders had extended more than 500 billion yuan ($73.14 billion) of loans to HNA alone as of last year, according to a company bond filing.But traditional loans aren\u2019t the only way banks are exposed. Take         China Construction Bank,       one of HNA\u2019s biggest lenders. Earlier this month, the bank financed a $190 million investment made by HNA\u2019s aviation unit in the initial public offering of         Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank.       Also this year, CCB fully guaranteed a $200 million bond that HNA issued offshore. And last year, together the two set up an investment fund to raise 20 billion yuan.When HNA sought to buy a majority stake in developer Tysan from U.S. private-equity firm Blackstone last year, meanwhile, CCB provided all the financing\u2014including a margin loan and a loan facility backed by letters of credit. The same happened when HNA bought a stake in jewelry maker KTL Holdings late last year.It\u2019s hard to know whether such wide-ranging connections, repeated across other banks and acquisitive companies, add up to a broad financial systemic risk. What they do illustrate is the heavy task regulators have set themselves to unpick these often cozy relationships that often go back years. CCB, for example, helped bail out a company HNA\u2019s now-Chairman Chen Feng worked for back in the 1990s.

The recall of 42 million vehicles in the U.S. is the largest ever.Takata\u2019s bankruptcy protection filing by the parent company in Japan early Monday and a chapter 11 filing for its U.S. subsidiary in Delaware late Sunday allow the company to attempt to stabilize its finances. Takata also unveiled a preliminary agreement to sell almost all its assets to Key Safety Systems Inc., a Michigan supplier owned by a Chinese company, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp., for nearly $1.6 billion.The sale would help Takata meet its $850 million payment obligation to auto makers early next year, part of a $1 billion plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department to settle a criminal investigation into the parts maker. Takata said its estimated liabilities range from $10 billion to $50 billion.The bankruptcy filing marks a bitter chapter in one of Japan\u2019s postwar industrial success stories. Takata began as a textile company and eventually grew into one of the largest automotive safety companies with operations in more than 20 countries.Founded in western Japan in 1933, one of Takata\u2019s early businesses was weaving lifelines for maritime rescues. During World War II, Takata\u2019s weavers were put to work making parachutes for the military.In the 1950s, Takata applied what it knew about parachutes to create seat belts. It was the first to supply seat belts in Japan in the 1960s, and manufactured the first air bag in the 1980s. The air bags were first introduced in a             Honda Motor Co.       sedan in 1985.Takata went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in November 2006. In its first annual report to shareholders, President       Shigehisa Takada,        the grandson of the founder, said the company wanted to help eliminate all fatalities from traffic accidents.For the financial year ended in March, Takata recorded a 79.5 billion yen ($714 million) loss, its third year in a row in the red. The company\u2019s share price fell more than 60% last week as it became clear that a bankruptcy filing was imminent.The problems that led to the recall and Takata\u2019s bankruptcy stem from its use of ammonium nitrate in air-bag inflater propellants. The chemical was later found to become unstable and lead to ruptures after aging and prolonged exposure to heat and humidity.Although Takata executives knew their air-bag inflaters were suffering potentially dangerous ruptures, from around the year 2000 they routinely discussed fabricating test data provided to auto makers, according to indictments unsealed by a Detroit federal court.Executives withheld information from auto makers even after ruptures caused injuries and deaths, according to federal prosecutors.In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wire fraud for providing misleading testing reports to auto makers and pay $1 billion in penalties.The first known rupture traces back to 2003, when the air bag in a             BMW AG       vehicle burst in Switzerland, according to U.S. congressional documents. In May 2004, a driver-side air bag in a 2001 Honda Civic ruptured in Alabama.Honda issued the first recall for Takata air bags in November 2008, citing improperly manufactured propellants used to inflate the air bags. In 2009, a Takata air bag ruptured and killed an 18-year-old woman driving a Honda Accord.In October 2014, a woman died in an Orlando crash that police first suspected to be a homicide because of the carnage resulting from the ruptured air bag.In May 2015, Takata bowed to pressure from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and filed documents with the U.S. agency conceding defects in its air-bag inflaters. A year later, the recall more than doubled in size. At present, 19 auto makers are in the process of replacing up to nearly 70 million Takata air bags.Takata hired bankruptcy lawyers more than a year ago and in late May last year, it hired             Lazard Ltd.       bankers to begin a process of reviewing bids from private-equity firms and rival suppliers.Litigation stemming from Takata\u2019s air bags continues in a Miami federal court. Several auto makers in May agreed to a collective $553 million settlement with millions of current and former owners and lessees. It isn\u2019t clear whether other auto makers will eventually agree to similar settlements.Assets and operations related to the manufacture of the recalled air bags are excluded from the deal with Key Safety Systems and will eventually be wound down, according to an emailed statement from Key.Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.       will provide Takata up to $227 million in bankruptcy financing.Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Takata Seeks Bankruptcy Shield.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 02:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/takata-corp-subsidiary-files-for-bankruptcy-in-u-s-court-1498434994", "news_title": "Troubled Air-Bag Maker Takata Files for Bankruptcy in Japan and the U.S.", "keywords": "affiliates,airbags,bankruptcy,chapter 11,delaware,takata americas,Takata,7312.TO,JP:7312,Key Safety Systems,Ningbo Joyson Electronic,CN:600699,Honda Motor,JP:7267,product,consumer safety,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,product recalls,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republican leaders pushing for a vote this week on a bill to rework the U.S. health-care system juggled objections from all corners of the GOP caucus over the weekend, with issues such as Medicaid and insurance regulations remaining key holdups.The Senate\u2019s draft health-care bill, released last week, would overturn large swaths of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and put GOP measures in its place. But with Democrats unified in opposition, Republicans can lose no more than two votes in their 52-member caucus, and by Sunday at least eight Republican senators had publicly sounded misgivings about the bill.Demands for getting on board include adding funds for particular areas, such as opioid treatment. But GOP senators are particularly divided over the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor that covers one in five Americans.In addition, four conservative senators object to the bill\u2019s retention of requirements for insurers to cover patients at the same price regardless of their medical history and with set benefits packages. Those provisions have created new consumer protections but also driven up premiums for younger, healthier people in particular, which the senators have cited as a primary concern.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said Sunday on             CBS,       about ameliorating centrists\u2019 concerns over the Medicaid changes in the bill. Of the insurance regulations, he acknowledged, \u201cSome of my conservative friends\u2026are concerned that the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office is expected to produce a formal estimate\u00a0Monday of the existing legislation\u2019s effects. The GOP could then hold a procedural vote Tuesday or Wednesday, and a final vote later in the week,\u00a0if consensus comes quickly. If the negotiating process is drawn out and requires new, complex changes, the timetable would likely shift.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said he wants to see a vote on the legislation\u2019s passage late\u00a0Thursday\u00a0or early\u00a0Friday, before Congress\u2019s July 4 recess. If he is successful in garnering at least 50 votes, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking a tie, the House could then take up the Senate legislation, or the two chambers could try to reach a compromise. The House passed its own health bill last month.If the effort fails, it would plunge the party\u2019s seven-year campaign promise to repeal the ACA into uncertainty and potentially put lawmakers at odds with a president,       Donald Trump,        who is anxious for a major legislative win.By late Sunday, it was clear that enough Republican senators had publicly put their votes in play to require more negotiations.Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0on Fox News that he is \u201cnot there yet\u201d in supporting the plan, adding that he was \u201cvery strongly optimistic\u201d that the bill could be passed.VIEW InteractiveMeanwhile, Democrats and backers of the legislation they consider the core achievement of former President       Barack Obama       were trying to sway more centrist Republicans from the new legislation.Republicans \u201chave, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,\u201d Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0on ABC. \u201cThe bill is just devastating\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s what\u2019s making it so hard for them to pass.\u201dMedicaid in particular is a tricky issue because GOP-controlled states split almost down the middle over whether to expand eligibility for the program\u2014to millions of low-income, childless adults for the first time\u2014using federal funding under the ACA. Concerns about cuts to Medicaid prompted Nevada Republican Dean Heller to say\u00a0Friday\u00a0he couldn\u2019t support the bill.Their demands are pitted against those of GOP-led states that opted not to expand their program, citing fiscal concerns about its sustainability.Of the conservative senators upset about the GOP bill\u2019s retention of insurance regulations, at least one,       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, is already seen as an unreliable vote even if he is mollified.\u00a0Another,\u00a0Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, signaled\u00a0Sunday\u00a0that he wanted more time to find a solution.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is slow the process down, get the information, go through the problem solving process, actually reduce these premiums that have been artificially driven up because of Obamacare mandates,\u201d he said on NBC.Some centrist Republicans also remain wild cards for a variety of reasons.Susan Collins       of Maine, who had previously expressed worries about the bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid, said\u00a0Sunday\u00a0it would be difficult to see a bill emerging that she could support.\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the cost of insurance for older people with serious chronic illnesses, and the impact of the Medicaid cuts on our state governments,\u201d Ms. Collins said on ABC.Mr. McConnell and his caucus are up against one particularly hard-to-move force: the\u00a0July 4\u00a0holiday. If the bill is passed\u00a0by the time they leave for a weeklong recess, they will likely face\u00a0criticism from Democrats and other supporters of the ACA. If the bill isn\u2019t passed, they would likely hear it from the Republican base about their commitment to delivering on campaign promises.Mr. Heller\u2019s bind in Nevada is a particular example of the multiple forces at work on senators: Late\u00a0Friday, the America First Policies nonprofit, launched by Trump allies to bolster the president\u2019s agenda, said it would launch a seven-figure ad campaign against him. Mr. Heller is up for re-election in 2018.The White House has made clear that, as in the House of Representatives, it doesn\u2019t intend to forgive members who don\u2019t back the bill; meanwhile, vulnerable members who vote for it can expect to get support from the president.At the same time, the president has taken a largely hands-off role to date, in contrast to his team\u2019s approach in passing legislation in the House. That could change in coming days and had already stepped up by the end of the week, when Mr. Trump called Mr. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the White House said.\u201cWe have a few people that\u2026want to get some points; I think they\u2019ll get some points,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the GOP holdouts during a Fox News interview that aired\u00a0Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re that far off\u2026.I think we\u2019re going to get there.\u201dMr. Pence will attend his regular policy lunch in the Senate on Tuesday and is expected to talk up the health bill while traveling in the middle of the week, but he will be back in Washington at the end of the week, when his tiebreaking vote could be required.The health-care bid wouldn\u2019t necessarily be derailed if Mr. McConnell balks at a vote ahead of\u00a0the recess, GOP strategists inside and outside of the administration have said. Members of Senate leadership have often stated their goal as making progress before the July 4 holiday, and completion after.\u201cI think August is the drop-dead line, about Aug. 1,\u201d said Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, speaking to reporters in Colorado at a retreat hosted by GOP megadonor       Charles Koch.Even if the Senate passes the health bill, another big question is whether the House would pass it. When GOP House members were wrangling to eke out a bill they could agree on, they declined to say what they would do if their delicate compromise was subsequently upended.\u2014Kristina Peterson, Byron Tau and Rachel Witkowski contributed to this article.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Senators Lay Out Demands On Health.'", "news_time": "2017-06-26 02:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-senators-lay-out-demands-on-health-bill-1498433562", "news_title": "GOP Senators Lay Out Demands on Health Bill", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President       John Williams       said it is necessary for the U.S. central bank to press forward with interest-rate increases, in part to reduce the risk that the economy might overheat.The main goal of monetary policy right now is \u201cto keep the expansion going as long as possible,\u201d Mr. Williams said in the text of a speech to be delivered in Australia. \u201cThat entails bringing monetary policy back to a more normal setting and taking actions to keep the economy on a path that neither exceeds its speed limit, nor stalls.\u201dWhen it comes to the Fed\u2019s inflation and hiring mandates, the economy is \u201cas close to these goals as we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he said. And while inflation has been weak lately, tepid readings are likely to be temporary, with what is now a 4.3% jobless rate already under the point at which it could start to fuel inflationary pressures, Mr. Williams said.\u201cThe very strong labor market actually carries with it the risk of the economy exceeding its safe speed limit and overheating, which could eventually undermine the sustainability of the expansion,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually raising interest rates to bring monetary policy back to normal helps us keep the economy growing at a rate that can be sustained for a longer time.\u201dMr. Williams spoke in the wake of the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting that saw officials raise their short-term overnight interest rate target range to 1% and 1.25%. Officials also expect to raise rates one more time this year, and they have laid out a plan to begin a slow drawdown of their $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.Mr. Williams is a close ally of Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        who said after the FOMC meeting the case remains strong to continue to boost the cost of borrowing in the U.S. economy.Other Fed officials have become more anxious, however. Two FOMC voters, the leaders of the Chicago and Dallas banks, have said they would need to see a pickup in inflation before they would support another rate increase. Another voter,       Neel Kashkari       of the Minneapolis Fed, argued the Fed\u2019s rate rise was a mistake given how far short price pressures are of the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal.Most Fed officials believe a strong job market would eventually fuel higher inflation. Mr. Williams said in his speech he still expects to see the U.S. reach the Fed\u2019s price target by next year. Mr. Williams also said he expects the current jobless rate to remain just above 4% through the next year.The central bank veteran said the main goal of monetary policy right now is to be \u201cboring\u201d and predictable and avoid rattling markets. He said the Fed is cognizant of the impact of its policies overseas as well.Mr. Williams said that while the Fed doesn\u2019t know how much it would like to shrink its balance sheet, it will nevertheless be considerably smaller than its current size.Write to Michael S.
