The directive will allow exceptions for airlines and cruise lines and will aim to not disrupt business under way, they said.Perhaps the most tangible effect of the changes will be the elimination of loosened travel regulations that allowed individuals to self-certify their travel as cultural exchange without joining a tour group.That regulation essentially lifted the travel ban, allowing anyone who wanted to go to Cuba from the U.S. to go, as long as they declared their trip was aimed at engaging with Cubans. Tourist travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba is forbidden by law, but the changes undertaken by the Obama administration basically allowed for it.Longer term, lawyers and others who have been working with companies to explore deals on the island said, the shift could affect companies that have been looking into potential business opportunities but haven\u2019t made it very far. But the effects will depend on how final regulations are crafted.\u201cIt\u2019s freezing the ability to do future deals,\u201d said James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a group that advocates on behalf of businesses to lift the embargo and which backs normalization.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement Friday will trigger a 30-day process for Treasury and Commerce to begin drafting new regulations, and the changes won\u2019t go into effect until that process is completed, officials said at a news briefing Thursday.The officials didn\u2019t provide a date for when they expect the process to be completed, saying that it will take \u201cas long as it takes.\u201dThe White House said it hopes its Friday announcement will encourage the Cuban government to take steps to allow free elections, release political prisoners and directly pay Cuban workers, among other changes.\u201cIt\u2019s very much the hope of the administration that the Cuban regime will see this as an opportunity to implement reforms that they paid lip service to a couple of years ago,\u201d said one White House official briefing reporters ahead of the announcement.Mr. Obama, beginning in December 2014, moved to normalize ties and loosen the longstanding U.S. embargo, including by easing trade and travel regulations, restoring diplomatic ties, making a historic presidential visit to the island, and eliminating the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s who reached U.S. soil without visas to stay in the country and apply for a green card after one year.While the individual cultural travel rule will be terminated, many of the regulations to relax trade and travel will remain, along with some of the measures that allowed increased telecommunications services. The countries\u2019 embassies will remain open and the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy won\u2019t be reinstated. And U.S. travelers who still head to Cuba will continue to be able to bring back as many cigars and as much rum as they want.Individual travel will remain legal through more than 10 categories, including research and humanitarian work, and family visits.But Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), who backs lifting the embargo, said, \u201cAny policy change that diminishes the ability of Americans to travel freely to Cuba is not in the best interests of the United States or the Cuban people.\u201dCollin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, said it is unclear how the Treasury and Commerce departments will interpret Mr. Trump\u2019s directive. But he said his company ahead of the directive on Thursday changed the hotel reservations for 25 groups over the next six months from one connected to a Cuban military entity to other hotels that don\u2019t have military ties.\u201cIf you look at the growth over the last two years, the travel of Americans has exploded, and you\u2019ll see that slow down,\u201d Mr. Laverty said, speaking by telephone from Havana. \u201cWhere you really saw an increase is individuals who bought a ticket from             JetBlue                   or Southwest, especially because routes are new and fares are really competitive right now.\u201dMost U.S. airlines that fly to Cuba had no comment Thursday on the impending Trump administration in procedures.             Southwest Airlines Co.      , which flies to Havana and two smaller destinations from Florida, said it will review the administration\u2019s statement to assess the impact on its Cuba schedule.What was expected to be a hot market has been a bit of a disappointment, airlines have conceded.             American Airlines Group Inc.       and JetBlue Airways Corp. ended up cutting their seats, either by substituting smaller planes or reducing the number of daily flights to some destinations. A turboprop carrier, Silver Airways, dropped out of eight secondary destinations in April. Low-fare Frontier Airlines and             Spirit Airlines                   left the Havana market in recent weeks.But those three idle daily slots to Havana are now being fought over by the other big carriers flying to the island-nation capital. All the major players are jousting with the Transportation Department to take up those routes, despite the higher costs and mediocre passenger loads on trips to the capital from the U.S. They fear if they don\u2019t hold this territory, they could be foreclosed for a generation, said one carrier\u2019s chief executive officer.Mr. Trump had promised on the campaign trail to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s policy changes on Cuba, and officials said his announcements on Friday are aimed at following through on that promise.But officials also signaled that Mr. Trump will retain portions of the policy shift that has won the endorsement of business groups and many Republicans, particularly those in agricultural states that want to expand trade with Cuba.The Trump administration worked closely with Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.), lawmakers who vociferously protested Mr. Obama\u2019s moves to normalize ties.One target of the policy directive is the Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial SA, better known as GAESA, a conglomerate owned by Cuba\u2019s armed forces and run by President       Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s       former son-in-law, Gen.       Luis Alberto Rodriguez.       GAESA owns a wide portfolio of more than 50 companies, many in the tourism industry, which for a long time has been one of Cuba\u2019s few cash-producing industries, analysts say.Through the Gaviota hotel chain, GAESA has nearly 29,000 hotel rooms, including the majority of Cuba\u2019s four- and five-star hotels, including the recently inaugurated Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski, which also houses top boutiques. Gaviota also has signed an agreement with Sheraton\u2019s Starwood chain to administer the Four Points Hotel in Havana.\u2014Susan Carey, Dudley Althaus, Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba and Carol E.

European physicists have developed many of the theories and basic practices underlying quantum encryption, but their Chinese counterparts are better-funded with government resources.Disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 about U.S. spying on Chinese networks rattled Beijing, and have pushed the country to bolster cybersecurity measures in a variety of ways.\u201cThe Snowden revelations undoubtedly played a part in the drive towards quantum technologies, as it revealed the degree of sophisticated threat Chinese counterespionage and cyberdefenses were facing,\u201d said       John Costello,        a fellow specializing in China and cybersecurity at the nonpartisan Washington-based think tank New America.The experiment exploited a phenomenon of quantum mechanics that allows two particles to be entangled so that whatever happens to one is immediately reflected in the physical state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.       Albert Einstein       once described this as \u201cspooky action.\u201dBy using a satellite, the Chinese scientists avoided the interference at ground level that had limited transmissions of entangled particles to around 100 kilometers.\u201cThe Chinese experiment is quite a remarkable technological achievement,\u201d said       Artur Ekert,        a professor in quantum physics and cryptography at Oxford University.Anton Zeilinger,        a physicist at the University of Vienna who is working with Chinese researchers on a different experiment involving the satellite, said the result had exceeded his expectations.The Chinese team behind this week\u2019s report was led by physicists from University of Science and Technology of China in the eastern city of Hefei. The university also led development of the satellite, named Micius after a fifth-century B.C. philosopher.Photons and other subatomic particles can be encoded with cryptographic keys\u2014the kind used to scramble and unscramble messages. The state of a particle changes as soon as it is intercepted, making it impossible for a third party to steal the key without alerting the intended recipient.Quantum                   encryption can be defeated when it isn\u2019t used properly, said Alexander Ling, an expert in quantum communications at the Center for Quantum Technologies in Singapore.Deployed correctly, quantum encryption would protect data against conventional snooping and protect networks against efforts in the U.S. and elsewhere to build quantum computers powerful enough to defeat the math-based encryption currently in use.The process described by the Chinese researchers in this week\u2019s report is too slow and complex to be used for practical quantum communications, said       Gregoire Ribordy,        co-founder of Geneva-based quantum cryptography firm ID Quantique. Mr. Ribordy\u2019s company recently formed a joint-venture to sell quantum-communications equipment in China\u2014photon generators and receivers for the exchanging of encryption keys through land-based, optic-fiber networks.But he said that China would be able to connect its embassies and other government facilities around the world by launching a second quantum satellite to expand the transmission range\u2014something he predicted could happen within five years.\u201cThey could do large-scale, global-scale quantum communications,\u201d said Mr. Ribordy. \u201cThey\u2019ve gathered experience with this satellite.\u201dLu Chaoyang, one of the physicists at the University of Science and Technology of China who worked on the project, said the Chinese research team was working to speed up the transmission process, but defended the progress they had already made.\u201cWe have achieved a two-proton entanglement distribution efficiency a trillion times more efficient than using the best telecommunication fibers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe done something that was absolutely impossible using conventional approaches.\u201dWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'In China, a Quantum Leap.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 23:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-make-leap-toward-quantum-network-1497549676", "news_title": "China Makes Leap Toward \u2018Unhackable\u2019 Quantum Network", "keywords": "chinese scientists,light particles,nature,quantum communications,quantum networks,quantum teleportation,quantum transmission,speed of light,political,general news,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "The widow of the man who went on a shooting rampage at a baseball practice for congressional Republicans in Alexandria, Va., said\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that she didn\u2019t speak with him in the weeks before he left their home in March and wasn't aware that he intended to carry out an attack.In a televised news conference near her home in Belleville, Ill.,       Sue Hodgkinson       said       James Hodgkinson,        her husband of nearly 30 years, rarely spoke with her before he left because she was very busy at work.

It has fallen to him to execute one of the Swiss giant\u2019s long-held ambitions\u2014to push more aggressively into healthier foods and make its best-selling products like Nesquik chocolate mix more appealing to health-conscious consumers.By shedding its U.S. candy business, which also includes Baby Ruth and Nerds, Nestl\u00e9 would be able to focus more on faster-growing sectors it identified at an industry forum earlier this year, such as coffee, pet food, water and health sciences.Across the industry, sugary drinks, salty snacks, candy and chocolate have all been vulnerable to cost-cutting. \u201cChocolate is [a] category under pressure amid the trend to health or fitness bars,\u201d said Jon Cox, head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux.Nestl\u00e9 is the No. 3 confectioner in the world by market share behind market leader Mars Inc. and second-ranked Mondelez International Inc., and No. 4 in the U.S. behind             Hershey Co.The U.S. is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s largest market overall, with annual sales of about $27 billion, 51,000 employees and 87 factories, which churn out dozens of well-known brands such as DiGiorno pizza, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Gerber baby food. In recent years, Nestl\u00e9 has had some success turning around sales of its frozen-food brands, namely Lean Cuisine.The decision to potentially leave the U.S. candy business signals new-found decisiveness under Mr. Schneider, said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. He said the likely buyer would be a smaller food maker or private-equity firm but wouldn\u2019t rule out Hershey or Mars.Nestl\u00e9 said the internal strategic review now under way doesn\u2019t include its Toll House baking products, nor its global confectionery business, which is much larger than the U.S. business and includes the Kit Kat brand. Kit Kat is licensed by Hershey Co. in the U.S. and by Nestl\u00e9 in other parts of the world. Nestl\u00e9 said it remains committed to its global confectionery business, particularly Kit Kat.The pressure on chocolate makers has set off a round of consolidation and cost-cutting across the confectionery industry. Last year, Mondelez International Inc. launched an unsuccessful bid to buy Hershey, in a deal that likely would have topped $25 billion. Mondelez said it\u2019s pleased with its U.S. candy business. Hershey, meanwhile, has acquired a chocolate-covered fruit brand and a beef jerky company in recent years to get a bite of healthier-minded consumers.Profiles of some of the brands in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s U.S. confectionary businessEarlier this year, Mr. Schneider ditched Nestl\u00e9\u2019s longstanding organic growth target of 5% to 6%, dubbed \u201cthe Nestl\u00e9 model,\u201d after the company missed it for a fourth-straight year.Italy\u2019s Ferrero SpA, the privately held maker of Nutella and Tic Tac, and the global industry\u2019s fourth-largest player, has expanded aggressively recently through deals. It pushed into the U.S. by snapping up Chicago-based Fannie May Confections Brands earlier this year.U.S. candy makers face competition not only from healthier snacks, but also from anything that occupies consumers\u2019 idle time\u2014including technology and social media, said Nielsen analyst Jordan Rost. \u201cThey are fighting against more competitors than ever before,\u201d he said. At the same time, food makers are under pressure to aggressively lower costs to maintain profit margins amid the slower sales.U.S. companies including             Kellogg Co.       and             Campbell Soup Co.       have closed factories and cut corporate head counts. Earlier this year, Hershey said it would cut 15% of its global workforce in an effort to boost profitability over the next two years.Sales at large packaged-food companies globally, and particularly in the U.S., have stalled as consumers flock to fruit-and-nut bars and Greek-style yogurt. Startups have been fast to launch trendy good-for-you items, stealing market share from traditional giants.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s strategic review follows similar studies at its competitors. British consumer-goods giant Unilever PLC said earlier this year it would review whether to sell its margarine and spreads business following an unsuccessful $143 billion takeover bid by Kraft Heinz Co.Reckitt Benckiser PLC, meanwhile, is shopping its food unit, including French\u2019s mustard. And             Conagra Brands Inc.,       owner of Slim Jim jerky and Chef Boyardee canned pasta, sold its Wesson cooking oil brand to             J.M. Smucker Co.       last month.Executives at these companies say by letting go of smaller or underperforming brands, they can focus more time and money on the ones that have more potential for growth.Nestl\u00e9 has made efforts to revive its U.S. business by offloading lackluster brands like Juicy Juice, PowerBar and its Jenny Craig diet business and combining purchasing and other operations to reduce costs.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com and Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Nestl\u00e9 Plans to Sell U.S. Candy Unit As Tastes Change.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 21:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-exploring-sale-of-its-u-s-confectionery-business-1497544689", "news_title": "Nestl\u00e9 Plans to Sell Its U.S. Confectionery Business", "keywords": "babyruth,baby ruth,butterfinger,candy,chocolate,confectionery business,crunch bars,kitkat,nestle,pe deals,toll house,Nestle,Nestle S.A.,CH:NESN,Mars,Mondelez International,MDLZ,Ferrero,Unilever,UK:ULVR,Reckitt Benckiser Group,UK:RB.,Kraft Heinz,KHC,Ulf Mark Schneider,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,sugar products,building construction,consumer goods,confectionery,construction,real estate,food products"}, {"content": "A Boston private-equity firm says it has been left holding the bag after pumping $44 million into an allegedly fraudulent event-ticketing business led by former New York math teacher Jason Nissen.The firm, Falcon Investment Advisors LLC, is seeking bankruptcy court approval to swoop in and seize the ticketing business\u2019s remaining assets, the value of which the firm likens to a melting ice cube that is quickly diminishing.\u201cTickets become worthless after the event date passes and tend to have less value the less time there is to sell them in advance of events,\u201d lawyers for Falcon said in court papers filed Wednesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.The ticketing business, National Events Holdings LLC, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month and is now liquidating. Bankruptcy bars creditors from suing or attempting to seize assets, which means Falcon must seek a judge\u2019s blessing before it can foreclose on any of the company\u2019s remaining inventory.A hearing on the firm\u2019s request is scheduled for June 20 in New York.Other lenders are also owed millions of dollars, but Falcon says many of them have already been able to recoup at least some of what they are owed. Falcon Strategic Partners IV LP, which also owns a minority stake in the ticketing business, hasn\u2019t been repaid a penny.Court papers show Falcon lent the company a total of $40 million in 2015 and another $4 million earlier this year. Those amounts don\u2019t include fees, expenses and penalties the firm says it is also owed.Mr. Nissen allegedly used phony financial records and fake tickets while claiming to investors that he was buying and reselling wholesale premium and VIP access tickets for major sporting events such as the Super Bowl and World Cup, as well as hit Broadway shows such as \u201cHamilton.\u201d\u201cThese forgeries were so sophisticated that Nissen was able to secure substantial and highly structured investments from otherwise sophisticated third parties, such as Falcon Investments,\u201d court papers say.But much of the money allegedly went to enrich Mr. Nissen or to pay off earlier victims to keep the fraud rolling, court papers say.National Events said in its bankruptcy filing that it was unaware of Mr. Nissen\u2019s alleged fraud and said the ticket broker\u2019s board fired him last month when it became aware of his activities.Mr. Nissen admitted the fraud to two victims, according to the criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors.Federal prosecutors arrested and charged him on May 31. Mr. Nissen\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bachner, said last week that his client intends to plead not guilty to the charges. The lawyer declined to comment Thursday.Now under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge, National Events is working to try to pay down the tens of millions of dollars in debt it is carrying, court papers say.

Although the House voted 233-186 last week to pass Rep. Jeb Hensarling\u2019s ambitious and substantive Financial Choice Act, it is unlikely to come to a vote in the Senate soon. The Treasury this week released the first installment of its own blueprint for reform, another good step. But the urgency of action has been lost as the       Trump       administration struggles to find its footing on tax cuts, health care and the budget.Unfortunately, delay is damaging. Financial regulation since 2009 has been a trifecta of failure: It has not achieved its stated objectives, yet has imposed enormous costs on banks and the economy, while creating Kafkaesque procedures that deform democracy by undermining the rule of law. With respect to missed targets, consider a few examples:\u2022 The 2009 CARD Act sought to protect risky credit-card borrowers from high bank charges. Instead the law has pushed these borrowers into the shadow consumer-finance system.\u2022 Dodd-Frank was supposed to limit mortgage risk through standards for qualified mortgages and qualified residential mortgages. But these requirements have been ineffectual because mortgage transactions by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are exempt. Even       Barney Frank       has publicly recognized the problem. In 2015 he said that regulators had \u201clet the loophole eat up the rule.\u201d As a result of relaxed underwriting standards at Fannie and Freddie, mortgage risk has been rising steadily for the past four years.\u2022 Title II of Dodd-Frank was advertised as a way to prevent bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks by offering them a means of orderly liquidation. But it is unworkable and will not produce neat resolution in practice. The path of least resistance remains bailouts, the procedures for which were codified by Dodd-Frank.\u2022 The Durbin Amendment, which limited debit-card fees, failed to help consumers because banks simply raised other fees, such as those on overdrafts. The share of banks offering free checking accounts fell from 75% before Dodd-Frank to 37% in 2015.\u2022 Dodd-Frank\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council was supposed to establish a credible means for measuring or controlling systemic risk, but it has failed to do so. The FSOC\u2019s one high-profile foray into so-called macroprudential policy was to limit banks\u2019 leveraged lending\u2014an initiative designed to deprive private-equity firms of certain types of loans. This was completely ineffectual, since leveraged lending by shadow banks increased dollar-for-dollar.\u2022 Dodd-Frank and its implementing rules have increased banks\u2019 minimum capital ratios, but there is little reason to believe that today\u2019s prudential regulations\u2014which use complex models of risk and liquidity to require minimum amounts of bank capital or cash\u2014will prove more reliable during the next crisis than they were in the last one. Recall that             Citigroup\u2019s       regulatory Basel capital ratio was 12% at the end of 2008. The current goal seems to be to make all banks just as sound as Citi was at that time.Despite these regulations\u2019 ineffectiveness, the compliance costs paid by customers and stockholders are large. Small banks face high regulatory overhead as a fraction of assets\u2014so much so that virtually no new banks have been started since Dodd-Frank was passed. Midsize banks often avoid profitable growth or acquisitions because they want to avoid an increased regulatory burden. Large banks bear unique compliance costs, such as stress testing based on highly questionable criteria, which probably does little to limit systemic risk but crimps the credit supply.Even more troubling is the adoption of processes inconsistent with the rule of law. Regulators increasingly issue \u201cguidance\u201d rather than go through formal rule making, with little regard for predictability, transparency or accountability. The criteria employed in stress testing are secret and therefore unaccountable. The standards for considering which nonbanks present a systemic threat are arbitrary.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s new outcome-based theories of lending discrimination are radical. The very structure of the CFPB, as a three-judge panel at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled last fall, \u201cviolated bedrock due process principles\u201d by giving the bureau\u2019s director \u201cmore unilateral authority than any other officer in any of the three branches of the U.S. government, other than the president.\u201dWith unchecked power comes predictable abuse, but some cases challenge the imagination. For instance, in \u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d the Obama administration, working through financial regulators, warned banks against doing business with industries that the government deemed undesirable\u2014gun dealers, tobacco purveyors and payday lenders, among others.Why did Dodd-Frank and the rest of the crisis-induced rules fail? Because they did not recognize the core principles of successful regulation. I would emphasize four:First, effective regulation must address incentives. Banks and financial firms want to avoid regulatory costs. Regulators tend toward what\u2019s politically expedient. Good rules take this into account. For instance, using market-based measures of risk and capital alongside accounting measures would make regulatory arbitrage less likely.Second, consumer protections should help people make informed choices instead of attempting to dictate choices with prohibitive rules.Third, macroprudential policy should focus first and foremost on real-estate risk, especially where subsidized and promoted by the government. The primary threat to financial stability remains subsidized risk-taking in the mortgage market, which is growing once again to worrying levels.Fourth, regulation should conform to the rule of law\u2014which means ending the reliance on \u201cguidance\u201d and the delegation of excessive discretionary authority to politicized actors such as the FSOC and the CFPB. Financial rules and their enforcement must be transparent, so that regulators are accountable to the public.The Financial Choice Act is a good start, but there\u2019s no time to waste. The longer the Senate waits to take up Mr. Hensarling\u2019s bill, the more harm the current regulations will do to America\u2019s financial system, the economy and the rule of law.Mr. Calomiris, a professor of finance at Columbia Business School, is the author of \u201cReforming Financial Regulation After Dodd-Frank,\u201d out last month from the Manhattan Institute.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 20:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/four-principles-for-replacing-dodd-frank-1497571869", "news_title": "Four Principles for Replacing Dodd-Frank", "keywords": "cfpb,dodd-frank,financial regulation,white house,Barney Frank,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Insurers must submit applications by next Wednesday to sell plans through HealthCare.gov, and these will give us some of the first indicators of how high       Obama      Care costs will skyrocket in 2018. ObamaCare supporters can\u2019t wait to blame the coming premium increases on the \u201cuncertainty\u201d caused by President       Trump.       But insurers faced the same uncertainty last year under President Obama.Consider a recent press release from California Insurance Commissioner       Dave Jones.       He announced that \u201cin light of the market instability created by President Trump\u2019s continued undermining of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he would authorize insurers to file two sets of proposed rates for 2018\u2014\u201cTrump rates\u201d and \u201cACA rates.\u201d Among other sources of uncertainty, Mr. Jones\u2019s office cited the possibility that the Trump administration will end cost-sharing reduction payments.Those subsidies reimburse insurers for discounted deductibles and copayments given to certain low-income individuals. Congress has never enacted an appropriation for the payments, but the Obama administration began disbursing the funds in 2014 anyway.Thus the uncertainty: The House filed a lawsuit in November 2014, alleging that the unauthorized payments were unconstitutional. Judge       Rosemary Collyer       ruled in the House\u2019s favor and ordered a stop to the payments. As the Obama administration appealed the ruling, the cost-sharing reduction payments continued.The House lawsuit and the potential for a new administration that could cut off the payments unilaterally should have been red flags for regulators when insurers were preparing their rate filings for 2017. I noted this in a blog post for the Journal last May.To maintain a stable marketplace regardless of the uncertainty, regulators should have demanded that insurers price in a contingency margin for their 2017 rates. It appears that Mr. Jones\u2019s office did not even consider doing so. I recently submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to his office requesting documents related to the 2017 rate-filing process, and \u201cwhether uncertainty surrounding the cost-sharing reduction payments was considered by the Commissioner\u2019s office in determining rates for the current plan year.\u201d Mr. Jones\u2019s office replied that no such documents exist.What does that mean? At best, not one of the California Insurance Commission\u2019s nearly 1,400 employees thought to ask whether a federal court ruling stopping an estimated $7 billion to $10 billion in annual payments to insurers throughout the country would affect the state\u2019s health-insurance market. At worst, Mr. Jones\u2014a Democrat running for attorney general next year\u2014deliberately ignored the issue to avoid exacerbating already-high premium increases that could have damaged       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       fall campaign and consumers further down the road.The California Insurance Commission is not alone in its \u201crecent discovery\u201d of uncertainty as a driver of premium increases. In April the left-liberal Center for American Progress published a paper claiming to quantify the \u201cTrump uncertainty rate hike.\u201d The center noted that the \u201cmere possibility\u201d of an end to cost-sharing payments would require insurers to raise premiums by hundreds of dollars a year.Following insurers\u2019 June 21 deadline, expect a raging blame game over next year\u2019s premium increases. Conservatives shouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask regulators and liberal advocates now pointing the finger at uncertainty where they were this time last year when the future of those payments was equally uncertain.Mr. Jacobs is founder and CEO of Juniper Research Group, and a senior health-care policy analyst for the Texas Public Policy Foundation.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 20:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-blame-trump-when-obamacare-rates-jump-1497571813", "news_title": "Don\u2019t Blame Trump When ObamaCare Rates Jump", "keywords": "california insurance commissioner,chris jacobs,dave jones,health care,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "It\u2019s Ramadan, and Beijing is again restricting the peaceful practice of Islam in its western territory of Xinjiang.

Under the \u201cTogether in Five Things\u201d campaign, cadres are even living in the homes of the Uighur minority, according to the World Uyghur Congress.This escalation may be due to the arrival of       Chen Quanguo,        who took over as Xinjiang\u2019s Communist Party secretary in August after running Tibet for five years. He has introduced the system of \u201cgrid-style social management\u201d he pioneered in Tibet that allows the government to closely monitor households.According to state media, Xinjiang\u2019s security budget increased 19.3% in 2016 to more than $4.4 billion, and 30,000 new officers were hired. In February Mr. Chen described security as \u201cgrim\u201d and urged the People\u2019s Armed Police to \u201cbury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the people\u2019s war.\u201d So much for winning hearts and minds.New \u201cRegulations on Anti-Extremism\u201d that came into effect in April outlawed veils or \u201cabnormal\u201d beards. Parents can\u2019t give children \u201coverly religious\u201d names such as Muhammad or encourage them to follow the Muslim faith. All Xinjiang residents were forced to turn in their passports late last year and must give a DNA sample when they apply for a new one.Other measures include antiterror drills, shows of force by the security services and the installation of satellite tracking devices in cars. Mandatory activities for students are deliberately scheduled on Fridays to prevent them from attending mosque services, and rewards are offered for reporting men who wear a beard or women who wear a veil.Control over the Uighur population goes far beyond religion. The use of their native language is discouraged in schools, and economic opportunities are limited. The best jobs go to Han Chinese settlers, who are given incentives to move to Xinjiang. Peaceful dissent is not tolerated. The Uighurs\u2019 most articulate spokesman, Minzu University Professor       Ilham Tohti,        was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for promoting separatism.Sporadic attacks by Uighurs on Han Chinese have continued since riots in the capital Urumqi killed almost 200 people in 2009. In the city of Hotan, three men ran amok with knives and killed five people in February after a family was punished for praying at home. Most attacks appear to be spontaneous and poorly planned, despite Beijing\u2019s claims that overseas terrorist groups are directing the violence.Yet China\u2019s fears of a Uighur terrorist movement may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Uighurs flee the country and some become radicalized, Islamic State issued a video in February in which a Uighur fighter threatened China with \u201crivers of blood.\u201d The government\u2019s anti-Islamic policies are also causing anger among Muslim nations such as Indonesia.Chinese officials continue to respond to every outbreak of violence in Xinjiang with greater repression.

Some craft brewers have indeed tested the limits of what may reasonably be called a beer (now liable to include avocados or oysters). But as       Patrick E. McGovern       relates in \u201cAncient Brews: Rediscovered and Re-Created,\u201d our ancestors imbibed some pretty wild creations themselves.Mr. McGovern directs the Biomolecular Archaeology Project for Cuisine, Fermented Beverages, and Health at the Penn Museum in Philadelphia. He describes himself as a \u201ccombination archaeologist and chemist,\u201d and his book recounts his work crafting modern spins on old-world potables\u2014\u201cliquid time capsules,\u201d as he calls them\u2014for Delaware-based Dogfish Head Brewery, which worked with Mr. McGovern on its Ancient Ales series. The book will be of interest to home brewer and historian alike.The simplified version of Mr. McGovern\u2019s process is as follows. He first sets about gathering drinking vessels and pottery shards from dig sites and museum collections, containers presumed to have held a fermented beverage at one time. Any artifact that has a promising residue suggesting the presence of a liquid gets taken to the laboratory for chemical testing, which can help determine whether the vessel ever held an alcoholic drink and what the ingredients might have been. When Mr. McGovern and his main collaborator\u2014Dogfish Head founder and president       Sam Calagione      \u2014believe they\u2019ve struck gold, the presumed concoction is a candidate for a remake.Their first \u201cextreme fermented beverage,\u201d he writes, was born of the Penn Museum\u2019s discovery in 1957 of some 160 bronze drinking vessels in the purported tomb of King Midas in central Turkey\u2014\u201cthe largest comprehensive Iron Age drinking set ever found.\u201d Forty years later, Mr. McGovern had the opportunity to investigate some of these containers, and what he found surprised him: The 2,700-year-old residue suggested a mix of wine, beer and mead (made from fermented honey).\u201cOur stomachs turned as we . . . thought of mixing wine, beer, and mead together,\u201d the author writes. Yet he was intrigued, and after being impressed with a one-off batch brewed by Mr. Calagione, the two set about producing the mix commercially for Dogfish. Midas Touch\u2014as it came to be called\u2014would eventually become one of the brewery\u2019s marquee products. \u201cIt has gone on to be the most awarded of any Dogfish brew,\u201d Mr. McGovern writes, and it\u2019s currently the best-selling honey-based fermented beverage in the U.S.By Patrick E. McGovern  Norton, 291 pages, $26.95Another winner in the Ancient Ales set is Chateau Jiahu. Mr. McGovern describes the excitement he felt working with pottery jars recovered from the Neolithic settlement of Jiahu in China\u2019s Henan province. \u201cAs we analyzed the extracts from one pottery vessel after another, the same chemical compounds kept showing up,\u201d he writes, and his team ultimately discerned a likely combination of rice, honey and fruit. At more than 9,000 years old, the Jiahu drink is \u201cthe oldest chemically confirmed alcoholic beverage in the world.\u201d In 2006, Messrs. McGovern and Calagione released Chateau Jiahu, brewed with hawthorn fruit, orange blossom honey and rice malt. The author calls it his \u201codds-on favorite\u201d Ancient Ale.The next stop is North Africa, which gave rise to Ta Henket. Unlike the previous two Ancient Ales, this drink was not based on finds at a single location. It instead came from \u201cthree early sites of different time periods in southern Egypt.\u201d Brewed with an ancient form of wheat and baked bread, Dogfish\u2019s version is but one of many possible renderings of \u201ca prehistoric and protohistoric Egyptian extreme fermented beverage.\u201d Even so, Mr. McGovern writes, Ta Henket does justice to \u201cthe available chemical, archaeobotanical, and textual evidence.\u201dOther reconstructed refreshments in \u201cAncient Brews\u201d include a Nordic \u201cgrog\u201d sourced from Scandinavia and the world\u2019s earliest known chocolate quaff used for special occasions, discovered in Honduras and now brewed with Aztec cocoa powder and chilies.

It is between those who support       Donald Trump       and those who despise him, between left and right, between the two parties, and even to some degree between the bases of those parties and their leaders in Washington. It is between the religious and those who laugh at Your Make Believe Friend, between cultural progressives and those who wish not to have progressive ways imposed upon them. It is between the coasts and the center, between those in flyover country and those who decide what flyover will watch on television next season. It is between \u201cI accept the court\u2019s decision\u201d and \u201cBake my cake.\u201d We look down on each other, fear each other, increasingly hate each other.Oh, to have a unifying figure, program or party.But we don\u2019t, nor is there any immediate prospect. So, as Ben Franklin said, we\u2019ll have to hang together or we\u2019ll surely hang separately. To hang together\u2014to continue as a country\u2014at the very least we have to lower the political temperature. It\u2019s on all of us more than ever to assume good faith, put our views forward with respect, even charity, and refuse to incite.We\u2019ve been failing. Here is a reason the failure is so dangerous.In the early 1990s Roger Ailes had a talk show on the America\u2019s Talking network and invited me to talk about a concern I\u2019d been writing about, which was old-fashioned even then: violence on TV and in the movies. Grim and graphic images, repeated depictions of murder and beatings, are bad for our kids and our culture, I argued. Depictions of violence unknowingly encourage it.But look, Roger said, there\u2019s comedy all over TV and I don\u2019t see people running through the streets breaking into laughter. True, I said, but the problem is that, for a confluence of reasons, our country is increasingly populated by the not fully stable. They aren\u2019t excited by wit, they\u2019re excited by violence\u2014especially unstable young men. They don\u2019t have the built-in barriers and prohibitions that those more firmly planted in the world do. That\u2019s what makes violent images dangerous and destructive. Art is art and censorship is an admission of defeat. Good judgment and a sense of responsibility are the answer.That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now, exciting the unstable\u2014not only with images but with words, and on every platform. It\u2019s all too hot and revved up. This week we had a tragedy. If we don\u2019t cool things down, we\u2019ll have more.And was anyone surprised? Tuesday I talked with an old friend, a figure in journalism who\u2019s a pretty cool character, about the political anger all around us. He spoke of \u201chorrible polarization.\u201d He said there\u2019s \u201ctoo much hate in D.C.\u201d He mentioned \u201cthe beheading, the play in the park\u201d and described them as \u201cdog whistles to any nut who wants to take action.\u201d\u201cSomeone is going to get killed,\u201d he said.That was 20 hours before the shootings in Alexandria, Va.The gunman did the crime, he is responsible, it\u2019s fatuous to put the blame on anyone or anything else.But we all operate within a climate and a culture. The media climate now, in both news and entertainment, is too often of a goading, insinuating resentment, a grinding, agitating antipathy. You don\u2019t need another recitation of the events of just the past month or so. A comic posed with a gruesome bloody facsimile of President Trump\u2019s head. New York\u2019s rightly revered Shakespeare in the Park put on a \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d in which the assassinated leader is made to look like the president. A CNN host\u2014amazingly, of a show on religion\u2014sent out a tweet calling the president a \u201cpiece of s\u2014\u201d who is \u201ca stain on the presidency.\u201d An MSNBC anchor wondered, on the air, whether the president wishes to \u201cprovoke\u201d a terrorist attack for political gain. Earlier       Stephen Colbert,        well known as a good man, a gentleman, said of the president, in a rant: \u201cThe only thing your mouth is good for is being       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       c\u2014 holster.\u201d Those are but five dots in a larger, darker pointillist painting. You can think of more.Too many in the mainstream media\u2014not all, but too many\u2014don\u2019t even bother to fake fairness and lack of bias anymore, which is bad: Even faked balance is better than none.Yes, they have reasons. They find Mr. Trump to be a unique danger to the republic, an incipient fascist; they believe it is their patriotic duty to show opposition. They don\u2019t like his policies. A friend suggested recently that they hate him also because he\u2019s in their business, show business. Who is he to be president? He\u2019s not more talented. And yet as soon as his presidency is over he\u2019ll get another reality show.And there\u2019s something else. Here I want to note the words spoken by Kathy Griffin, the holder of the severed head. In a tearful news conference she said of the president, \u201cHe broke me.\u201d She was roundly mocked for this. Oh, the big bad president\u2019s supporters were mean to you after you held up his bloody effigy. But she was exactly right. He did break her. He robbed her of her sense of restraint and limits, of her judgment. He broke her, but not in the way she thinks, and he is breaking more than her.We have been seeing a generation of media figures cratering under the historical pressure of Donald Trump. He really is powerful.They\u2019re losing their heads. Now would be a good time to regain them.They have been making the whole political scene lower, grubbier. They are showing the young what otherwise estimable adults do under pressure, which is lose their equilibrium, their knowledge of themselves as public figures, as therefore examples\u2014tone setters. They\u2019re paid a lot of money and have famous faces and get the best seat, and the big thing they\u2019re supposed to do in return is not be a slob. Not make it worse.By indulging their and their audience\u2019s rage, they spread the rage. They celebrate themselves as brave for this. They stood up to the man, they spoke truth to power. But what courage, really, does that take? Their audiences love it. Their base loves it, their demo loves it, their bosses love it. Their numbers go up. They get a better contract. This isn\u2019t brave.If these were only one-offs, they\u2019d hardly be worth comment, but these things build on each other. Rage and sanctimony always spread like a virus, and become stronger with each iteration.And it\u2019s no good, no excuse, to say Trump did it first, he lowered the tone, it\u2019s his fault. Your response to his low character is to lower your own character? He talks bad so you do? You let him destabilize you like this? You are making a testimony to his power.So many of our media figures need at this point to be reminded: You belong to something. It\u2019s called: us.Do your part, take it down some notches, cool it.

On Wednesday the Senate voted 97-2 to strengthen sanctions on       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       regime, a rare moment of bipartisan agreement these days.The amendment to an Iran sanctions bill would require congressional approval before President Trump lifts current sanctions on Russian entities. It broadens the field of potential sanctions targets to include those involved in human-rights abuses or doing business with Russian intelligence and defense industries, among others. It also expands the range of Russian industries that could be subject to sanctions.The Administration objected to the proposal, but what did Mr. Trump expect? Ordinarily we\u2019d agree with Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        who warned a House committee this week not to limit the President\u2019s \u201cflexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation.\u201d The Constitution intends for the executive to have broad discretion on foreign policy.But it\u2019s hard to fault Congress for being skeptical. Though there\u2019s no evidence of campaign \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia, Mr. Trump has been oddly solicitous of Mr. Putin. Congress is sending a useful message that Mr. Trump has little running room to negotiate unless the Russian changes his behavior.Mr. Putin is giving American leaders plenty of reasons to act. Russians have spread misinformation and used computer hacks to disrupt elections in France, Germany and the U.S. Russia still occupies Ukrainian territory in Crimea; frequently violates the Minsk cease-fire agreements the Obama Administration helped negotiate for eastern Ukraine; and is propping up       Bashar Assad       in Syria.U.S. sanctions are also a message of support for the thousands of Russians protesting against corruption this week in the streets of major cities. The protests were inspired by opposition leader       Alexei Navalny,        who was sentenced this week to 30 days in jail for organizing a rally in Moscow. In a sign of how worried the Kremlin is, up to 1,700 protesters may have been arrested and courts are sentencing some to weeks in prison.One question is why Democrats on Capitol Hill took so long to notice. Their new enthusiasm for Russia sanctions follows eight years during which most\u2014although not all\u2014Congressional Democrats endorsed President Obama\u2019s and       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       \u201creset\u201d with Mr. Putin, supported Mr. Obama\u2019s refusal to offer lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, and granted him ample loopholes in sanctions legislation on both Russia and Iran. Their conversion now looks more political than principled.That doesn\u2019t make them less right, and we hope the House picks up the Senate sanctions legislation. Mr. Trump would then have to decide whether to veto, but an override wouldn\u2019t improve his standing on the world stage. The better choice would be to sign the bill, enforce the sanctions vigorously, and work with Congress to forge a bipartisan approach to Russia. That would help the President rebut fears that he can\u2019t be trusted on Russia, while telling Mr. Putin that rogue behavior won\u2019t be rewarded.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 20:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-steps-up-on-russia-1497571253", "news_title": "Congress Steps Up on Russia", "keywords": " alexei navalny, barack obama, crimea, donald trump, hillary clinton, minsk cease fire, russia,sanctions, vladimir putin,corporate,industrial news,corporate social responsibility,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "The             Nasdaq Co      mposite posted another session of declines as technology stocks resumed their slide.Thursday\u2019s moves sent the index, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, lower for the fourth time in the past five trading days.U.S. stocks have hit a string of records this year, in part due to stronger-than-expected corporate earnings.

The question has been posed countless times, and each time liberals answer more decisively than the previous: No.On Thursday Britain\u2019s Liberal Democrats delivered that message to their leader,       Tim Farron,        forcing him to resign over his mildly conservative views on homosexuality and abortion. The Lib Dems supposedly carry the torch of 19th-century classical liberalism, though more recently it\u2019s been difficult to distinguish them from any progressive party, anywhere.Not least when it comes to gender-and-sexuality orthodoxy. The media and many in his own party have hounded Mr. Farron for years because he deviated\u2014gently, almost imperceptibly\u2014from that orthodoxy. A working-class evangelical Christian, Mr. Farron imagined that his liberal opinions on other big issues like climate change and the European Union would protect him. He was wrong.Soon after he took the party reins in 2015, Mr. Farron was asked whether, as a Christian, he considers homosexuality a sin. The Lib Dem leader gave the quintessential Christian reply: \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t enough. The question would resurface amid the election campaign this spring.During a TV interview on April 18, he was pressed four times, and four times he demurred. Quiescence wasn\u2019t enough.Pressure mounted, and the next day Mr. Farron relented. No, he clarified in remarks at the House of Commons, homosexuality isn\u2019t a sin. That still wasn\u2019t enough. The latter-day Gletkins and Ivanovs needed to be sure that Mr. Farron believed this in his heart of hearts, not merely as a matter of public confession. If he didn\u2019t think homosexuality a sin, asked a BBC interviewer a few days later, why had it taken him so long to say so? Mr. Farron was reduced to spouting gibberish.Then the Guardian newspaper unearthed a 2007 interview, in which he had suggested that \u201cabortion is wrong\u201d but also cautioned Christian activists that an immediate outright ban would be impracticable. Confronted with his own words on the campaign trail, Mr. Farron pleaded that he\u2019d never advocated abortion restrictions. It wasn\u2019t enough.In his resignation statement, Mr. Farron wrote: \u201cTo be a political leader, especially of a progressive liberal party in 2017, and to live as a committed Christian, to hold faithfully to the Bible\u2019s teaching, has felt impossible.\u201d He added: \u201cI seem to have been the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in.\u201dThe concept he was grasping for is conscience.Mr. Farron\u2019s politics recall the liberalism of Gladstone, Chesterton and Isaiah Berlin, which treated conscience as king. Today\u2019s liberalism has triumphed so spectacularly over the claims of faith and tradition that it has nothing left to conquer but the individual conscience. This is why modern liberals are so unmagnanimous in victory.It isn\u2019t enough to emancipate transgender people\u2014you, rabbi, must adhere to strict pronoun guidelines and feel in your soul that       Chelsea Manning       was always a \u201cshe.\u201d It isn\u2019t enough to legalize abortion\u2014you, Tim Farron, must like it.Liberals welcome believers insofar as religion can be deployed in service of liberal causes, to be sure. But any expression of theological or moral judgment is met with hostility.Witness, across the Atlantic, Sen.       Bernie Sanders\u2019s       tirade against Russell Vought, President Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. During a Senate confirmation hearing last week, the Vermont socialist grilled Mr. Vought about his contention, in a blog post published last year, that Muslims \u201cdo not know God, because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned.\u201dMr. Vought\u2019s was a particularly stark summary of the basic Christian teaching that faith in the God-Man is essential to salvation. Plenty of Americans might disagree with the substance, phrasing or both. But Mr. Sanders went further, arguing that Mr. Vought\u2019s views were \u201cIslamophobic\u201d and \u201chateful\u201d and therefore disqualifying.Set aside the senator\u2019s riding roughshod over the Constitution, which prohibits religious tests for office. What was most depressing about his outburst was the bleak vision of civic life behind it.To wit, Mr. Sanders implied that a devout Christian can\u2019t hold fast to his faith\u2019s most demanding claims and at the same time exercise public authority with decency and honor. If you disagree with someone\u2019s theology, in other words, it must mean you hate him. Yet at its best the West has stood for the opposite principle: that people can build and share a democratic public square across and even through such differences.That principle is decaying across much of the West, and authoritarian adversaries like       Vladimir Putin       are no doubt trying to accelerate its demise. But it wasn\u2019t Mr. Putin who made Western politics so inhospitable to large segments of society\u2014and to conscience.Mr. Ahmari is a Journal editorial writer in London.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Believers Need Not Apply.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberalism-believers-need-not-apply-1497570751", "news_title": "Liberalism: Believers Need Not Apply", "keywords": " abortion, conscience, faith, freedom of religion, liberal democrats,liberalism, progressives, tim farron,Tim Farron,abortion,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "When the       Trump       administration notified Congress last month that it plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, it started a process that could drag on for years. But there\u2019s a huge potential obstacle: the Mexican and American political calendars. U.S. trade negotiators should aim for a fast and favorable outcome, but they also need to prepare for the possibility of negotiating with an increasingly hostile southern neighbor.Mexico will elect a new president and Congress in July 2018. U.S. midterm elections will take place the following November. Starting early next year, domestic electoral politics in both countries likely will pre-empt consensus on a trade agreement. If Nafta isn\u2019t renegotiated by the end of 2017, meaningful talks almost certainly will be deferred to 2019.Mexico\u2019s populism-driven presidential race appears set to be focused on corruption and security.       Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s       left-populist Movement of National Regeneration leads in the polls. President       Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s       center-left Institutional Revolutionary Party and the center-right National Action Party also have significant support, though independents and other parties further split the field.It\u2019s possible Mexico\u2019s next president will win with 30% of the vote and a minority of seats in the legislature. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s vocal criticism of the U.S., free markets and trade suggests his victory would make any renegotiation difficult.When Candidate Trump first denounced Nafta, many Mexicans naturally panicked. That fear has since dissipated. Around 80% of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the U.S., according to the Congressional Research Service. Mexico is the second largest recipient of U.S. exports and the third largest importer of U.S. agricultural products, data from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show.Mexican entrepreneurs won\u2019t accept just any deal. They want one that serves their country\u2019s long-term interests. The U.S. states that export the most to Mexico\u2014Texas, Michigan, California and Illinois\u2014also carry huge political weight. Mexican leaders understand that if U.S. exports do not find a home in Mexico, they will have an even harder time finding other markets, especially in Asia.Trade politics are equally complex in the U.S. Antiglobalization sentiment remains fervent in many quarters of the left and right. The U.S. could threaten tariffs to block Mexican exports, but this would directly hurt American companies and workers.Consider the automobile industry. Prohibitive U.S. tariffs on Mexican-finished automobiles would undermine the American companies that export car parts to Mexican assembly plants.The energy market further underscores how interlinked the two economies have grown. As of 2016, the U.S. exports more refined fuel products and natural gas to Mexico than to any other country in the world, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. With global fuel markets saturated, the U.S. needs Mexico\u2019s energy consumers, and Mexico needs American fuel.Trade laws further complicate the timeline for renegotiation. Formal talks can begin only when the U.S. completes legislatively required congressional consultations in mid-August. Once Nafta is renegotiated, the Trump administration must report to Congress on proposed \u201ctrade remedies\u201d 180 days before signing the agreement. If negotiations close by the end of 2017, the earliest signing date would be July 1, 2018. That very same day Mexico elects a new president. On July 1, the president\u2019s fast-track trade promotion authority will expire. If Congress doesn\u2019t extend that authority beforehand, lawmakers could enact myriad amendments.If the Trump administration wants to negotiate with the current Mexican government, it must complete talks within five months. The president will also have to persuade Congress quickly to extend his trade promotion authority. On Mexico\u2019s side, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto would have to convene an extraordinary session of Mexico\u2019s Congress before he leaves office to ratify the agreement\u2014or his successor could scrap it.If Mexico has ratified the new agreement, the U.S. Congress can approve it in 2019. But if lawmakers in Washington balk, negotiations will start anew in 2019 with the new Mexican government, or the agreement could collapse entirely. And then there\u2019s Canada, which could hold elections in October 2019, another potential complication.The entire process is fraught with risk that could damage the continent\u2019s global economic prospects. If the U.S., Mexico and Canada instead want stability, they should agree from the outset to a \u201cstandstill\u201d that honors Nafta\u2019s terms while they negotiate. The alternative, a retaliatory trade war, would rob all the parties of markets, efficiencies and exports. China would love nothing better.Despite all these risks, quickly ratifying an amended agreement could provide a positive outcome for all three countries. The current Mexican administration has little to lose from a good deal that mitigates economic risk. Canada has everything to gain. For the U.S., an interim outcome eliminates uncertainty about a future Mexican negotiating counterpart. Playing the short game is worth it. Too bad a gloomier outcome appears more likely.Mr. Pascual, a senior vice president at the consulting firm IHS, served as U.S. ambassador to Mexico (2009-11) and Ukraine (2000-03).Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-is-running-out-for-nafta-1497570542", "news_title": "Time Is Running Out for Nafta", "keywords": "mexico,nafta,pena nieto,trump,white house,North American Free Trade Agreement,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Shai Schmidt       no longer counts the Shabbat dinner as part of his typical Friday night. Yet having grown up as part of a traditional family in Jerusalem, the rituals are familiar: warm challah bread, cold wine, hot chicken soup, spirited songs. Although Mr. Schmidt is no longer religiously observant, he often finds himself missing the experience. It can be hard to replicate.The Shabbat dinner marks the ceremonial start of the Jewish Sabbath, which runs from Friday evening to Saturday night. Observant Jews spend the 25 hours abstaining from working, handling money, driving, writing and much more. In a world where cellphones and other devices essentially function as bodily appendages, the Sabbath offers respite from the noise. Rather than seeing the rules as restrictions, many think of them as a source of liberation, providing time to stop and think without constant interruption.For Jews like Mr. Schmidt\u2014respectful of tradition but personally unobservant\u2014there are relatively few substitutes. But       Aaron Kaplowitz       and       Shimon Shmooely       hope to change that with a series of dinners called \u201c+1\u201d that they have begun hosting in New York.For the first dinner on March 10, the two 30-somethings invited 18 guests from across the religious, professional and social spectra. These 18 were then asked to invite someone to the next dinner. The pattern will repeat each time, culminating in a fifth and final dinner for 288 attendees later this year. Each of the dinners includes Shabbat staples like challah and wine, but they also have interesting programming.At the first one, billionaire philanthropist       Lynn Schusterman,        whose foundation provided funds for the first two dinners, spoke about her focus on Jewish continuity and pluralism. The Israeli musician       Yoni Bloch       described how he went from a rock star to technology entrepreneur. At the second dinner, Ambassador       Dani Dayan,        Israel\u2019s consul general in New York, fielded questions about his personal political views and the current policies of the government in Jerusalem.At the most recent dinner, three Israelis with different disabilities talked about the challenges they face navigating daily life. Attendees were then given a small sliver of their experience by being impaired throughout the meal. I was blindfolded for the first course, unable to see who at my table was harmonizing as we sang \u201c      Shalom Aleichem,       \u201d the song that formally begins the Shabbat meal. For the main course, I was given gloves that made it unthinkably difficult to use utensils, pick up a glass, or wield a napkin. (Mercifully, my dress somehow remained unstained.) During dessert, I wore specially made headphones that made it impossible to hear fellow diners. This was not my Bubbe\u2019s Shabbat table.Messrs. Kaplowitz and Shmooely hope others replicate their experiment. They want to expand the way people experience the Sabbath\u2014along with who experiences it. For me, Shabbat is a weekly tradition, but it had been far less familiar to many of the dinner attendees. One attendee, who works in New York real estate, told me that growing up in the Soviet Union, his family never had Shabbat dinners. It wasn\u2019t until he came to the U.S. in the mid-1990s that he first experienced the ritual so commonplace to American Jews. Mr. Schmidt, one of the original attendees, brought along two secular friends to the subsequent dinners.The early Zionist thinker known as       Ahad Ha\u2019am      \u2014whose Hebrew nom de plume translates to \u201cone of the people\u201d\u2014wrote in an 1898 essay: \u201cMore than the Jews have kept the Sabbath, the Sabbath has kept the Jews.\u201d Observing the laws of the Sabbath as a modern Orthodox Jew has molded and solidified my own religious beliefs. It has kept me, one could say. Most American Jews aren\u2019t Orthodox, but even without strict observance, the experience of Sabbath can keep them too.For some, perhaps, the Sabbath calls to mind an archaic institution characterized by tedious traditions. But the minute details of observing the Sabbath are far less significant than the idea of the day itself. It\u2019s easy to think of religion in its traditional glory as the enemy of modernity, but these recent dinners prove something else: that it\u2019s possible to be faithful to the customs of the past while recognizing that an evolving culture ensures new meaning will be found in old rituals.Ms. Greenbaum is an assistant editor at Commentary magazine.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whom-have-you-brought-to-shabbat-1497570577", "news_title": "Whom Have You Brought to Shabbat?", "keywords": "challah,jew,jewish,judaism,sabbath,shabbat,political,general news,society,community,religion,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Many American men born in the years immediately following World War II, my dad among them, are marked by stoic dispositions.

By the time I learned he was in the hospital, it wasn\u2019t clear he was going to survive. Making matters worse, I heard all this while I was in an airport. So I decided then and there, when tomorrow wasn\u2019t assured, that it was time to change things forever between us. I dialed his number.\u201cHello?\u201d It\u2019s my mom.\u201cMom, it\u2019s me.

Doctors caught it in time, and say they can break up the clot with medicine.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound convinced. Not scared, but not convinced. I wasn\u2019t going to miss my chance.\u201cDad,\u201d I said, my voice catching a little, \u201cI just want you to know that I love you. And you don\u2019t have to say it, but I know you love me, too. I\u2019ve always known it.\u201d\u201cOK, uh, thanks.\u201d His voice sounded a little stronger. \u201cListen, the doctors are coming back into the room now, so I need to go.\u201d The phrasing was ominous. \u201cGoodbye, son.\u201d He hung up.I tried to keep my composure in LaGuardia Terminal C, just like dad would. I don\u2019t know how much time passed\u2014enough to say a couple of quiet Hail Marys and my break-the-glass prayer that only God knows. Suddenly, my phone starts ringing. It\u2019s my kid brother.

I thought he was dying. He sounded so frail, so scared, and\u2014wait, how did you know that?\u201d\u201cHe just called me from the hospital and told me. Seriously, Mike, the L-word?

Many highly educated, upper-middle-class Democrats regard themselves as exemplars of \u201ccompassion\u201d (which they have elevated into a supreme political principle) and yet they routinely assail Trump voters as ignorant, callous hate-mongers. These elite Democrats occupy an amorphous meta-realm of subjective emotion, theoretical abstractions, and refined language. But Trump is by trade a builder who deals in the tangible, obdurate, objective world of physical materials, geometry, and construction projects, where communication often reverts to the brusque, coarse, high-impact level of pre-modern working-class life, whose daily locus was the barnyard. It\u2019s no accident that bourgeois Victorians of the industrial era tried to purge \u201cbarnyard language\u201d out of English.Last week, that conceptual gap was on prominent display, as the media, consumed with their preposterous Russian fantasies, were fixated on former FBI director       James Comey\u2019s       maudlin testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. (Comey is an effete charlatan who should have been fired within 48 hours of either Hillary or Trump taking office.) Meanwhile, Trump was going about his business.

Mr. Comey was overseeing a probe into whether associates of Mr. Trump colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.Russia has denied any government interference in the election, and Mr. Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Moscow.In another afternoon tweet, the president made reference to a meeting on an airport tarmac in Phoenix last year between former President       Bill Clinton       and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Critics said the meeting was improper, coming at a time when the FBI was investigating Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system when she served as secretary of state.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet suggested, without offering any substantiation, that Mrs. Clinton set up the meeting between her husband and Ms. Lynch.Using the nickname he gave her in the campaign, Mr. Trump mentioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices and tweeted that \u201cCrooked H \u2026 had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared \u2013 & they talk about obstruction?\u201dMs. Lynch has said the airport tarmac meeting consisted of nothing more than a cordial conversation about grandchildren and other pleasantries, but that she regretted it.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, tweeted: \u201cThe most surefire indication that the right is running scared is when they turn things back to false attacks on Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvisers to Mr. Trump have urged him not to tweet about the Russia investigation, cautioning that his comments could provide fodder for Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.

Remember the \u201cenergy independence\u201d preoccupation of not so long ago? The U.S. is now emerging as the world\u2019s energy superpower and U.S. oil and gas exports are rebalancing global markets. More remarkable still, this dominance was achieved by private U.S. investment, innovation and trade\u2014not Washington central planning.Thanks largely to the domestic hydraulic fracturing revolution, the U.S. has been the world\u2019s top natural gas producer since 2009, passing Russia, and the top producer of oil and petroleum hydrocarbons since 2014, passing Saudi Arabia. By now this is well known.Less appreciated is the role that energy exports are now playing in sustaining U.S. production despite lower prices. Since Congress lifted the 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports in 2015, exports are rising in some weeks to more than one million barrels of oil per day. That\u2019s double the pace of 2016 when government permission was required, according to a recent Journal analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.The U.S. still imports about 25% of petroleum consumption on net, mostly from Canada and Mexico, but lifting the ban has resulted in a more efficient global supply chain. Most domestic refineries are configured to process heavy crudes, but fracking tends to produce light sweet crudes. Exporting the light and importing cheaper heavy oil results in lower prices for gasoline and other petro-products, and the larger world market has allowed U.S. drillers to revive production after prices fell from close to $90 a barrel in 2014.Then there is the surge in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Since the first LNG shipment from the lower 48 left a Louisiana port in 2016, the EIA expects exports will climb by about 200% over the next five years.What is responsible for this progress? Well, producers are responding to a modest recovery in commodity prices after the price bust amid rising demand, and break-even costs for production continue to fall as technology and cost-management improve. But better policy decisions have also been crucial.Under federal law, natural gas exports must be certified by the Department of Energy as \u201cconsistent with the public interest,\u201d whether the U.S. has a free-trade agreement with the destination country or not. DOE approval is also necessary to build liquefied natural gas export terminals, and the       Obama       Administration slow-walked these licences until deep into the second term.Yet starting in April, Energy Secretary       Rick Perry       approved a burst of LNG projects and promised to speed review of some two dozen other export terminals. In May the rhetorically trade-averse       TrumpCo      mmerce Department signed a market-access pact that welcomed China to receive U.S. liquefied natural gas shipments and make long-term LNG contracts with U.S. suppliers.This wave of American LNG is already moving the global market toward a single price, like oil. As long as pipelines were the only transportation option, outfits like Gazprom were able to force their customers to take gas at inflated prices. Increased competition and energy diversification in Europe, where 14 NATO countries now buy 15% or more of their oil and gas from Russia, will also decrease Russia\u2019s leverage as the region\u2019s dominant producer.As for the oil-export ban, this policy triumph arrived as part of a compromise between Republican leaders in Congress and the Obama White House in the 2015 budget deal. The GOP had to extend green-energy subsidies for several years as the price of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature, but opposition from the left to any exports was certain to grow. GOP leaders recognized that a policy victory established by statute was worth the trade, and they are being vindicated now as exports grow with dividends for U.S. workers and energy production.Conservative critics at the time didn\u2019t take the long view, to say the least. The Heritage Action pressure group instructed Congress to vote against the compromise, saying it \u201cfails to achieve significant conservative policy victories.\u201d       Steve Bannon       and       Julia Hahn,        now White House aides, wrote a Breitbart.com manifesto \u201c      Paul Ryan       Betrays America,\u201d calling the bill \u201ca total and complete sell-out of the American people.\u201d Opposition was concentrated among Republicans: 95 Representatives and 35 GOP Senators voted nay, but Democrats didn\u2019t get the better of the deal.All of this is a lesson in free-market energy policy but also the occasional wisdom of accepting partial victory. The last two Presidents\u2014including       George W. Bush,        President Ethanol\u2014had too much confidence in government to drive energy change. President Trump doesn\u2019t appear to be following their example, and Americans are benefiting as a result.Appeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-of-the-energy-export-boom-1497568180", "news_title": "Lessons of the Energy Export Boom", "keywords": "marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,energy department,executive branch,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,liquid petroleum gas markets,editorials,energy,natural gas upstream operations,basic materials,resources,natural gas,oil extraction,fracking,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "A lawsuit against             General Electric Co.\u2019s       finance unit over its relationship with convicted businessman Thomas Petters, whose $40 billion empire collapsed in 2008, will move to trial as a result of a bankruptcy judge\u2019s ruling on Thursday.In a 34-page ruling, Judge Paul Hyman refused to dismiss a federal lawsuit that accused the General Electric unit of conspiring to commit fraud by keeping quiet in 2000 when its employees allegedly discovered that Mr. Petters was operating a Ponzi scheme. The dispute will head to a jury in a trial that has yet to be scheduled.The lawsuit was filed by two Florida hedge funds that lost about $650 million in the scheme. The investment entities filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and were taken over by Florida accountant       Barry Mukamal,        who has tried to collect money for their investors.The GE unit has fought the lawsuit. Specifically, its lawyers argued that Mr. Mukamal didn\u2019t have the authority to pursue the suit because the power to do so remained with another trustee who took over Mr. Petters\u2019 bankrupt companies.Judge Hyman rejected that argument in his ruling.In 1998, a division of GE\u2019s finance arm, GE Capital, loaned money to a Petters-controlled business, according to court papers. The conglomerate has since sold off a lion\u2019s share of its finance business. When the lender allegedly discovered the fraud several months later, it struck a deal to be repaid and wrote a recommendation letter that Mr. Petters and his colleagues used to get more investors, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in West Palm Beach, Fla.\u201c[The GE unit] joined the third-largest financial crime in American history,\u201d       Michael Budwick,        who represents Mr. Mukamal, told The Wall Street Journal Thursday. \u201cWe are eager to present [its] misconduct to a jury this summer.\u201dThe GE unit\u2019s lawyers declined to comment on Judge Hyman\u2019s ruling. A GE representative also declined to comment.Mr. Petters, whose business empire once encompassed Polaroid and Sun Country Airlines, told investors that their money would help his companies buy electronic goods, which they then resold to retail stores. That money, instead, was used to fund Petters\u2019 extravagant lifestyle and pay off other investors, creating the illusion of profits.Leaders at the failed Florida hedge funds, Palm Beach Finance Partners LP and Palm Beach Finance II LP, said that Mr. Petters used his relationship with the established lender \u201cas a strategic selling point,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Mukamal sued in 2012, hoping to collect $650 million along with damages and unpaid interest.In late 2008, U.S. government agencies exposed the 15-year scheme. Mr. Petters was later convicted of multiple counts of fraud and money laundering and is now serving a 50-year prison sentence at the Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas.Write to Katy Stech at katherine.stech@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-against-ge-finance-unit-over-petters-fraud-heads-to-trial-1497567733", "news_title": "Lawsuit Against GE Finance Unit Over Petters\u2019 Fraud Heads to Trial", "keywords": "bankruptcy,bankruptcy news,chapter 11,General Electric,GE,corporate crime,legal action,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,ponzi,pyramid scheme,securities fraud,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "This year is shaping up to be a dismal one for so-called quant funds, typically some of Wall Street\u2019s hottest investors.At Two Sigma Investments LLC, the $45 billion firm\u2019s flagship Compass fund is down 2.5% this year through May 31, fund investors say.

The firm recently cut fees charged to its investors.Overall, quant funds, which use sophisticated statistical models often developed by Ph.D.s rather than trade based on human research and intuition to find attractive trades, rose 1.44% this year, through May, according to data-tracker HFR. That compares with a gain of 8.7% for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and a rise of 5.7% for the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, which invests 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, highlighting how far quant hedge funds are lagging behind more traditional investments.\u201cYou will see some very, very bad May numbers for a lot of firms,\u201d says Andrew Fishman, president of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors LLC, which invests about $16 billion, including borrowed money, in various quantitative strategies.So far, the weakness hasn\u2019t stunted investor interest.Through the first quarter of this year, $4.6 billion of net new money was invested in quant funds, even as over $10 billion was withdrawn from non-quant funds, HFR says. Quants now are responsible for 27% of all U.S. stock trades by investors, \u200baccording to the Tabb Group, a research and consulting firm in New York.At the same time, more traditional investors are turning to sophisticated computer models to guide their trading, adding to the flow of money backing quant strategies.The disappointing recent performance raises questions among some investors about whether too much money is pursuing quant strategies and whether performance is beginning to suffer as a result.\u201cThere are so many different types of bets quant firms can make over so many different time horizons and with so many data sets, so I\u2019m not worried yet,\u201d says Mr. Fishman, whose fund is up about 7% so far this year, according to investors. \u201cBut there are definitely a lot of guys chasing similar ideas.\u201dSo-called trend-following firms\u2014quant funds \u200bthat bet on the continued momentum of certain investments\u2014have been especially weak performers, partly because some trends that worked over the past year or so, such as rising oil prices and a climb in the value of the U.S. dollar, haven\u2019t continued. Surprising strength for Treasurys and a lack of overall market volatility are among other reasons for the losses, investors say.GSA Capital Partners LLP, a $7.8 billion firm that spun out of Deutsche Bank in 2005, saw its $3.8 billion Trend fund drop 7.6% through June 8, even as the fund received $1 billion of new cash this year, said a person familiar with the matter. The flagship fund run by Leda Braga\u2019s Systematica Investments, the $5.5 billion BlueTrend Fund Ltd., is up less than 1% this year, through June 2. The fund, which takes riskier bets on market moves than many of its peers, fell nearly 11% last year.And two funds run by Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management, which manages $6 billion in its trend-following strategy, are down 7.4% and 4.8% through June 7, according to data sent to investors.The broad remit of quantatitive funds makes it hard to generalize about them. Some firms hold investments for seconds while others hold for seasons, for example, and many pursue multiple strategies.And some are up a lot. Renaissance Technologies LLC\u2019s $14 billion Renaissance Institutional Equities LP fund, or RIEF, rose over 10.5% this year, through May, investors say, while the $11 billion Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha Int. LP fund rose about 13.5% this year.\u201cRenaissance has other inputs in its algorithms besides trend following,\u201d explaining the outperformance, says Amanda Haynes-Dale, co-founder of Pan Reliance Capital Advisors, a Renaissance client.The firm has thousands of trading signals it relies on\u2014from economic-data points to the value of global assets in real time\u2014and employs computer science, statistics and more.Some quant firms with struggling funds have others with better results. Man AHL\u2019s Evolution fund rose 9.9% through June 9, for instance. Systematica\u2019s $1 billion Systematica Alternative Markets Fund Ltd. is up 8.7% this year, profiting from niche trades on credit derivatives and Czech interest rates, according to an investor letter seen by The Wall Street Journal.Some investors turn to some of these strategies for uncorrelated returns, those that don\u2019t move in lockstep with stocks. So they may not be disappointed with the funds\u2019 performance, as long as they hold up during a downturn.Still, some funds are changing their methods to adjust to the new environment, which some quants say has been especially challenging amid the market swings since the U.S. election in November.Florin Court Capital, a London hedge fund backed by Swedish investment firm Brummer & Partners, has largely stopped trying to make money from momentum trades in developed markets, a relatively simple strategy still used by many trend-following firms and other quants. Instead, it has shifted to more complex or esoteric trades, such as taking advantage of price differences in various maturities of a bond.Florin\u2019s founder Doug Greenig, a former chief risk officer at Man Group\u2019s AHL unit, says trend-following funds trading developed markets had been \u201clanguishing\u201d and managers needed to look for new sources of returns.Since the financial crisis, trend-following funds \u201cas a group have had only one really great year,\u201d in 2014, he says.Write to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Once-Hot Quant Funds Get Lukewarm Start to Year.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/flush-with-cash-top-quant-funds-stumble-1497561706", "news_title": "Flush With Cash, Top Quant Funds Stumble", "keywords": " computer model trading, fund inflows, fund returns,hedge funds, quantative funds,Man Group,EMG.LN,UK:EMG,Two Sigma Investments,AHL Dimension,Winton Group,GSA Capital Partners,Systematica Investments,Renaissance Technologies,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,portfolio,fund,asset management,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Otto Warmbier,        the U.S. student imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year before his release this week, has suffered extensive loss of brain tissue and is in a state of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness,\u201d doctors treating him said Thursday.The doctors in Cincinnati have limited medical data from North Korea, and the reasons for Mr. Warmbier\u2019s injury remain unclear. Doctors said the damage to his brain is consistent with lack of oxygen caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, which in someone his age\u201422 years old\u2014could be caused by intoxication or trauma.The physicians didn\u2019t offer a prognosis, citing the wishes of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s family, but indicated he suffered a profound injury and faces a difficult road ahead.\u201cHe shows no signs of understanding language, responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surroundings,\u201d said Daniel Kanter, medical director in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Physicians there have treated Mr. Warmbier since his arrival late Tuesday.The North Koreans told U.S. officials during a secret meeting last week that Mr. Warmbier lost consciousness after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill. Mr. Warmbier\u2019s doctors said they saw no evidence of botulism but stressed they had very limited information about his condition before his arrival in Cincinnati.The doctors also didn\u2019t see signs of trauma to his bones or skin. Scans provided by the North Koreans indicate he suffered a brain injury at least 14 months ago, Dr. Kanter said.The North Koreans detained the University of Virginia student at the Pyongyang airport in January 2016 and sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly defacing a political poster while on tour there.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father,       Fred Warmbier,        said he received word only last week that his son was in a coma in North Korea, after having no information for more than a year. He said he was relieved to have his son home, but was angry because he was \u201cso brutally treated for so long.\u201d\u201cWe have few answers. There\u2019s no excuse for the way the North Koreans treated our son,\u201d Fred Warmbier said, speaking from his son\u2019s former high school in the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming.He wore the light-colored blazer that his son wore when he gave his confession in North Korea and choked back tears while speaking about his son. He said his wife, Cindy, was by Otto\u2019s side at the hospital, where he is in stable condition.In a one-sentence statement Thursday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said the U.S. student was sent home \u201con humanitarian grounds.\u201dPresident       Donald Trump       phoned Mr. Warmbier around 10 p.m. Wednesday, Mr. Warmbier said. In the conversation, Mr. Trump expressed sorrow about his son\u2019s condition and told Mr. Warmbier that he told him about what the State Department did to secure his son\u2019s release.\u201cHe wanted to find out about Otto,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was gracious and nice.\u201dMr. Warmbier said the Obama administration had stressed to the family that they maintain a low profile, and said, \u201cWe did so without result.\u201d But after the change of administration in Washington, the family \u201cdecided the time for strategic patience was over,\u201d Mr. Warmbier said.He also said that former U.S. professional basketball star       Dennis Rodman      \u2014who has made several trips to Pyongyang, and is visiting there again this week\u2014had nothing to do with       Otto Warmbier\u2019s       release.Mr. Warmbier said the North Korean government claims his son was in a coma for almost all the time he was held.One reason for his lengthy detention in that condition was because he was being held by North Korea\u2019s public security department, according to a person familiar with the situation. The public security department is seen as more hard-line than Pyongyang\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father said Thursday that his son was being held by North Korea \u201cas a war criminal.\u201dThe person familiar with the situation said that Pyongyang\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved to release Mr. Warmbier earlier this year after it had learned that he had been in a coma.U.S. citizens formerly detained for extended periods in North Korea, including missionary       Kenneth Bae       and tourists such as Korean War veteran       Merrill Newman,        have received medical care, but those cases were handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.After North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January last year, the U.S. led efforts to tighten sanctions on North Korea. In March 2016, the U.S. and South Korea conducted so-called decapitation exercises on the Korean Peninsula aimed at North Korea\u2019s leadership, and in July 2016 the Obama administration sanctioned leader       Kim Jong Un       directly for human-rights abuses, in moves that North Korea regards as acts of war.Three other American citizens are known to be detained in North Korea, according to U.S. authorities, and Mr. Warmbier called for their release as well.He expressed relief that the family and community didn\u2019t have to stay in the shadows any longer for fear of offending the secretive North Korean regime. He also criticized tour groups who help Americans access North Korea, and said he believes the North Koreans lure U.S. citizens there to take them \u201chostage.\u201d Roughly 5,000 Western tourists visit the country each year.Mr. Warmbier described his son as \u201ca sweet, loving, kind person\u201d who is also adventurous and had never been in a fight. He would have graduated from the University of Virginia in May.When his son returned home Tuesday night, Mr. Warmbier said he knelt down beside him and embraced him.\u201cThese things are tough to process but he\u2019s with us,\u201d Mr. Warmbier said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make him comfortable.\u201d\u2014Jonathan Cheng contributed to this article.Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Detainee Suffered Brain Tissue Loss.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-detainee-otto-warmbier-has-severe-neurological-injury-1497538241", "news_title": "North Korea Detainee Otto Warmbier Has Suffered Extensive Loss of Brain Tissue\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t", "keywords": "barack obama,brain injury,coma,detained,donald trump,fred warmbier,north korea,otto warmbier,politics,student,University of Cincinnati,U.S. State Department,Dr. Daniel Kanter,Fred Warmbier,Otto,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,crime,legal action,kidnapping,abduction,international relations"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Police in the nation\u2019s capital issued arrest warrants and wanted posters Thursday for a dozen members of the Turkish president\u2019s security team who are accused of assaulting demonstrators protesting the visit of       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       to Washington last month.The unusual prosecution of a foreign leader\u2019s security team sets the stage for a diplomatic showdown between Turkey and the U.S., which risks alienating an unpredictable ally over the incident.Mr. Erdogan quickly vowed to fight efforts to prosecute his bodyguards. The Turkish Foreign Ministry criticized the charges as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d And the ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador to its office in Ankara to express the government\u2019s concern.In Washington, Metropolitan Police Chief       Peter Newsham       said the Turkish security officers would face charges if they return to the U.S., even if they come back to protect Mr. Erdogan.\u201cIf they attempt to enter the United States, they will be arrested,\u201d Mr. Newsham said, while standing between \u201cwanted\u201d posters with photos of the suspects.Unless the U.S. decides to request extradition of the Turkish suspects, the security officials aren\u2019t expected to return voluntarily to face charges, making it unlikely that they will be arrested. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert refused Thursday to say if the U.S. would seek extradition, but left the door open for that possibility.\u201cThis is not over,\u201d she said.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said in a statement that the charges \u201csend a clear message that the United States does not tolerate individuals who use intimidation and violence to stifle freedom of speech and legitimate political expression.\u201dSeven of the 12 Turkish security officials are facing felony assault charges for their alleged role in beating demonstrators protesting Mr. Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington.The attacks, which Washington Mayor       Muriel Bowser       called a \u201cclear assault on the First Amendment,\u201d were captured by multiple news cameras and cellphone video that the police used to identify the suspects. The footage captured men in suits with side arms, identified by police as members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s security detail, kicking and beating protesters in a park known as Sheridan Circle across from the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence.Nine demonstrators were hospitalized. One police officer and two members of the Secret Service were also injured.The beatings cast a pall over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s first White House meeting with President       Donald Trump       and triggered a diplomatic crisis with Turkey.The House of Representatives unanimously approved a resolution condemning the attacks. The State Department called in the Turkish ambassador to express the government\u2019s concern about the attacks.\u201cRarely have I seen in my almost 28 years of policing the type of thing that I saw in Sheridan Circle,\u201d said Mr. Newsham, the police chief.The Turkish government accused anti-Erdogan protesters of instigating the clash and said they were sympathizers of the Kurdish PKK, a militant group classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Turkey.The Foreign Ministry in the Turkish capital summoned U.S. Ambassador John Bass to protest the move. The ministry blamed the incident on the Americans\u2019 failure to provide adequate security.\u201cIt has been conveyed to the ambassador that this decision taken by U.S. authorities is wrong, biased and lacks legal basis,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The D.C. police chief said the clash was unexpected, that his officers did the best they could, and the protesters\u2019 beliefs were of little importance.\u201cIn Washington, D.C., we do not care particularly what your views are, what you support or what you do not support,\u201d Mr. Newsham said. \u201cOur role is to make sure you can [protest] safely, especially if you are here peacefully.\u201dSoon after the charges were announced, Mr. Erdogan defended his bodyguards and vowed to fight any effort to prosecute his security detail.\u201cWhat kind of law is this?\u201d Mr. Erdogan said Thursday night in Ankara. \u201cIf my bodyguards cannot protect me, then why am I bringing them to America with me?\u201dThe Turkish president is a polarizing figure who has embarked on a widespread crackdown on domestic dissent. Turkey has detained more than 45,000 people, including opposition lawmakers, military officers, policemen, journalists and teachers accused of being linked to groups Turkey has deemed terrorist organizations.In one of the Washington videos, a security official can be seen conferring with Mr. Erdogan as he sat in his car after arriving at the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence. After talking to the president, the security official speaks to another member of the team who heads down toward the demonstration right before they are attacked. The video stoked speculation that Mr. Erdogan may have ordered the assaults, but Mr. Newsham said the police had no evidence to support that suspicion.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any information right now to suggest that we have any probable cause to make an arrest of the president,\u201d he said.Police have arrested four Americans accused of taking part in the beating, and they are seeking the arrest of two Canadian citizens facing assault charges.The decision to charge the Turkish security officials drew immediate praise from some lawmakers who have been pushing for action.Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, hailed the move and urged the State Department to reject a pending $1.2 million sale of handguns and ammunition to Turkish security forces.\u201cThe violent attacks by Turkish security forces on peaceful protesters in Washington were completely and totally unjustified,\u201d Mr. Royce said. \u201cNow, the State Department should double down on efforts to help bring these individuals to justice.\u201d\u2014Margaret Coker in Istanbul contributed to this article.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 19:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-police-issue-arrest-warrants-for-turkish-security-officers-over-clash-1497554880", "news_title": "Washington Police Issue Arrest Warrants for Turkish Security Officers Over Clash ", "keywords": "arrest warrants,beatings,extradition,president,security team,turkey,turkish security officers,Turkish Foreign Ministry,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,assault,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch,state department"}, {"content": "Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp.             said Thursday that federal regulators have given it a green light to produce an emergency injection treatment for allergic reactions, providing a potential competitor to Mylan NV\u2019s EpiPen.Adamis said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the trade name Symjepi for the epinephrine prefilled syringe treatment, which the company expects to launch in the second half of this year.The San Diego company intends to position Symjepi as a \u201clow cost alternative to the current offerings,\u201d according to a spokesman, and it will determine pricing at the time of launch.Adamis also plans on seeking FDA approval for a \u201cjunior\u201d version of Symjepi, said Chief Executive       Dr. Dennis Carlo.The pharmaceutical firm Mylan gained the rights to market EpiPen in 2007 and raised the list price for the lifesaving drug from around $100 to just over $600. The price increases touched off a wave of criticism last year and a federal probe. In October, Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations that it had overcharged the government for its EpiPen products. Mylan also released a less expensive version of the medicine, in December, offered at $300 for two injections.Symjepi is trying to enter the epinephrine-products market, which Adamis said in its annual report generated about $1.2 billion in sales last year.Shares of Adamis climbed 53% in Thursday trading to close at $5.75, and gained an additional 4.3% after hours.

A spokesman for the Senate majority leader on Thursday called the meeting a \u201cpositive step forward.\u201dAt the meeting in Albany, Queens legislator       Michael Gianaris,        a Democrat in the Senate\u2019s minority, asked the panel of nine for new rules surrounding legislative stipends.The stipends, public money handed out to legislators for leadership positions on committees or in party conferences, came under fire this year because some of the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate\u2019s bipartisan majority were receiving stipends marked for legislative committee chairpersons, despite being vice chairpersons.They have said it was legal and that the money could be given to a vice chair if a chairperson wasn\u2019t taking it.The issue cast a spotlight on how the stipends are used as perks in the Senate in general.Discussion of the matter hadn\u2019t been on the agenda for the ethics meeting Thursday, and seemed to catch the other members off-guard.Seeming to refer to state authorities probing the issue, the committee chairwoman, Republican Sen.

It is mostly focused on what the mayor called \u201cgood-paying jobs,\u201d ones that either pay at least $50,000 a year or lead to positions at that salary.\u201cThe job here is to lift the floor for everyone in this city,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at Thursday\u2019s news conference in Chelsea. \u201cTo make sure that a middle-class lifestyle really is available to everybody.\u201dThe projects in the plan, rolled out in a glossy, 111-page book titled, \u201cNew York Works,\u201d don\u2019t appear to create the full 100,000 jobs. City officials didn\u2019t outline exactly how they planned to reach the figure, but said\u00a0the plan was a blueprint.\u201cThis is a pathway for the 100,000,\u201d said       James Patchett,        president and chief executive of the New York City Economic Development Corp., a city agency involved in the plan.De Blasio administration officials said they would create 30,000 tech jobs, 15,000 life-sciences jobs, 20,000 industrial and manufacturing jobs and 10,000 in the creative and cultural sectors. They said another 25,000 jobs would be brought to the city by increasing available office space for businesses looking to expand or move to New York City with tax incentives and rezonings.Within the tech sector, city officials said many of the jobs would be created in cybersecurity, a growing field that helps protect corporations from hacking and similar threats.In the industrial and manufacturing sector, de Blasio administration officials said thousands of jobs would come from a push to modernize the city\u2019s freight system. That includes making $39 million in infrastructure upgrades to the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal as part of a larger effort to move more goods into the city using waterways instead of highways. Trucks carry 91% of goods into and out of New York City, clogging roadways and adding to pollution.The plan also includes a \u201cNightlife Ambassador,\u201d described as a \u201csenior-level administration official\u201d tasked with helping businesses obtain licensing and permits from the city\u2019s sprawling bureaucracy. City officials said they borrowed the idea from the cities of London and Amsterdam. They said they were still working out a salary for the position.The city\u2019s unemployment rate, which was 4.3% in May, according to state data, is low. But the mayor said the jobs would help protect the city, \u201cregardless of what happens in the economy.\u201d\u201cWe have an opportunity to shape our own destiny,\u201d he said.Kathryn Wylde,        president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, said there are already about 150,000 job vacancies in the city at any given time that can\u2019t be filled because the city doesn\u2019t have workers with the right skill set.\u201cThese efforts are important but the real key is the quality of our education system and the infrastructure that supports business development, like transportation,\u201d she said. Ms. Wylde, who has long served as a prominent liaison between City Hall and the business community, said she hadn\u2019t received an invitation to the news conference and hadn\u2019t seen the final plan.The initiative comes as Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is up for re-election this year. The jobs plan he unveiled\u00a0Thursday\u00a0appeared to be largely aimed at addressing the needs of middle-class New Yorkers, a subtle shift from his first campaign four years ago when addressing rising income inequality was the central theme.\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether there\u2019s a lot to celebrate here. The bigger need is amongst lower-income and unemployed New Yorkers,\u201d said       Jesse Laymon,        director of policy and advocacy at the New York City Employment and Training Coalition. The umbrella organization represents groups that offer job training and other job-related services, often to low-income New Yorkers. \u201cWhat the city ought to be focusing on is helping those new Yorkers get the training, the skills, the credentials they would need to get those jobs now,\u201d Mr. Laymon said.City officials said about 25% of the jobs would be accessible to New Yorkers without a college degree.

They say it is the only way to force Qatar to stop its alleged financing of international terrorism, a charge Doha has repeatedly denied.The U.A.E.\u2019s ambassador to Washington,       Yousef Al Otaiba,        suggested this week that the U.S. pull out its forces from the massive Al Udeid air base in Qatar. The facility has been the central staging ground for most American airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\u201cIf I want to be honest, I think the reason action hasn\u2019t been taken against Qatar is because of the air base,\u201d Mr. Otaiba told reporters in Washington. \u201cThe air base is a very nice insurance policy against any additional pressure.\u201dU.S. officials said the concurrent arrival of Arab diplomats in Washington this week was extraordinary.Saudi Foreign Minister       Adel al-Jubeir       met Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       on Tuesday, and the U.A.E.\u2019s top diplomat,       Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed       al Nahyan, dined with Mr. Tillerson on Wednesday.Also on Wednesday, Qatari Defense Minister Khalid al-Attiyah signed a $12 billion arms deal with Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       at the Pentagon. The country\u2019s foreign minister will arrive in Washington next week, said Qatari officials.\u201cWe believe that this agreement will propel Qatar\u2019s ability to provide for its own security while also reducing the burden placed upon the United States military in conducting operations against violent extremism,\u201d Mr. Attiyah said.Qatari officials said Al Udeid and Qatar are crucial to the fight against terrorism and the national security of the U.S.Senior U.S. officials described Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson as seeking to balance the demands of the three U.S. allies, but acknowledged the task might not be possible in the short term.Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to make more calls on the Qatar dispute on Friday, said U.S. officials. But they played down the prospect for a quick resolution or a formal meeting in Washington between the feuding parties, an approach that has been promoted by Doha, said these diplomats.The Trump administration also is waiting for Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. to send a list of formal demands that Qatar would need to meet to restore economic and diplomatic ties with its neighbors.Mr. Tillerson is \u201ctrying to bring some alignment where there\u2019s a willingness among the parties to find a resolution and de-escalate the situation with some of the factors that created it in the first place,\u201d said a senior U.S. official.Arab diplomats said their descent on Washington has been fueled, in part, by the conflicting statements coming out of the Trump administration.Mr. Trump, at times, has appeared to openly side with Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. Mr. Tillerson and Mr.\u00a0Mattis, however, have sought to be neutral and have called for the easing of the economic siege on Qatar.One Arab diplomat quipped that Washington\u2019s hotels are filled with Middle East officials striving to interpret the meaning of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.Mr. Attiyah hosted a roundtable with journalists and academics on Thursday at a Georgetown hotel.

KR 1.73%       sent shares in the nation\u2019s biggest supermarket chain down 19%.Kroger said that sales at longstanding stores fell for the second straight quarter and that increasing competition will hurt earnings for the year. Kroger\u2019s shares took their steepest one-day drop in more than 17 years on the news. Shares of other big food retailers also fell.It was the latest blow to big grocers battling volatile food prices on one front and stiffer competition on another.\u201cThe change right now in what the customer wants has never been faster,\u201d Kroger Chief Executive       Rodney McMullen       said in an interview.Consumers are buying more of their groceries outside of traditional supermarkets. Online merchants, discounters and meal-kit delivery services are all grabbing market share. At the same time, a global commodity glut has pulled down prices for many staple foods over the past 18 months, putting pressure on many retailers to lower prices.Sales have continued to slacken. In the first quarter, food and beverage sales at brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. were off nearly $3 billion, or 2.5%, from a year earlier, market research firm Nielsen says. Grocery-store visits rose just 0.5% over the past year.Some grocery sellers are making gains. Trips to deep-discount chains are up 2.9% over the past year, Nielsen says, and online grocery orders have risen 6.8%.\u201cThe economic model of the traditional grocery store is incredibly challenged,\u201d said Wolfe Research analyst       Scott Mushkin.Germany-based chain Lidl is opening its first 10 stores in the U.S. this week. At a store opening in Wilson, N.C., on Thursday, a line of more than 100 people snaked around the block ahead of time, an industry analyst reported.Rival German chain Aldi, which has operated in the U.S. for decades, plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years to open nearly 900 stores and remodel hundreds more.Amazon.com Inc.       also is selling fresh groceries in some cities and recently launched two grocery pickup locations in Seattle.\u201cThis is the most disruption the grocery industry has seen in the last half-century,\u201d said       David Ciancio,        a former Kroger executive and a strategist at consumer-data company dunnhumby. \u201cMore customers are concerned about price and value, and that has a material impact on profitability.\u201dWhole Foods Market Inc.             is under pressure to reverse a nearly two-year decline in same-store sales that has halved the specialty-food chain\u2019s share price.         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       the largest U.S. food seller, is cutting prices to keep up with competition from Amazon.         Target Corp.\u2019s       food-and-beverage comparable sales continued to fall in the latest quarter, even after the chain replaced its grocery chief earlier this year.Some grocers may need to merge to keep up, said Mr. McMullen, Kroger\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe would expect there would be consolidation in the industry.\u201dKroger will continue to cut prices to retain customers, he said, and strive to improve customer service in part by paying higher wages. That will add to pressure on Kroger\u2019s bottom line.\u201cThe best thing that we can do is to stay on the offense,\u201d he said.The downbeat outlook from Kroger, the largest traditional grocery chain in the U.S. by sales, triggered a selloff on Thursday across the food-retail sector. Shares of Whole Foods fell nearly 7%, while Wal-Mart and         Costco Wholesale Corp.       shed about 1%. Target\u2019s shares were off by more than 4%.Kroger\u2019s stock had already dropped 12% this year through Wednesday, hurt by a quarterly sales decline that broke a 13-year streak of quarterly growth. Thursday\u2019s share-price tumble to $24.56 erased another $5 billion in Kroger\u2019s market value.The Cincinnati-based company, which operates Ralphs, Fred Meyer and other chains in addition to its flagship Kroger stores, said on Thursday that same-store sales excluding fuel fell 0.2% in Kroger\u2019s fiscal first quarter, which ended May 20. That compares with a 2.4% rise in the same quarter a year earlier.Same-store sales could still grow by as much as 1% this year, Kroger forecast. Executives noted that same-store sales were positive in the last nine weeks of its fiscal first quarter and in the second quarter so far.Kroger expects annual adjusted earnings of between $2 to $2.05 a diluted share in 2017, compared with its previous estimate of $2.21 to $2.25.In all, the company reported a first-quarter profit of $303 million and revenue of $36.29 billion.\u2014Austen Hufford contributed to this articleWrite to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Kroger Rattles Nerves in Grocery Section.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 18:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kroger-shares-slide-as-grocer-is-battered-by-price-fight-1497531764", "news_title": "Kroger Shares Slide, as Grocer Is Battered by Price Fight", "keywords": "earnings,earnings outlook,earnings season,grocery store,kroger,kroger earnings,pricing,retailer,retail sales,supermarkets,wal-mart,Kroger,KR,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Lidl,David Ciancio,Scott Mushkin,financial performance,sales figures,share price movement,disruptions,corporate,industrial news,wooden furniture,retail,wholesale,food retailing,grocery stores,specialty stores,consumer goods,furniture"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       government came under mounting pressure over the fire that engulfed a high-rise building, killing at least 17 and leaving authorities bracing for far more, as critics pushed for answers about how a disaster of such scale could have happened in the U.K.The charred building, which looms over a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood not far from central London, continued to smolder Thursday and was at risk of internal collapse with bodies still inside. The death toll was expected to rise, possibly significantly, though authorities said the process of identifying the dead could take weeks.London police commander       Stuart Cundy       wouldn\u2019t speculate on the total number of people who died, but said he was hopeful it wouldn\u2019t reach more than 100.\u201cIt is not inevitable it will reach triple figures,\u201d Mr. Cundy said. \u201cFrom my personal perspective I really hope it is not.\u201dThe early-morning fire that blazed through the hulking 24-story tower where hundreds lived has raised questions about whether officials were too slow to address concerns about fire-safety measures in low-income housing.Mrs. May ordered a public inquiry. \u201cWe need to know what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe owe that to the families, to the people who have lost loved ones, friends, and the homes in which they lived.\u201dThe U.K. government provides a significant share of local-government income, and political opponents say spending cuts directed by the Conservative government have forced local governments to cut corners. Critics also accuse the Conservatives of being lax in enforcing adequate housing regulations.The blaze comes on the heels of a trio of terrorist attacks, including one in London less than two weeks ago, in a procession of dispiriting news over the past three months. Donations flooded into community centers. Families appealed on social media for information on people who were unaccounted for.Mr. Cundy said 17 of 37 people receiving hospital treatment were in critical care.It wasn\u2019t clear how many may have been trapped inside and weren\u2019t yet counted. But witnesses have described people screaming for help or attempting to signal from their apartments with lights. Others jumped from high floors to escape the flames.\u201cOur absolute priority for all of us is identifying and locating those that are missing,\u201d Mr. Cundy said. Officials were using teams of dogs to search because it was too dangerous for firefighters to go to the top floors. Victims would be identified using fingerprints, DNA and dental records, he said.Details began to emerge about some of the victims.       David Lammy,        a Labour lawmaker, said his friend living on the 20th floor of the building was communicating on Facebook that she was about to faint hours after the fire started. She is missing, and likely dead, he said.Another victim was identified as Mohammed AlHajali, a Syrian refugee who arrived in the U.K. in 2014 and was studying civil engineering. He lived on the 14th floor.\u201cHis dream was to be able to go back home one day and rebuild Syria,\u201d said the Syrian Solidarity Campaign, a U.K. network of refugee-rights activists. \u201cMohammed undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the U.K., in his own home.\u201dHe was separated from his older brother, Omar, who managed to get out. He went back to his flat where he talked to a friend on the phone, waiting to be rescued. After two hours, he said goodbye and asked his friend to pass the message on to his family because the fire had reached him, the group said.The fire\u2019s swift spread revived concerns about the safety of low-income public housing in one of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities, where housing for the poor can butt up against some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate. The building, Grenfell Tower, sits amid an otherwise upscale area in the tony district of Kensington and Chelsea.The public-housing block was built in 1974 and recently went through an \u00a38.6 million ($11 million) refurbishment that included new exterior cladding and a new heating system.Fire experts have suggested that the materials used on the outside of the building may have enabled the fire to swiftly spread.       Ray Bailey,        the managing director at Harley Facades Ltd., which completed the refurbishment work, said that the company was \u201cnot aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.\u201dResidents said they heard few, if any, alarms, and had complained for years about the building\u2019s fire safety, including that it lacked adequate emergency exits. It wasn\u2019t clear if the building had sprinklers installed, but residents who escaped the fire said none had come on.Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       said at a committee hearing in Parliament to discuss the crisis that residents had raised concerns about the building that went unanswered.\u201cSome hard questions have got to be answered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot be right that a fire like this takes so many lives in the 21st century, in modern Britain. Somewhere along the line, regulations, or something, failed.\u201dFire-services minister Nick Hurd said a complex investigation into what happened would take several months and that bureaucracy wouldn\u2019t get in the way.\u201cIt is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,\u201d he said.Critics said the government failed to conclude a fire-safety review following a July 2009 fire that broke out in a 14-story residential public-housing block in Camberwell, south London, killing six.Jim Fitzpatrick,        a Labour lawmaker and former firefighter, said that because of when the Grenfell Tower was built it wouldn\u2019t have been required to have sprinklers, unlike newer buildings of its type.\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t been responding to the pressure, probes and questions we\u2019ve been asking them\u201d regarding fire-safety regulations. He said he is concerned the public inquiry could drag on. \u201cThis is far too urgent for that.\u201dThe department for communities and local government said it was \u201csimply not true\u201d\u200bthat the government hadn\u2019t done enough\u200b to review fire-safety regulations. It said work on the review continues.\u201cOur priority is to make sure we have the highest possible standards,\u201d the department said. Following the 2009 fire, the government wrote to local councils to encourage them to retrofit water sprinklers in older buildings, the department said.The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which manages Grenfell Tower for the local council, didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment on whether sprinklers had been installed. It said on Wednesday that it was too early to speculate on the cause and what contributed to the fire\u2019s spread.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 18:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-tower-fire-death-tolls-climbs-to-17-1497527977", "news_title": "London Tower Fire Death Tolls Climbs to at Least 17 ", "keywords": "fire,fire deaths,public safety,uk politics,Harley Facades,Theresa May,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Commuters emerged Thursday morning from the bowels of New York Penn Station looking confused, then bemused. Over and over, the travelers uttered the same cheerful pronouncement: Wow!Rarely has a new hallway elicited so much delight. But if the new pathway\u2014officially called the West End Concourse\u2014offers commuters a fresh route to escape the much-maligned Penn Station, that is a reason to cheer. Or, at least whip out a phone and snap a photo.Michael Riddell,        an architect who lives in Milburn, N.J., was among those who captured the moment. He said he has traveled through Penn Station for 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible. I\u2019m not even sure where I am,\u201d he joked.The West End Concourse, unveiled in full\u00a0on Thursday, connects the James. A. Farley Post Office Building with Penn Station, and is the first phase of a larger, future plan to bring Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road riders into a not-yet-built Moynihan Train Hall.Construction on the 36,870 square-foot area, which includes the concourse level and the two entry galleries at street level, began in September 2012 and cost a total of $315 million, financed through federal and state funds, according to Empire State Development.The concourse serves tracks 5 through 21 in Penn Station, with elevators and escalators leading out of the Farley Building onto the west side of Eighth Avenue.Entering the Farley Building, the walls leading down to the concourse are covered with easy-to-understand signage and bold graphics. The overall effect is \u201cairport terminal,\u201d or at least that is how it looked to       Nikia Blair,        a student at the nearby TCI College of Technology. \u201cIt looks clean!\u201d said Ms. Blair, who enthusiastically asked a reporter if all of Penn Station would soon look as fresh as the new concourse. Answer: No.Ms. Blair frowned. \u201cWell, too bad they aren\u2019t going to do everything,\u201d she said.Inside the concourse there is a surplus of monitors that display track announcements and, critically, news of delays. The waiting area is equipped with charging stations.Those delays and disruptions will worsen\u00a0this summer\u00a0as Amtrak overhauls its aging infrastructure. On the upside, riders waiting in the concourse are treated to generous air-conditioning and several excessively large digital-media screens flashing postcard-worthy images of Central Park and other area landmarks. The ceiling, too, offers some psychological escape, with its imagery of clouds.Steve Queroli,        who works in commodities, said he rides NJ Transit weekdays from the Jersey Shore. He was impressed with the look of the concourse. \u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that my train is a half-hour late every day coming in and going,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Queroli conceded that given a choice of places to endure delays, he will take the new concourse over the old Penn Station. \u201cIt looks nice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt smells new.\u201dWrite to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 18:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-penn-station-project-wows-commuters-1497565734", "news_title": "New York Penn Station Project Wows Commuters ", "keywords": "new york penn station,new york transpoortation,nyc train station"}, {"content": "British Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       election debacle has brought a surge of optimism to London\u2019s financial district and elsewhere. It is based on the hope that the outcome will derail her plans for a radical break from the European Union.There are real reasons to believe that Mrs. May will have to change tack and jettison her pre-election plans to leave the EU\u2019s single market\u2014its zone of common regulation\u2014 and its customs union.But there are no guarantees. Her minority Conservative government is precarious and dependent on the support not only of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, but also of a minority of members of Parliament from her own party for whom a complete break from the EU is an overwhelming priority. Brexit could still go either way.There are several important obstacles to Mrs. May\u2019s pre-election vision.Inside her own government, some of her cabinet members are worried about the disruption Brexit would wreak on the economy and want to retain the closest ties possible with the EU.Mrs. May was previously criticized for running her government with very little input from economists or business. Now, expectations have risen that the Treasury and its chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer       Philip Hammond,        will influence the government\u2019s approach by making a more vocal case for hugging the EU tight.As for the 10 MPs from the mainly Protestant Northern Irish DUP, they will likely agree to support Mrs. May on essential votes and keep her in power. But there will be a price.The DUP backs the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, but it wants a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border with the Irish Republic and no \u201cspecial deal\u201d for Northern Ireland that would increase its separation from the U.K. Without such a special deal for the province, Northern Ireland couldn\u2019t join the Republic inside the EU\u2019s single market, an outcome some observers have mooted and the DUP wholly rejects.For Britain as a whole, one way to minimize friction on trade would be to enter an agreement to form a customs union with the EU. That would preserve tariff-free trade and the EU\u2019s common external tariff.This, however,\u00a0has a big drawback in the eyes of some of Mrs. May\u2019s lawmakers: It severely limits the U.K.\u2019s ability to sign its own preferential trade deals with other countries, leaving the international trade department of pro-Brexit minister       Liam Fox       without a brief.Mrs. May\u2019s majority in the House of Commons is razor thin even with DUP support, and the Commons is overwhelmingly anti-Brexit. A Wall Street Journal examination of past declarations shows well over 400 of the 650 lawmakers there to be against Brexit. Most of them want a closer relationship with the EU than that laid out by Mrs. May.Mrs. May\u2019s leadership is tenuous. Her party could unseat her or her government could fall. \u201cYou can get by with a weak government if it doesn\u2019t have to do anything. But with Brexit, this government has a lot to do,\u201d said       Gus O\u2019Donnell,        formerly Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant and now chairman of the Frontier Economics consulting firm.\u2018You can get by with a weak government if it doesn\u2019t have to do anything. But with Brexit, this government has a lot to do.\u2019There will be incentives for Conservatives not to break ranks: Most won\u2019t want to bring about the government\u2019s fall, given that another election soon could bring a Labour government to power.But not every loss for the government in the Commons would bring it down and any hard-line government position could be outvoted by a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d majority.The unelected House of Lords has limited powers to rebuff the will of the elected chamber. But its members are overwhelmingly anti-Brexit and can return legislation to the Commons for reconsideration. Mrs. May\u2019s feeble mandate increases the likelihood of this happening with some important Brexit legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that the Lords have a lot more power when the government has a small majority,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who sits in the Lords.But while Mrs. May\u2019s ability to railroad any pure version of Brexit through Parliament is thus severely constrained, there are countervailing forces, not least the fiercely anti-EU wing of her own party, which will try to keep her true to its members\u2019 vision.They argue that, in one respect at least, the election delivered an unambiguous verdict.\u00a0Both Conservatives and Labour laid out in their manifestos that Britain should leave the single market. That is accepted by both as the price for imposing controls on migration from other parts of the EU.With the two major parties winning more than 82% of the vote, the highest proportion since the 1970 election, they say this is a mandate to leave the single market.For an optimistic financial-services industry, this interpretation of the vote isn\u2019t good news. It is the single market that gives the sector access to the EU. As things stand, the best realistic hope may be a transitional deal, preserving single-market membership for a period beyond Brexit in 2019 but not leaving it in place permanently.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 18:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theresa-mays-electoral-setback-puts-brexit-in-limbo-1497565553", "news_title": "Theresa May\u2019s Electoral Setback Puts Brexit in Limbo ", "keywords": "brexit, city of london, u.k.-eu relations, u.k. financial industry,European Union,Theresa May,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "The Justice Department is conducting a civil and criminal investigation into       Booz Allen       Hamilton\u2019s cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the U.S. government, the consulting firm said Thursday in a securities filing.Shares of the company dropped 12% to $34.67 in after-hours trading, more than erasing the stock\u2019s gains so far this year.The McLean, Va., firm is among a group of contractors that provides analysts and systems support to the National Security Agency, the Pentagon and other U.S. intelligence bodies.

Andrew Cuomo       introduced legislation Thursday that would widen the statute of limitations for child sex-abuse cases, a move that increases pressure on legislators to come to an agreement on the issue.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s bill mirrors legislation passed in the state Assembly earlier this month with bipartisan support.The Assembly bill, like Mr. Cuomo\u2019s, would lengthen the window for civil lawsuits over allegations of past sex abuse. The window would end when the victim reaches 50 years old, instead of the current age of 23. For criminal prosecutions, the victim could be up to 28 years of age, instead of the current limit of 23 years.Both measures would provide a one-year window after implementation for victims of any age to sue, or for prosecutors to move cases, over past abuse allegations.\u201cThis is about justice, and I urge this measure to be passed before the end of session and allow these victims the ability to hold their abusers accountable\u2014something they\u2019ve wrongly been denied for far too long,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement.The Assembly and advocates against child sex abuse cheered the move Thursday.With just three days left in the legislative session, the move puts the ball firmly in the Senate\u2019s court.

It was made at a meeting\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0to discuss problems with the ride-hailing company\u2019s culture, including allegations of sexual harassment. In a statement later\u00a0Tuesday, Mr.\u00a0Bonderman\u00a0called his words \u201ccareless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.\u201dThe gaffe briefly shifted the intense spotlight on Uber toward the\u00a0press-shy\u00a074-year-old, who serves as chairman of one of the largest managers of private equity and other so-called alternative investments. People who have worked with Mr. Bonderman say he has a penchant for irreverent, sometimes brusque remarks\u2014though usually in better taste.The comment in question came in the opening minutes of an\u00a0all-hands\u00a0meeting about\u00a0a lack of diversity in the company\u2019s workforce and its response to charges of sexism. He interrupted fellow director       Arianna Huffington       after she\u00a0noted\u00a0the company\u2019s recent appointment of a second female board member,       Wan Ling Martello.As Ms. Huffington said data show that \u201cwhen there\u2019s one woman on the board, it\u2019s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,\u201d Mr. Bonderman interjected, saying, \u201cactually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201dMr. Bonderman\u00a0discussed his\u00a0remarks and apologized to TPG employees on a companywide call\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0and invited them to speak with him personally to voice any concerns, people familiar with the matter said. He responded directly to some of the firm\u2019s investors who inquired about the episode, they added.Mr. Bonderman rarely gives interviews, but public remarks over the years illustrate his outspoken style. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Mr. Bonderman supported       John Kerry       and\u00a0told The Wall Street Journal\u00a0that\u00a0President       George W. Bush       was \u201cturning out to be the worst president since       Millard Fillmore      \u2014and that\u2019s probably an insult to Millard Fillmore.\u201dThe occasional setback aside, Mr. Bonderman\u2019s remarkable career puts him in a small group of the most successful Wall Street financiers of his generation.He founded TPG in 1992 at age 50 after following an unusual path for a Wall Street mogul. The Los Angeles native attended the University of Washington and Harvard Law School, then taught at the Tulane University Law School and worked in the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department.During a stint at corporate-law firm Arnold & Porter LLP, Mr. Bonderman worked on a number of historic-preservation cases. He teamed up with Texas billionaire       Robert Bass       on an effort to stop the widening of a Fort Worth freeway that threatened a park and historic properties. Later, he went to work for the private investing firm of Mr. Bass, an oil heir known for audacious corporate takeovers and real-estate deals. There he met       Jim Coulter,        with whom he would co-found\u00a0TPG in 1992.TPG gained attention shortly thereafter with an investment in then-bankrupt Continental Airlines Inc. The firm and its co-investors made 10 times their money on the investment after selling their stake in the late 1990s, according to a Wall Street Journal report.After a number of other successful deals\u2014TPG\u2019s holdings range from guitar maker Fender Musical Instruments Corp. to talent agency Creative Artists Agency LLC\u2014the firm hit a rough patch during the financial crisis. It put $1.35 billion into Seattle thrift             Washington Mutual\u00a0Inc.      \u00a0in April 2008, only to see its investment wiped out when regulators seized the bank the following September. Other investments of that era, such as in the power company now known as Energy Future Holdings Corp., casino operator             Caesars Entertainment Corp.       and telecommunications-gear supplier Avaya Corp. soured, with the companies all filing for bankruptcy.TPG\u2019s $15 billion buyout fund raised in 2006 has returned 5.3% annually after fees through September, according to Oregon Public Employees Retirement System data, while a 2008 fund returned 11.6%. Private-equity firms have historically sought returns of roughly 20% annually.The firm has nevertheless increased its assets under management to $72 billion. Meanwhile, the stature and influence of Mr. Bonderman and contemporaries like             Blackstone Group                   LP\u2019s       Stephen Schwarzman       and             Apollo Global Management                   LLC\u2019s       Leon Black       have ballooned as the private-equity business has risen from a small corner of the financial markets to encompass a $2.49 trillion mountain of assets. The rewards of their efforts occasionally spill into public view, as when Mr. Bonderman feted his 70th birthday at the Wynn resort in Las Vegas, a party that featured a musical performance by       Paul McCartney.       In recent years, the TPG co-founder was named chairman and stepped back from day-to-day operations at the firm.Part of TPG\u2019s success can be traced to its moves into distressed debt and venture investing, the latter exemplified by savvy and well-timed stakes in apartment-sharing service Airbnb Inc., music-streaming site Spotify AB\u2014and Uber. A 2011 fund raised to pursue such investments has returned 31.9% annually, according to the Oregon pension system.Write to Matt Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 18:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-gaffe-is-latest-drama-in-storied-career-of-billionaire-bonderman-1497519004", "news_title": "Uber Gaffe Is Latest Drama in Storied Career of Billionaire Bonderman ", "keywords": "pe industry news,people,Uber Technologies,Airbnb,Apollo Global Management,APO,Arnold & Porter,Avaya,Blackstone Group,BX,Continental Airlines,Creative Artists Agency,Fender Musical Instruments,Caesars Entertainment,CZR,Spotify,Energy Future Holdings,WMIH,California Public Employees' Retirement System,Apollo Global Management Cl A,David Bonderman,Robert Bass,Wan Ling Martello,George W.

Still, the company reported a first-quarter loss of $163 million, compared with $125 million a year ago.The weak baby business, combined with clearing of leftover holiday toy inventory, pushed Toys \u201cR\u201d Us sales down 4.1% at existing stores for the three months ended April 29. The decline was sharper in its domestic business, where same-store sales fell 6.2%. About 650 of the company\u2019s 1,700 stores include its Babies \u201cR\u201d Us concept.Baby-product sales carry greater weight in the first quarter, where they make up nearly half of domestic sales, compared with about a third for all of last fiscal year. Overall baby product sales have been bolstered by an improving birthrate but that has encouraged more retailers to vie for that business, from             Target Corp.       and             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       to online giant             Amazon.com Inc.Retailers have been going after those parents online, where Toys \u201cR\u201d Us admits it is behind. It is only now updating it dated technology platform so that it can accommodate must-have offers such as subscription systems. It also plans to improve its baby registry and loyalty program.Mr. Brandon said the business was further challenged as shoppers traded down to lower priced diapers, strollers and furniture.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us reported some surprises in its toy business too, as a cooler spring hurt sales in of bikes and pool toys. Some large brands, such as Lego and Star Wars, continue to struggle, while the collectible Shopkins toys, which Toys \u201cR\u201d Us helped launch, is now on the downswing. \u201cTheir business has just gone down the tubes,\u201d Mr. Brandon said.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-has-a-baby-problem-1497563397", "news_title": "Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Has a Baby Problem   ", "keywords": "baby-related marketing,baby-related sales,earnings,earnings season,e-commerce,infant-related sales,pricing,profit,results,same-store sales,toys 'r' us,Toys \\"}, {"content": "Teen apparel seller Papaya Clothing filed for bankruptcy protection Thursday, the latest mall-based chain to fall victim to changing consumer shopping habits roiling the retail industry.Papaya, a privately held California-based chain with 80 stores and some 1,300 employees, said its financial woes are the result of an industrywide shift in consumer preferences to online shopping coupled with an ill-timed expansion in recent years.Papaya, whose corporate name is Cornerstone Apparel, Inc., brought in revenue of $134 million last year. And unlike many of its competitors that have filed for bankruptcy protection\u2014among them Rue21, Wet Seal and American Apparel\u2014Papaya has no secured debt.The company said in papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles that it will keep its doors open during its chapter 11 case. It intends to use the bankruptcy to identify the core retail stores it can reorganize around and to wring \u201cmeaningful rent concessions\u201d from its landlords.Cornerstone President and Chief Financial Officer Tae Yi said in a declaration filed with the court that the retailer had already begun closing some less profitable stores. On its website, Papaya says it has more than 100 locations in over a dozen states.Opening its first outlet in 1999, Papaya added about 50 new stores in the last six years. The expansion took \u201ca heavy financial toll\u201d and significantly increased operating expenses, court papers say.\u201cThe high cost of expansion combined with decreasing store sales as a result of a general industrywide shift in consumer shopping preferences from in-store to online shopping, and the resulting increased competition, has left Cornerstone with insufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations,\u201d the declaration said.Aside from its stores and online business, Papaya has a 75,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution space in Commerce, Calif. The company is able to design a new piece of clothing and get it to Papaya stores within two weeks, according to court documents.Papaya has asked permission from the bankruptcy court to continue honoring gift cards and coupons, pay utilities and maintain its cash management system, common requests when a company begins chapter 11.Papaya is scheduled to make its debut in bankruptcy court Tuesday.The law firm of Levene, Neale, Bender, Yoo & Brill LLP is handling the chapter 11 case.

A flatter yield curve isn\u2019t.That was the dilemma faced by banks as the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates Wednesday. The Fed is now targeting short-term rates of between 1% and 1.25%.Yet longer-dated rates have fallen of late; the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hit 2.11% at one point Wednesday. On Thursday it was at 2.16%.The result is compression between short- and long-term rates. The spread between yields on 10- and two-year government debt has fallen in recent days to 0.81 percentage points. That is not far off levels experienced last summer, which were the lowest in five years. At its peak in this period, in late 2013, the spread was 2.61 percentage points.A flatter yield curve threatens to pinch bank profits, even as the Fed\u2019s move to end nearly a decade of near-zero rates promises to help bolster them.Bank of America,        BAC 0.67%       the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, illustrates the challenge. The bank is seen as the big bank that will benefit most from higher rates. Investors often buy and sell the lender\u2019s stock on rate expectations.The Fed\u2019s increases, which began in December 2015, have helped lift the bank\u2019s profits broadly. Notably, it has helped to relieve pressure on the bank\u2019s net-interest margin, a measure of the profit the bank generates from borrowing money and then lending it out.While the bank has been able to charge more for some loans, it has been able to hold steady the rates it pays for deposits. That bolsters its net-interest margin.Last year, Bank of America paid an average of 0.08% for its interest-bearing deposits in the U.S. That rate has barely budged since then. Despite this, Bank of America kept raking in customers\u2019 money; such deposits increased $33 billion versus 2015.\u201cWe are doing better than our models would have said\u201d on how quickly the bank would have to increase deposit rates, Bank of America CEO       Brian Moynihan       said in late May.In the first quarter, higher rates helped lift net interest income by more than $700 million.Over time, though, the bank and others are likely to have to increase the amount it pays to depositors. That will lessen some of the benefit from rising short-term rates.The bigger problem: The recent reversal in long-term rates means Bank of America, like other banks, earns less on its massive investment portfolio. When those rates fall, banks reinvest maturing securities at lower rates.So, in late May, Bank of America cut its expectations for growth in net interest income for the second quarter, saying lower rates would reduce a previous forecast of about $150 million by at least $30 million.Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-americas-profits-caught-between-the-fed-and-10-year-treasury-1497538716", "news_title": "Bank of America\u2019s Profits Caught Between the Fed and 10-Year Treasury   ", "keywords": "federal reserve,fed policy,fed rate increases,fed rate schedule,flat yioield curve,treasury yields,yield curve,Federal Reserve,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "While the Federal Reserve shakes off softening inflation data and sticks to its rate-raising plan, bond and commodity traders are increasingly anxious that a potential policy error by the central bank will become a problem for economic growth.The yield premium investors demand to hold the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note relative to the two-year note shrank on Wednesday to the smallest since September and approached the lowest since 2007. A falling premium is known as a flattening yield curve and typically happens when worries rise that economic momentum is slowing.Inflation expectations, meanwhile, are sliding. One gauge, the 10-year break-even rate, which measures the yield premium on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, fell Thursday to the lowest since October. The Bloomberg Commodity Index slipped Wednesday to its weakest since April 2016.Unease that the Fed will move too quickly signals deteriorating sentiment in the market after a period when stock prices soared to historic highs and valuations became stretched. The worries also mark a shift from earlier this year, when economic indicators prompted some to say the U.S. central bank was falling behind the curve in tightening policy.The Fed concluded its two-day meeting Wednesday with a rate increase that was widely expected. What surprised many investors was that Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       didn\u2019t blink after an inflation report, released right before the Fed\u2019s decision, that was weaker for the fourth month in a row.Instead, Ms. Yellen said the data, which showed inflation drifting below the central bank\u2019s 2% target again, can be noisy. The Fed chief said she believes that a robust labor market, evidenced by an unemployment rate that hit a 16-year low last month, is likely to push up inflation.But some money managers aren\u2019t buying it.\u201cThe bond market is sending the world a warning that the Fed rate hike is unnecessary with inflation falling,\u201d said       Jonathan Lewis,        chief investment officer at             Fiera Capital Inc.       \u201cWe are in a very dangerous stage of a market and growth cycle. Any misstep from the Fed would backfire.\u201dFalling inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling, which would heighten the Fed\u2019s challenge. Not only would it make meeting the Fed\u2019s 2% target harder, but consumers and businesses that think inflation will fall may delay spending plans, which could in turn throttle economic growth.The \u201ctightening into a slowdown\u201d narrative is \u201ca bad cocktail for risk,\u201d according to       Charlie McElligott,        managing director and head of U.S. cross-asset strategy at RBC Capital Markets.He said that is partly why U.S. stocks slipped after the Fed\u2019s rate decision, although the slide has been modest so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.07% Thursday, while the S&P 500 index was down 0.2%. Both remain near records.Compounding investor anxiety is that other major central banks became more hawkish this week, indicating a possible shift away from a period of highly accommodative monetary policy.Two Bank of Canada officials said this week that the nation\u2019s recovery is picking up, sending the country\u2019s two-year bond yield higher. The U.K.\u2019s two-year government debt yield rose Thursday after three Bank of England officials called for a rate increase.Predicting the inflation outlook appears to be a challenge for investors. In late 2016, a reflation trade\u2014betting on stronger growth and higher inflation\u2014dominated global markets as optimism rose over wide-ranging U.S. fiscal stimulus.But that narrative has faded this year, as President       Donald Trump,        mired in political issues, hasn\u2019t gained traction in pushing his fiscal agenda.Ms. Yellen said Wednesday that a stronger labor market will create the conditions for inflation to speed up.But some economists and analysts say the structure of the labor market has changed, which means that a low unemployment rate is no longer a reliable indicator for how tight the labor market is.David Rosenberg,        chief economist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc., said that Ms. Yellen \"seems to be operating under the old paradigm,\u2019\u2019 and that she is getting it wrong on inflation.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Fear Policy Misstep by the Fed.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-fear-policy-misstep-by-the-fed-1497562345", "news_title": "Investors Fear Policy Misstep by the Fed ", "keywords": "bond market ,economic indicators,federal reserve ,federal reserve chairman,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,Charlie McElligott,Jonathan Lewis,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "\u2018Cardinal\u201d belongs to that increasingly crowded mystery genre in which physical background is in the forefront of all that gives a film its life\u2014the unnamed extra character that steals every scene, as this one does with its wintry landscapes, its lonely town of bleak houses with cellars that hold who knows what, and its icy silence. In this saga of a law-enforcement officer proved right where all around him were wrong, Detective John Cardinal (Billy Campbell) stalks the streets of that town looking for a killer he knows is there. Demoted and forced off the Algonquin Bay Police Homicide Unit for refusing to yield in his insistence that a missing 13-year-old had been abducted\u2014contrary to the official findings of his superiors, who declared her a runaway\u2014he\u2019s been brought back.CardinalFriday, HuluThe girl\u2019s body having been found frozen in a mineshaft, the police chief decides that Cardinal is just the kind of driven cop who can solve the case. Which doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s become a favorite at Homicide. For all the camaraderie there\u2019s a distinct touch of suspicion there in the attitude toward Cardinal, a self-contained sort with a sense of irony and a distinct lack of interest in making himself popular\u2014a role Mr. Campbell carries off with panache.Cardinal is refreshingly free of at least some of the clich\u00e9s now characteristic of film detectives\u2014he\u2019s not emotionally stunted, not a drinker or a depressive or an isolated soul who once had a marriage for three days.To the contrary, he\u2019s an ideal father and devoted husband to a wife suffering from severe mental illness\u2014a quintessential straight arrow. All of which make him something of a novelty as brilliantly intuitive detectives go these days.Even so, we find him at the beginning of this tale under a cloud of suspicion. He\u2019s not only watched, closely and uneasily, by his police chief superior, he\u2019s joined by a new, young partner, Detective       Lise Delorme       (      Karine Vanasse      ), who\u2019s there to do more than assist him. She\u2019s there\u2014assigned by forces in the department who suspect Cardinal of corrupt involvement with a drug kingpin and much worse\u2014to gather evidence against him.

It\u2019s a location familiar from countless films about serial killers obsessed with body parts: a subject that has itself been, for years, an obsession irresistible to television writers and other creative minds in the entertainment industry. The sadist here has a girlfriend who helps lure his victims and provides the basement\u2014he\u2019s a mentor to her in the joys of inflicting pain and reaching the most daring of goals in torture.The pretext for the ensuing horrors is a psychological side-trip of sorts to the subject of such couples\u2014to their very special teacher-mentor connection on display in scenes packed with socio-babble about personal growth.

Even as some tried to reform the system, the number of people receiving such sensitive data quietly expanded, public documents show.Thursday\u2019s move came on the heels of reports by The Wall Street Journal that showed that some investors could be trading with knowledge of U.K. economic statistics before they are published.The British pound and government-bond futures moved in a way that was consistent with traders being informed of the strength or weakness of economic statistics before their publication, according to analysis for the Journal.Statisticians complain that Britain\u2019s practice of allowing the government early access to market-moving data increases the chances of leaks that could be traded upon for financial gain. More than 100 people, from Prime Minister       Theresa May       to dozens of policy advisers and press officers, can get to see some of the figures a day before they come out. In the U.S., the president and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers receive sensitive data such as gross domestic product a day in advance. In several European countries, there is no prerelease access at all.Thursday\u2019s change will \u201cincrease public confidence in official statistics. It will also lower the risk of market-sensitive information being leaked or abused,\u201d said       Hetan Shah,        executive director of the U.K. Royal Statistical Society.\u201cThe government attaches the utmost importance to the integrity of official statistics, including those produced by the Office for National Statistics,\u201d a government spokesman said.The new rule will cover both economic statistics and politically sensitive data, such as migration and crime.A limited number of officials at the Bank of England would still be granted prerelease access when an economic data release coincides with a BOE interest-rate decision, said       Miles Fletcher,        head of media and public relations at the Office for National Statistics, which produces the data.John Pullinger,        the head of the U.K. Statistics Authority, said in a letter explaining Thursday\u2019s decision to the body\u2019s chairman that a round of recent changes to prerelease access aimed at addressing risks hadn\u2019t been adequate.Mr. Pullinger also cited a letter sent to the Times of London signed by 114 academics and other experts expressing their concerns on the policy that had followed the Journal\u2019s coverage.Analysis for the Journal showed that U.K. markets often anticipate that economic data is going to be better or worse than analysts expect ahead of its release.In 59.5% of 172 U.K. economic data releases between April 2011 and December 2016, British government-bond futures correctly anticipated the rise or fall that ultimately happened when economic data were published, according to an analysis prepared for the Journal by       Alexander Kurov,        associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. The analysis for the Journal also showed that the British pound often moves sharply in the hour before data are released.But in Sweden, where there is no pre-access, the krona shows no signs of moving ahead of official numbers, an analysis of trading data between January 2011 and March 2017 suggests.Mr. Fletcher said that there was no direct evidence of leaks.Statisticians and some lawmakers say they had repeatedly tried to curtail the policy of early access, fearing its abuse.Several former senior officials at the Statistics Authority, Bank of England and ONS, warned the government both privately and publicly about the risks of early access.In 2011, the then chairman of the Statistics Authority       Michael Scholar       sent a letter to Treasury Chief       George Osborne       warning him that there was a danger that market-sensitive statistics could be leaked and used for financial gain.\u201cThere is a risk of market manipulation if key economic data fall in to the wrong hands before publication,\u201d Mr. Scholar said in the letter, which is available on the Statistics Authority\u2019s website.Mr. Scholar said that the government, though aware of the risk that data could be used for private gain, didn\u2019t change its policy.Mr. Osborne, who is no longer a lawmaker, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Karen Dunnell,        who chaired the ONS from 2005 to 2009. said that the U.K.\u2019s main political parties didn\u2019t want to change the system. \u201cThe torture that we went through\u201d during efforts to reform the prerelease system, she said.Lawmakers and their aides have said the pre access policy is useful because it gives them time to prepare a response for the press to the data.In 2008, the number of recipients of major economic data releases was cut after a concerted by senior statisticians and lawmakers, including Jack Straw the then Labour Party government\u2019s then Justice Secretary.But the numbers soon rose again.For instance, at the end of 2011, 77 people received U.K. labor market data 24 hours before its release. By the end of 2016, that number had risen to 122.\u201cThe whole thing has been allowed to mushroom again back to where it was,\u201d Ms. Dunnell added, speaking before Thursday\u2019s decision.In 2016, former deputy Bank of England Governor       Charlie Bean       published an official review of official data which criticized repeated mishandling of it during the prerelease period.\u201cMany economic statistics are highly market-sensitive and advance knowledge of them can be exploited for private gain,\u201d the review said.Following the Journal\u2019s reports, several senior U.K. lawmakers called on Britain\u2019s financial regulator to investigate whether economic data is being leaked and traded upon for financial gain.A Financial Conduct Authority spokesman said it would need to wait for a new Treasury Select Committee\u2014the group of lawmakers that oversees the financial regulator\u2014to be appointed before responding.Regulators say that widespread leaking can undermine confidence in public markets because it gives investors with early information an unfair trading advantage.It also hits the credibility of the system through which the data is released.Last year, the European Commission asked residents of 35 European countries how much they trusted their country\u2019s economic statistics. Swedes expressed the highest level of confidence, with 73% saying they tended to trust the data. The U.K. came 23rd, with 44% of respondents saying they tended to trust the figures.Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. to No Longer Offer Sneak Peeks at Statistics.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-statistics-body-to-end-government-prerelease-access-1497535987", "news_title": "U.K. Government\u2019s Controversial Early Peeks at Economic Stats to End ", "keywords": " economic data, economy, uk,uk data,Karen Dunnell,Michael Scholar,Alexander Kurov,Hetan Shah,John Pullinger,Miles Fletcher,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Conservatives inside and outside the Senate GOP are sounding alarms over the emerging shape of the chamber\u2019s bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, a sign that the faction\u2019s support may be increasingly difficult to secure.Pressure from outside groups has intensified in recent days, and conservative lawmakers have signaled their concern that the Senate bill doesn\u2019t do enough to curb spending on the Medicaid federal-state program for the poor or to reduce health-care premiums\u2014two of their top goals.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a leading Senate conservative, said Thursday.Negotiations over the bill\u2019s contours remain fluid as Republican senators wrangle over its central tenets. No Republicans have taken a fixed position for or against the bill, in part because its language hasn\u2019t yet been finalized. But President       Donald Trump\u2019s       recent private disparagement of the bill passed by the House last month as too stingy suggests the Senate legislation is likely to only tilt more toward the chamber\u2019s centrists.That\u2019s making it a harder sell for conservative senators including       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), whose party holds a 52-48 majority in the Senate, can afford to lose no more than two votes. No lawmakers in the Democratic caucus support an ACA repeal.\u201cI have some grave concerns about what we\u2019re doing so far, concerns that if we don\u2019t get in the right direction, if we don\u2019t pull back this massive regulatory burden\u2026I\u2019m going to be very worried about what it will do to our economy,\u201d Mr. Lee said Sunday on ABC.Getting the conservatives on board with the bill was \u201calways going to be difficult,\u201d Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) said Thursday.Outside conservative groups, fearing that Senate GOP leaders are watering down the House bill\u2019s Medicaid savings and rollback of ACA regulations, have meanwhile begun speaking out more forcefully in recent days. \u201cEverything we\u2019re hearing right now is frustrating and concerning to us,\u201d said Jason Pye, director of public policy at FreedomWorks, a grass-roots-oriented conservative group.Senate GOP leaders have said they hope to vote on a health overhaul by Congress\u2019 July 4 recess. That prospect seems increasingly remote, though party leaders haven\u2019t ruled it out.The Senate bill retains many elements of the House legislation, rolling back much of the ACA, the 2010 health-care law often called Obamacare. Both bills would enact new tax credits to help people buy insurance and would curtail the open-ended federal funding for new enrollees of Medicaid.But GOP senators have made clear their bill will pursue a slower phase-out of federal funding to the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. To pay for some of their changes, including expenses such as beefed-up tax credits, Senate Republicans may keep or delay the repeal of some ACA taxes that would be more quickly eliminated under the House version.GOP senators are also expected to preserve more of the ACA\u2019s insurance regulations that conservatives want to loosen because they say that would lower costs for many consumers. For instance, the Senate bill will likely require insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions without charging them higher premiums.Mr. Trump recently appeared to back the Senate bill\u2019s shift toward the GOP centrists, some of whom are up for re-election next year.In a closed-door meeting at the White House with senators this week, Mr. Trump called the House bill \u201cmean\u201d and said the Senate bill should be more generous, GOP aides said.The White House has refused to comment on the president\u2019s private remark, but his public comments that day also suggested he was leaning toward the centrists\u2019 views. \u201cWe\u2019ll come out with a bill that\u2019s going to be a phenomenal bill for the people of our country\u2014generous, kind, with heart,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd that may be adding additional money into it.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear if conservative senators can redirect the course of a bill that now appears to be drifting to the left.\u201cIt is an open question right now,\u201d said Dan Holler of Heritage Action, a group that pushed conservatives to hold a hard line in the House. \u201cA lot of this depends on which element of the Republican Party is going to stand up for what they believe and what they promised constituents.\u201dThe problem for GOP leaders is that switching tactics to pull the bill toward conservatives could cost them the support of centrists and other Republicans wary of deep cuts to Medicaid, including Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio.\u201cI\u2019ve seen heavy lifts before, but getting Ted Cruz and Susan Collins on a health bill sounds like one heck of a challenge to me,\u201d said Sen.       Ron Wyden       (D., Ore.).He added that in his view, none of the Senate\u2019s proposed changes fundamentally alter the House bill. \u201cHundreds of billions in cuts to Medicaid and hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the fortunate few\u2026I don\u2019t see that changing,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.The House bill would cut $834 billion in 10 years from Medicaid, and leave 23 million more people uninsured compared to current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would also repeal many of the ACA\u2019s taxes.Another challenge is that if the Senate approves a bill that satisfies many of the centrists\u2019 concerns, it could be that much harder to reconcile with the House version.Still, some GOP strategists remained optimistic that Republicans will be able to coalesce behind a bill. \u201cWhile there have been different points of view on how the bill should be structured, people are trying to come together,\u201d said Avik Roy, a health policy expert who advised Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) during his presidential campaign.White House principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that the president was \u201copen to things that make the bill better,\u201d but she didn\u2019t name specific changes that could make it more palatable for conservatives.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com, Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Senate Health Bill Alarms Conservatives.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservatives-sound-alarm-about-senate-health-bill-1497561439", "news_title": "Conservatives Sound Alarm About Senate Health Bill ", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,conservatives,donald trump,health law,medicaid,obamacare,senate,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014Air-safety regulation is changing dramatically on both sides of the Atlantic, increasingly shifting from mandatory rules to voluntary standards dependent on enhanced government and industry collaboration that already has seen accident rates fall world-wide.Capping years of gradual movement toward such cooperation, the more flexible, industry-friendly approach was spelled out this week by speakers at an international aviation conference in the Belgian capital. Senior European and U.S. regulators emphasized that formal, prescriptive rules\u2014once the bedrock of aviation oversight\u2014are now often their last resort in confronting difficult safety issues.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration previously announced its revised enforcement principles, which rely heavily on data analyses buttressed by joint efforts with industry to anticipate and resolve hazards. But for the European Aviation Safety Agency, which has spent much of the past few years recruiting staff and reorganizing, the conference provided a prominent public platform to unveil its new philosophy.\u201cWe are not going to rely so much in Europe on rules,\u201d       Patrick Ky,        EASA executive director, told the gathering\u00a0Wednesday. Instead, he said the agency is looking to benefit from safety promotion, industry consensus on technical standards and other alternate ways to ensure safety.On Thursday,       Jean-Marc Cluzeau,        head of strategy for the agency, gave a presentation on some of those new plans, saying EASA is determined to \u201cconsider systematically alternatives to rule-making.\u201dWith the proliferation of unmanned aircraft, EASA is examining ways to oversee startups, some of which have little aviation experience. Mr. Cluzeau said that requires a new strategy. \u201cThe best way to kill a new business model is to start regulating it,\u201d he said.At another point, Mr. Cluzeau asserted: \u201cMaybe the best way to improve regulation is not to consider regulation.\u201dAirlines, plane manufacturers, equipment suppliers and other industry segments have applauded the less-confrontational approach of regulators in recent years. And aviation authorities have taken some of the credit for adopting new oversight and enforcement strategies that have produced an era of record low airline accident rates world-wide. But safety experts fret that growing traffic and long-term complacency could result in an uptick in crashes.Many industry officials argue prescriptive rules simply aren\u2019t able to mitigate risks because many crucial aviation technologies evolve too rapidly. Both sides, however, point to development of new FAA certification standards for general aviation and business aircraft, which go into effect this summer, as a successful example of more-nimble regulatory activity. By obtaining industry consensus and streamlining the process, the new, updated document whittled an unwieldy regulatory package of some 377 specific technical requirements down to 71 requirements.Under the traditional system, the FAA mandated all small-plane manufacturers demonstrate the safety of seats by passing specific tests that limited how far seats could shift in a simulated crash. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people [would] stay safe in the event of a crash\u201d in the real world, said       Gregory Bowles,        vice president of policy for the General Aviation Manufacturers Association.\u2018Maybe the best way to improve regulation is not to consider regulation\u2019By contrast, the FAA\u2019s new approach permits manufacturers to choose from among a range of engineering options\u2014from various energy-absorbing materials to specialized harnesses to seat belts with built-in air bags\u2014that \u201cmay be more effective\u201d in protecting occupants and require less engineering work, according to Mr. BowlesIn the U.S. and Europe, it takes about four years on average from the time agency experts begin work on a specific regulation to its final adoption. In many cases, speakers at the conference agreed, that\u2019s way too long to deal with fast-changing technologies.One potential solution is to get regulators more deeply involved from the beginning, when companies start considering new hardware that will need to be certified by the FAA and EASA. \u201cWe have to get information early on\u201d if industry hopes to reduce the rule-making delay, said       Lirio Liu,        director of the FAA\u2019s office of rule-making.Ms. Liu also told the conference that the FAA faces separate challenges to comply with governmentwide White House directives that for every new regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. She said the net impact of the rule changes is intended to avoid imposing additional costs on industry. \u201cThat will be a challenge for us in the future,\u201d Ms. Liu said.Those restrictions are one more reason the FAA, like EASA, wants to use alternative approaches to formal rules. Ms. Liu said the agency\u2019s revised oversight strategy is the \u201cculmination of events that have led us\u201d to rely less on traditional rules specifying technical solutions and more on those giving manufacturers maximum flexibility to reach performance goals.John Duncan,        the FAA\u2019s head of flight standards, said \u201cit\u2019s a big cultural change within our organization,\u201d requiring a gradual phase-in. But Mr. Duncan added that, personally, he doesn\u2019t want \u201cto engage in any further rule-making that\u2019s prescriptive in nature.\u201dWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rules-no-longer-rule-air-safety-1497561239", "news_title": "Rules No Longer Rule Air Safety ", "keywords": "air safety,air safety regulation,aviation industry,easa,european aviation safety agency,faa,faa certification standards , federal aviation administration,flight standards,plane safety,European Aviation Safety Agency,U.S. Federal Aviation Administration,Gregory Bowles,Jean-Marc Cluzeau,John Duncan,Lirio Liu,Patrick Ky,regulation,government policy,standards,standardization,product,consumer safety,corporate,industrial news,airplane accidents,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,airlines,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Merrill Lynch has hired two             Morgan Stanley        MS 3.28%       brokers who oversaw $300 million in assets, a move that comes as the brokerage reworks its recruitment deals.Brokers       Will Sahlman       and       Greg Jones       will join Merrill\u2019s Rockefeller Center office in New York from Morgan Stanley, where they had worked for more than eight years.

The Senate\u2019s Republican leadership has been hammering out the bill behind closed doors, so there has been scant information about the legislation.But its outline so far is said to resemble a more expansive version of the legislation passed last month by the House.The bill preserves the House\u2019s essential goal: replacing the Affordable Care Act with a new system based on tax credits and cuts to Medicaid. But Republican senators are still grappling, according to Hill aides and sources familiar with the negotiations, over a number of central questions.MedicaidThe Senate bill would phase out the enhanced federal funding for new enrollees in the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, but there is disagreement over how long that phasing out should take. Some lawmakers are looking at three years beyond the House deadline of Jan. 1, 2020, and others favor seven years beyond that date.Medicaid funding to states would change from a guaranteed federal matching rate to a per capita cap, which in time would mean less federal funding. Conservatives are pressing for a more restricted growth rate in spending that would mean deeper cuts.A possible compromise may be a longer off-ramp for phasing out Medicaid expansion funding in return for tighter per capita caps.Refundable tax creditsThe plan retains the House GOP\u2019s idea of providing tax credits to people who don\u2019t get insurance on the job. The Senate is looking at enhancing the credits for people who are low-income, older or living in high-cost areas.Cost-sharing subsidies to insurersSenators are considering a measure that would provide $10 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 to offset the cost to insurers of reducing out-of-pocket health costs for low-income consumers on the ACA exchanges. The goal is to stabilize the market until new provisions in the Republican health overhaul take effect. A number of insurers have said they would have to raise premiums or leave the exchanges in 2018 without this funding. It\u2019s still unclear if this measure would meet Senate procedural rules.Market stabilizationSenators are weighing $15 billion in both 2017 and 2018 for state grants to help provide coverage for consumers with high medical costs. This would likely mean restructuring the funding provided in the House bill to help states stabilize their insurance markets.Opioid addiction treatmentThe bill would include additional funding to help states battle the opioid crisis, a demand of some centrist Senate Republicans.TaxesA number of ACA taxes may be retained, depending on how provisions are scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which provides a nonpartisan analysis of the legislation\u2019s costs and coverage. The Senate bill must save $133 billion under a procedural rule in order to pass with a simple majority.The bill could preserve the ACA\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax, a levy on generous employer health plans. That tax has been suspended by Congress, and under the Senate bill it might not take effect until 2026. Retention of this tax is vigorously opposed by employer groups.The bill also could include a sales tax on health insurance and an excise tax on certain medical devices. The taxes are largely needed to pay for additional spending in the Senate bill, such as beefed-up tax credits.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 16:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-may-be-in-the-senates-health-bill-1497560255", "news_title": "What May Be in the Senate\u2019s Health Bill", "keywords": " aca, affordable care act, obamacre,senate heath-care bill,The Senate,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "New YorkThe words that Henry James said on his deathbed sound like the last testament of a religion\u2019s founder. \u201cTell them to follow,\u201d he said, \u201cto be faithful, to take me seriously.\u201d And since he said them in 1916, as Europe was being shattered by a world war, he might have guessed that his life\u2019s work was an epitaph. He had chronicled the manners of the European Old World and the American New as the heirs and heiresses of high cultural traditions intertwined with those of more raw democratic commerce.Henry James and American PaintingMorgan Library & Museum  Through Sept. 10Henry\u2019s brother,       William James,        was a scientist and philosopher of the mind; in a way, so was Henry, who tried to delineate the mercurial nuances and unspoken quiverings of late 19th-century consciousness.The next generation couldn\u2019t really follow. As for taking James seriously\u2014or being serious in his way\u2014that now seems a relic of an era when being an aesthete could be a vocation. But go to the exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum, \u201cHenry James and American Painting\u201d\u2014perhaps after reading \u201cThe Portrait of a Lady\u201d (1881) or \u201cThe Golden Bowl\u201d (1904) because of the links the exhibition will reveal\u2014and you come away with an amplified sense of how James saw the world, the nature of his seriousness.We look at James here almost entirely through images, with more than 50 objects, including paintings, drawings, sculptures and other artworks as well as with manuscripts, letters and books, all borrowed from two-dozen international museums and private collections. We see James in paintings; paintings of places that worked their way into his novels, and images that give us a sense of the mysterious vitality James sought in his prose. From the moment we enter we are faced with the \u201cMaster\u201d in       John Singer Sargent\u2019s       great, piercing 1913 portrait. But have there ever been as many such portraits gathered? (Twelve!) James is not yet 20 in       John La Farge\u2019s       1862 work; bearded and balding almost two decades later in       Abbott Handerson Thayer\u2019s       crayon image; grimly intent as rendered by his brother in 1910. The photographer       Alice Boughton       wrote that \u201cHenry James was, I may truthfully say, the only sitter who ever terrified me\u201d; he was \u201cdignified and impressive, with manners almost courtly.\u201d The exhibition\u2019s 1906 photograph of him inspecting a painting was taken in her studio entranceway.When Sargent\u2019s portrait was unveiled at London\u2019s Royal Academy in 1914, James took great pleasure in sitting next to it, putting the figure and the figurative on display. Less directly, that kind of intimacy characterizes the exhibition. As we are reminded by the curators\u2014the Morgan\u2019s       Declan Kiely       and the novelist       Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn      \u2014James saw the painter and novelist as analogous, declaring their inspiration and their processes to be the same. \u201cThey may learn from each other, they may explain and sustain each other,\u201d he wrote in 1884.One painting, Sargent\u2019s \u201cAn Interior in Venice (The Curtis Family)\u201d (1898), shows us a grand salon in a palazzo in which James and Sargent both stayed (and is alluded to in \u201cThe Wings of the Dove\u201d). \u201cI\u2019ve seen few things,\u201d James wrote of the painting, \u201cthat I craved more to possess.\u201d But mostly the exhibition\u2019s interest is not in places but in the ways painters and their work intersected with James\u2019s life.Henry and William both studied painting with       William Morris Hunt,        though Henry quickly ceded the art to his brother\u2019s talent, turning to criticism instead. James\u2019s friendship grew with his fellow student La Farge, whose \u201cwondrous intelligence,\u201d James said, opened up \u201cprospects and possibilities that made the future flush and swarm.\u201dA wall focuses on three figures whose incarnations haunt \u201cWashington Square\u201d (1880), \u201cThe Portrait of a Lady\u201d and \u201cThe Golden Bowl.\u201d One is the wealthy New England-born father, the composer       Francis Boott,        whom we see here from 1881, towering, aloof and proud in a painting by       Frank Duveneck,        an impoverished Cincinnati-born artist who yearned to marry the Boott heiress, Elizabeth, whom he also taught to paint\u2014quite wonderfully, given the evidence here. Duveneck\u2019s suit was ultimately successful. James, a friend of \u201cLizzie,\u201d visited the trio in the family villa overlooking Florence\u2014a location James imagined as Gilbert Osmond\u2019s residence in \u201cThe Portrait of a Lady.\u201d After his wife\u2019s sudden death in 1888, Duveneck created tomb effigies, one of which we see here; \u201cStrange, strange it seemed,\u201d James wrote, \u201cstill to see her only so\u2014but so she will be seen for ages to come.\u201d (But it is through James\u2019s novels that aspects of her character may be imagined more clearly.)It may also be that the visual led to what may have been one of James\u2019s great loves: for       Hendrik Christian Andersen,        whose bust of a young count\u2014said to resemble its creator\u2014is here; it was always on James\u2019s mantle, \u201cthe first object that greets my eyes in the morning, and the last at night.\u201dJames destroyed manuscripts and letters in bonfires, though a few escaped, some of which we see, including two typed chapters of \u201cWhat Maisie Knew\u201d (1897) and James\u2019s 90-page outline for \u201cThe Ambassadors\u201d (whose sculptor Gloriani is based on       James McNeill Whistler      ).But we are left on our own in imagining the shared vibrations that resonate under these images and James\u2019s allusive prose. Mr. T\u00f3ib\u00edn, in an email, has suggested some connections: James\u2019s novels often hinge on intensely realized images or scenes; also, like a painter, James appreciated the power of the gaze and its sudden recognitions. But there is also something to be felt here, among these paintings, the best of which capture the mystery of character. What we feel is the painter\u2019s attentiveness to what James once called the \u201cappalling complexity\u201d of life, a complexity resisting all theory, all explanation and all utopian fantasy. That complexity can be evoked in extraordinary artworks. It is also what James worked so hard to unveil in the complexity of his prose.Mr. Rothstein is the Journal\u2019s Critic at Large.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 16:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/henry-james-and-american-painting-review-finding-the-writers-gaze-1497559957", "news_title": "\u2018Henry James and American Painting\u2019 Review: Finding the Writer\u2019s Gaze", "keywords": " american painting,arts in review, books, exhibition,henry james, morgan library & museum, portrait, writing,Henry James,art,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "ATHENS\u2014Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to release the next tranche of its \u20ac86 billion ($96.5 billion) bailout, but on Thursday put off a final decision on relieving the country\u2019s crushing debt burden until August of next year.The agreement, reached in Luxembourg among the finance ministers of the eurozone, unlocks \u20ac8.5 billion of the bailout fund. While that brings Greece a small step closer to the end of an eight-year ordeal, the creditors\u2019 refusal to address debt relief leaves the depleted country with bleak prospects for the future and at risk of needing yet another bailout down the road.Greece\u2019s travails remain a black mark in a eurozone that has otherwise found fresh confidence this spring, underscoring the bloc\u2019s failure to root out the problems that threatened the single currency\u2019s integrity five years ago.The government of Prime Minister       Alexis Tsipras       enacted unpopular austerity measures whose effects extend well beyond next year\u2019s end of the current bailout program with the aim of convincing creditors to go beyond releasing the next payment and restructure Greece\u2019s debt.Athens hoped debt relief would clear the way for the European Central Bank to include Greek debt in its massive bond-buying program, thus giving a major boost of confidence to Greek and foreign investors.Instead, the lenders on Thursday named some limited measures for potential debt relief next year, and postponed further discussion until late 2017 at the earliest, after elections in Germany, where concessions to the Greeks are deeply unpopular. That means any further clarification would likely come too late for the ECB to include Greece in its bond-buying program.That delay will make it more challenging for Athens to re-enter capital markets and issue enough debt to meet its financing needs after the current bailout ends, thus likely necessitating another rescue, bankers and economists say.Meanwhile, without large-scale investment from outside, Greece\u2019s depleted economy may struggle to build up much steam. The OECD expects the Greek economy, which has shrunk almost 27% since 2008, to expand only 1.1% this year, compared with 3.7% in Ireland, which bounced back strongly from its own 2010 bailout.To be sure, business executives and bankers agree Greece\u2019s economy has bottomed out and shows signs of healing. Tax collection has improved, the government has begun implementing reforms, such as making it easier to auction repossessed properties, a key measure to help its crippled banks. and international investors have shown some appetite for the country this year.Giannis Nikolarakos, who owns an eyewear store in Athens, saw his revenues drop by more than 50% and had to lay off more than half of his personnel. He believes the country\u2019s economy downward spiral has ended and there is only one way up.At least \u201cwe know what we have to deal with from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can accept that we are alone, roll up our sleeves and get down to work.\u201dThose Greek companies that have survived have emerged leaner and more focused. For instance, Sunlight, an energy company, entered the crisis fully leveraged and with 40% of its revenues earned in Greece. It slashed debt, refocused the business on industrial batteries and now exports 98% of its production.The crisis was painful, CEO       Vasilis Billis       said, but \u201cit helped us tighten the belt and forced us to focus.\u201dThe Greek economy, however, remains critically ill. A quarter of all Greeks live under the poverty line, and 23% are unemployed. More than 400,000 Greeks, many highly qualified, have left the country since the crisis. The number of companies in the country has plunged 27% since 2008. And while the risk of Grexit is low, it haunts the economy. Credit agencies still rank Greek bonds as junk.Greece also faces the prospect of a creditless recovery. Its barely functioning banks are virtually frozen by bad loans that amount to nearly half of their total lending portfolio, and they may need more capital after next year\u2019s European stress tests.Capital controls imposed during the turbulent summer of 2015 to prevent deposits from fleeing overseas are still in place. And even when they are lifted, skeptical Greeks\u2014mindful of the near-catastrophe\u2014 aren\u2019t likely to pull out billions in cash from under their mattresses and entrust their funds again to banks.\u201cIt will take some time for things to start moving again in Greece,\u201d said       Michael Tsamaz,        chief executive of Greek telecoms group OTE, which has seen pricing crash since before the crisis. Investors \u201cneed to feel confident that the country is committed to growth,\u201d he added.Greek shop owner Nasos Sioris had to fire cherished employees and cut his stock by two-thirds to keep his electrical-appliances business open. Even a revival of Greece\u2019s economy wouldn\u2019t induce the 33-year-old to hire new employees, he said. Instead, he still worries he will have to close the business he inherited from his father.\u201cThe few small businesses that managed to survive have the chance to grow, even if there is just a bit of growth,\u201d Mr. Sioris said. \u201cBut if things continue as they are, we will have to shut down.\u201dA major obstacle is that, despite intense pressure from creditors, Greece has done little to address cronyism and bureaucratic obstacles hindering business, while the Tsipras government\u2014composed of hard-left politicians and Marxist aficionados\u2014has dragged its feet in implementing the pro-market reforms creditors have demanded, say company executives and bankers. Greece\u2019s main improvement in competitiveness\u2014a 20% drop in real wages\u2014comes largely from a deep recession.\u201cAlthough the crisis offered an opportunity for introspection, giving rise to efforts to correct past mistakes and achieve improvements in the functioning of institutions and the organization of markets, time has been wasted,\u201d wrote former Economy Minister Yannos Papantoniou for think tank Carnegie Europe.For instance, a property fund signed a \u20ac8-billion deal in 2014 to develop Hellinikon, a site on Athens\u2019s former airport that is triple the size of Monaco and potentially one of Europe\u2019s biggest urban-redevelopment projects. But despite the project offering the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs, it has been impeded from even starting by red tape .It would take major changes to lure back the likes of Stratos Stergiou, one of thousands of Greek businesspeople who moved their companies to Bulgaria and Cyprus at the depths of the crisis.Before the recession, Mr. Stergiou ordered new machinery to expand the company, which makes personal hygiene items. But repeated strikes by dockworkers delayed the machines\u2019 delivery of new machinery by almost a year. The threat of Grexit and tax hikes then sealed his decision in 2010 to leave Greece.Even if Greece recovers now, the 54-year-old says he remains deterred by its sclerotic economy and sky-high taxes deter him from returning and isn\u2019t considering a return to his homeland. Today just 0.4% of the businesses currently in Greece contribute 40% of the total tax revenues in state coffers. Greek businesses say two-thirds of their revenue sometimes goes to taxes and social security contributions.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be just stupid, but suicidal,\u201d he said, to go home under those conditions.Write to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Lenders Give Greece Cash but Not Relief.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 16:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-and-creditors-reach-deal-1497553973", "news_title": "Greece, Creditors Reach Long-Sought Bailout Deal but Postpone Relief Decision ", "keywords": " european union,eurozone, greece bailout, greece creditors, greece debt,Alexis Tsipras,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news"}, {"content": "A woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India is suing Uber Technologies Inc. and three current and former executives, claiming they breached her privacy by obtaining and publicizing her medical records.The plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe of Texas in a legal complaint filed\u00a0Thursday\u00a0in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, sued the ride-hailing company after new information came to light last week about the 2014 incident and its handling by CEO       Travis Kalanick       and two top deputies who recently left the company,       Emil Michael       and       Eric Alexander      .Mr. Alexander, Uber\u2019s former president in Asia, sought and obtained the female passenger\u2019s medical report in 2014 in pursuit of a theory that a competitor pushed the story to damage Uber\u2019s reputation in India, a person familiar with the matter had told The Wall Street Journal. He then shared the document with\u00a0several high-ranking Uber officials, including Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael, this person said.Uber is contending with a corporate shake-up and a string of controversies. The company\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0shared the results of a monthslong internal investigation into its workplace,\u00a0and its board agreed to adopt sweeping new policies to address a corporate culture seen as tolerating sexual harassment and sexism.Uber fired Mr. Alexander last week after reporters inquired about his involvement in obtaining the medical records, this person said. Mr. Michael resigned from the company on Monday, without providing a reason, while Mr. Kalanick said Tuesday he would take an indefinite leave of absence to grieve the recent death of his mother and \u201cto work on myself.\u201dMr. Kalanick, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Michael didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.In a statement, an Uber spokesman said: \u201cNo one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we\u2019re truly sorry that she\u2019s had to relive it over the last few weeks.\u201dThe lawsuit stems from an incident in December 2014, when a woman in New Delhi accused an Uber driver of taking her to a secluded area and raping her. As a result of the allegations, city officials banned Uber and other app-based ride-hailing firms for several months over what it said were inadequate background checks.The driver was convicted in late 2015 and sentenced to life in prison for the rape and related charges. At the time of the allegations, Mr. Kalanick condemned the rape in a statement, calling it \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201cdespicable.\u201dThe woman previously sued Uber for failing to maintain safety standards. Uber settled that case in 2015 for around $3 million, a person familiar with the matter has said.In her latest legal complaint, the woman alleges that Mr. Alexander invaded her privacy by obtaining and distributing her medical records and defamed her by suggesting she conspired with a competitor to falsify the story of her rape.The lawsuit adds to the myriad legal challenges facing Uber, which is contesting a trade-secrets theft complaint brought by Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       Uber has called Alphabet\u2019s claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and is defending against the lawsuit.Uber also faces a federal criminal investigation into its controversial practice of using technology to evade government officials seeking to identify and block the service\u2019s drivers.

That\u2019s right, this will be good old-fashioned 10 ounce-glove boxing\u2014no steel cage, no kicking, arm bars or rear naked chokeholds. It will be fought at 154 pounds, and is set for Las Vegas on Saturday, Aug. 26.You are allowed to have one of two opinions about this:1. Mayweather vs. McGregor is a shameless abomination concocted purely for money, which I have zero interest in paying to watch.2. Mayweather vs. McGregor is a shameless abomination concocted purely for money, which I have zero interest in paying to watch\u2014but I will try to talk my neighbor into paying for it.I lean more toward Camp No. 2. I\u2019ve already gotten to work on my neighbor. I think this fight is as goofy as it gets, but I\u2019m curious. Maybe not $99 curious, or whatever the pay-per-view fee will be, but enough to bring my neighbor a six-pack. And maybe some chips.Come on. It\u2019s on Aug. 26. What are you doing on Aug. 26? I\u2019ll tell you what you\u2019re doing: You\u2019re standing around the grill, drinking beer, burning eight ears of sweet corn. That\u2019s about it. (I told you that sweet corn was burning.)Think of Mayweather vs. McGregor as peak mindless entertainment in the doggiest final dog days of summer.Mindless summer entertainment is one of America\u2019s most cherished industries, after all. There\u2019s a reason TV unleashes its most ridiculous reality programming in July and August\u2014they know your overworked brain wants a holiday. There\u2019s a reason we love beach reads, Slip \u2018N Slides and popcorn movies. It is not a crime in this country to produce an overhyped summertime letdown strictly for money. If it were, they would not have made five Pirates of the Caribbean films.Floyd vs. Conor\u2026I don\u2019t see much to get worked up about.Fighting isn\u2019t church. Boxing, by design, is a spectacle, with a rich tradition of stuntcraft. Muhammad Ali fought the Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki. Manute Bol boxed Refrigerator Perry. Heavyweight \u201cTwo Ton\u201d Tony Galento fought Joe Louis\u2014but also a bear and a kangaroo. He even wrestled an\u2026octopus.(It\u2019s said the octopus died on the way to the fight, so Two Ton apparently wrestled a dead octopus.)I\u2019m not saying Conor McGregor is a dead octopus. But Mayweather stepping out of retirement to fight a man with the lightest of boxing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s isn\u2019t going to diminish boxing\u2019s stature in the eyes of the public\u2014boxing does a perfectly great job of that on its own. (Though boxing does have a really legit fight coming in September with Gennady Golovkin vs. Canelo Alvarez.)As for Mayweather vs. McGregor, I never imagined it would happen. It is easier to teach your dog French cooking than it is to organize a major fight\u2014and this was a fight involving two known egomaniacs and separate fighting bureaucracies.I thought this was simply an amusement for both men, world-class chatterboxes with limitless interest in keeping their names in the public eye. As long as the rumored financial offers never crossed the imaginary line in their heads, they\u2019d never get around to doing it.Apparently, the money crossed that imaginary line. There\u2019s talk that Mayweather vs. McGregor could surpass the nearly half-billion haul for Mayweather\u2019s 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao, though I\u2019m not sure that dull-as-doorknobs fight should be the model. A lot of people wanted to throw their televisions out the window after Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.What we\u2019ll surely get from Floyd and Conor is this: spectacular talk. McGregor is maybe the most amusingly charismatic talker in sports today, even if I think he believes only about 30% of what comes out of his mouth. The news conferences for this thing will really be the main event.As for the fight, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to lose for either guy.To Mayweather, the calculation must be pretty straightforward: You\u2019re going to pay me zillions to box a guy who doesn\u2019t box for a living? Where do I sign?To McGregor, who is just 28, the calculation must be pretty straightforward: You\u2019re going to pay me zillions to box when I don\u2019t box for a living? Where do I sign?There are other upsides for McGregor: exposure to a wider platform, the attention of a broader sports public, and the ability to create leverage within the UFC. If he loses, even badly, so what? A non-boxer lost to one of the greatest boxers of all-time for a ton of cash.The only relevant question is: Will you pay to watch on Aug. 26?My advice: start buttering up the neighbors.

The pedals help New Zealand charge hydraulics that are used to adjust the boat\u2019s wing-like main sail and the underwater blades that keep it soaring above the water. More hydraulic power allows crisper turns and other adjustments.It\u2019s a fresh innovation from the Kiwis, who in 2013 were the first team to figure out how to use hydrofoils to lift the boat above the waves. The bikes are just one of the design elements the New Zealanders adopted in their pursuit of the \u201cauld mug\u201d as they seek payback for the last finals, in which the Kiwis surged out to an 8-1 lead, pushing the U.S. to the brink of elimination, before Oracle stormed back to win 9-8 in one of the greatest comebacks in sports.This time the Kiwis are younger, honed by the early rounds, and sailing a boat that\u2019s proven fast in the moderate breezes forecast for coming days as the finals in the 165-year-old event unfold off Bermuda. Extra power for handling the boat could be a decisive advantage in what many expect to be a close series.In the challenger series, \u201cthe Kiwis\u2019 maneuvers were very good,\u201d said Peter Melvin, a former designer for teams including New Zealand and partner at Morrelli & Melvin Design and Engineering. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a combination of good crew work and the extra energy they have available to do those things.\u201dEllison\u2019s team, meanwhile, has barely been tested so far, losing just two races in the early rounds. Oracle\u2019s round-robin victory means the U.S. even starts out the Cup finals with a one-point advantage.So far, things have unfolded according to plan for the team led by Ellison, the world\u2019s ninth-richest man. The 50-foot catamarans have provided high-speed action, with numerous lead changes and minimal breakdowns. And while weeks of competition have shown that any team can win a race, Oracle has looked to oddsmakers and analysts like a solid favorite.One challenge Oracle faces is rust. The U.S. team hasn\u2019t raced since early June. That could be critical, some analysts said, since few of the sailors on any team have spent as much time sailing the catamarans as they\u2019d like.\u201cEveryone always wants more time with these boats,\u201d Oracle helmsman Jimmy Spithill told The Wall Street Journal recently. \u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface of what they are able to do.\u201dSome analysts think the teams could also be masking some of their boats\u2019 capabilities. Grant Dalton, chief executive for the New Zealand team, said at a test event in New York last year that one of his biggest regrets from 2013 was revealing the team\u2019s success with hydrofoils too early\u2014giving other teams the chance to catch up. Indeed, last month Oracle added a cycling station to its boat, just behind the helmsman.Gary Jobson, who won the Cup as tactician for Ted Turner\u2019s Courageous, said New Zealand likely has an edge in the light air, while the advantage shifts to the U.S. in the breeze. Much will also depend on who can adjust their boat and sailing quickly after seeing the other team\u2019s capabilities. Experience could also play a role.Spithill, Oracle\u2019s driver, \u201cis historically is the better starter and, like any sport, there\u2019s no substitute for knowing what it\u2019s like to reach the finals,\u201d Jobson said. Yet Peter Burling of New Zealand is \u201ccoming off a gold medal in the Olympics, so the kid\u2019s on an upward trajectory.

He chose not to make any.Still seeking his first career major title, Fowler began his latest quest with a first-round 65 at Erin Hills that sent him into the clubhouse in the lead at 7 under par. He tied the lowest first-round U.S. Open score relative to par on record. And he did it without making a bogey.\u201cYou don\u2019t get many rounds at the U.S. Open that are stress-free,\u201d he said. \u201cSimple day, when you look back on it.\u201dOnly Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf, who both opened the 1980 U.S. Open with 7-under 63s, have been as far below par after the first round. What those two did next shows how much\u2014and how little\u2014Fowler\u2019s start ultimately could matter.Nicklaus went on to set a tournament scoring record and win his fourth U.S. Open title. Weiskopf shot no better than 75 the rest of the week and finished in 37th place. Fowler, 28, would be content to secure the trophy however he can.\u201cIt is always cool to be part of some sort of history in golf,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather be remembered for something that\u2019s done on Sunday.\u201dThe conditions were benign during Fowler\u2019s morning round. Mostly low winds took away one of the primary defenses for a course with wider fairways than usual for the U.S. Open and without especially tricky greens. Still, some other favorites in the field playing around the same time struggled.Dustin Johnson, the world No. 1 and defending Open champion, stumbled to a 3-over 75 as he repeatedly found himself hitting out of the tall fescue grass right and left of the fairways. It was his first major championship round of 2017, after a freak back injury on the eve of the Masters forced him to withdraw.Playing in the same group as Johnson, Jordan Spieth struck the ball much better but was uncharacteristically shaky on the greens. He had 15 putts for birdie and sank just one, leaving him with a 1-over 73.If Fowler goes on to win, it would mark the seventh consecutive major won by a first-time major champion. When Sergio Garcia won the Masters in April, it left Fowler as the popular pick for the title of best player without a major title. He has five top-five finishes at majors, including a tie for second place at the 2014 U.S. Open.\u201cThere are a lot of really good players out here that haven\u2019t won a major,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it would be nice to get rid of that at some point. I\u2019m not saying that this is the week or isn\u2019t the week.

Hens and chicks and their relations do have a certain rubbery, glaucous charm. But what if you truly desire leafy, bloom-covered plants, and doubt you can commit to their water requirements?Your guide to mastering the lazy summerThe horticultural industry has recognized a need for less-demanding varieties, especially as drought has hit large swaths of the country and people\u2019s lives have grown busier. Today\u2019s gardeners, many of them novices, \u201cneed bulletproof plants,\u201d said       Kris Carlsson,        product-launch manager at Ball FloraPlant, a flower breeder based in West Chicago, Ill. The drought-resistant category also serves weekend gardeners as well as people who forget to make arrangements for the balcony flowers when on vacation. The homeowners \u201ccome back and have to buy all new plants,\u2019\u2019 he said.To find varieties that take abuse, Ball conducts \u201cdeath trials,\u201d leaving plants to bake in the sun in hot climates like Texas\u2019s. Mr. Carlsson said he allowed a salvia variety called Black & Bloom, whose rich blue flowers stand out against its near-black stems, to go unwatered for 10 blazing days. \u201cThe plant had wilted all the way to the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cI watered it, and four hours later it was standing perfectly straight up, looking absolutely beautiful.\u2019\u2019Many of these durable plants originally hail from arid climates. Gazania, whose blooms resemble diminutive sunflowers, are native to southern Africa. Scaevola, with its delicate demilunes of petals, can be traced to Australia. Central and South America brought us Angelonia, or Angel Flower, which adorns its upright stems with blossoms of purple, pink, red or white. Lantana, whose tiny flowers cluster in puffy, brilliant-hued balls (sometime more than one color per formation) come from the same part of the globe.Other good long-hot-summer choices are plants our grandparents grew: geraniums, begonias, zinnias, portulaca, tall phlox and cleome, or spider flower. These old-timey flowers have appealed to generations of lazy folks because they are tough and nearly foolproof, said       Rick Schoellhorn,        a consultant at Proven Winners, a wholesale plant purveyor based in Campbell, Calif.Keep in mind, these champions do require water from time to time, especially at first. \u201cYou need to slowly pare them back to a low-water regime,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schoellhorn said.Beyond selecting the right varieties, you can give plants in containers a leg up. Supplement potting soil with silica-gel granules sold at garden centers. They absorb moisture like a sponge, then release it as the soil dries. Use oversize planters\u2014which hold more soil and therefore more moisture\u2014made of anything but unglazed terra-cotta, which leaches wetness. Saucers help by catching excess water that roots can later suck back up as needed. And top off the soil with mulch, for slower water evaporation.With these tricks, warm-weather gardening won\u2019t be foolproof\u2014gardening never is.

Richard Shelby       of Alabama about the delay in disbursements. \u201cOne of the most important things we can do is reimburse victims\u2026and we should do it as quickly as possible.\u201dRepublican Rep.       Vern Buchanan       of Florida also asked the agency in writing last month\u00a0for an explanation,\u00a0saying victims \u201cwere cheated out of their life savings, and now they\u2019re being denied timely compensation.\u201dVictims are keenly interested in the $4 billion settlement pot, and so is Wall Street. Many\u00a0Madoff\u00a0investors sold their claims to\u00a0hedge funds, some of which have been urging the Justice Department to release the money and change its approach to who should get paid, according to people familiar with the matter.The Justice Department said\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that the victim fund was entering the \u201cpayment phase\u201d after having taken formal action on close to 60,000 petitions. It said it remains \u201con track\u201d to make initial payments this year, though another 5,800 applications totaling $9.8 billion are still under review.A spokeswoman for Mr. Breeden\u2019s firm didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But the delay is in part by design since the forfeiture fund was designed to broaden the universe of eligible claimants beyond Mr. Picard\u2019s liquidation.While Mr. Picard has paid back account holders at Mr.\u00a0Madoff\u2019s phantom firm, tens of thousands of indirect investors who lost money through pooled investment vehicles haven\u2019t received anything through the liquidation proceeding because they weren\u2019t customers themselves.Some indirect investors have collected payments from liquidators winding down the feeder funds or investment clubs that funneled their money to\u00a0Madoff\u00a0and later reached settlements with Mr. Picard. Others who lost money through middleman funds have received nothing because the intermediaries profited from the Ponzi scheme. Mr. Breeden\u2019s plan would allow those victims to collect directly rather than being repaid through their feeder funds, many of which are also in liquidation.\u201cA victim may be eligible for remission no matter who handled or managed their money on its way to\u00a0Madoff,\u201d Mr. Breeden wrote in an update posted online\u00a0Thursday. He said 35,500 victims, mostly indirect investors, would receive payments, 26,000 of whom would be getting a recovery for the first time.But his eligibility standards would freeze out\u00a0hedge funds that paid\u00a0Madoff\u00a0customers for their claims and aren\u2019t considered victims under his framework, unlike Mr. Picard, who has honored payments to investors that acquired claims on the secondary market.If Mr. Breeden distributes money to victims, \u201cthe assumption is you\u2019ll see a lot of litigation\u201d as\u00a0hedge funds\u00a0that bought claims try to chase down that money, said       Jonathan Sablone,        a lawyer specializing in private funds with Nixon Peabody LLP.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to exclude feeder funds from payouts from the victim fund came as a surprise when it was announced in 2013. It helped\u00a0scuttle a provisional settlement\u00a0between Mr. Picard and Kingate Management Ltd., a Bermuda-based operation that parked $1.7 billion with Mr.\u00a0Madoff\u00a0from 1994 to 2008.Some claim buyers, represented by the Jones Day law firm, have argued in Washington that the Justice Department should release forfeiture money under a different framework more closely resembling what was used in federal bankruptcy court, according to people familiar with the matter.Other skeptics say prioritizing indirect investors was ill-advised because of the difficulty of tracing stolen cash that moved in and out of the Ponzi scheme through opaque arrangements, often based offshore. Those criticisms haven\u2019t convinced the agency to change its approach, people familiar with the matter said.Mr. Breeden had hoped to hand out money last year but was unable \u201cdue to the volume and complexity of claims,\u201d according to an update he posted in January.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to look through all the investor vehicles to the individuals who were actually harmed,\u201d Mr. Sablone said. \u201cWhile that\u2019s a laudable goal to have, it\u2019s virtually impossible in the global marketplace\u2026and it explains why we\u2019re so many years out and nothing\u2019s been distributed.\u201dA small portion of the Justice Department fund came from selling assets seized after Mr.\u00a0Madoff\u2019s arrest, including his homes in Manhattan, Montauk, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. also kicked in $1.7 billion in 2014 under a pact with prosecutors to head off a criminal case surrounding its dealings with Mr.\u00a0Madoff. The majority of the pot came from the\u00a0widow of Jeffry Picower, a wealthy beneficiary of the Ponzi scheme, who contributed $2.2 billion in 2010. Mr. Picard\u2019s team separately collected $5 billion from that settlement.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 16:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/criticism-mounts-on-madoff-compensation-fund-1497557329", "news_title": "Criticism Mounts on Madoff Compensation Fund ", "keywords": "bankruptcy,bernie madoff,compensation fund,justice department,madoff,madoff fund,madoff victim fund,madoff victims,ponzi scheme,J.P.

FB 0.79%       is leaning more on artificial intelligence.The social-media firm said Thursday that it has expanded its use of A.I. in recent months to identify potential terrorist postings and accounts on its platform\u2014and at times to delete or block them without review by a human. In the past, Facebook and other tech giants relied mostly on users and human moderators to identify offensive content. Even when algorithms flagged content for removal, these firms generally turned to humans to make a final call.Companies have sharply boosted the volume of content they have removed in the past two years, but these efforts haven\u2019t proven effective enough to tamp down a groundswell of criticism from governments and advertisers. They have accused Facebook, Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       and others of complacency over the proliferation of inappropriate content\u2014in particular, posts or videos deemed as extremist propaganda or communication\u2014on their social networks.British Prime Minister Theresa May ratcheted up complaints this month in the wake of a series of deadly terror attacks in the U.K., and sought new international agreements to regulate the internet and force technology companies to preemptively filter content.In response, Facebook disclosed new software that it says it is using to better police its content. One tool, in use for several months now, combs the site, including live videos, for known terrorist imagery, like beheading videos, to stop them from being reposted, executives said Thursday. The tool, however, doesn\u2019t identify new violent videos like the Cleveland murder that was posted on Facebook in April.Another set of algorithms attempts to identify\u2014and sometimes autonomously block\u2014propagandists from opening new accounts after they have already been kicked off the platform. Another experimental tool uses A.I. that has been trained to identify language used by terrorist propagandists.Facebook declined to say what portion of extremist material it removes is being blocked or removed automatically, and what percentage is reviewed by humans. The firm\u2019s moves reflect a growing willingness to trust machines to help even in part with thorny tasks like distinguishing inappropriate content from satire or news coverage\u2014something firms resisted after a spate of attacks just two years ago as a potential threat to free speech.One factor in the changed approach, Facebook executives say, has been the improved ability of algorithms to identify unambiguously terrorist content in some cases, while referring other content for human review.While an Isis-propaganda photo posted without a caption may be an easy removal for an algorithm, the same image with a caption might for instance require human review, said Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management. Similarly a beheading video that has previously been removed is easy to block. Short clips of the same video, or a never-before-seen but similar looking video, might need a reviewer to check if they are part of a news report or other commentary.\u201cOur A.I. can know when it can make a definitive choice, and when it can\u2019t make a definitive choice,\u201d said       Brian Fishman,        lead policy manager for counterterrorism at Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s something new.\u201dAnother factor in the fresh A.I. push: a spate of recent terrorist attacks and scandals involving ads being shown before jihadist videos.Just days before a general election in the U.K, for instance, the campaigns for the country\u2019s two main parties pulled political ads from Alphabet\u2019s YouTube video-sharing site after being alerted those ads were appearing before extremist content.Germany earlier this year proposed a bill that could fine firms up to \u20ac50 million ($56 million) for failing to remove fake news or hate speech\u2014including terrorist content. The U.K. and France published a counterterrorism action plan this week that calls on technology companies to go beyond deleting content that is flagged, and instead identify it beforehand to prevent publication.\u201cThere have been promises made. They are insufficient,\u201d said French President       Emmanuel Macron       on Tuesday.Facebook has expanded its use of human reviewers to look at what executives say are difficult cases. In May, the company said it would add about 3,000 new moderators to its community operations team that takes down content that violates Facebook policies, expanding the team by two thirds. Across the company, Facebook says it has 150 people focused on counterterrorism as their core job.Facebook already has rolled out software to identify other questionable content such as child pornography and fake news stories. Ahead of French and German elections this year, the company began tagging \u201cdisputed\u201d stories when outside news organizations ruled them as false.The issue of content removal remains at times fraught for Silicon Valley companies, whose values often place a premium on permitting debate. At times, firms have also acknowledged that algorithms have gone too far. Last July, Facebook was criticized for removing live video from Minnesota woman Diamond Reynolds, who showed her boyfriend, Philando Castile, dying after being shot by a police officer during a traffic stop. Facebook blamed the removal on a technical glitch and restored the video.Social-media firms including Facebook,         Yahoo Inc.       and             Twitter Inc.       are adamant that they want to stamp out terrorism on their platforms\u2014and already do a lot to remove such content. Twitter says it is expanding its use of automated technology to combat terrorist content, too. From July through December last year, Twitter said internal tools flagged 74% of the 376,890 accounts it removed.YouTube said Thursday that it uses automated software to block users from uploading videos that have already been flagged and removed from the site, adding that more than half of the content removed for terrorism in the last six months was removed at least in part using such technology.Along with Facebook, it is collaborating with the other social media firms on a shared database of previously identified terrorist imagery, first announced in December, which allows the companies to more quickly identify posts that use them. But the company doesn\u2019t use technology to screen new content for policy violations, saying computers lack the nuance to determine the difference between propaganda and newsworthy or religious speech in a previously uncategorized video.\u201cThese are complicated and challenging problems, but we are committed to doing better and being part of a lasting solution,\u201d a YouTube spokesman said.\u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Facebook Scans for Terror Using AI.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 15:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-boosts-a-i-to-block-terrorist-propaganda-1497546000", "news_title": "Facebook Boosts AI to Block Terrorist Propaganda ", "keywords": "facebook,facebook postings,facebook terrorism,terrorism,terrorism postings,terrorism propaganda,terrorism social media,Facebook,FB,Alphabet Inc.

Worker shortages are causing businesses to slow investment, the administration says. Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training and classroom education, with participants earning a credential recognized by the federal government.The order directs the Labor Department to allow companies, trade associations and unions to develop their own apprenticeship-program guidelines. Those would be reviewed for quality, but the government would generally take a lighter touch than it does with current programs.\u201cWe\u2019re empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens,\u201d Mr. Trump said just before signing the order in the White House. \u201cApprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees.\u201dThe order also directs additional funds to apprenticeship programs, roughly doubling spending to $200 million a year, senior administration officials said Thursday. The increase in apprenticeship funding stands in contrast to the president\u2019s budget, which proposes to cut the department\u2019s overall funding for training and employment services by $1.27 billion.The bulk of the cost of apprenticeships is paid for by employers or labor unions, which benefit from workers\u2019 specialized training. The Labor Department provides oversight of programs and has provided funding to start new ones, such as a restaurant-manager training apprenticeship under development by the National Restaurant Association.Apprentices, who are typically paid a training wage that averages $15 an hour, face a strong job market. The average starting salary of apprentices is about $60,000 a year, and nine in 10 who complete programs are offered jobs, according to the Labor Department.But apprenticeships haven't been applied widely. About two-thirds of apprentices work in construction or manufacturing, and there are only about half a million Americans in active programs, compared with more than 13 million enrolled four-year colleges.Mr. Trump can create an environment where high-school students look to apprenticeships as good career options, said       Judy Marks,        chief executive of Siemens USA, a division of the German industrial giant. The company has apprenticeship programs in four states and is expanding to four more.\u201cWe\u2019re changing the narrative to show instructional and vocational training leads to valid, needed and respected careers,\u201d she said in an interview.Thursday\u2019s order is the latest government effort to promote apprenticeships, with programs spanning back to the       Franklin Roosevelt       administration. In 2015, President       Barack Obama       launched a program to award $175 million in apprenticeship grants and his administration entered a deal with German counterparts to collaborate on workforce development.Germany\u2019s system is viewed by many as a model, but translating it to the U.S. is a challenge. Germany has two-track educational system where 17-year-old students choose whether to pursue a college degree or a vocational degree and apprenticeship. Educational institutions are separate, and few students switch tracks.The Trump administration\u2019s push has been welcomed by business groups, including the Business Roundtable, and labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers and North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions.Wes Bush,        chairman and chief executive of             Northrop Grumman Corp.      , pointed to apprenticeships and summer internships for students in two- and four-year colleges as a way to increase the ranks of workers who have requisite skills, especially for jobs that require sophisticated science, technology, engineering and math abilities. The aerospace and defense company works with universities in Maryland to train workers for cybersecurity careers.\u201cIt enhances the ability of students to understand the real-world need for the skillsets they are developing,\u201d he said in an interview.Existing federally registered apprenticeship programs would continue, administration officials said. The new programs developed by industry could have expedited access to gain that federal recognition.Under existing apprenticeship rules, the Labor Department closely dictates how programs are administered, including the minimum length and how many hours of classroom instruction are required. The National Restaurant Association, which won a contract last year to develop its program for restaurant managers, negotiated with the department for months to allow it to count prior work experience toward the two-year program, said       Rob Gifford,        executive vice president for the association\u2019s educational foundation.\u201cIf there was less flow-through of federal regulations, I think that would increase the enthusiasm of businesses around apprenticeships,\u201d he said.Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the House education and workforce committee, said expanding apprenticeships has broad support among both parties, but he\u2019s concerned industry-led programs will result in less oversight.\u201cYou have a system that works now,\u201d said Mr. Scott, who attending the signing of the order.The executive order would also require federal agencies to review the effectiveness of job-training programs and look to consolidate. While the administration is proposing large cuts to job training, it says many existing programs overlap or are ineffective. There are 43 job-training programs across 13 agencies.The president\u2019s direction comes after a 2015 law Republicans in Congress crafted and Mr. Obama signed, which sought to streamline programs, ease federal mandates and establish performance measures.Those measures went into effect less than a year ago, and members of Congress are still awaiting the initial results, said Rep.       Virginia Foxx       (R., N.C.), chairwoman of the house workforce committee.\u201cIt is reassuring to see the White House join House Republican efforts to educate Americans for the future,\u201d she said Thursday.Last week, she called on the administration to implement the 2015 law \u201cas Congress intended.\u201d The administration proposed a nearly 40% cut to programs authorized under that act.\u2014Paul Beckett contributed to this article.Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Order Boosts Apprenticeships.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 15:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-set-to-sign-order-seeking-to-expand-apprenticeship-programs-1497538868", "news_title": "Donald Trump Signs Order Seeking to Expand Apprenticeship Programs   ", "keywords": "apprenticeships,executive order,executive orders,internships,labor department,on-the-job training,trump administration,Donald Trump,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,employee training,development,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Takata Corp.        7312 37.04%      , the Japanese automotive supplier of rupture-prone air bags linked to numerous deaths and injuries, is in the final stages of preparing to file for bankruptcy protection to address mounting liabilities stemming from an unprecedented recall, said a person familiar with the matter.Takata is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as next week, the person said. The company is nearing a takeover deal with rival Key Safety Systems Inc. that would be consummated as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, this person said, though an agreement hasn\u2019t yet been reached.Takata is planning to file for protection from creditors in both the U.S. and Japan, the person said.Takata has been on the verge of a bankruptcy restructuring for some time, only for plans to be delayed. Takata is now expected to seek bankruptcy protection before the end of this month at the latest, though the timing could still slip, the person said.For Takata, the long-expected bankruptcy filing would cap a long-running crisis at the Japanese automotive supplier stemming from tens of millions of air bags that risk exploding and spraying shrapnel in vehicle cabins, a defect linked to at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries globally.Takata earlier this year pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud and agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties for providing misleading testing reports to auto makers on the air bags. The plea deal settled a longstanding U.S. Justice Department criminal probe and requires Takata to pay restitution to auto makers shouldering recall costs and consumers harmed or yet to be affected by the air bags.In the U.S. alone, nearly all auto makers are in the process of recalling 42 million vehicles with up to nearly 70 million Takata air bags, the largest automotive safety campaign in American history.The unprecedented safety crisis sparked U.S. congressional hearings, widespread litigation and hammered Takata\u2019s finances, forcing it to weigh a bankruptcy filing and seek a financial backer. In May, Takata reported a roughly $718 million loss for the full year ending in March. The company declined to declare a year-end dividend for shareholders.Takata is weighing options for completing a takeover deal with Key Safety that include pursuing what is known in restructuring circles as a \u201c363 sale\u201d for the relevant section of the U.S. bankruptcy code governing it, the person familiar with the matter said. Such sales allow companies to sell assets free and clear of certain liabilities to a buyer.Takata\u2019s U.S. plea deal outlines financial obligations to auto makers and consumers, and sets deadlines for paying claims, making the supplier\u2019s liabilities clearer as it prepares to seek bankruptcy protection. Takata, for instance, has until early 2018 to pay $850 million to auto makers, or five days from when it completes a takeover deal, according to the plea deal. Prospective bidders were wary of Takata\u2019s recall and litigation liabilities as discussions began on a possible restructuring deal for the supplier.Some other liabilities could still be in the offing, as litigation stemming from Takata\u2019s air bags continues to proceed in a Miami federal court. Several auto makers in May agreed to a collective $553 million settlement with current and former owners and lessees of nearly 16 million vehicles to address lagging repairs and financial losses associated with Takata air bags. It isn\u2019t clear whether other auto makers will eventually agree to similar settlements.While the plans aren\u2019t yet completed, Takata\u2019s preparations for seeking bankruptcy protection and ceding control to a rival have been under way for more than a year. In May 2016, Takata hired Lazard Ltd. bankers, including those with significant experience guiding companies through bankruptcy proceedings, to begin a process of reviewing bids from private-equity firms and rival suppliers.Even before that, the company had enlisted bankruptcy lawyers at Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, a law firm that has handled some of history\u2019s largest corporate failures, including             General Motors Co.\u2019s       $50 billion government rescue and bankruptcy restructuring.Consumers, meanwhile, have encountered parts shortages and confusion attempting to get recalled vehicles repaired. In some cases, air bags will need to be replaced more than once.Two-thirds of more than 46 million recalled Takata air bags remained unrepaired as of mid-May, according to Sen. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.), a longtime critic of the company and regulators who earlier this month cited the figures to an independent monitor overseeing the safety campaign. One since-settled wrongful-death case involving a ruptured Takata air bag in Mr. Nelson\u2019s state stemmed from a 2014 Orlando crash that police first suspected to be a homicide because of the resulting carnage.Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 15:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/takata-nears-bankruptcy-filing-1497554185", "news_title": "Takata Nears Bankruptcy Filing", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,pe restructuring,takata,takata air bags,takata bankruptcy,Takata,7312.TO,JP:7312,General Motors,GM,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,product,consumer safety,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,product recalls,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Thursday to expand sanctions on Moscow and wrest more control of Russia policy from the Trump administration, bucking criticism of the legislation from European allies, the State Department and the Kremlin.The bipartisan bill, which passed on a 98-2 vote, requires that the administration receive congressional approval to lift existing sanctions on Russia. It also broadens sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector, mandates punishment of malicious cyber actors and crimps financing available to Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors.The result is the strongest rebuke yet from U.S. lawmakers to Moscow over Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, which is cited specifically in the legislation.Sen.       John McCain       (R. Ariz.) chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the legislation \u201cfinally holds Russia accountable for its brazen attack on our 2016 presidential election.\u201dRussia has denied any government effort to meddle in the U.S. election.The bill marks a warning shot to the White House from the Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans but where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns the Trump administration isn\u2019t responding forcefully enough to Russia.The bill in effect makes any decision to lift sanctions on Russia a matter for Congress and the White House to decide together. Without the legislation, the executive branch can decide to reverse the sanctions on its own.Both the White House and Congress traditionally have the power to initiate sanctions, but the U.S. sanctions initiated against Russia since 2014 have been done primarily through executive order. The bill would codify the executive orders into U.S. law. So to lift them, it no longer would be simply a matter of rescinding an executive order. It would be a matter of approving a change to the law.The congressional approval applies to the existing sanctions the Obama administration imposed through executive order. The bill doesn\u2019t limit the White House\u2019s ability to impose any future sanctions on its own.If the bill becomes law, it would essentially kill any hopes in Moscow for sanctions relief in the short term and hamper President Donald Trump from removing the penalties until Russia displays a significant change in behavior.The legislation comes six months after U.S. intelligence agencies issued the declassified version of a report concluding Russia ordered an influence campaign to aid Mr. Trump in his battle in the 2016 election against Democratic candidate       Hillary Clinton.The two senators to vote against the bill were Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I.,Vt.)Democratic lawmakers largely supported the bill because of the check it put on the White House. \u201cAny idea of the president\u2019s that he can lift sanctions on his own for whatever reason are dashed by this legislation,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D, N.Y.) said on the Senate floor on Thursday before the legislation was passed.The bill also steps up sanctions against Iran over human rights abuses, support for terrorism and ballistic missile development, measures the Trump administration supports.To become law, a form of the legislation needs to be passed by the House of Representatives. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is reviewing the Senate bill\u2019s details, and House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) believes \u201cwe must do more to hold Russia accountable,\u201d his spokeswoman said.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House spokeswoman, said Thursday that the administration was still reviewing the new sanctions and would wait until there was a final product to \u201cweigh in.\u201dShould Mr. Trump veto the legislation, a vote from two-thirds of each chamber of Congress could override it. He could also let it pass into law without his signature by declining to sign for 10 days after its passage.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       has sounded deeply skeptical of such legislation. He said Wednesday that Russia should be held accountable for interference in the 2016 campaign but argued that Congress shouldn\u2019t tie the president\u2019s hands when it comes to applying or lifting sanctions.\u201cEssentially, we would ask for the flexibility to turn the heat up when we need to, but also to ensure that we have the ability to maintain a constructive dialogue.\u201d Mr. Tillerson said in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.The bill cites the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential election. It says the U.S. should increase efforts to enforce sanctions in \u201cresponse to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, cyber intrusions and attacks, and human rights violators in the Russian Federation.\u201dRussian President       Vladimir Putin       criticized the Senate bill before its final passage, describing it as the product of domestic political battles in the U.S.Certain energy-related provisions of the Senate bill also prompted a rare public rebuke from European allies, which largely have imposed sanctions on Russia in lockstep with Washington since the Ukraine-Russia conflict erupted in 2014.Germany and Austria issued a joint statement taking issue with a section of the bill that allows the president to sanction companies providing certain goods, services or investments for the construction of Russian energy export pipelines.\u201cWe cannot accept a threat of extraterritorial sanctions, illegal under international law, against European companies that participate in developing European energy supplies,\u201d German Foreign Minister       Sigmar Gabriel       and Austrian Chancellor       Christian Kern       said in their statement. \u201cEurope\u2019s energy supply is Europe\u2019s business, not that of the United States of America.\u201dBerlin and Vienna supported the U.S. State Department\u2019s efforts to change the legislation, Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Kern said.The legislation, they added, would have a \u201cvery negative\u201d impact on European-American ties and damage Western efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis. The bill\u2019s stipulation that the U.S. \u201cshould prioritize the export of United States energy resources in order to create American jobs\u201d also drew a rebuke from Berlin and Vienna.Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was unaware of which provision upset U.S. allies in Europe, but said the House could change the bill if necessary.The pipeline provision, which says the president \u201cmay\u201d impose such penalties but stops short of mandating them, poses a potential risk to a consortium of five European companies, which pledged to provide up to \u20ac4.75 billion ($5.3 billion) in long-term financing to the Russian-backed Baltic Sea pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 AG project is a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia\u2019s state-owned PAO Gazprom.Engie SA,OMV AG      ,             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC,             Uniper SE                   and Wintershall Holding GmbH signed their agreement in April, after Polish regulators had blocked them from owning 50% of Nord Stream 2.\u201cAny decision we take, like this one when we made that financing commitment, we make it by our best commercial interest, while abiding by applicable trade controls and international sanctions,\u201d said       Sally Donaldson,        a spokeswoman in London for Shell.Nord Stream 2 is seeking construction permits from Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, and has begun stockpiling pipes to start construction, scheduled for early next year.\u201cWe see absolutely no impact on the project,\u201d said Sebastian Sass, Nord Stream 2\u2019s representative to Brussels. \u201cThe bill makes clear that the objective is about American jobs and commercial projects being pursued at the expense of prosperity and jobs in Europe.\u201dThe Senate measure reiterates the continued U.S. opposition to NordStream 2 because of \u201cits detrimental impacts on the European Union\u2019s energy security, gas market development in Central and Eastern Europe, and energy reforms in Ukraine.\u201dOregon Sen.       Ron Wyden,        the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade policy, said \u201cthis bill is obviously not about U.S. gas exports, it\u2019s about ensuring we hit critical leverage points in countering Russian aggression.\u201dAnother portion of the bill would prohibit U.S. citizens and entities from exporting goods, nonfinancial services and technology in support of deep-water, Arctic offshore or shale-exploration projects involving Russian firms.The Senate bill also tightens restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities. It reduces the maturity period of new debt issuance to Russia\u2019s financial sector from 30 to 14 days and Russia\u2019s energy sector from 90 to 30 days.\u2014Emre Peker in Brussels and Thomas Grove in Moscow contributed  to this article.Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com, Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Senate Seeks Wider Russian Penalties.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 15:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-passes-bill-expanding-russia-sanctions-limiting-trumps-say-1497555703", "news_title": "Senate Passes Bill That Would Expand Russia Sanctions, Limit Trump\u2019s Say ", "keywords": " nord stream, nord stream 2 ag, russian-backed baltic sea pipeline,russia sanctions,U.S. Senate,Nord Stream 2,Vladimir Putin,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,natural gas markets"}, {"content": "U.S. government bonds pulled back Thursday, lifting the yield on the 10-year Treasury note from its lowest level of the year, amid continued fallout from Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.The yield on the benchmark 10-year note settled at 2.160%, compared with 2.138% Wednesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.Trading in the bond market has been volatile over the past two days.Prices surged early Wednesday after a report showed the consumer-price index fell to 1.9% on an annualized basis in May from 2.2% the previous month. That was the latest sign that inflation is struggling to reach the Fed\u2019s 2% target, a development that has been a major factor behind the unexpected strength of the bond market this year.A slower increase in consumer prices makes bonds more attractive to investors because inflation chips away at the fixed returns of bonds. It also increases skepticism that the Fed will raise interest rates in the second half of the year.Still, the Fed hasn\u2019t backed away from its tightening plans. On Wednesday afternoon, the central bank, as expected, announced it would raise short-term interest rates for the second time in 2017. Officials said they were \u201cmonitoring inflation developments closely\u201d but signaled they still expect to raise rates one more time this year, while also starting to slowly unwind the Fed\u2019s balance sheet that includes more than $2 trillion in Treasury debt.The Fed\u2019s statement and subsequent press conference from Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       put an end to the bond rally, leading yields to partially retrace their declines from earlier in the day.Overall, the Fed was \u201cvery nonchalant about inflation and kind of brushed it off,\u201d said       Blake Gwinn,        U.S. interest-rates strategist at NatWest Markets.Government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic came under further pressure Thursday morning after three Bank of England officials dissented on the central bank\u2019s decision to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, arguing instead for an immediate rate increase.The number of dissenting votes was taken as a sign by investors that the U.K. central bank is closer to ending the stimulus put in place after last year\u2019s Brexit referendum.U.S. economic data, however, was supportive of bond prices. A report showed industrial production was flat in May, below the 0.1% increase anticipated by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.Despite recent swings, many investors and analysts expect the market to be relatively calm in the near future. After months of volatility caused in part by political developments, inflation data has emerged as the overriding focus of investors, said       Jim Vogel,        interest-rates strategist at FTN Financial.Should the data pick up, it would support the case for the Fed tightening policy and weaken the argument for buying bonds.

It is the lowest settlement since Nov. 14.The losses extended a selloff that started Wednesday when crude tanked by nearly 4% after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported gasoline inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels last week, a time when analysts thought those inventories had declined. It raised questions about whether demand would grow enough at the height of summer driving season to burn up a longstanding glut of crude, questions still leading the market Thursday, analysts and a broker said.It was the latest in a series of big losses that have become commonplace in oil this year. Many expected output cuts enacted by the world\u2019s biggest exporters to reduce oversupply this year. But stockpiles in the U.S. kept growing anyway and are still holding near historic highs after several recent weekly declines. That has confused traders and forced several big selloffs since March.\u201cThe past week has shown that the oil market remains in a fragile state in which minor changes can tip the scales,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note Thursday afternoon.With stockpiles still holding near highs, demand becomes especially important. Many traders and analysts expected much of the excess gasoline to be mopped up during the U.S. summer driving season. But data show gasoline demand has fallen for three weeks straight.Gasoline prices fell to intraday lows dating to November in early trading, though they rebounded later. Gasoline futures settled up 0.3 cent, or 0.2%, to $1.4357 a gallon.\u201cThe gasoline is a market in dire need of a major reduction in U.S. refinery activity and such a development is not currently showing up on the radar,\u201d said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.Market sentiment was already weak before the EIA readings, after both the global oil cartel and the top energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, noted that the global supply growth rate continues to outpace demand and will do so until next year at least. That was despite the continuing output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia. The cuts are aimed at bringing global OECD inventories down to their five-year average.\u201cAny build in U.S. commercial stocks gives us an indication of the uphill battle OPEC is facing in achieving its target,\u201d said       Tamas Varga       at brokerage PVM.The IEA predicts non-OPEC production, mainly U.S. supplies, will grow by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018, while global daily demand will only see a rise of 1.4 million barrels.\u201cTo me, that\u2019s the biggest alarm bell.

Once you\u2019ve experienced the convenience of casually asking a computer to do your bidding (\u201cAlexa, play \u2018This American Life\u2019 \u201d), being forced to swipe and tap feels downright primitive.But there is a hitch. Though voice assistants have become more skillful\u2014capable of summoning taxis, turning on lights and preheating ovens\u2014conveying your wishes isn\u2019t always as easy as you might expect.To save you the tedious effort of trial and error in a brave, new voice-controlled world, we\u2019ve put together this guide, complete with reality checks, to the current state of play when it comes to introducing Alexa into your life.The Promise You\u2019ll never have to flip a light switch or fiddle with a TV remote again.In Reality As you configure more Alexa-connected devices to work in your home, giving Alexa precise lighting cues can get convoluted. What used to be \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights\u201d quickly becomes \u201cAlexa, turn on the living-room floor lamp\u201d or \u201cAlexa, turn on the living-room overhead lights.\u201dLatency can be a problem, too: There\u2019s sometimes a brief but noticeable lag between the moment you utter your command and when the light actually responds. The system leaves you hanging just long enough to make you wonder if everything is working.Your Best Bet Rely on Alexa for channel surfing instead. Alexa makes it especially easy to control             Dish Network\u2019s       set-top boxes; just say \u201cAlexa, tune to HBO\u201d or \u201cAlexa, show me       Christopher Nolan       movies.\u201d (This works on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, too.) There\u2019s no need to navigate arcane menus with a button-laden remote control. Expect more smart TVs and video providers to offer similar compatibility soon.The Promise Cooking will be a chore of the past now that you can ask Alexa to order-in everything from a Meat Lovers Pizza to pad thai.In Reality Although a number of eateries and delivery services (Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut,             Starbucks,       Seamless) offer Alexa integration, you\u2019re currently limited to choosing items from your previous online orders or dishes you\u2019ve designated as favorites.\u2018Alexa-enabled speakers make incredibly handy kitchen assistants. No more grease-streaked smartphone screens.\u2019Your Best Bet For culinary variety, have Alexa help you cook more capably. Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled speakers\u2014Echo and its less expensive, more compact sibling, the Echo Dot\u2014make incredibly handy kitchen assistants. Use them to start or silence multiple timers (no more grease-streaked smartphone screens). Call on Alexa to convert measurements on the fly (\u201cAlexa, how many ounces is nine tablespoons?\u201d) or do quick arithmetic to triple a recipe as you go.The Promise You\u2019ll be able to integrate Alexa throughout your home, as manufacturers build Alexa microphones into thermostats (ecobee4), smoke detectors (First Alert Onelink) and table lamps (C by GE Sol).In Reality One of the most miraculous aspects of using the Echo or Echo Dot speakers is their ability to understand you over the din of real life. You don\u2019t have to shout or over-enunciate; you can talk to Alexa like a real person\u2014even if others are yapping and       Bruno Mars       is blasting in the same room. What makes this possible? In part, an array of seven microphones that Amazon has incorporated into the speakers.But the third-party devices that are available now or that are coming soon use a maximum of two microphones. As a result, they may not have the same super-hearing powers as the Echo or Echo Dot. While they\u2019ll likely work fine in quiet bedrooms, they may struggle in your home\u2019s noisier areas.Your Best Bet At $40, an Echo Dot is the least expensive gadget you can buy with a seven-mic array.

The team beamed roughly six million pairs per second to separate telescopes on Earth from a satellite. The telescopes were roughly 750 miles apart.Although their practical use is still years away, these so-called entangled particles could one day be harnessed to develop new kinds of communication systems linking quantum computers and quantum sensors. These devices would exploit special properties of quantum physics.A traditional computer stores information in binary bits whose value can be either a 1 or a 0.             Quantum                   machines store data in a more powerful system of information-storing known as a qubit, whose value can be 1 and 0 simultaneously. That special property allows for faster computation.Companies including International Business Machines Corp.,             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Microsoft Corp.       are working toward building quantum computers, which they hope will enable advances in artificial intelligence and life sciences.Interfaced with a quantum device, entangled particles would serve as the connections between machines, aiding in the transfer of information between quantum computers or quantum sensors, for instance.Because sending entangled particles reliably over large distances is a requirement for global quantum-based communication systems, the new work by the Chinese scientists is \u201ca very big advance,\u201d said Thomas Jennewein, a professor at the University of Waterloo\u2019s Institute for Quantum Computing in Canada. Dr. Jennewein wasn\u2019t involved with the research.Scientists have long known that quantum devices like the ones IBM and Google are developing will eventually need to be connected, much like the computers of today are networked to form the internet, according to physicists.But while the entanglement-based links that would weave a quantum web together are much more powerful, they are also much more delicate, presenting a challenge in building the infrastructure on the ground.That is why the backbone of the quantum internet would most likely be built in space, where there is much less turbulence to knock entangled particles out of unison and distort communications between quantum computers in different parts of the world, scientists said.The new work \u201cis a very important step toward a quantum internet,\u201d said Anton Zeilinger, a physicist at the University of Vienna.Researchers across the world are working on building similar satellite-based quantum systems, but the Chinese are the clear leaders currently, said Dr. Zeilinger, who wasn\u2019t involved in the work but is working with the study authors on other research.Among the next challenges: increasing the efficiency of the system. The telescopes detected roughly one entangled pair per second only. That rate is \u201cvery low,\u201d Dr. Zeilinger said.\u201cWe plan to launch satellites at higher orbit, which require us to develop new techniques to further increase the link efficiency, including bigger telescopes\u201d and better tracking systems, said Pan Jianwei, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei and one of the scientists who led the study.Write to Daniela Hernandez at daniela.hernandez@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 14:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-internet-is-one-step-closer-1497550005", "news_title": "Quantum Internet Is One Step Closer", "keywords": "entangled particles,micius satellite,quantum computing,quantum encryption,Alphabet Inc.

In the year ended June 30, 2016, China accounted for almost a third of Australia\u2019s trade, valued at about 150 billion Australian dollars (US$113.8 billion). In comparison, trade flows with the U.S. were worth A$69.2 billion, although the U.S. remains the country\u2019s biggest investor.Australia is one of 55 nations that allow foreign donations to political parties. Its closest intelligence allies\u2014the U.S., U.K., Canada and New Zealand\u2014all restrict donations from foreign interests.While legal, foreign donations have the potential to upend political careers. Last year, Sam Dastyari, a rising star in the opposition Labor Party, stepped down from a party leadership position after acknowledging that he used donations from Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo\u2019s property conglomerate to pay campaign bills totaling thousands of dollars.Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull       has promised to introduce legislation banning foreign donations later this year, but he has so far resisted Labor calls for a political inquiry into Chinese influence by Parliament\u2019s powerful intelligence oversight committee.The issue gained further attention after Australian state ABC television and             Fairfax Media                   reported this month that Labor and Mr. Turnbull\u2019s conservative Liberal-National coalition have received a total of A$6.7 million in donations from Mr. Huang and fellow billionaire Chau Chak Wing.Both sides acknowledge having taken donations and deny any wrongdoing.The government and Labor have traded jabs all week over foreign donations. Foreign Minister       Julie Bishop       faced questions by opponents about her knowledge of a Chinese donor who allegedly set up a foundation to raise funds for her, called the \u201cJulie Bishop Glorious Foundation.\u201d And on Thursday, Ms. Bishop questioned Labor on whether senior lawmakers changed positions on China\u2019s territorial assertions in the South China Sea due to China-linked donations.The ABC-Fairfax report also said that the country\u2019s spy agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, has warned major political parties about receiving donations from Chinese alleged to have Communist Party links.Concerns were also raised by outgoing Australian Defense Secretary       Dennis Richardson,        who accused China in a valedictory speech in May of spying in Australia, as well as widespread interfering in the Chinese-Australian press.Former Director of U.S. National Intelligence James Clapper warned Australia\u2019s government last week that China\u2019s growing influence over Australian politics bore similarities with alleged Russian meddling in American politics.\u201cThe challenge that I think we both face, both the United States and Australia, is the potential jeopardy to the very fundamental underpinnings of our political system,\u201d Mr. Clapper said in a speech here.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 14:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-panic-beijing-envoy-accuses-critics-of-fearmongering-1497516631", "news_title": "\u2018China Panic\u2019: Beijing Envoy Accuses Critics of Fearmongering", "keywords": " australia,china, donors, foreign donations, influence,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Nike Inc.        NKE 0.21%       is cutting more than 1,000 global jobs as part of a restructuring to help the sneaker giant battle slowing sales.The company said Thursday that the layoffs would affect 2% of its global workforce. The Beaverton, Ore., company employed more than 70,000 around the world as of last May, including retail staff.Nike said the changes were part of a strategy to focus on key markets, digital sales and fewer products.

Since then, its global workforce has more than doubled, not including its increased reliance on contract workers, particularly at corporate headquarters. Construction is under way to expand its Beaverton campus, which currently houses more than 10,000 people.But a shift to online shopping and the demise of traditional sporting goods chains such as Sports Authority has pinched the company and U.S. rivalUnder Armour Inc.       Nike is also being challenged by             Adidas AG      , which has recaptured some of the market share it lost in past years.In March, Nike gave a tepid outlook for sales growth this year, citing competition in the U.S. market and a more promotional retail environment. Overall, athletic footwear retail sales have fallen about 1% to $5.4 billion this year through April, according to NPD Group. Nike is expected to report its latest results on June 29.Sales declines have hurt the lucrative basketball-shoe category, which is dominated by Nike. Nike reduced the price for LeBron James\u2019s signature shoes over several years from more than $200 a pair to between $140 and $170. The company also introduced custom kicks for Paul George and Kyrie Irving at more moderate price points, between $100-$140.As part of its restructuring, Nike said it would reduce its geographic divisions from six to four: North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific and Latin America.

It should by all rights have moved from there to Broadway, but \u201c4000 Miles\u201d was successful enough as is: It was taken up by regional theaters throughout America, and Ms. Herzog went on to establish herself as this country\u2019s most gifted under-40 playwright. Now, a month after \u201cMary Jane,\u201d her latest play, was first performed by the Yale Repertory Theatre, \u201c4000 Miles\u201d has been revived by Shakespeare & Company in a production at least as fine as the one that I saw and admired five years ago in New York. It leaves no doubt whatsoever that Ms. Herzog\u2019s work, as they say in the profession, has legs.4000 MilesShakespeare & Company, 70 Kemble St., Lenox, Mass.  $25-$65, 413-637-3353, closes July 16Like her other plays, \u201c4000 Miles\u201d is a small-scale character study reminiscent of Chekhov in its emphasis on personality over plot. At its center is Vera (      Annette Miller      ), a crusty 91-year-old Jewish grandmother who is teetering on the near edge of senility (the most frequently used word in her shrinking vocabulary is \u201cwhaddayacallit\u201d) but has no intention of giving up without a fight. When Leo (      Gregory Boover      ), her spacey 21-year-old grandson, stops in for a visit after a cross-country bicycle trip from Seattle to New York, Vera puts him up for a couple of weeks. That\u2019s pretty much all that happens, though we also meet Bec (      Emma Geer      ), Leo\u2019s earnest ex-girlfriend, and Amanda (      Zo\u00eb Laiz      ), a drunken young Chinese-American woman whom he picks up at a bar and with whom he doesn\u2019t quite manage to have sex.For the most part, though, \u201c4000 Miles\u201d is all about the relationship between Vera, an unrepentant Communist, and Leo, a child of the therapeutic generation who thinks \u201cMarx is cool\u201d and utters sentences like \u201cAnd I was like, first of all, who knows.\u201d Separated by a yawning gulf of age and experience, they manage to meet somewhere in the middle, and the uneasy but nonetheless loving relationship that results proves to be powerfully moving.Unlike \u201cAfter the Revolution,\u201d its 2010 prequel, in which we discover that the widowed Vera\u2019s second husband was a Soviet spy, \u201c4000 Miles\u201d isn\u2019t explicitly political. Ms. Herzog is careful never to be preachy about Vera\u2019s Stalinism: The only time that it comes to the fore is when Amanda sees a book on the shelf and amazes Leo by shrieking, \u201cIs your grandmother like a Communist? I like, hate Communists! The Communists like f\u2014ed China up the ass!...My family didn\u2019t do so well over there, okay? I know I\u2019m like this funny weird girl in platform shoes, but I actually am not joking at all.\u201d That this admission is played for laughs\u2014and gets them\u2014doesn\u2019t diminish its potency. If anything, Amanda\u2019s reaction lands harder because it\u2019s played for laughs, which is typical of Ms. Herzog\u2019s method. Here as always, she is a master of indirection.This revival, staged with poignant, self-effacing delicacy by       Nicole Ricciardi,        is an ideal showcase for the talents of Ms. Miller, a Shakespeare & Company veteran who gives the kind of performance you\u2019ll be talking about days after you see it. Her Vera is tough and unselfconsciously gallant, a woman whose mental powers are failing fast but who stares into the abyss with something very much like glee. I\u2019ve never seen a more vividly detailed stage portrayal of extreme old age\u2014merely to see her get up from a couch is to receive an acting lesson\u2014or a less sentimental one. Everyone else in the cast is superb, with Ms. Laiz, whose part is small but flashy, making the biggest impression. She has the kind of star quality that you notice the moment she walks on stage.\u201c4000 Miles\u201d is being performed in Shakespeare & Company\u2019s 186-seat Elayne P. Bernstein Theatre, which is small enough to put you a stone\u2019s throw from the actors no matter where you\u2019re seated. Between the size of the house and       John McDermott\u2019s       perfectly dressed set, which looks exactly like the kind of modest Greenwich Village apartment in which a woman like Vera would live, you\u2019ll come away feeling as though you\u2019d spent the evening sitting across the room from Vera and Leo.

And it appears that Wednesday\u2019s attack on Republican lawmakers and their associates has proven to be particularly traumatic for the editorial page staff of the             New York Times.       Symptoms exhibited by the afflicted Timesfolk include the making of assertions that have not been established as facts and a refusal to accept those that have.To be sure, the last 24 hours have been highly stressful for progressive leftists. Creating conditions of extreme psychological discomfort are the published writings of suspected shooter James T. Hodgkinson. Among the revelations is that Hodgkinson appears to have accepted as fact virtually the entirety of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 over-the-top rhetoric about U.S. political and economic systems.Perhaps as a coping mechanism, the New York Times now editorializes that Hodgkinson \u201cwas surely deranged, and his derangement had found its fuel in politics.\u201d One can argue that anyone who seeks to assassinate politicians is by definition deranged. Some people might even argue that Hodgkinson\u2019s proposal to lift marginal tax rates to \u201c70% or more\u201d was insane. But Hodgkinson\u2019s mental condition has not been established.The Associated Press reports that as of March 24 of this year, just before Hodgkinson set off for Virginia from his home in Illinois, local law enforcement in that state had no knowledge of any psychiatric issues. That\u2019s when police were called to his house by neighbors concerned about the multiple gunshots he was firing. According to the AP:Various accounts of Hodgkinson paint a picture of a horrible foster parent with a history of mostly minor brushes with the law, but not a raving lunatic. In its news coverage, the New York Times interviews the suspect\u2019s brother:The paper also quotes Charlene Brennan, a real estate agent who said Mr. Hodgkinson had conducted inspections for various of her housing sales: \u201cHe did not come off as an unstable individual. He wasn\u2019t belligerent. He was just kind of a normal guy.\u201dThe Washington Post found another person who didn\u2019t seem to think Hodgkinson was deranged:Hodgkinson\u2019s hometown paper, the Belleville News-Democrat, interviewed Hodgkinson\u2019s neighbor Aaron Meurer:This column could go on citing witnesses who found Hodgkinson to be a more or less normal guy with leftist views but there are even more egregious errors in the Times editorial that demand attention.This column thinks it\u2019s usually unfair to hold political leaders responsible for all the acts and views of their followers. Pick the nuttiest person at any large political rally of either party and you\u2019ll find someone whose comments are not easy to defend. The Times has a different view, and seeks whenever possible to blame shootings on conservative politicians. So it may be understandable that one symptom of its Hodgkinson\u2019s disease is a heightened sensitivity and fear that people on the right will use the Times technique against leftists that the Times admires, or even against the Times itself. Perhaps deciding that the best defense is a good offense, the paper editorialized:UPDATE: In response to criticism, the Times has softened this smear on Mrs. Palin so that it now reads as follows:Because Sarah Palin is a well-known former politician, she\u2019s in a category of people who face enormously high legal barriers to winning libel cases. This is as it should be. We want a vibrant free press to vigorously hold politicians to account and when people step into the political arena they understand that rough treatment from the media is part of the gig. But if Mrs. Palin were just another private citizen, she would sue the New York Times and she would win. As this column\u2019s most celebrated alumnus noted in 2011, politicians of both parties were publishing similar maps about each other. And despite the New York Times\u2019 fondest desires, it turned out Loughner wasn\u2019t a conservative at all but a babbler of nonsense who adopted a mish-mash of views from both the left and the right and whose tastes in literature ran the gamut from Ayn Rand to Karl Marx.If the Times followed its own unfair standards, it would now be blaming Mr. Sanders, not dredging up long-discredited smears against Mrs. Palin. But correcting the Times\u2019 journalistic flaws can wait. The first priority must be treating the victims on its editorial page.***Bottom Stories of the DayQuestions Nobody Is Asking  \u201cAre Democrats in Congress not \u2018fighting\u2019 hard enough?

HAIN 4.01%       has failed to meet a basic requirement for publicly traded companies: regular earnings reports.The organic-food company\u2019s problems started last summer when it discovered revenue irregularities and said it couldn\u2019t release financial results until it analyzed the mistakes.Since it disclosed the issue in August, the onetime darling of Wall Street in the food sector has suffered a 34% drop in its share price as it missed four deadlines for reporting quarterly results.Hain launched an internal evaluation and a separate review by its board of directors with the help of outside counsel. In November, the board review concluded no intentional wrongdoing, but the company said earlier this year that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.On Thursday, Hain said an independent             Nasdaq                   panel granted it another two-week extension to report its numbers from the past year. If the company doesn\u2019t meet the\u00a0June 30\u00a0deadline, the panel can drop the company from the exchange or grant another extension through August. Nasdaq confirmed this process.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom why a seemingly simple revenue recognition issue takes one year to resolve,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale.Hain, which declined to comment, said in a previous statement that it \u201cfully intends to continue to take all steps necessary to regain compliance.\u201dThe Long Island-based company, whose brands include BluePrint juice and Terra vegetable chips, was off to a promising start when founder and Chief Executive       Irwin Simon       started building the conglomerate of natural and organic brands in 1993.The company has since acquired some 55 brands that it sells in about 65 countries, generating $2.7 billion in annual sales, according to its fiscal 2015 earnings report. In the decade leading up to its disclosure of reporting problems last year, Hain\u2019s share price more than tripled, while the S&P 500 index nearly doubled.Pablo Zuanic, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, says the revenue issue likely will have a minimal impact on Hain\u2019s financial results, and that Hain has the potential for long-term sales growth since organic products are increasingly popular in the U.S.Over the years, mainstream rivals such as             General Mills Inc.       and             Kellogg Co.       started acquiring natural and organic brands, taking those products to more stores and winning shelf space from Hain in the U.S. \u201cThis is an exciting category, absolutely attracting a lot of competition as they see conventional categories declines,\u201d Mr. Simon said on Hain\u2019s last earnings conference call, in May 2016.Mr. Simon said at the time that Hain was evolving to keep up with the industry by selling underperforming brands and cutting costs, with the goal of reaching $5 billion in revenue by 2020. Hain said it expected its sales to rise by 9% to 10% for the fiscal year ending in June 30, 2016. But in August, when it delayed its earnings report, the company said it wouldn\u2019t meet that target.Hain said its financial issues were discovered during the quarter that ended June 30. That was shortly after it hired a new head of accounting from outside the company, and less than a year into its financial chief\u2019s promotion to that role.In its disclosure in August, Hain said it was evaluating whether revenue it associated with concessions granted to certain U.S. distributors should have been recorded in the quarter when the products were sold to retailers, rather than when they were shipped to the distributors.In February, when Hain disclosed the SEC investigation, it said it had expanded its internal review to include previously reported quarters.

Article 50 is the formal mechanism for a country to withdraw from the bloc.British Prime Minister       Theresa May      this week has held meetings with officials from the Democratic Unionist Party, seeking to hash out an alliance with the small Northern Irish party following the Conservative Party\u2019s failure to secure a majority in last week\u2019s election.A deal with the DUP, a mostly Protestant political party, would enable Mrs. May to govern with a minority.To get the DUP\u2019s support on key votes in Parliament, Mrs. May will likely have to agree to demands from the party related to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and potentially on domestic policy. But it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what any agreement would contain.An agreement could also complicate the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, where the U.K. and Irish governments act as impartial mediators between the mainly Protestant DUP, which wants the province to be part of the U.K., and the mainly Catholic Sinn F\u00e9in, which wants Northern Ireland to leave the U.K. and join the Republic of Ireland.Gerry Adams,        leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, said he told Mrs. May at a meeting in London on Thursday that she was in breach of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that put an end to three decades of violence.

NVDA -0.52%U.S. government leaders warned in a September 2016 technical meeting convened by the National Security Agency and the DOE that the country was in danger of losing its leadership in supercomputers to China. Governments have long used these systems to crack codes and develop nuclear weapons, and the supercomputers have business purposes such as oil exploration and auto design.The U.S. is in a \u201chorse race\u201d with China, the European Union and Japan as they attempt to outdo one another in processing power, said       Steve Conway,        senior vice president of research at Hyperion Research.The fastest U.S. computer, the Titan, built by Cray, can handle 17,590 trillion calculations per second, or the rough equivalent of 11.6 million iPad Pros running at the same time. It is about the size of a basketball court and is said to use enough power to run a small town.By 2021, the U.S. plans to deliver at least one \u201cexascale\u201d system which performs one quintillion\u2014a billion billion\u2014calculations per second. That would be one year later than when China has said it plans to deploy its first system. Both countries are anticipated to deliver production-ready systems that can solve problems at exascale speeds by as soon as 2023, according to Hyperion Research.In June 2016, China took the top spot in a twice-yearly ranking of the 500 fastest scientific computers. China\u2019s machine, called the Sunway TaihuLight, marked the first time China had taken the top speed ranking without using U.S. semiconductor technology. China also, for the first time, placed more machines than the U.S. on the so-called Top 500 list, by 167 to 165. In a November 2016 ranking, the U.S. and China each had 171 systems on the list.The DOE funding will be used by the tech companies to further the research and development into exascale computers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, for example, last month demonstrated a prototype of a new memory-driven computer called The Machine, which it will further develop with the additional funds by the government. The system is HP Enterprise\u2019s largest research and development program in the history of the company. That computing system is capable of simultaneously working with the data held in every book in the Library of Congress five times over, about 160 million books.Hyperion Research estimates that the price to research, develop and buy a U.S. exascale system will total about $300 million to $500 million per system. Oak Ridge National Laboratory spent about $97 million to buy the Titan supercomputer from Cray. While the U.S. government is typically the first buyer for these systems, the technology advances usually trickle down to other computing products at lower prices.Write to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Funds Race To Beat China in Supercomputers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 14:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-invests-258-million-in-supercomputing-race-with-china-1497549600", "news_title": "U.S. Invests $258 Million in Supercomputing Race With China ", "keywords": " doe, energy department, exascale,supercomputers,supercomputing,Advanced Micro Devices,AMD,Hewlett Packard Enterprise,HPE,International Business Machines,IBM,Intel,INTC,Nvidia,NVDA,Cray,CRAY,research,development,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,energy department,executive branch,computers,consumer electronics,networking,lan,wan hardware,semiconductors,computer services,business,consumer services,computing,computer hardware,industrial electronics,industrial goods,integrated circuits,technology,audio,video,graphics integrated circuits"}, {"content": "ERIN, Wis.\u2014A commercial blimp crashed in a field near the site of\u00a0the U.S. Open golf tournament\u00a0on Thursday, leaving one person injured, according to\u00a0local authorities.The blimp was flying low over Erin Hills Golf Course as thousands\u00a0of spectators watched the first round of the tournament before it went\u00a0down about a mile away.A USGA spokesperson said the blimp was unaffiliated with the\u00a0tournament and its broadcast partners.Tim Guetzke,        a 54-year-old local resident who witnessed the crash,\u00a0said the blimp deflated and descended rapidly before bursting into\u00a0flames when it hit the ground.A Wisconsin State Police officer said the person injured was alert and\u00a0was being airlifted to a hospital.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 13:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blimps-crashes-near-u-s-open-course-one-injured-1497549523", "news_title": "Blimp Crashes Near U.S. Open Course, One Injured ", "keywords": " blimp, erin hills, erin hills golf course,golf, u.s. open, u.s. open golf tournament, usga, wisconsin,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "IN THE THROES of summer heat, few beauty rituals are more masochistic than blow-drying your hair. And with the humidity index at its highest, trying to achieve smooth, straight locks can be futile. But the alternative, air-drying, comes with its own frustrations and risks. The following strategies\u2014easier than daily blow-drying, we swear\u2014make it less of a gamble.Your guide to mastering the lazy summerFirst, the cut makes a difference. Blunt or all-one-length \u2019dos usually need an assist from heat to look good. \u201cA layered style will air-dry quicker and more evenly,\u201d said celebrity hairstylist Chuck Amos. \u201cThe strands that lay on top...are lighter and shorter so air circulates throughout better.\u201d Bonus: Lightweight layers around the face are flattering. Teddi Cranford, a stylist at New York salon White Rose Collective, evocatively calls them \u201cBardot bits.\u201dA skilled stylist can also remove weight according to your hair\u2019s pattern of growth, which helps create a more uniform and manageable air-dry. \u201cWhen you\u2019re air-drying, you\u2019re not manipulating the root of the hair so whatever direction it moves toward is where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d said Wes Sharpton of New York\u2019s Hairstory Studio. This technique can cajole it into behaving.Next, for the best air-dry results, strategize your shower. A moisturizing shampoo and conditioner can reduce frizziness\u2014the bane of many air-driers\u2019 existence. Shampooing your hair less frequently will also help. Alternatively, you can try a conditioning wash, which Mr. Sharpton calls the \u201csmartphone of hair-washing\u201d for its multitasking prowess (delivering all-in-one cleansing, conditioning, detangling and repairing). Mr. Sharpton helped create Hairstory\u2019s product \u201cNew Wash\u201d designed to do all of the above.Applying a leave-in conditioner immediately post-shower, said Mr. Amos, also tames frizz, keeping straight or fine hair light and airy, and leaving curly or wavy hair with curls intact. Try Verb\u2019s Leave-In Mist for fine hair and Living Proof\u2019s Curl Leave-In Conditioner for thicker locks.Another cool tip: Upgrade your towel. To fast-track air-drying\u2014and avoid the frizz that traditional terry towels impart\u2014invest in a microfiber towel like those from Aquis.The final step is applying a styling product and coaxing hair into a desired shape. Alcohol-free mousse is ideal for wavy or curly tresses, while straight and finer textures need just a dab of styling cream rubbed into the ends. Very processed hair can even handle an oil, alone or mixed with styling cream. To encourage \u201cbeachy waves\u201d\u2014as the ne plus ultra of summer styles is reverently known\u2014Mr. Sharpton advises weaving wet hair into a loose braid. For night-owl hair washers, he said, sleeping with a silk scarf wrapped around your head also cuts frizz.Ultimately, you may need to experiment to find what works for you.

The team must vacate any records between Dec. 2010 and July 2014 in which ineligible student-athletes competed, which could include the 2013 championship.Louisville\u2019s interim president Greg Postel said in a statement that the NCAA committee imposed \u201csevere penalties that we believe are excessive,\u201d and said the school would appeal the sanctions.A lawyer for Pitino said he would appeal the findings and the sanctions.The sanctions mark the culmination of a saga that has tarnished the reputations of one of the country\u2019s premier basketball programs and its storied head coach.In October, the NCAA charged multiple current and former men\u2019s basketball staff members, including Pitino, with major rules violations, centering on the school\u2019s former director of basketball operations Andre McGee. McGee paid for \u201cadult entertainment and/or sex acts\u201d for 15 recruiting prospects, three enrolled-student athletes, a friend of a recruit, and two nonscholastic coaches, the NCAA said Thursday. At least seven of the recruits were under age 18 at the time, according to the report.The NCAA said in the report it \u201chas not previously encountered a case like this,\u201d citing on-campus striptease dances, and \u201cacts of prostitution\u201d on and off-campus.McGee, who left Louisville in October 2015, didn\u2019t cooperate with the NCAA investigation, the report said. His lawyer couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The university cooperated with the probe, and has taken disciplinary steps on its own, including a self-imposed postseason ban in 2016.But Louisville had said it would dispute the allegations against Pitino, whom the NCAA accused of failing to monitor McGee. In October, then-acting president Neville Pinto said \u201cI have come to the conclusion that [Pitino] could not have known,\u201d adding: \u201cThis activity was clearly kept from him.\u201dThe NCAA didn\u2019t find that Pitino was aware of the activities, but that he \u201cdid not exercise sufficient oversight\u201d of McGee, a failure of responsibility that the NCAA said amounted to a severe violation meriting his suspension. The sanctions against Pitino, who has coached the team since 2001, reflected the NCAA\u2019s finding that he failed to monitor McGee after placing him in charge of a dorm where the basketball team lived.Pitino told the NCAA that his assistant coaches were responsible for monitoring McGee, a responsibility that the coaches said they weren\u2019t aware of.Pitino will not be allowed to coach the first five conference games next season, and will not be able to take part in practices.\u201cThe finding against Coach Pitino is one of the weakest I\u2019ve ever seen against a head coach,\u201d Pitino\u2019s lawyer, Scott Tompsett said. \u201c[T]he decision hinges on a vaguely-worded rationale about creating an environment in which the violations eventually occurred\u201d but doesn\u2019t identify a \u201csingle specific thing that Coach Pitino should have done...that would have either prevented or detected the illicit activities.\u201dTompsett said the decision broke with the NCAA\u2019s established precedent for head coaches and \u201cimposes a standard of strict liability.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-15 13:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/louisvilles-rick-pitino-suspended-five-games-for-sex-scandal-1497546633", "news_title": "Louisville\u2019s Rick Pitino Suspended Five Games for Sex Scandal ", "keywords": "college basketball,louisville,louisville cardinals,ncaa,pitino,rick pitino,University of Louisville,basketball,political,general news,college sports,crime,legal action,probation,home detention,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The U.S. Treasury Department will auction $97 billion in securities next week, comprising $53 billion in new debt and $44 billion in previously sold debt.

But it\u2019s the studio that\u2019s doing the milking in \u201cCars 3,\u201d and the pleasures are modest at best. (      Brian Fee       directed from a screenplay by       Kiel Murray,       Bob Peterson       and       Mike Rich.      )This time the former hotshot, Lightning McQueen (voiced by       Owen Wilson      ), is a faded champion who yearns to win one more race. An unlikely hero for young audiences, Lightning is also an intriguing one\u2014a living legend and incipient geezer struggling to compete against a new breed of race cars represented by Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), a high-tech marvel with a formidably low drag coefficient. The computer animation is remarkable, just as we\u2019ve come to expect from Pixar features\u2014all those gorgeous colors and hurtling objects going round and round\u2014and round and round and round. Yet the film\u2019s drag coefficient starts to climb when Lightning\u2019s story is intertwined with that of a gifted young rookie, Cruz Ramirez (      Cristela Alonzo      ). Having missed her own shot at racing, Cruz is determined to inspire Lightning as his trainer.There\u2019s more to the relationship than that\u2014a process of mutual inspiration, reciprocal support and, sometimes affectingly, a passing of the baton from one generation to the next. (And from Anglo to Hispanic, although Lightning is painted cherry red and Cruz is a lovely mustard yellow.) But the script is full of             Disney                  -esque motivational slogans\u2014don\u2019t fear failure, be afraid of not having the chance, seize your chance when you can, look for new opportunities you never knew were there. And, paradoxically, the story slows most noticeably when the emphasis is on speed at a cutting-edge training center. That\u2019s where Cruz helps her aging student sharpen his rusty skills in a program that differs little from countless other training sequences, and where we\u2019re expected to thrill to the spectacle of Lightning coping, at a bizarre level of narrative abstraction, with the head-spinning challenges of a virtual-reality simulator.That reference to the narrative should be taken loosely; it\u2019s more like a succession of pit stops in a film that meanders all over the landscape to rural race tracks, and to one extremely muddy demolition derby. The script declines to explore Jackson Storm\u2019s technology. In an era where race cars\u2014and even passenger cars\u2014are prodigies of complexity, Lightning\u2019s ultramodern rival is seen entirely from the outside, with no sense of the soul in the elegant machine.\u201cCars 3\u201d does examine, albeit briefly, some of the strategies Cruz teaches her aging champ so he can compensate for slower reflexes and diminished fire in his cylinders. But much of the latter section becomes a trip down memory lane as Lightning searches for his old pal Smokey (      Chris Cooper      ), and for further inspiration from the memory of his role model and mentor Doc Hudson. (It\u2019s eerie to hear       Paul Newman\u2019s       voice purring from the past.) The first film wasn\u2019t bad, though it had its lapses. \u201cCars 2,\u201d an aberration, was readily forgotten.

Two services that link doctors and patients by video chat. A cybersecurity company that keeps hackers out of cars.These startups are part of the eclectic mix that makes up The Wall Street Journal\u2019s ranking of 25 technology companies to watch\u2014companies that show signs of becoming emerging leaders in some of the most dynamic parts of the tech industry.The Journal 25 have all attracted the attention of the tech community, as well as cash from venture-capital investors. They have had growing workforces and, in some cases, have founders with prior success launching a company. They are also young\u2014all founded in the past six years\u2014and far from billion-dollar valuations. (See the full list.)Looking at emerging companies provides insight into technologies that may have influence more broadly on business and markets, says       Venky Ganesan,        managing director at Menlo Ventures, a venture-capital firm. \u201cYou get insights into the big trends. You see the disruptions that are going to happen,\u201d Mr. Ganesan says. For investors, he says, \u201csometimes it\u2019s equally important to know who is going to lose and who is going to win.\u201dVIEW InteractiveThe starting point of the ranking was a survey of technology-industry watchers and experts. Nominations were taken from prior attendees of technology conferences run by The Wall Street Journal and Founders Forum, a London firm that organizes events for a network of tech entrepreneurs and investors. (The Journal and Founders Forum have a business relationship.) Survey participants were asked to identify young companies that are innovative, growing fast and expected to continue to grow fast.A data analysis was conducted on the nominated firms to assess their founders\u2019 experience, the investments the companies have attracted, the prior success of their biggest investors, the growth of their workforces, and the buzz they have begun to generate. Equal weight was assigned to these five criteria to calculate overall scores for the companies. (See the full methodology.)No. 1 on the list was Hollar Inc., a Commerce, Calif., company that runs a website that sells low-price household goods. It was the idea of       Brian Lee,        who co-founded Honest Co. with actress       Jessica Alba,        and       David Yeom,        another Honest Co. veteran. Mr. Lee, who stepped down as Honest\u2019s CEO earlier this year, is executive chairman of Hollar. Mr. Yeom is its chief executive officer.The ranking methodology rewards companies founded by people who have founded other companies, particularly if those other companies went on to go public or be acquired. There were multiple such cases for Hollar. For example, another founder,       Thanh Khuu,        president and chief technology officer, was a co-founder of an online consignment company that was later acquired.David Singer,        managing partner of Maverick Ventures in San Francisco, says the founders\u2019 background is the most important factor he considers when deciding whether to make an investment. \u201cThat is where we spend most of our thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are really dependent on this person. It is so much about this person.\u201dThe ranking methodology also gives founders credit if they have had high-level experience at other venture-backed companies. Mr. Singer says prior experience makes the transition from an idea to an operating company more effective, in terms of building an executive team and making decisions.\u201cWe are interested in founders who are the product. The most persuasive people are people who might not even have wanted to be founders but were frustrated that there was this problem and no one was fixing it,\u201d Mr. Singer says. Before becoming a venture-capital investor, Mr. Singer himself was the founder of three companies.Maverick Ventures is an investor in the No. 2 company in the ranking, Collective Health Inc., San Francisco, which allows companies and employees to manage health-care information. It is one of four health-care companies in the ranking, including two that allow patients to see a doctor over a video app: Doctor on Demand Inc., based in San Francisco, and Babylon Healthcare Services Ltd., based in London.The expertise of the venture-capital firms that sit on a startup\u2019s board is factored in the scores companies received in the ranking. Credit is given to companies for having on their boards VC firms that have made sizable investments and that have invested in companies that have later gone public or been sold. The analysis used data from Dow Jones VentureSource.Clever Inc., the No. 4 company on the list, benefited from having on its board representatives from Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners, two large VC firms. Clever is a San Francisco company that developed a way for schools to organize the many software applications that are used by teachers and students.Lightspeed also is on the board of two other ranked companies: Hollar and Zola Inc., a New York company that operates an online wedding registry. Zola has traditional registry functions plus other features such as a way to manage when gifts are delivered, and a way for couples to collect monetary gifts for things like a honeymoon or down payment on a house.Board members offer advice to startup executives and assist in recruiting and fundraising, says Mr. Ganesan of Menlo Ventures. The names on a company\u2019s board also assist in making sales to business customers. \u201cIf you are at             J.P. Morgan                   and are looking at a cybersecurity startup, you want to know who invested in it,\u201d he says. Knowing that investors put money into a company gives business customers more confidence in the startup\u2019s products.Four cybersecurity companies are in the ranking, including two with headquarters in Tel Aviv: Argus Cyber Security, which makes products to counter attacks on systems in cars and commercial vehicles, and Illusive Networks, which creates cyberdefenses by tricking intruders with fake data.Dharmesh Thakker,        a general partner at Battery Ventures, credits the prominence of cybersecurity in the startup world to broader shifts in technology. As more people use mobile devices, store information online and use other internet-connected devices and appliances\u2014the so-called Internet of Things\u2014new types of online threats emerge, driving investment in cybersecurity startups.Consumer hardware and gadgets are well-represented on the list, including two companies that create connected devices to manage home security, August Home Inc. and Ring, which formerly used the name Bot Home Automation. Also in the ranking is Eero Inc., which makes a system to improve home Wi-Fi signals; Tile Inc., which makes a device to help keep track of everyday things such as keys and the TV remote; and Jibo Inc., which is developing a robot.Jibo\u2019s robot, whose release has been delayed, will become available before the end of 2017, says a company spokesman. The device will perform tasks similar to those done by             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s       Alexa and             Apple Inc.\u2019s       Siri. It will recognize faces and voices and be more interactive than the others, the spokesman says. A price hasn\u2019t been announced.The staying power of new consumer-device startups can be uncertain. \u201cThese are either home runs or strikeouts,\u201d says Mr. Ganesan. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of singles and doubles.\u201d The longevity of consumer-hardware startups is enhanced if the company has a recurring revenue stream. For example, he says a service subscription tied to Ring devices provides recurring revenue. Menlo Ventures isn\u2019t an investor in the company.Whether a disruptive startup continues to grow or fades away often comes down to whether it continues to evolve, says Mr. Thakker of Battery Ventures. Many startups \u201cthink the IPO is the end goal and they stop innovating. Companies that don\u2019t innovate tend to end up getting disrupted themselves by another startup.\u201dMr. Pettit is a Wall Street Journal editor in New York.

Surely not, but it can nourish the soul when the parts of life that are supposed to make sense refuse to do so. \u201cLost in Paris\u201d is nonsensical by design, a comedy of the absurd that\u2019s always entertaining and occasionally pure.The filmmakers, who have made other features in a burlesque vein, play two of the three main roles.       Fiona Gordon       is Fiona, a spinster librarian of elaborate clumsiness; she travels from Canada to Paris, pack on back, to find her Aunt Martha, a former dancer who, at the age of 88, is in some sort of distress.       Dominique Abel       is Dom, a classic clochard\u2014a bum living on the banks of the Seine\u2014with a gift for comic malice that he may have inherited from       Michel Simon\u2019s       Boudu, the hero of       Jean Renoir\u2019s       \u201cBoudu Saved From Drowning.\u201d Aunt Martha, a blithe spirit who doesn\u2019t know the meaning of distress, is played by       Emmanuelle Riva,        who starred in the cryptic \u201cHiroshima Mon Amour\u201d in 1959, got an Oscar nomination for her stirring performance in the 2012 \u201cAmour,\u201d and died shortly before \u201cLost in Paris\u201d was released in France.Freewheeling as it is, the film does have a plot. Fiona\u2019s search for her aunt leads to lunatic misadventures, many of them provoked by the lecherous Dom, and an interlocking structure reveals new perspectives by revisiting several incidents. The film also functions as a compendium of comic styles. Ms. Gordon and Mr. Abel draw deftly from       Jacques Tati,       Charlie Chaplin       and       Pierre Etaix,        with a bit of \u201cNapoleon Dynamite\u201d to push things further off-center, plus a yellow-flower tribute to the peerless mime       Jean-Louis Barrault       and a shout-out to Ren\u00e9 Clair\u2019s \u201c\u00c0 Nous la Libert\u00e9.\u201d (The eclectic sound track includes a Shostakovich jazz suite and Kate and       Anna McGarrigle\u2019s       wonderful \u201cThe Swimming Song.\u201d)Still, the best way to watch \u201cLost In Paris\u201d is without expecting anything but a succession of sight gags, pratfalls and antic riffs, some of them pleasantly clumsy, just like Fiona, but several of them close to sublime: a surreal tango aboard a floating restaurant; a charming bit of slapstick involving a ladder and the Eiffel Tower; and, most memorably, a little dance for four feet in close-up that leads to a full-out dance for the owners of the feet, Aunt Martha and her old vaudeville partner, Norman, who is played by the great       Pierre Richard.

Following the European rebuke, U.S. senators moved forward in a 98-2 vote on Thursday to advance the measure, as part of a larger sanctions bill.The Senate sanctions package would impose new restrictions on Russian actors linked to human-rights abuses, arms sales to the Syrian government or malicious cyberattacks on behalf of the Russian government.What particularly angered Austria and Germany, however, is a section of the bill that would allow President       Donald Trump       to sanction some companies that participate in the construction of Russian energy export pipelines.\u201cWe cannot accept a threat of extraterritorial sanctions, illegal under international law, against European companies that participate in developing European energy supplies,\u201d Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Kern said. \u201cEurope\u2019s energy supply is Europe\u2019s business, not that of the United States of America.\u201dThe Senate bill could have an impact on the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany underwater pipeline, which would double Russia\u2019s gas export capacity to Germany. A\u00a0consortium of five European companies\u00a0has pledged to provide up to\u00a0\u20ac4.75 billion ($5.3 billion) in long-term financing to the Russian-backed venture.Berlin and Vienna supported the U.S. State Department\u2019s efforts to change the legislation, Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Kern said\u2014a rare instance in which Europeans have been in agreement with the Trump administration on a foreign policy debate.The legislation, they added, would have a \u201cvery negative\u201d impact on European-American ties and damage Western efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis. The bill\u2019s stipulation that the U.S. government should \u201cshould prioritize the export of United States energy resources in order to create American jobs\u201d drew a rebuke from Berlin and Vienna.\u201cIt would not only be highly unfortunate, but also damaging to the efficacy of our position on the Ukraine conflict, if we do not act together and instead irrelevant considerations such as the economic interests of the U.S. in gas exports won the upper hand,\u201d Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Kern said.A Nord Stream 2 spokesman said the company currently saw no impact on the project as a result of the legislation.\u201cThe bill makes clear that the objective is about American jobs and commercial projects being pursued at the expense of prosperity and jobs in Europe,\u201d the Nord Stream 2 spokesman said.EU officials declined to comment.Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 13:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-austria-chide-u-s-senates-russia-sanctions-bill-1497545677", "news_title": "Germany, Austria Chide U.S. Senate\u2019s Russia Sanctions Bill", "keywords": "crimea,eu,russia natural gas,russia sanctions,trump administration,ukraine,European Union,U.S. Senate,Sigmar Gabriel,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,energy"}, {"content": "Sally Hawkins gives everything she\u2019s got to \u201cMaudie.\u201d She plays a fictionalized version of       Maud Lewis,        a Canadian folk artist who, in the tiny, primitive house she shared with her fishmonger husband in Nova Scotia, produced radiant paintings that have been inevitably, and favorably, compared with the work of Grandma Moses. (Her husband, Everett, is played by       Ethan Hawke.      ) A tiny, stooped woman whose body had been ravaged by juvenile arthritis, Maudie struggles to assert herself as an artist while she lives in willing enslavement to her inarticulate and unpredictably brutal husband. This film, directed by       Aisling Walsh       from a screenplay by Sherry White, paints their marriage as a love affair that evolves slowly but steadily, if painfully.

SNAP 1.63%       is in a tricky spot. To boost revenue, the 6-year-old company will ultimately need more of the tailored packages of pictures and videos, called Stories, advertisers prize. Expanding its offering using only editors could be a slow and costly effort, but letting computers do the work would eliminate the human touch that has helped Snapchat stand out.Ads accounted for nearly all of Snap\u2019s $149.6 million in revenue in the latest quarter, which surged from a year earlier but declined sequentially for the first time.The Venice, Calif.-based company gets ad revenue from several areas, including publisher content and sponsorships. While Stories is a smaller share\u2014it could amount to more than a quarter of ad revenue this year,             Barclays                   PLC estimates\u2014it is the lever Snap has the greatest control over.Snap created Stories four years ago to take advantage of the steady stream of pictures and videos people send in private, disappearing messages called Snaps. By allowing users to stitch Snaps together into a narrative arc that could be shared publicly for 24 hours, Stories showed how Snapchat could be more than just a messaging app.More important, it gave Snap a place to showcase ads. Unlike             Facebook Inc.       and             Twitter Inc.,       Snapchat doesn\u2019t have a content feed optimized by algorithms. And it doesn\u2019t show traditional ads with most of the 3 billion Snaps.Facebook, by comparison, pulled in $7.86 billion in ad revenue in the first quarter, driven by ads placed in the news feeds of its 1.28 billion daily users. Twitter had $474 million in ad revenue and 328 million monthly users in the first quarter.With its stock falling more than 25% since the company\u2019s first earnings report and briefly touching its IPO price of $17 on Thursday, Snap is under pressure from investors to prove its new form of advertising will grow. \u201cSnap might be able to scale with human editors, but it will be labor intensive and won\u2019t make much money,\u201d said       Pedro Domingos,        a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington who wrote a book on machine learning.In the first quarter, Snap editors created more than 450 Stories, called Our Stories, chief strategist       Imran Khan       said on an earnings call. While Snapchat\u2019s 166 million daily users also can create Stories that carry ads, those don\u2019t have the ability to go viral. Users see Stories from editors and people they follow, and Snapchat has no equivalent to a \u201cshare\u201d or \u201cretweet.\u201dSnap doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its process for curating Stories, but former employees say about 50 people scan videos\u2014as many as 100,000 a day\u2014to piece them into narratives and weed out inappropriate content. Workers try to focus on positive Stories, they say.At a time when competitors including             Alphabet Inc.\u2019sYouTube, Twitter and Facebook are grappling with how to handle inappropriate material, curation lets Snap position its content as high quality.\u201cThere is a degree of safety for brands with Snap\u2019s human curation,\u201d said       Chris Paradysz,        co-chief executive of the digital-marketing firm PMX Agency, which has purchased ads on Snapchat for its clients. \u201cHow that scales is everybody\u2019s head-scratcher.\u201dSnap says it is committed to human curation, and the company is testing new software to help editors more quickly and efficiently craft Stories, former employees say. Editors will remain critical to how Snap presents stories in the more prominent \u201cDiscover\u201d section of the app, a spokeswoman said.Still, Snap has hired people with machine-learning expertise, a person familiar with the matter said. And since 2014 Snap has filed for patents related to automated content curation, according to research firm CBInsights.Last year, Snap tested tools that help create Stories using algorithms. The company isn\u2019t planning on including ads in algorithm-created content, a spokeswoman said, adding that the company doesn\u2019t speculate about future plans.During the first phase of testing, algorithms flagged when users in New York created a burst of Snaps after a statue of       Donald Trump       appeared in August. Editors then culled the content into a Story, according to a person who saw the tool in action.A later version of the tool did the work of pulling Snaps together for editors to evaluate. Stories sometimes contained coherent narratives, but often were nonsensical, former employees said.In March, Snap pushed the experiment further forward, creating a Stories search tool that uses machine learning to scrape information in posts to show users relevant content.

They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that.\u201dFrom context, it was clear that \u201cfuzz\u201d meant \u201cambiguity\u201d or \u201cuncertainty.\u201d But there was, in fact, some uncertainty about this Comey-ism: Merriam-Webster admitted on Twitter, \u201cWe\u2019re a little fuzzy on Comey\u2019s usage.\u201d (\u201cFuzz\u201d was one of the top look-ups on Merriam-Webster\u2019s online dictionary during the hearing, along with other words like \u201cprobative,\u201d \u201clordy\u201d and \u201crecuse.\u201d)\u201cFuzz\u201d goes back to the 17th century in English, probably formed by taking the \u201cy\u201d off the adjective \u201cfuzzy.\u201d \u201cFuzzy\u201d originally meant \u201cspongy\u201d (related to the Low German word \u201cfussig\u201d), before it came to describe things covered with light, fluffy particles or fibers, like the surface of a peach.By the 18th century, \u201cfuzzy\u201d took on the more metaphorical meaning of \u201cblurred, indistinct,\u201d eventually extended to imprecise thoughts or expressions. Meanwhile, the noun \u201cfuzz\u201d also got associated with blurriness, used as early as 1889 for out-of-focus photography. (\u201cFuzz\u201d also became slang for \u201cpolice\u201d by the 1920s, though etymologists are still fuzzy on its origins.)More technical meanings of \u201cfuzz\u201d emerged in the 20th century, often having to do with visual or audio distortion. The buzzy tone of sonic \u201cfuzz\u201d became a popular effect on electric guitars in the 1960s, achieved with a distortion device known as a \u201cfuzz box.\u201d\u201cFuzz\u201d also fuzzed up radar screens, bringing the term into use in military and aerospace contexts. The Comey-esque usage of \u201cfuzz\u201d for \u201cuncertainty\u201d was used as early as 1990, when former NASA administrator       James M. Beggs       owned up to hiring a contractor that manufactured a defective mirror for the Hubble Space Telescope. \u201cThere is no fuzz on that as we say in the trade,\u201d Mr. Beggs said by way of apology.In 2000, in an interview with the Denver Post, Noel Hinners, vice president of flight systems for             Lockheed Martin, made a similar mea culpa about the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter: \u201cWe made mistakes. No fuzz on that.\u201d And in 2003, NASA administrator       Sean O\u2019Keefe      warned that the report on the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster would pull no punches, by saying that the report \u201cis going to have no fuzz on it, no gloves.\u201dThe \u201cno fuzz\u201d turn of phrase extended beyond NASA, becoming \u201can intelligence community term,\u201d according to       Jim Wright,        a progressive blogger who served as a chief warrant officer in the U.S. Navy.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Kim Eckart.U.S. multinational companies\u2014especially in technology and finance\u2014are bringing in talent from around the world and changing the face of workplaces and communities. In Silicon Valley, where my firm is located, two-thirds of workers in computer and mathematical fields are foreign-born.For financial advisers, this trend brings the opportunity to gain clients. But it also brings challenges that advisers must be prepared to handle.Foreign-born workers can have a complicated financial picture because they may have held positions in more than one location. It\u2019s not uncommon for these workers to own multiple residences and maintain several old retirement and bank accounts. It\u2019s important, then, for advisers to educate themselves on the complexities of taxes and real estate and possibly consult or refer to the client to an accountant who is well-versed in these areas.Depending on where the client is from, they may be more comfortable with investing in, for example, real estate rather than stocks. So when it comes to stocks, retirement accounts and other investments, you are in a position to educate the client. And the first step for many clients is to help them understand our retirement system.In many places outside the U.S., workers invest in a defined-benefit system. The U.S., however, is more reliant on a defined-contribution system and the responsibility of retirement rests with the individual. So clients often need to be educated on the role of stocks and what a 401(k) is, as well as other investment tools such as individual retirement accounts, Roth IRAs and \u201c529\u201d college-savings plans. It\u2019s generally the employer\u2019s job to provide information specific to their 401(k) plan, but it\u2019s important for advisers to help international clients properly allocate their plan balances into investments that diversify their assets globally. Making sense of all this can be daunting to someone from another country.Workers sometimes arrive in the U.S. and are unsure whether the stay is permanent. But after a few years, as they achieve some success, they might decide to stay and pursue a green card. If they decide to stay, they will need to revisit their other assets outside the U.S.; it\u2019s generally a good idea to liquidate those investments and bring them here.Many large investment firms avoid working with foreign people in the U.S.\u2014and with Americans living abroad\u2014because of the perceived risk that their advisers may not be adequately trained to advise those clients. But if you\u2019re willing to dive into the complexities, you will be serving a community that tends to be well educated, interesting and appreciative.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 12:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/underserved-client-class-foreign-born-workers-1497544878", "news_title": "Underserved Client Class: Foreign-Born Workers", "keywords": "Andrew Fisher,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "More investors are betting against big tech stocks these days. The biggest one of all is drawing an especially bold gamble.Short sellers have been targeting             Apple Inc.,        AAPL 0.63%Amazon.com                   and Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       over the past six weeks.

Subscribe to the podcast.Those bets were coming in before a selloff on big tech stocks began in earnest last week. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, along with             Microsoft                   and             Facebook,       are the five largest stocks in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. They also accounted for 41% of the index\u2019s gain before the recent selloff. With fresh selling on Thursday, those five are now down more than 5%, on average, from last Thursday\u2019s close.But not all short bets are created equal. Apple in particular is unusual given both the timing\u2014a few months ahead of a major new iPhone launch\u2014and its low valuation relative to the others. Apple trades at just over 14 times forward earnings, while Alphabet and Microsoft are at 26 times and 21 times, respectively.The company\u2019s huge size also limits short sellers\u2019 sway; short interest represents just over 1% of Apple\u2019s public float, according to FactSet.But short sellers are still taking a special interest. The world\u2019s most valuable company is now the world\u2019s third-largest short position by market value behind             Alibaba                   and             Tesla,       S3 head of research       Ihor Dusaniwsky       noted.The reasons why make sense. Unlike its big tech peers, Apple is highly dependent on a single product\u2014the iPhone\u2014for the bulk of its revenue and earnings. That product has become highly cyclical. Sales of the iPhone fell in Apple\u2019s latest fiscal year and are expected to be relatively flat in the current one as the past two versions have offered only incremental changes and smartphone users hold on to their devices longer.A big upgrade cycle is expected for the next device coming out this fall, but that rightfully raises worries about what happens to Apple\u2019s stock following that launch.The shares have seen two big selloffs over the last five years following big iPhone launches.Apple ended up losing more than one-third of its market value after the stock hit a peak in early 2015, driven by the highly successful iPhone 6 launch.Shorting Apple now still seems premature given that the stock is likely to continue to net gains leading up to the next launch.

A government investigative agency\u2019s raids earlier this month on the founders of New Delhi Television, a prominent private broadcaster, have triggered a fierce debate in the country over this perennial question.Critics accuse the government of       Narendra Modi       of fostering an environment that makes ordinary journalists afraid or unable to do their jobs. Many in the media cannot remember a time when they had to watch their step so carefully.To the prime minister\u2019s vocal fans, especially on social media, this is hogwash. They view much of the elite English-language media as ethically challenged and unremittingly hostile to the government.While some of the more excitable crusaders for press freedom may exaggerate the problem\u2014India is in no danger of becoming another Russia or Turkey any time soon\u2014on the whole they are more right than wrong. On Mr. Modi\u2019s watch, the space to criticize the government or the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party without fear of retaliation has indeed shrunk. If the action against NDTV is a portent, then in the run-up to the 2019 elections this space may shrink even more.The government argues that its tussle with NDTV founders Radhika and       Prannoy Roy       has nothing do with media freedom. According to investigators, the Roys violated the law by obtaining a partial waiver of interest on a 2008 loan worth about 3.5 billion rupees (about $70 million at the time) from private bank ICICI.In anonymous leaks to sympathetic media outlets, alleged government officials suggest they may also pursue more serious charges, including money laundering and concealment of income. NDTV denies any wrongdoing, and accuses the government of \u201can unsubstantiated, politically motivated and vindictive campaign\u201d against it.The government\u2019s argument appears shaky. In India, large borrowers owe government-owned banks many billions of dollars. That the Central Bureau of Investigation\u2019s case hinges on a nine-year-old loan repaid to a private bank seems to suggest, at the very least, an odd set of priorities.The move against NDTV comes against the backdrop of a media landscape that has tilted noticeably toward the government. Prominent news channels now spend more time attacking the enfeebled opposition than scrutinizing the government. The front pages of several major newspapers increasingly read like official press releases. The burden of holding the government accountable for its missteps has largely shifted to opinion writers and a clutch of online publications with far less reach than TV or newspapers.For the most part, Mr. Modi eschews interviews and press conferences, preferring to communicate directly through             Facebook,Twitter                   and a regular radio address. His junior foreign minister,       V.K. Singh,        has helped popularize the pejorative term \u201cpresstitute\u201d to describe journalists.The BJP pays lip service to the idea of a free press, but one that knows its place. In party President       Amit Shah\u2019s       formulation, criticizing the government remains permissible but criticizing the nation is out of bounds.Earlier this year, the party appointed as its spokesperson       Tajinder Bagga,        notorious for a televised 2011 assault on a left-wing lawyer and anticorruption activist he deemed too sympathetic to Kashmiri separatists. \u201cHe try to break my Nation, i try to break his head,\u201d Mr. Bagga tweeted at the time.Mr. Modi\u2019s supporters tend to dismiss concerns voiced by journalists as much ado about nothing. And it\u2019s certainly true that, unlike many developing countries, India remains a place where you can call the prime minister an imbecile without facing a lawsuit or a midnight knock on the door from a thug. Government critics are feted at literary festivals and regularly published in the most prestigious op-ed pages. They may lose access to top officials, but they aren\u2019t queuing up for asylum in Sweden or languishing in prison.Moreover, most of the Indian media\u2019s problems predate Mr. Modi\u2019s 2014 election. The owners of most major TV channels and newspapers juggle other business interests as well. They must negotiate a plethora of opaque laws and regulations that would make them vulnerable to government pressure. Many outlets also rely on government advertising to stay afloat. All this ensures that Indian journalism maintains a long tradition of kissing up to power rather than questioning it.Things have nonetheless deteriorated on Mr. Modi\u2019s watch. This government is particularly ruthless about cutting off access to reporters it deems unfriendly. The BJP also appears to at least tacitly encourage social-media lynch mobs that go after any journalist seen to be stepping out of line. No other major political party appoints trolls to responsible positions.It may still be easier to practice journalism in Mr. Modi\u2019s India than in       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       Russia or       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       Turkey. But for a country that prides itself as the world\u2019s largest democracy, that isn\u2019t saying much.Mr. Dhume is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a columnist for WSJ.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 12:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/modis-message-to-the-media-1497544087", "news_title": "Modi\u2019s Message to the Media", "keywords": " freedom of the press,india, narendra modi, ndtv, presstitute,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Jurors in the Bill Cosby sexual-assault trial said Thursday they were deadlocked on their fourth day of deliberations, raising the possibility of a mistrial in the high-profile case outside Philadelphia.Judge Steven O\u2019Neill ordered the jury of seven men and five women to continue trying to reach a verdict after they sent a note to him, after roughly 30 hours of deliberations, saying they couldn't come to a consensus on any of the counts against Mr. Cosby.Prosecutors charged Mr.\u00a0Cosby, 79,\u00a0with three counts of aggravated indecent sexual assault and he faces up to 10 years in prison.Andrea Constand, a former\u00a0Temple University\u00a0employee,\u00a0accused the 79-year-old entertainer of drugging and molesting her after inviting her to his home in 2004.

Driven by foreign-government interventionist policies, this overcapacity has led to high levels of dumped and subsidized imports and the loss of nearly 14,000 jobs.The steel industry has relied on our trade laws to address the impact of these unfairly traded imports, and that has provided some relief. However, high volumes of steel continue to enter the U.S. market from countries that aren\u2019t subject to the relief, or where it has been ineffective or from companies that ship their steel through third countries to evade the laws.The American steel industry is among the most environmentally sustainable and technologically advanced in the world. We have substantially reduced our energy usage and led the development of industry innovations\u2014like advanced high-strength steel. If not countered effectively, the injurious dumping of steel will continue to cost thousands of good paying jobs, discourage new investment in manufacturing and threaten the very viability of an industry that built this nation and remains the strong backbone of our economy and security.Thomas J. GibsonPresident and CEOAmerican Iron and Steel InstituteWashingtonIs breaking the law justified as long as it benefits consumers? The point of applying tariffs isn\u2019t to make foreign steel more expensive to protect a small number of American steelworkers, as your editorial claims. Tariffs are a means of enforcing the rules of international trade for the sake of more than one million American jobs that depend on a viable steel industry.We would all like a global trading system that is truly free, one in which the theory of comparative advantage is a reality, with each nation exporting what it does best. We\u2019re not there yet. Instead, we have managed trade\u2014a system governed by trade agreements and rules that participants agree to follow.

Morgan offers fathers 16 weeks of paid leave after a child\u2019s birth if they will be the baby\u2019s primary caregiver during that time. Non-primary caregivers receive two weeks of paid parental leave. Biological mothers and other primary caregivers get 16 weeks.Derek Rotondo, who works as a fraud investigator in the bank\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio, filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission arguing that, by designating biological mothers as the default primary caregivers, J.P. Morgan\u2019s parental leave policy violates federal and state laws that prohibit employers from discriminating against employees based on gender or gender-based stereotypes. He was joined in his charge by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Ohio.A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman said the bank is reviewing the charge.J.P. Morgan last year expanded its parental leave policy to 16 weeks from 12 weeks for primary caregivers and to two weeks from one week for nonprimary caregivers.The EEOC reviews all charges and can decide to initiate a lawsuit or settlement talks on the worker\u2019s behalf. In most instances, the EEOC declines to do that, but tells workers they have a right to file a private suit against their employer.According to the charge, Mr. Rotondo requested paternity leave before the birth of his second child earlier this month, and was told by the bank\u2019s human-resources representatives that, to be eligible for the paid time off, he would need to prove his wife had returned to work or was medically incapable of caring for the child. Mr. Rotondo\u2019s wife is a special-education teacher who is on summer break. According to the charge, J.P. Morgan employees must take the parental leave immediately after the birth of the child.J.P.

And that\u2019s just as well, because consumers remain wary of the technology. According to a Deloitte study released in January, three out of four Americans said they did not trust autonomous vehicles. But two out of three said they would be interested if the technology were proven safe.\u201cTo win consumers\u2019 trust,\u201d wrote Deloitte vice chairman       Craig Giffi,        \u201cauto makers will need to integrate limited self-driving and advanced-safety features into new product offerings steadily over time\u2026.\u201dThat, as of Summer 2017, is where we are, with car makers rolling out a limited palette of driver-support technologies that reduce driver workload to a minimum. And isn\u2019t reducing workload what summer is all about?The leader in driver-assisted loafing is Tesla. The Silicon Valley car maker rocked the world in 2015 when it introduced Autopilot, a suite of functions, including Autosteer, that keep the car in the center of the lane even if the road twists and turns. The Tesla also uses dynamic, all-speed cruise control that can manage stop-and-go traffic, as well as emergency braking, lane-changing and side-collision warning/prevention. Together these features comprise a rudimentary highway auto-piloting function. Tesla still requires drivers to hold on to the wheel and pay attention. The company has had a couple of cars crash while in Autopilot mode.Never one to hedge a deadline, Tesla CEO       Elon Musk       has said his company would have fully autonomous cars on the road by the end of the decade. And here it\u2019s good to note how much Tesla\u2019s human-factors engineering pioneered other kinds of bum laziness. With the key fob in the pocket of your favorite frayed cargo pants, you merely walk up to your Tesla and the door latch pops up as you reach for it. By the time you sit down, the car is already started; just put your foot on the brake, select your direction, D or R, and go.The Tesla experience changed automobiles, particularly the operative definition of \u201ceasy.\u201d In your typical well-heeled sedan, be it             Audi                   or             BMW,       Cadillac or Infiniti, the headlights come on automatically and dim so as not to blind an oncoming car. Mercedes uses face-feature algorithms and temperature sensors to detect fatigue. The car will find a hotel for you before you realize you need a good lay down.Of course, we all know the human burden that is parking. The good news is that most auto makers now offer parking-assistance systems that will identify available parking places\u2014in the case of Manhattan, they are all in Queens\u2014and then take over like a harbor pilot, gently easing the car into the spot, nose-in, nose-out, parallel or, in the case of Tesla, perpendicular.Mercedes-Benz is the first major auto maker to hard-wire their cars for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) communications that would enable a real-time, cloud-computed model of city streets and available parking in the area. When you put the two technologies together\u2014autonomous driving and self-parking\u2014the mixture practically explodes with possibilities that could transform civil architecture and city planning. Imagine automobiles that drop their passengers off at the door of their workplace, the doctor\u2019s office, a shopping mall, and then retreat to park themselves, returning when summoned to pick up. Tesla has had summoning for a while, but it was intended for people\u2019s driveways. The recent Enhanced Autopilot update will allow the car to negotiate more complex, low-speed environments.That\u2019s right: No more crossing the burning asphalt to get to Nordstrom.

It marked the largest one-month decrease since August 2012. Sales decreased in about half of all local markets tracked, with a sizable 25% drop in the greater Toronto area, and similar steep declines in surrounding urban centers in southern Ontario.On a year-over-year basis, resale activity in May fell 1.6%.The association added a closely watched gauge suggested Canada\u2019s housing market moved into balanced territory for the first time since late 2015. The national sales-to-new listings ratio stood at 56.3% in May, down from 60.2% in April and the high-60% range over the first three months of this year. A sales-to-new listings ratio above 60% indicates a sellers\u2019 market, the industry group noted.The CREA report marked the first full month of real estate activity under new rules introduced by the province of Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, aimed at cooling a frothy real-estate market and demand from foreign investors. Key among the measures was a tax on foreigners acquiring residential real estate, and \u00a0ability by municipalities to levy taxes on vacant homes.The May report \u201csuggests the changes have squelched speculative home purchases,\u201d said Gregory Klump, CREA\u2019s chief economist.On eight occasions starting in 2008, federal and provincial authorities in Canada have introduced measures to tamp down housing exuberance. Housing has been a crucial growth engine for the country in recent years amid slumping commodity prices and a lackluster export performance, and TD Bank estimates that over a third of Canadian economic output since 2014 is tied to real estate.Diana Petramala, economist at TD Bank, said the Ontario regulations have showed initial success and \u201ckicked off what is expected to be a soft landing\u201d in the Toronto market and its surrounding exurbs. She added the prospect of higher interest rates\u2014with the Bank of Canada signaling this week it\u2019s prepared to remove stimulus\u2014will limit any rebound in Ontario, and cause a recovery under way in Vancouver, British Columbia, to fizzle out.In its most recent review of the financial system, the Bank of Canada warned frothy real-estate markets\u2014with up until recently price gains of 30% or more in Toronto on a one-year basis\u2014posed a material threat to financial stability. It said in Toronto, price growth \u201chas been too fast for normal market activities.\u201dThe real estate association said the national average price for homes sold in May was 530,304 Canadian dollars ($401.471), up 4.3% from one year earlier but a slowdown from the 10.4% annual gain recorded in the previous month.

Hammers and explosives aren\u2019t its only tools. The antiquities trade is worth billions, and the self-styled caliphate is funding itself in part by looting and selling ancient treasures.In late May, the Journal reported that U.S. and European Union authorities were scrutinizing a pair of art dealers as part of a wider investigation into who has been facilitating the market for ancient coins, statues and relics stolen by Islamic State. The dealers say they have done nothing wrong.Looting for profit and propaganda would hardly have surprised the cultures that made these artifacts. In ancient times, it was a given that no victory was complete without the final humiliation of cultural destruction. In a show of power, the enemy\u2019s temples, art and monuments had to be publicly despoiled. The Arch of Titus in Rome, which celebrates the sacking of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, shows Roman soldiers triumphantly bearing aloft the treasures of the Jews\u2019 Great Temple, including its menorah.The Romans may also have been the first to recognize that religious objects and works of art belonged to a different category than mere \u201cspoils of war.\u201d The famous orator and lawyer Cicero made the point in 70 B.C., when he prosecuted       Gaius Verres,        the governor of Sicily. Verres, Cicero said in a blistering introductory speech, had stripped towns there not only of \u201cpublic statues and ornaments, but he also plundered all the temples consecrated in the deepest religious feelings of the people.\u201d After Cicero\u2019s assault, Verres\u2019 own attorney could only recommend to his client that he leave the country\u2014which he did.It became fashionable, for a while, for emperors to pay lip service to the idea of protecting cultural heritage. But the emperors of the Roman East, ruling from Constantinople, had no qualms about embellishing their city with looted art. In 1204, they received a taste of their own medicine during the Venetian sacking of the city. Constantinople\u2019s pride and joy, its four gilt-copper horse statues, ended up on top of St. Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice\u2019s main square.Centuries later, as the Enlightenment awakened an interest in universal rights, European jurists began to argue that art, religious objects and educational property belonged to a special category that was off-limits to invaders.       Lord Elgin,        the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, may have believed that he was rescuing the Parthenon sculptures from Turkish mistreatment when he transferred the marbles to England in 1805. But many people, including       Lord Byron,        denounced his action as cultural theft.In another example of Europe\u2019s change in attitude, following Napoleon\u2019s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the victorious Duke of Wellington insisted that the final peace treaty contain a restitution clause. Napoleon had ransacked Europe of its treasures; now, much was returned to its rightful owners. Among the objects France had to return were Venice\u2019s St. Mark\u2019s horses. Napoleon had taken them to Paris to decorate his Arc de Triomphe. Truly, what goes around comes around.Several decades later, a German-American lawyer named       Francis Lieber       played a crucial part in establishing modern safeguards against looting. As a young man, Lieber had fought in the Napoleonic War and witnessed the emperor\u2019s plundering firsthand. Later, during the U.S. Civil War, he endured the heartbreak of seeing his sons fight on opposite sides.Although he knew it was useless to try to stop the tides of war, Lieber felt that he could make a difference in the way it was fought. In 1863 he worked with the White House to develop a military code of conduct for the Union armies. Lieber\u2019s code made it clear that cultural property such as museums, libraries and churches were to be protected and looting prohibited. The code laid the groundwork for subsequent international efforts, including the Allied role in rescuing artistic treasures stolen by the Nazis in World War II.But restitution remains no easy matter. Earlier this year, Poland\u2019s National Museum in Krak\u00f3w celebrated the return of three Nazi-appropriated artworks.

NDAQ 0.15%       slammed a plan by rival Bats to shake up the crucial closing auctions that happen daily at 4 p.m. and determine prices for thousands of stocks.Bats\u2019s proposal would \u201cintroduce undesirable market fragmentation and volatility,\u201d NYSE said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission posted online Thursday. In a similar letter, Nasdaq said the plan was \u201charmful to investors\u201d and \u201cwould establish a dangerous precedent.\u201dThe proposal, which awaits SEC approval, would give traders a new way to buy and sell shares of companies listed on NYSE and Nasdaq at the daily closing price without paying fees to NYSE or Nasdaq.Bats said it would address the criticism in letters to the SEC. \u201cWe expected an active comment period and look forward to responding in this healthy debate,\u201d a spokeswoman said.The growing popularity of exchange-traded funds and index-based strategies has increased the importance of the closing auctions in recent years. That is because index-fund managers often seek to buy and sell stocks at prices close to the daily settlement prices, which determine the level of the indexes they are tracking.For instance, an unusually high 39% of the trading volume in         Yahoo Inc.       shares on Tuesday took place in its closing auction, according to data from brokerage ITG. The spike came as             Verizon Communications Inc. completed its takeover of Yahoo\u2019s main businesses, which led benchmark providers FTSE Russell and MSCI to remove it from their indices. That in turn prompted funds tracking those indices to sell Yahoo, traders and analysts said.On average, 5.9% of the volume in NYSE-listed securities this year has taken place in the closing auction, up from 3.6% in 2012, according to NYSE. For Nasdaq-listed securities, the share of volume at the close rose from 3% to 4.6% over the same period, according to Nasdaq.Bats\u2019s plan threatens to erode NYSE and Nasdaq\u2019s bottom lines, said       Rich Repetto,        an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners. \u201cIn the worst-case scenario, they could lose some profitable trading revenue with a knock-on effect on market-data revenue.\u201dNYSE and Nasdaq\u2019s control over closing auctions is a vestige of the duopoly they enjoyed until the mid-2000s, when regulations forced greater competition between exchanges.During the trading day, a stock can be traded on any exchange. But at the close, it reverts to the exchange where it is listed. That means NYSE has an effective monopoly on closing auctions for shares of companies listed on the Big Board, while Nasdaq has a similar grip on closing auctions for Nasdaq-listed stocks.Increasing fees for trading at the close have led to complaints on Wall Street. \u201cCosts associated with primary markets closing auctions have been steadily increasing in the absence of competitive alternatives,\u201d the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a lobby group for financial firms, said in a letter Wednesday to the SEC.Nasdaq has increased the maximum fee for trading at the close by 60% in the past three years, while NYSE has raised it 16% over the same period, according to SEC filings. The two exchange groups also offer discounted rates for higher-volume traders, and NYSE offers cheaper rates to traders who use floor brokers.Bats said last month that its plan would create a \u201ccompetitively priced alternative\u201d to NYSE and Nasdaq\u2019s closing auctions.If approved, the plan would let Bats create a mechanism to replicate market-on-close orders in NYSE and Nasdaq\u2019s closing auctions. Such orders allow traders to buy or sell NYSE- or Nasdaq-listed securities at whatever the day\u2019s final closing price is.The plan wouldn\u2019t affect limit-on-close orders, in which traders specify the highest price at which they are willing to buy the stock, or the lowest price at which they are willing to sell. By leaving such orders untouched, Bats would avoid \u201cdistorting auction price formation,\u201d it said last month.NYSE and Nasdaq disagree, saying it is essential to keep closing-auction trades concentrated in one place. Nasdaq, in its letter to the SEC, also accused Bats of \u201cunabashedly free-riding\u201d on Nasdaq\u2019s closing auction.Bats was acquired this year by Chicago-based             CBOE Holdings Inc.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Bats\u2019s Auction Plan Irks Rivals.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 11:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-exchanges-squabble-over-end-of-day-auctions-1497541023", "news_title": "Stock Exchanges Squabble Over End-of-Day Auctions   ", "keywords": "bats stock exchange,closing auctions,exchange traded funds, limit-on-close orders,Nasdaq,NDAQ,NYSE Euronext,NYX,Yahoo,YHOO,Verizon Communications,VZ,CBOE Holdings,CBOE,Bats,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,internet search engines,financial services,internet,online,investing,technology"}, {"content": "A FORGIVING DISH, pasta salad. Chances are, you have the makings of a respectable one in the fridge right now, ready to be thrown together without undue contrivance.Your guide to mastering the lazy summerForgiving is not the word I\u2019d apply to the Italian approach to pasta. Years ago, while watching me prepare a seafood risotto, a Milanese friend was appalled at the abundance of shrimp, clams and calamari I enthusiastically included. She insisted that, when made correctly, her country\u2019s rice and pasta dishes were all about the starch; any other ingredient was there merely to provide nomenclature and a bit of variety. Duly shamed, I followed her directive for years afterward.Time has passed, I\u2019ve gained confidence as a cook, and anyway, I live in New York, not Florence. Lately I\u2019ve been flipping the ratio on my pasta salads\u2014easier on the noodles, prodigal with the produce\u2014and loving the results.My newfangled, crunch-forward, summer-light salads have just enough pasta\u2014a fourth of what I previously used\u2014to provide a bit of heft and here-and-there chewiness. I include only about a quarter of a box (four ounces) of pasta to make six generous main-course servings. As for the rest, I\u2019ve always seen a pasta salad as the ideal repository for extraneous bits and pieces. If you\u2019re even marginally imaginative, most any combination of leftover meat, poultry, fish, seafood, sausage, legumes and vegetables\u2014cannily tossed with olive oil and seasonings, or with a first-class vinaigrette\u2014will be a winner. For even lighter salads and additional servings, add shredded lettuces or cabbage and extra vegetables.For those who prefer following a recipe, I\u2019ve included, below, my two current favorites. The first\u2014with fusilli (whole-wheat, if you like), cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, scallions, arugula, fresh herbs and pine nuts\u2014is my go-to lunch when temperatures soar. A shady porch, this salad and an ice-cold Chablis is my kind of healthy.The somewhat richer other recipe, a combo of roast chicken, Roquefort cheese, grapes, pears and walnuts, will pair nicely with a dry ros\u00e9 now and also slip seamlessly into autumn. Feeling ambitious? Try swapping in smoked chicken or roast duck, if you fancy. Or go vegetarian and omit the poultry entirely. Play around. Replace the Roquefort and walnuts with ch\u00e8vre and pistachios, or the pears with Granny Smith apples.

While the deaths caused by those attacks fell during the same period from 150 to 135, the casualty toll is still far higher than in other recent years, Europol said.Meanwhile, arrests for terrorism-related offenses continued to increase for the fourth straight year, the agency said.Rob Wainwright,        executive director or Europol, said the need for improved information-sharing on suspected militants has become more pressing in the past two years.\u201cJihadist terrorism has an international character and therefore needs an international answer from cross-border law enforcement,\u201d he said.While terrorist attacks in 2016 involved a wide range of available weapons\u2014the attack in Nice, France, on Bastille Day was carried out by a truck\u2014explosives were used in about 40% of the assaults, owing to \u201ctheir high impact and symbolic power,\u201d Europol said.Europol warned that weaponized drones could become a threat in Europe, having already been deployed in Syria and Iraq.The number of propaganda videos produced by Islamic State slowly began to decline in 2015, according to Europol, which pointed to anti-propaganda measures by social media companies that have started to disrupt Islamic State communication.Europol cited the 2016 effort by             Facebook Inc.,Microsoft Corp.      ,             Twitter Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       YouTube to create a joint database to quickly identify and remove pictures and videos that promote terrorism.Write to Julian E.

That action shows defensiveness in China\u2019s financial sector despite muted market reaction after the big insurer\u2019s hands-on chairman disappeared from view in recent days.Wu Xiaohui,        the Anbang chairman, was detained last week in China by a special unit investigating possible economic crimes, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The insurer said only that Mr. Wu \u201cis temporarily unable to fulfill his role for personal reasons.\u201d The probe centers on whether Mr. Wu was involved in bribery and other economic crimes at Anbang, these people said. He isn\u2019t reachable for comment.China\u2019s insurance regulator and the Communist Party\u2019s antigraft watchdog didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Anbang gained an international profile through deal making that included buying New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel and financial firms in Europe and Asia. In China, Anbang represents fast, debt-powered expansion and interlinkages throughout the financial system. The company says it is operating normally; but if it trips, the impact could be far-reaching.Some of the first signs of caution about Anbang are now being seen at some Chinese banks, which have begun to limit exposure to the firm, according to people at the banks. They said some banks are instructing their branches to reduce or halt sales of Anbang-branded financial investments.The defensive action, reported first by Bloomberg News, wasn\u2019t the result of internal risk assessments at banks but instead orders from higher Chinese authorities, they said. In some cases, caution about Anbang-related business began some time ago, they said. A spokesman for the China Banking Regulatory Commission said he wasn\u2019t aware of any such notice.Banks are a primary channel for Anbang to sell investments it needs to generate revenue, including until recently deals called universal life that are structured like short-term time deposits and need to be rolled over continuously.It\u2019s unclear how much impact a reduced bank channel will have on Anbang but any such crimps are in line with an increasingly strong effort by Chinese financial regulators to curtail sales of loosely regulated investments, often labeled as wealth-management products. Anbang\u2019s own figures suggest it has relied less this year on such activity than in the past.With total assets of nearly $300 billion, Anbang represents around 12% of the country\u2019s insurance sector and probably under a half-percent of China\u2019s total financial sector assets when including banks and stocks, according to corporate, regulatory and analyst figures.Mr. Wu led Anbang through explosive growth by exploiting a brief period of financial liberalization in China, when traditional lines of business got blurred. The company is regulated as an insurer but it takes deposits like a bank and trades stocks like a brokerage, while making strategic investments like a private-equity firm.Andy Xie,        an independent economist, says Anbang\u2019s size suggests it poses little systemwide risk for China, calling it a far smaller part of the financial system than Bear Stearns was in the U.S. before it caused shock waves with a 2008 collapse. Plus, he says, Anbang operates in an environment where authorities have more power than their U.S. counterparts to order prevention of any \u201csnowballing effect.\u201dBut to Mr. Xie, China\u2019s shot at Anbang\u2019s chief signals political leaders may sacrifice big names to tame an indebted financial system.Anbang said in a statement, dated Tuesday, that its business is running smoothly. Employees echoed that view in brief interviews on Thursday outside Anbang\u2019s glass headquarters in central Beijing. \u201cEverything\u2019s normal. In fact, approvals for things are going through faster,\u201d said one man, before hurrying away.Employees said the person now in charge is the Communist Party\u2019s top representative at Anbang,       Chen Ping.       Anbang has declined to elaborate on its statement, which said Mr. Wu has \u201cauthorized relevant senior executives\u201d to manage Anbang in his absence.Mr. Chen couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Among Asian insurers only Shenzhen-based             Ping An Insurance                   (Group) Company of China is considered by the Group of 20-backed Financial Stability Board to be globally systemically important, meaning its stumble could be felt abroad the way Lehman Brothers Inc.\u2019s fall was in 2008. But research by Da Wang at Beijing\u2019s Central University of Finance and Economics recommends that another nine Chinese insurers, including Anbang, should be better monitored for their domestic systemic importance.Financial market reaction to this week\u2019s news has been limited, with little sign of impact to bonds and market interest rates. In part, traders say, that reflects how Mr. Wu\u2019s detention is only the most striking outcome in a monthslong crackdown in the financial sector. They add that they\u2019ve had ample opportunity to trade on Anbang news, including in May when China\u2019s insurance regulator banned Anbang from selling two products, alleging the firm had dodged regulations and \u201cdisrupted order in the market.\u201dSome of Anbang\u2019s most liquid assets appear to be shares in listed Chinese companies; it controls nearly $30 billion in shares of companies where it is a sizable stockholder, according to Wind Information Co.Some of those shares have fared poorly this week, but without drama. Shanghai-listed             China Minsheng Banking                   has fallen less than 1% in the past two sessions.

Between 2020 and 2022 they are expecting to add another 1 billion cubic feet a day of new gas production, assuming the other two projects are approved by the government.BP first partnered with RIL in 2011, spending $7.2 billion for a 30% stake in oil and gas fields operated by the Indian company. The deal was the company\u2019s first major investment since its fatal blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and came at a time when BP was desperately selling assets elsewhere to help pay for the fallout from the spill.It was meant to mark a step toward new growth prospects in a market where demand for oil and gas was growing rapidly, but for years government caps on gas prices limited profitability and stymied investment.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to develop a natural gas price to help develop these projects,\u201d BP CEO       Bob Dudley       told the industry CERAWeek conference in Houston in March. \u201cIt is behind in developing these resources,\u201d he said of India.The Indian government last year unveiled a new formula for gas prices from deepwater projects that Mr. Dudley said provided more certainty.\u201cI\u2019m feeling optimistic about sizable investment in India,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.Now, the British oil giant seems ready to pile in again, hoping to take advantage of India\u2019s rapidly growing market. The country already consumes over 5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, according to BP. That is a number that India hopes to double by 2022.Though weak oil and gas prices have pressured spending across the industry and delayed new projects, BP has made it clear that it is back in growth mode after years of retrenchment. In addition to its latest investment in India, the company intends to add 800,000 barrels a day of new production by the end of the decade and has ambitious plans to increase profit from its refining and marketing arm.In addition to their plans to boost gas production, BP and RIL also said Thursday they would look for other opportunities in India in conventional fuel retail as well as lower carbon alternatives.Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'BP\u2019s India Natural-Gas Plans Advance.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 11:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bp-forges-ahead-with-deepwater-gas-field-plans-in-india-1497536058", "news_title": "BP Forges Ahead With Deepwater Gas Field Plans in India", "keywords": "british oil company,deepwater gas,gas prices,gas production,indian gas producer,indian joint venture,offshore gas,BP,BP.LN,Reliance Industries,500325.BY,500325,UK:BP.,IN:500325,Bob Dudley,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,natural gas markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,petroleum,coal products,petroleum refining,industrial goods,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Propelled by what he called his \u201cterrible itch for the unknown,\u201d Paul Gauguin frequently traveled far from the art world of Paris: to France\u2019s Breton coast, Panama, the Caribbean island of Martinique, Tahiti and beyond. He also liked to cross creative boundaries, experimenting with woodcarving, ceramics and other media commonly thought of as mere \u201ccrafts.\u201dThe new show \u201cGauguin: Artist as Alchemist\u201d explores this less familiar side of the great painter\u2019s story, showing how his work in more mundane art forms influenced his most important breakthroughs on canvas.Opening June 25 at the Art Institute of Chicago, the 240-work exhibition takes a loosely chronological approach, grouping the art by theme and location. Focusing on the moments when the onetime stockbroker was working most furiously in multiple media, the show deliberately bypasses points when Gauguin (1848-1903) worked exclusively on painting\u2014leaving out, for instance, the tumultuous few weeks in 1888 that he spent with       Vincent van Gogh       in the south of France.Instead, the exhibition delves deeply into Gauguin\u2019s prints, ceramics, furniture, wood sculptures and bas-reliefs, as both personal expression and creative fuel. By the time he made his first trip to Tahiti in 1891, \u201chis toolbox is set,\u201d artistically speaking, said       Gloria Groom,        co-curator of the show and chairwoman of the museum\u2019s European painting and sculpture department. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing and how to do it.\u201d How Gauguin acquired that sure-handed grasp of his own art is the focus of the show\u2019s first half.One early grouping of works draws a strong connection between Gauguin\u2019s late-1880s explorations in ceramics and his 1888 \u201cVision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel),\u201d the painting that established him as an avant-garde master. Gauguin had started out as an impressionist, falling in with a circle that included       Camille Pissarro       and Edgar Degas. But his ceramic experiments of the late 1880s\u2014marked by deeply incised lines and solid blocks of color\u2014pointed in another direction.Depicting a crowd of Breton women in their traditional headdresses, \u201cVision of the Sermon\u201d features blocks of color like those on his ceramics, boldly outlined in dark blue. \u201cThere are these almost interlocking zones of color,\u201d said Ms. Groom.Made around the same time, \u201cVase in the Form of Leda and the Swan\u201d (1887\u201388) displays a similar color-block-and-outline style. The vase, said Ms. Groom, may be seen as \u201cliterally a painting in the round.\u201d Gauguin soon did a watercolor depicting the vase from different angles and a year or so later made a print on the same theme, created as a design for a ceramic plate.The desolate girl, head in hands, depicted in the 1888 painting \u201cThe Wine Harvest (Human Misery)\u201d appears in a watercolor-and-pastel, a drawing and a print all made the following year. A decade later she\u2019s the centerpiece of \u201cHuman Miseries, From the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints,\u201d made in Tahiti in 1898-99. All of these works are in the exhibition.Drawn to non-European cultures\u2014and implausibly claiming Peruvian Indian heritage through his French-Peruvian mother\u2019s aristocratic forebears\u2014Gauguin positioned himself as both civilized and savage, sophisticated and crude. His search for an uncorrupted paradise led him to Panama and Martinique in the late 1880s and to Tahiti in 1891, where he spent two years before returning to France in 1893.In Paris, Gauguin worked on \u201cNoa Noa,\u201d his memoir of Tahiti for which he made a suite of woodblock prints. Experimenting with inks, wax, resin and solvents on different colors and types of paper, he repeatedly printed the 10 \u201cNoa Noa\u201d woodblocks as he continued carving them, producing different effects each time. Figures from his 1894 painting \u201cMahana no atua (Day of the God)\u201d\u2014one of his best-known works\u2014appear and reappear in the prints.Despite his intense and innovative output, Gauguin did not experience great success in Paris. Barely two years after he left Tahiti, he went back in 1895, determined \u201cto see no one but savages, to live their life.\u201d In Tahiti\u2014and in the more remote Marquesas Islands, where he moved in 1901\u2014Gauguin\u2019s art took on a decorative aspect, in which he conceived individual works as related elements in an immersive art environment.The artist died in the Marquesas in 1903 of causes variously suggested as syphilis, a heart attack and an overdose of laudanum. The exhibition closes with five wood bas-relief panels carved for the entrance to his home there, which he dubbed the House of Pleasure. \u201cBe Mysterious,\u201d one panel instructs. \u201cBe in Love and You Will Be Happy,\u201d reads another. In media both grand and modest, Gauguin tried to be all of these things.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gauguins-travels-into-multiple-art-forms-1497538622", "news_title": "Gauguin\u2019s Travels Into Multiple Art Forms", "keywords": "art,art institute of chicago,chicago travel,french painters,galleries,gauguin,museum,political,general news,arts,entertainment,calendar of events,routine general news,media"}, {"content": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014Pakistani Prime Minister       Nawaz Sharif       defended himself and his family\u00a0Thursday\u00a0before a court-appointed\u00a0panel investigating allegations of corruption sparked by the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d leak last year.In April Mr. Sharif narrowly escaped being forced out of office when the country\u2019s\u00a0Supreme Court ordered a probe into opposition parties\u2019 accusations he used his position to enrich his family. In a\u00a03-2 decision, the court\u00a0stopped short of ending Mr. Sharif\u2019s\u00a0term as prime minister, as demanded by the opposition, but judges said questions about his family\u2019s acquisition of expensive London properties were serious enough to merit further investigation.After speaking to the investigators for three hours\u00a0on Thursday, the prime minister struck\u00a0a defiant tone, repeating that his family\u2019s assets were acquired with money earned through\u00a0legitimate\u00a0business.\u201cI\u2019ve accounted for every single penny,\u201d he said, adding that he gave the investigators documents on the legitimate sources of his income. \u201cOur opponents are free to make any allegations, hatch conspiracies, try anything. They will fail.\u201dThe capital was under high security, with additional police and paramilitary personnel deployed\u00a0along Mr. Sharif\u2019s route to and at the investigators\u2019 offices.The controversy has dominated Pakistani politics since the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a collection of files leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca & Co., which included documents mentioning members of Mr. Sharif\u2019s family and their investments.Several opposition political parties, led by cricket star-turned-politician       Imran Khan\u2019s       Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, have repeatedly demanded Mr. Sharif\u2019s resignation after the Panama Papers leak. Mr. Sharif was elected prime minister of Pakistan for the third time in 2013.The prime minister\u2019s supporters say the opposition is distracting the government from focusing on Pakistan\u2019s many challenges, including a campaign against terrorist groups.\u201cThese conspiracies and [political] spectacles have cost this country a lot. It\u2019s time for the truth to be upheld,\u201d Mr. Sharif said\u00a0Thursday, adding that he was confident the investigation will clear his family.Three of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children were named in the documents as owners, through offshore companies, of apartments in London\u2019s upscale Mayfair area. Opposition political parties allege that the properties were purchased with money the family acquired through corruption during Mr. Sharif\u2019s first two terms as prime minister in the 1990s.The Sharif family\u2019s lawyers have said during court hearings that Hussain Sharif, Mr. Sharif\u2019s eldest son, received the properties as part of the settlement of a joint venture started in the 1980s between the Sharifs and a branch of the Qatari royal family.Mr. Sharif\u2019s opponents have rejected the explanation.\u201cThey have no way of explaining how they got the money to buy those palaces in London,\u201d Imran Khan, the prime minister\u2019s main political rival, said in response to Mr. Sharif\u2019s statement\u00a0on Thursday.The Mossack Fonseca documents don\u2019t allege any wrongdoing.

Although the property is 112 years old, it has never actually been a house\u2014until now. After serving as a company headquarters and political command post, it has been converted into a seven-bedroom house, listed for almost $46 million. The price tag includes all its furniture and fittings, down to the artwork (a bronze nude by Rodin stands in the main living room).Mansion House\u2019s new identity was given to it by London-based luxury developer Saigol DDC. In 2013, when London\u2019s prime property market was skyrocketing, it bought the building in Westminster, home of the British government.The building, designed by architect Horace Field and built in 1905, was originally the London office of the North Eastern Railway Company at a time when the railways were the locomotive of Britain\u2019s expanding industrial power.In 1982, the centrist Social Democratic Party (since renamed the Liberal Democrats) took over the building. The party had been founded the year before and Mansion House\u2014then known simply as 4 Cowley Street\u2014was conveniently close to parliament. The Liberal Democrats remained there until 2011, when the run-down building was listed for $14 million.Saigol\u2019s renovation concentrated on restoring the property\u2019s original features\u2014the dark wood paneling in the main reception rooms and the central staircase. A lavish cupola lights the stairs, a glass dome decorated with gold leaf and a confection of plaster scrolls and flowers.With Calacatta Oro marble and parquet flooring, chandeliers hanging and a gray/white/taupe color palette, Mansion House is an exercise in grandeur. In addition to seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms, the house includes a dining room, formal and informal living rooms, a media room, wine room and staff quarters.Outside is a walled backyard and a roof terrace with views of the Houses of Parliament and the peak of Big Ben. The basement features a pool tiled in gold, green and bronze mosaic tiles, as well as a hot tub and sauna.When Saigol bought the property, offices across London were being converted into luxury homes to satisfy raging demand from international buyers. But since 2014, a combination of tax increases and the fallout from Brexit has seen prices fall substantially.The stamp duty bill for anyone who pays $46 million for a prime residence in the U.K. would be about $5.4 million. For a second home, that bill would increase to about $6.8 million.Mansion House officially went on the market in May but has been offered \u201coff market\u201d since the start of the year\u2014an arrangement where key clients are invited to see a property in advance of its official launch. Charles Lloyd, a director at             Savills                   and one of Mansion House\u2019s two selling agents, said it attracted global interest, but no buyer, and its original asking price of $54.77 million was rapidly adjusted.Tax and politics aside, Mansion House\u2019s location may be a disadvantage. Westminster lacks the boutiques, bars, and restaurants of the prime heartland areas. But Alastair Nicholson, a director of Knight Frank and the other selling agent, believes this won\u2019t be an obstacle. \u201cIt is quiet, but you are close to the River Thames and you can be anywhere in 10 minutes,\u201d he said.And the fact that this month\u2019s general election has left the British government in disarray might be a silver lining for Mansion House.The pound, already weak against the dollar and euro, has tumbled still further, making the giant house a\u2014relative\u2014bargain to overseas buyers.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-newly-minted-mansion-lists-for-over-46-million-1497537292", "news_title": "A Newly Minted Mansion Lists for Over $46 Million", "keywords": " homes for sale, london,london property, luxury homes, luxury real estate,mansion house, saigol ddc,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,politics,international relations,domestic politics,real estate,property,heavy construction,railway construction,construction"}, {"content": "Surprises from central banks have become a rare thing in recent times. So when one comes along, as it has at the Bank of England, it is worth paying attention\u2014both inside and outside the U.K.The shock at the BOE lies in the split on the Monetary Policy Committee; policy was left unchanged, with rates at 0.25%.

Subscribe to the podcast.Inflation, which at 2.9% in May is well above the BOE\u2019s 2% target, is provoking discomfort. The central bank has previously managed to keep policy loose in the face of higher inflation rates, most notably 2011\u2019s climb to above 5%. But things are different now. The recovery has run a long way, and unemployment is much lower. That is making the BOE less tolerant of above-target inflation, the minutes of the meeting show, although that sits uneasily with the idea that rising prices are due to the sharp fall in sterling, something the BOE can\u2019t easily offset.True, a BOE rate increase is still far from certain. Split votes have happened before, and one vote to lift rates came from       Kristin Forbes,        who leaves the policy-setting committee this month. The minutes also noted that wage inflation was still subdued, and raised concern about weaker consumer demand, the force that the U.K. economy has relied on in its recovery.In terms of U.K. assets, the pound has found a friend. While politics is still a source of volatility, investors can no longer just blithely believe that the BOE is on perma-hold. The wider message is that the BOE, like other central banks, is buying into the idea that the global economy has picked up speed.

Witnesses said they saw people jumping from the building to escape the flames. Dozens of residents were injured, and police said they expected the death toll to rise.Firefighters were still battling pockets of fire Wednesday evening, but had searched most of the Grenfell Tower in the otherwise upscale North Kensington neighborhood, clambering through the ruins and also using drones, authorities said. It was too early to pinpoint the cause of the blaze, police said.The London Fire Brigade said 65 people were rescued from the building, which a structural engineer said isn\u2019t in danger of collapsing.Residents said they heard few, if any, alarms. One man who got out described a chaotic race through a central staircase that was the only escape route.London Fire Commissioner       Dany Cotton       called the blaze unprecedented, saying she hadn\u2019t seen anything like it in her 29-year career.Michael Paramasivan,        who lived on the seventh floor, said he woke to the smell of burning plastic and heard people shouting. He, his girlfriend and their children fled down a crowded central staircase. He said he wasn\u2019t sure if there were sprinklers, but said none had activated.\u201cI saw three kids near the top floor, and next thing we knew, bang, it went up in flames,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have perished. It was horrific.\u201d\u201cIt was the towering inferno, like lighting a bonfire,\u201d said       Piers Thompson,        who lives in a neighboring building and said he was awakened by shouts at about 1:15 a.m. and watched fast-moving flames spread.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. You could see people flashing\u201d lights in an effort to attract rescuers attention, especially on high floors, he said. \u201cSomeone was waving a blanket.\u201dA spokesman for British Prime Minister       Theresa May       said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the loss of lives.Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. Wednesday evening, Mrs. May said a proper investigation into the cause of the fire would take place once the scene is secure.\u201cIf there are any lessons to be learned, they will be, and action will be taken,\u201d she said.Opposition leader       Jeremy Corbyn       of the Labour Party told LBC radio that \u201csome very searching questions\u201d needed to be asked, suggesting budget cuts could be to blame. \u201cIf you deny local authorities the funding they need, then there is a price that\u2019s paid by the lack of safety facilities,\u201d he said.The government will seek to identify other high-rise buildings that could be at risk, particularly those that might have a similar process of refurbishment, and run checks on them to reassure residents, a Home Office spokesman said Wednesday evening.The public-housing block was built in 1974 and recently went through an \u00a38.6 million ($11 million) refurbishment. New exterior cladding and a new heating system were installed.The cladding appears to have significantly contributed to the fire\u2019s spread, said       Angus Law,        a lecturer at the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh.Nick Paget-Brown, the leader of the Kensington and Chelsea council, acknowledged that the council had received complaints about the refurbishment work. \u201cBut we will need to look much more closely about how much of that corresponds to the cause of today\u2019s fire.\u201dRydon Group Ltd., which carried out the refurbishment, said the work met fire and health and safety requirements.The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which manages the building for the council, said it was too early to speculate on the cause and what contributed to the fire\u2019s spread.The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a Chicago-based nonprofit group, on Wednesday said the fire would raise questions about the defend-in-place approach, in which residents are instructed to remain in their homes if there is a fire elsewhere in the building, as was the policy at Grenfell House. The group said defend in place remains the best policy for such buildings.Residents of the block had long warned of fire risk in the building. The Grenfell Action Group, a residents\u2019 rights group, warned on its website in November that \u201conly a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord.\u201d\u201cAll our warnings fell on deaf ears and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time,\u201d it said in a blog post early Wednesday.Vassiliki S. Lorraine, who lives near the tower, said she heard children screaming shortly after the fire started.\u201cThey screamed very loud, \u2019Save us, save us, save us\u2019 and \u2019Can we jump?\u2019 \u201d she said. She said the cries stopped after about an hour.A woman identified only as Zoe told the British Broadcasting Corp. that she had escaped from the fourth floor after someone banged on her door and told her to get out.\u201cWhen I got on the landing it was thick with smoke but the smoke alarms weren\u2019t going off, which is quite scary, \u201d she said. \u201cThen I just ran down the stairs. You could see the fire is in one of the flats.\u201dIn July 2009, six people died after fire broke out in Lakanal House, a 14-story residential public housing block in Camberwell, south London. The local council pleaded guilty to breaching fire safety regulations and was fined \u00a3270,000.

That beat market expectations for a 0.9% increase, according to economists at Royal Bank of Canada.On a volume, or price-adjusted, basis, factory sales increased 0.5%. On a 12-month basis, manufacturing shipments rose 7.6%.March\u2019s data were revised downward and now indicate sales rose 0.8% in the month from the earlier estimate of a 1% gain. However, February\u2019s results were upgraded and now suggest shipments fell 0.2% versus the previously reported 0.6% decline.The encouraging result for April will take on heightened importance for Canadian market watchers after the Bank of Canada\u2019s top two officials signaled this week that it\u2019s time to assess whether the Canadian economy, exhibiting signs of sustained growth across a wider spectrum of industries and regions, still requires ultralow interest rates. In a broadcast interview, Gov.       Stephen Poloz       said the interest-rate cuts the central bank delivered in 2015 to fend off the fallout from the oil-price shock had \u201cdone their work.\u201dEconomists have altered their Canadian rate forecasts as a result, with the bulk expecting the Bank of Canada to raise its benchmark policy rate of 0.50% at its October meeting. Some analysts indicated a rate rise next month couldn\u2019t be ruled out should data over the coming weeks, starting with April\u2019s factory-sales report, come in stronger than expected.\u201cThe manufacturing sector is holding well, and the outlook is also sound,\u201d said Jimmy Jean, economist at Desjardins Capital Markets. \u201cThe reasons for the Bank of Canada sounding more upbeat on the current evolution were only reinforced in the factory sales report.\u201dApril\u2019s overall gain was driven by higher sales of petroleum and coal products, up 8.9% to C$5.43 billion, and in primary metals, up 3.8% to C$4.16 billion. On a price-adjusted basis, sales in the two categories climbed 7.8% and 2.5%, respectively.Also contributing toward higher manufacturing sales were increases in paper, food, and machinery and equipment.The biggest drag on the results was from the auto component. Sales of motor vehicles declined 3.7% to C$5.71 billion, while shipments of auto parts fell 2.1% to C$2.49 billion.Excluding motor vehicles and auto parts, the data-gathering agency said factory shipments rose by a stronger 1.9% on a nominal basis, and 1.4% in volume terms.Overall, sales were up in 13 of the 21 sectors tracked, representing 62% of sales. Shipments rose in eight of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces. That is in line with Bank of Canada commentary this week that growth is broadening.The report said inventories rose 0.9% to a record C$73.43 billion, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. A rise in inventories suggests production exceeded consumption but also could signal firms are stockpiling goods in anticipation of stronger demand.For a second straight month, two forward-looking gauges increased in tandem. Unfilled orders, or the stock of orders that will contribute to future sales assuming they aren\u2019t canceled, rose 1% to C$90.25 billion, while new orders advanced 0.4% to C$55.34 billion.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-factory-sales-beat-april-expectations-with-1-1-rise-1497531554", "news_title": "Canada Factory Sales Beat April Expectations With 1.1% Rise ", "keywords": " bank of canada,canada, canada auto, canada economy, canada factory sales, canada manufacturing, interest rates,Bank of Canada,Statistics Canada,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic news"}, {"content": "When             Twitter                   users open their home pages, they are greeted by an inset box at the top of the screen in which three words appear in gray type: \u201cWho to follow.\u201dCorrect grammar? Certainly not.Plenty of Twitter users, including members of the blue-checkmarked elite, have complained about that oversight. \u201cThe \u2018whoms\u2019 put up a good fight, but we ultimately opted for a more natural cadence and the \u2018whos\u2019 won out,\u201d says Twitter spokeswoman Brielle Villablanca.This sort of grammatical nonchalance doesn\u2019t sit well with many people, among them       Thomas Steiner,        a systems engineer at Google.Mr. Steiner, a German who lives and works in Hamburg, says Twitter\u2019s language annoys him. \u201cAs a non-native speaker, I make a lot of effort to learn the language, and the people who should know better don\u2019t,\u201d he says.In his spare time, he wrote a free browser plugin that automatically corrects the \u201cwho\u201d to \u201cwhom.\u201d He \u201cfixed the internet,\u201d gushed one user of the program.Mr. Steiner has a kindred spirit in British scriptwriter       James T. Harding,        who recalls that, as a teenager, he used to go through music videos and correct the soundtracks. That was around the time he established an imaginary group called the Grand Order of the Whomic Empire. Today, the case-sensitive Mr. Harding runs a lightly visited             Facebook                   group, the Whom Appreciation Society.As for when \u201cwhom\u201d is appropriate: It is the correct choice if the word is the object of a preposition or a verb, such as in Hemingway\u2019s \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d The choice should be \u201cwho\u201d if the word serves as the subject of a sentence or clause.Ben Yagoda cares about such matters, as the author of several books on language and a professor of English and journalism at the University of Delaware. Still, he doesn\u2019t insist on 100% whom-compliance either. For Twitter, he says, \u201cIt would be worse to say \u2018whom to follow.\u2019 It\u2019s so stilted. I mean, here you are on social media with all these exclamation points and whatever.\u201dThe writer       Calvin Trillin       has gone further: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, \u2018whom\u2019 is a word that was invented to make everyone sound like a butler,\u201d he once wrote.Think about it: Would anyone listen to a band called \u201cThe Whom\u201d? And for that matter, would the signature phrases of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and a certain       Bo Diddley       song have worked if they read \u201cWhom ya gonna call?\u201d and \u201cWhom Do You Love?\u201dEven Mr. Harding, the scriptwriter, makes concessions for how people actually talk. One exception is a recurring character in a script he wrote, a 1,224-year-old vampire. \u201cShe uses \u2018whom\u2019 when it\u2019s appropriate because she\u2019s old-fashioned,\u201d Mr. Harding says.Arrayed in galactic war against these accommodating types is Doctor Whom, a \u201cgrammatically correct TimeLord\u201d created by       Adam Roberts,        who, besides being a professor of 19th-century literature at Royal Holloway, University of London, is a prolific writer of science fiction.In a nod to the subtitle of       Lynne Truss\u2019s       grammar best seller \u201cEats, Shoots & Leaves\u201d\u2014which is \u201cThe Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\u201d\u2014Doctor Whom has adopted a \u201czero tolerance approach to parodication,\u201d according to the cover of a book about him, as he travels through time righting grammatical and other wrongs.\u201cI\u2019m a grammar pedant in a lighthearted way,\u201d says Mr. Roberts. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being a grammar Nazi and a Nazi.\u201d Mr. Roberts continues to use \u201cwhom\u201d when it is proper and encourages others to do so too, because \u201cthere\u2019s just something elegant about it.\u201d\u2018There could be other advantages, if a 2014 Wired article is to be believed.

They might write, \u201cI will talk to whomever knows the answer.\u201dThe correct word there, of course, is \u201cwhoever.\u201d\u2019 Reason: The object of the preposition \u201cto\u201d isn\u2019t the word that comes right after it but the whole clause that follows, and \u201cwhoever\u201d is that clause\u2019s subject.\u201cWhom\u201d has hung on somewhat better with the written than the spoken word, but it is losing ground there, too. A scan of thousands of titles through Google Books shows one use of \u201cwhom\u201d for every five of \u201cwho\u201d in the year 1800. By the start of the 20th century it was one to every six, and by the beginning of the 21st century it was one to 11.So, is \u201cwhom\u201d headed the way of \u201cthou,\u201d a word people now encounter mostly when reading religious texts or Shakespeare?Edward Sapir,        an anthropologist and linguist of the last century, predicted in a 1921 book on language that \u201cwithin a couple of hundred years from to-day not even the most learned jurist will be saying \u2018Whom did you see?\u2019... No logical or historical argument will avail to save this hapless \u2018whom.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhile internet language is hardly helping rescue the word, Mr. Yagoda thinks it will hang on as an object of prepositions, if not of verbs. He never expects to see a letter starting with \u201cTo who it may concern.\u201dMr. Harding sees reason to lament the way his generation has largely stopped using \u201cwhom.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame in a way, because they\u2019re missing out on a way to correct people and be annoying.\u201dWrite to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bell-tolls-for-whom-1497536635", "news_title": "The Bell Tolls for \u2018Whom\u2019", "keywords": "correct usage,grammar,proper usage,who and whom,writing,Match.com,OkCupid,Wired,University of Delaware,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,page-one stories,internet,online,media,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "DUBAI\u2014            Daimler AG        DMLRY -0.32%       has bought a stake in the main rival to Uber Technologies Inc. in the Middle East, the latest of a series of investments by the world\u2019s largest car makers in the rapidly expanding ride-hailing sector.The maker of Mercedes-Benz cars took part in the second round of a $500 million fundraising alongside Saudi billionaire Prince       al-Waleed bin Talal\u2019s       investment vehicle Kingdom Holding Co., Careem said on Thursday.

The company didn\u2019t disclose details of its investment in Careem.Daimler\u2019s growing interest in ride-hailing\u2014which allows users to find a vehicle with an app from a smartphone, bypassing conventional taxi switchboards\u2014extends to owning MyTaxi, a taxi-hailing app, and Blacklane, an upscale chauffeur-hailing app. Daimler has launched a joint venture with Bosch GmbH to develop a robot-taxi by the end of the decade.\u201c[T]he future of transport is autonomous,\u201d Careem\u2019s Mr. Sheikha said. \u201cWe are hoping a partnership with [Daimler] will put us on the fast track of innovation,\u201d he said.Careem is working with a U.S. startup to bring battery-powered, self-driving electric pods to the Middle East and North Africa, consistent with Dubai\u2019s goals to make at least a quarter of all trips in the city smart and driverless by 2030.Careem on Thursday said it would use the funds it has raised to gain traction in the region and to develop driverless pods as a new mode of public transportation.In the past six months, Careem started operating in Turkey and in cities in Egypt and Pakistan. The app is popular in Saudi Arabia where women\u2014who make up about two thirds of Careem\u2019s customers in the kingdom\u2014are barred from driving.Careem raised $350 million of the $500 million late last year from investors led by Japan\u2019s Rakuten and Saudi Telecom Co.

Output in April climbed a revised 1.1%, up slightly from an initial estimate of 1%.Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the index to rise 0.1% in May.Manufacturing, the biggest component of industrial production, was the main drag last month. The index dropped 0.4%, partly retracing April\u2019s big gain. Manufacturing output had touched a postrecession high in April.\u201cStepping back from the considerable short-term noise, the trend in core manufacturing output is rising modestly,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients. \u201cSurveys points to continued increases in output, but no boom.\u201dThere were few bright spots in May. Auto production dropped 2%, while metals, wood products, appliances, computers, textiles and other sectors also retrenched.With May\u2019s setback, overall manufacturing output has increased 1.4% over the past 12 months.U.S. factory activity was stagnant through much of 2016 but picked up earlier this year, in line with an improving global economy and rising optimism among U.S. businesses.The Institute for Supply Management earlier this month said its closely watched index of U.S. manufacturing activity rose slightly in May. ISM manufacturing readings for each month this year have been higher than any month in 2015 or 2016.Manufacturing has been shaping up as a bright spot for the economy this year. That stands in contrast to sluggish consumer spending and a widening trade deficit\u2014both economic headwinds. The economy has been stuck near a 2% annual growth rate during most of the nearly eight-year-old expansion.Thursday\u2019s report showed output in the volatile mining sector rose 1.6% in May, pushing the index to the highest level since 2015. The mining index, which includes oil and natural gas extraction, was up 8.3% from a year earlier. The energy sector had been weighed down by weak commodity prices.Utility output advanced 0.4% from the prior month. Utility use is typically more a reflection of the weather than the economy.Overall capacity use, a measure of slack in the economy, decreased 0.1 percentage point to 76.6% in May. Economists had expected 76.7%.Capacity use remains below the long-run average of 79.9%, a sign the economy is operating below its potential.The Federal Reserve\u2019s report on industrial production can be found at:https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/g17/current/default.htm.Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-industrial-production-unchanged-in-may-1497533505", "news_title": "U.S. Industrial Production Unchanged in May ", "keywords": " capacity use, capacity utilization, factory activity, industrial production, manufacturing output, u.s. economic expansion,u.s. industrial output,Federal Reserve,output,production,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,industrial production,capacity utilization,economic news"}, {"content": "Your guide to mastering the lazy summerWHAT\u2019S THE BEST bottle for a languid summer day? What wine pairs well with picnics and pools and games of beach volleyball? I took the laziest route possible in coming up with answers, punting these questions to seven top wine professionals with impeccable taste. They responded with summery reds, whites and ros\u00e9s produced in wine regions all over the world. I did not, however, shirk my wine-columnist duties altogether; I bought each one of their recommendations and tasted them with friends. None of the picks are particularly expensive or hard to find, and they are all incredibly, joyfully easy to drink.John Keife,        Owner, Keife & Co., New OrleansRetailer John Keife\u2019s directive for summer wine drinking in the Big Easy can be summed up as: light and fresh, lower in alcohol and tannin. His lazy-day wine choice, the 2015 Broc Cellars Love White, is a natural wine from a high elevation vineyard in Madera County, Calif., that Mr. Keife calls \u201cliquid sunshine.\u201d A zingy blend of southern Rh\u00f4ne grape varieties, including (mostly) Marsanne and a bit of Roussanne and Viognier, it\u2019s a fleshy medium-bodied wine with a decidedly tropical note.Joe Salamone,        Wine Buyer, Crush Wines & Spirits, New YorkMr. Salamone told me he doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in so-called summer wines, but he does love to drink this Assyrtiko from the arid Greek island of Santorini at this time of year. And rightfully so. This crisp, lively dry white with a decidedly saline note is a wine that I could drink all summer long and well into the fall.Chad L. Walsh, Sommelier, Agern, New YorkThough the list that Mr. Walsh put together at Agern is focused exclusively on American wines, he opts for a Blaufr\u00e4nkisch ros\u00e9 from the Burgenland region of Austria for his own summertime drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect balance of fresh and fruity while not seeming too innocuous,\u201d he said. Mr. Walsh likes the wine even better when it\u2019s upsized to a (two-bottle) magnum size. I had to settle for a regular-size bottle of this pale ros\u00e9 that was pleasingly light-bodied and compulsively drinkable.June Rodil, Beverage Director, McGuire Moorman Hospitality, Austin, TexasWhen Ms. Rodil sits on the porch of her house with friends, this New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is her wine of choice\u2014easy to drink, easy to find and very reasonably priced. It\u2019s dry and lively, with notes of citrus and grapefruit, and especially accessible because of its screw cap.Morgan Calcote,        General Manager, FIG, Charleston, S.C.Ms. Calcote admires both of the ros\u00e9s made by the venerable Ch\u00e2teau Pradeaux\u2014one a light bodied rather simple C\u00f4tes de Provence wine and the other a more complex ros\u00e9 from the Provence subregion of Bandol. But the Bandol ros\u00e9 is her personal and professional choice (she\u2019s adding it to the FIG list). This is a savory, full-bodied dry ros\u00e9 with wonderfully floral aromas and a long mineral finish\u2014the oxymoronic serious ros\u00e9.Tim O\u2019Rourke,        Business Development Manager, Zachys DC, Washington, D.C.Mr. O\u2019Rourke split his bets between red and white with his summer favorite, a slightly spritzy and decidedly zippy wine from the Basque region of Spain. Made from equal parts of two native red and white grapes (Hondarribi Beltza and Hondarribi Zuri), this lighthearted, light-bodied and refreshing ros\u00e9 has a pretty note of red-berry fruit and a slightly (and pleasingly) bitter note.Erik Liedholm,        Wine Director,       John Howie       Restaurant Group, Seattle, Wash.Mr. Liedholm calls this ros\u00e9 \u201cthe wine cooler of your youth but more refined.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty fair description of this low-alcohol (5%) sparkling ros\u00e9, a blend of Moscato and Brachetto produced in the Piedmont region of Italy. Mr. Liedholm suggests pairing the sweet, but not too sweet, fizzy, cherry-red wine with spicy food, although I\u2019d drink it as dessert or perhaps freeze it into popsicles instead.Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 10:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/easy-drinking-summer-wines-what-the-experts-sip-1497535434", "news_title": "Easy-Drinking Summer Wines: What the Experts Sip", "keywords": "best summer red wine,best summer rose,best summer white wine,best summer wines,easy summer wine,recommended summer wines,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,reviews"}, {"content": "Manhattan interior designer Kevin Roberts owns a beach house in the Hamptons with his partner and husband, Timothy Haynes. But when he wants to get away from it all, Mr. Roberts jumps on the ferry for a five-minute ride from the South Fork to Shelter Island, N.Y., where he owns not one, but two antique homes on Gardiners Creek.\u201cMy house in the Hamptons is kept by 20 minions running around,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who often meets clients there. On Shelter Island, he reads, gardens and kayaks between his Dutch gambrel cottage and his 19th century farmhouse, on facing sides of the creek. \u201cI like to mow the lawn myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so private and old-fashioned, and it feels so authentic in every way.\u201dShelter Island\u2014an 8,000-acre island wedged between Long Island\u2019s North and South Forks that can only be reached by ferry or private plane\u2014draws a moneyed crowd in search of a more laid-back vibe, along with a rich history, good sailing, scant traffic and more attractively priced vacation homes than can be found in the nearby Hamptons.\u201cLast year, we sold $60 million in real estate on Shelter Island\u2014that was a banner year,\u201d said Penelope Moore, a real-estate agent with Saunders & Associates. \u201cWhat we are hearing from buyers is that the Hamptons are great, but they are getting too congested\u2014the people that come over here want to be in a quieter place.\u201dShelter Island, whose core population of about 2,400 burgeons to 10,000 in season, has been a vacation destination since the 1870s, when a group of clergymen created a summer retreat of gingerbread cottages for Methodist camp meetings. A large hotel was built soon after: Sections of the golf course at the private Gardiner\u2019s Bay Country Club date to 1896.Many Shelter Islanders have deep roots there\u2014some can trace their family history on the island back to the Colonial period\u2014and are wary of overdevelopment. Concerned by the prospect of a freewheeling Airbnb-style tourist culture, the island\u2019s town board recently passed a measure to regulate short-term rentals, which prevents property owners from renting out their homes more than once in a two-week period.\u201cYou never want to say no, but we also want Shelter Island to stay quiet,\u201d said Craig Wood, Shelter Island town assessor.The market for vacation homes has tightened, with sales prices that are now surpassing prerecession levels in some categories. \u201cUnder $1 million, I have very little to show,\u201d said Catherine Debackere, an agent with Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. On the high end, she is showing a 5,400-square-foot home priced at $4.7 million; \u201cIf that house were in the Hamptons, it would be $6 million at least,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not precious, and people sort of want to keep it that way\u2014thank God that ferry keeps people away,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who bought his first home\u2014Creek Cottage, a Dutch gambrel built for the island\u2019s first chaplain in the 1730s\u2014for $1.25 million in 2014, according to public records. The cottage is set within the gates of Sylvester Manor, a 243-acre nonprofit educational farm with a 1737 Georgian manor house that has remained in the same family for 11 generations\u2014and which had long fascinated Mr. Roberts.Shortly after he bought the cottage, Mr. Roberts learned a picturesque 19th-century yellow farmhouse opposite the creek was for sale. \u201cWhen it looked like someone was going to buy it and rip it down, I threw all caution to the winds and bought it.\u201dMr. Roberts paid $1.6 million last year for the house, called the Homestead, records show. He has stabilized an original circa-1750 portion, put on a wood shake roof, and is in the process of installing a heating and cooling system\u2014part of a continuing restoration. He said the cost far exceeds any reasonable return on his investment. \u201cIt has nothing to do with real-estate values\u2014but a love for the island and an interest in preserving two historic properties,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who intends to bequeath both homes to Shelter Island when he dies.Some rooms are being left in their faded glory\u2014like the dining room with peacock wallpaper dating to 1907 and a centuries-old sideboard, which Mr. Roberts bought from Glorian Dorsey, the 83-year-old matriarch of the family who had owned the house since prerevolutionary times. \u201cThat wallpaper was given to Glorian Dorsey\u2019s grandmother on her wedding day. It\u2019s peeling off and I\u2019ll never touch it,\u201d said Mr. Roberts.\u201cI love what he\u2019s doing\u2014he\u2019s made wonderful changes,\u201d said Ms. Dorsey, who has become a close friend, staying in her old pink bedroom on visits from her home in Maryland.Ms. Dorsey doesn\u2019t approve of other changes to the island\u2014notably, Sunset Beach, the celebrity-friendly hotel and restaurant that Andr\u00e9 Balazs opened in 1997. \u201cShelter Island was not a fancy place, not until Andr\u00e9 Balazs ruined it,\u201d Ms. Dorsey said. \u201cThe secret got out. There are a lot of people with too much money and not enough taste.\u201d Mr. Balazs couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Bill Persky, an Emmy-award winning producer, director writer whose credits include \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cThat Girl\u201d and \u201cKate & Allie,\u201d built a waterfront home on Shelter Island\u2019s West Neck Bay 20 years ago after spotting the site from his boat.Mr. Persky, 85, and his wife, Joanna Patton, spent close to $2 million to create their Shelter Island compound: a 2-acre property shaded by Norwegian spruce trees, with a 2,500-square-foot main house whose contours evoke a billowing sail, as well as a guesthouse and a pool.\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Hamptons where there are a thousand places to go\u2014there\u2019s one coffee shop and you see everybody there,\u201d said Mr. Persky, who is more likely to be found at the annual firehouse barbecue than a bash at Sunset Beach. \u201cThere\u2019s never any traffic\u2014I don\u2019t think we have a traffic light.\u201d (Shelter Island has no traffic lights. \u201cAnd in the winter they remove some of the \u2018Stop\u2019 signs,\u201d Ms. Moore said.)Stephen Harvey, an Egyptologist, and his partner, Perry Sayles, a designer, bought a 1788 Colonial farmhouse for $765,000 in 2014 after selling their home in Sagaponack. \u201cIt was \u2018On Goldman Pond\u2019,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, 51, of his former Hamptons neighborhood and its investment-banker denizens.The couple spent another $410,000 on improvements. While digging a pool trench, they discovered a trove of artifacts: bits of shell-edged pearlware, a Native American grinding stone, a pitchfork and a broken champagne flute dating from about 1810. \u201cThere\u2019s this layering, and the feeling of all these families who have come and gone,\u201d Mr. Harvey said.Other vestiges of Shelter Island\u2019s past are disappearing. All but a few of the tiny fisherman\u2019s shacks that once dotted Little Ram Island, a narrow peninsula, have been replaced by sprawling multimillion-dollar homes.Nor is the island immune to Hamptons-style spats between neighbors. In Dering Harbor\u2014a tiny village with a year-round population of 11, according to a 2016 U.S. Census Bureau estimate\u2014village authorities have taken residents to court for planting hedges without permits.Patrick Parcells, who is selling his 5,000-square-foot home in Dering Harbor Village for $5.675 million, ran an unsuccessful 2014 campaign for mayor of Dering Harbor against the incumbent Tim Hogue\u2014currently serving his 13th two-year term. More recently, he has challenged the eligibility of some voters in village elections\u2014notably, out-of-state adult offspring of vacation-home owners.\u201cI love the village and I\u2019m going to continue to live in it, but the people who run the village have been running it for 30 years,\u201d said Mr. Parcells, a 66-year-old retired banker. \u201cThe mayor in particular is very litigious.\u201dMr. Hogue defended his role in hedge-gate. \u201cYou need to apply for a permit for a hedge, which is considered a fence,\u201d he said.Mr. Parcells said his six-bedroom house is too big for his family now that his son is in college. The home and its 7.6 acres are part of a 19-acre property that Mr. Parcells purchased for $2 million in 2001; once an arboretum, it features an allee of weeping beech trees, a 19th-century barn and a restored glass conservatory. Buyers have the option to acquire additional acreage and a deep-water dock.Mr. Parcells, who is reserving 3 acres for a smaller home, said his political opponents are still good neighbors. \u201cWe play golf,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree about everything, but we\u2019re able to get along.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications: A prior version of this story incorrectly stated that the farmhouse of Stephen Harvey and Perry Sayles is circa 1778.", "news_time": "2017-06-15 09:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-buyers-flock-to-shelter-island-1497534873", "news_title": "Home Buyers Flock to Shelter Island", "keywords": " hamptons alternatives, long island, luxury homes, real estate,shelter island, vacation homes,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,construction"}, {"content": "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week, remaining at a low level in line with a healthy U.S. labor market.Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., declined by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 in the week ended June 10, the Labor Department said Thursday.\u201cClaims remain low, consistent with the trend in employment growth remaining more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down,\u201d said       Jim O\u2019Sullivan,        chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 240,000 new claims last week. Initial claims for the week ended June 3 were left unrevised at 245,000.Figures for jobless claims can be volatile from week to week. The four-week moving average for initial claims edged up by 1,000 last week to 243,000.Low claims can signal that relatively few companies are laying off workers, a sign of health in the broader economy, though claims have continued to edge down in recent years despite a fairly steady pace of layoffs and discharges. Weekly claims have remained below 300,000 for 119 consecutive weeks, the longest such streak since 1970\u2014when the U.S. population and workforce were far smaller than they are today.The labor market has tightened in recent years and the unemployment rate in May fell to 4.3%, its lowest level since 2001.

Over in Switzerland, others can line up to eat in a hut made of bundles of shiny cookware\u2014a performance by Indian artist Subodh Gupta that opened Monday to VIPs at Art Basel. The fair, part of a marathon of European art events, opens to the public on Thursday and runs through Sunday.Last week, the destination was a pair of exhibitions\u2014Documenta in Kassel and the Sculpture Projects in M\u00fcnster\u2014that are held throughout these German cities every five and 10 years, respectively. The Grand Tour kicked off in Italy, with last month\u2019s launch of the Venice Biennale, an Olympics-style showcase that runs through Nov. 26. At month\u2019s end, the intrepid will round out the continental circuit at a set of London auctions.By this point, savvy art travelers have swapped their high heels for comfy sneakers; they\u2019ve also started to pinpoint their favorite shows\u2014and artists. S\u00e3o Paulo investor Pedro Barbosa, who is trying to hit all the stops, said the opening festivities in Venice \u201cfelt like a car dealership\u201d because galleries were trying to sell so many of the works on display. By contrast, Mr. Barbosa said the atmosphere over the past weekend at Documenta felt \u201cpurer, which was fantastic.\u201dDocumenta was founded in 1955 as a way for Kassel to catch up on the modern art it missed during the Nazi years. The event is still known for asking audiences to do a lot of hard thinking about political, environmental and social ills. For the first time, artistic director Adam Szymczyk split the show, opening a version earlier this spring in Athens that allowed artists to weigh in on Greece\u2019s economic woes. That iteration closes July 16.For its Kassel counterpart, Mr. Szymczyk said he invited some artists to mull Germany\u2019s legacy, including the issue of Nazi-looted art. As a result, many of the pieces installed throughout the city\u2019s museums and parks, as well as the local train station and a former tofu factory, explore haunting aspects of war, memory, labor and money. \u201cI want this show to be intelligent,\u201d Mr. Szymczyk said.The showstopper is Argentine artist Marta Minuj\u00edn\u2019s \u201cParthenon of Books,\u201d a temple with towering metal columns covered with nearly 50,000 books that were or are banned somewhere in the world. Ms. Minuj\u00edn erected her \u201cParthenon\u201d in a plaza where Nazis once burned books. Her library, gathered through donations, will be given away when the show ends.In a nearby museum called the New Gallery, Belgium-based artist P\u00e9lagie Gbaguidi has also transformed an airy corridor into something of a maze by hanging dozens of paper scrolls from strings near the ceiling. Each narrow strip of paper is covered in drawings she made after researching racist laws embedded in historical archives in Kassel and South Africa. Despite the grim subject matter, the figures and markings on these scrolls are surprisingly cheery. \u201cThe joy is my way of rebuilding history,\u201d Ms. Gbaguidi said.Other Documenta highlights include Los Angeles-based artist Ben Russell\u2019s \u201cGood Luck,\u201d a film installation about gold and copper miners in Suriname and Serbia that the artist arranged in barrel-ceiling cellar of the Fridericianum museum. Israeli filmmaker Roee Rosen has attracted crowds to the top floor of another site, the Bellevue Palace, with \u201cDust Channel,\u201d his comic-relief meditation on the myriad uses for vacuum cleaners.Kassel may be nudging its audience to work on the world\u2019s problems, but playful distractions abound 90 miles northwest in M\u00fcnster. That city\u2019s Sculpture Project, which has been commissioning groups of artworks once a decade since 1977, unveiled 35 new sculptures and installations on Saturday. The pieces are almost all interactive and crop up in unlikely places, such as French artist Pierre Huyghe\u2019s earthy excavation of a former ice-skating rink, \u201cAfter ALife Ahead,\u201d which the artist partially repopulated with peacocks, a pair of beehives and a fish tank.Independent curator Germano Celant waited almost an hour to enter German artist Gregor Schneider\u2019s funhouse apartment piece, \u201cN. Schmidt.\u201d Mr. Schneider, who is known for reworking domestic spaces in wry ways, has created what appears to be a mysterious apartment within the city\u2019s Museum of Art and Culture. To reach Mr. Schneider\u2019s rooms, visitors must find a tiny apartment buzzer beside a nondescript side door of the museum. Here\u2019s a hint for appreciating the installation: Keep opening doors, even if you think you\u2019ve walked through them already.\u201cHe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d Mr. Celant said of the artist.Istanbul-born artist Ay\u015fe Erkmen\u2019s installation, \u201cOn Water,\u201d allows people to take a different type of leap. Ms. Erkmen built a metal bridge connecting opposite sides of a bustling harbor of the Dortmund-Ems Canal\u2014and then submerged the platform roughly a foot under water.

Water managers say they have left enough room in most reservoirs to handle the runoff.With heavy snow in the southern Sierra this year, one of the biggest property risks from rapid snowmelt is to infrastructure the city of Los Angeles maintains as part of its extensive system of funneling mountain water 200 miles south from the Owens Valley.It is among the biggest snowpacks on record mountain-wide, and the largest in certain places such as the southern Sierra Nevada which tower above the Owen Lake area.State and local officials warn the worst could be to come, if mountains been buried under more than double their normal amount of snow get hit with much more precipitation in the coming weeks. The Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, for example, still has up to 20 feet of snow on the ground and has plans to stay open through August. Another foot of snow fell at high elevations above Lake Tahoe last weekend, in a rare June wintry storm.\u201cThe real wild card is if we get hit with a big rain event,\u201d said Frank Gehrke, chief snow surveyor for the California Department of Water Resources, as he monitored a rushing stream near this Eastern Sierra city in late May. \u201cThat could throw the whole system into tilt.\u201dRunoff problems also are of concern in Colorado and other mountain states which received heavy snow this winter. Canada already has faced severe runoff problems, after a heat wave earlier this spring resulted in major\u00a0flooding\u00a0in Quebec and British Columbia.Rapid snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada has caused widespread damage in the past. In 1997, a deluge of rain from a succession of tropical storms in midwinter melted so much snow that rivers surged out of their banks\u2014leaving nine people dead and an estimated $2 billion in damage in\u00a0Northern and Central\u00a0California.In anticipation of the threat this year, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a disaster declaration in March to help expedite work to protect an estimated $1.1 billion in equipment for dust control on Owens Lake. That equipment includes pumps and pipelines to help keep down dust, as part of a court-ordered agreement to help mitigate Los Angeles\u2019s diversion of waters flowing into the desert lake which resulted in it drying out a century ago.Crews since then have been busy putting in sandbags, K-Rail barriers and taking other steps to keep equipment dry, while working upstream to reduce the amount of water in some streams.On a sage-covered hill a few miles from the lake, Todd Bunn, a construction and maintenance supervisor for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently showed where one big creek had been split into several small ones by digging trenches for the water to spread into.\u201cWe\u2019ll manage this chaos by slowing down the water and spreading it out,\u201d Mr. Bunn said.Mr. Garcetti said he hopes the measures will be enough, but can\u2019t know for sure yet.\u201cThe melting has really only just begun so we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said the mayor, who in early May toured the Owens Valley. \u201cWe can only do more than we have ever done before.\u201dSome places have already had close calls with disaster. In February, local officials in Churchill County, Nev., about 60 miles east of Reno noticed Lake Lahontan had risen to fill one fifth of its 295,000 acre-foot capacity in just five days\u2014posing a flooding threat to the city of Fallon about six miles downstream.\u201cI woke up thinking, \u2018My gosh, this is going to be catastrophic. We have to do something\u2019,\u201d said Churchill County Commissioner Pete Olsen, who helped initiate work on an emergency water diversion.State and local crews along with the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District within days began clearing debris out of the Carson River, which empties out of the lake and runs through the town of 8,600 residents, and built a detour for the excess\u00a0water.A hastily built weir was installed to divert the water south of Fallon. There, crews assisted by a volunteer brigade of farmers using their tractors spent six weeks digging a 17-mile ditch to complete the water\u2019s journey around populated areas. The completion on May 10 was celebrated with a ceremonial bucket of mud.So much snowmelt water has poured into the river since then that officials believe they have averted flooding, but worry the threat to the community isn\u2019t over.\u201cI feel comfortable if the water comes down at the same rate, but if we get a weather event all bets are off,\u201d said Bill Lawry, former Fallon fire chief and the county\u2019s incident commander for flood response.Other flood-prone areas are taking protective measures. In this city of about 4,000 people, officials have staged bulldozers and other equipment to help clear debris jams at places along creeks that have flooded in the past. Sandbags are also being given out to residents, including 88-year-old Marvin Nelligan, who deployed about two dozen to help protect his home along fast-moving North Fork Bishop Creek.\u201cAs you can see there\u2019s a lot of water coming down,\u201d Mr. Nelligan, a retired engineer, shouted above the torrent in late May.Bill Lutze, the sheriff of surrounding Inyo County, said the sound of rising waters in the creek behind his home above tiny Independence, Calif. recently woke him at\u00a03 a.m.\u00a0Some residents of a nearby subdivision became so concerned the same night they put up sandbags, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re at the whim of Mother Nature,\u201d Mr. Lutze said. \u201cWhatever she brings us we will have to deal with.\u201dWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-brace-for-flooding-as-sierras-historic-snowpack-melts-1497531600", "news_title": "States Brace for Flooding as Sierra\u2019s Historic Snowpack Melts", "keywords": "political,general news,disasters,accidents,floods,tidal waves,natural disasters,catastrophes,risk news,weather,water utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "DETROIT\u2014            Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 0.67%       NV said Thursday it is recalling nearly 300,000 minivans to fix faulty wiring that could lead air bags to deploy unintentionally, a condition it linked to eight injuries.The auto maker said wiring in certain 2011-2012 model year Dodge Grand Caravan minivans could short circuit, causing inadvertent deployment of the driver-side front air bag.

One is to look at what the Federal Reserve says, compare it to your own forecasts for inflation, growth, productivity and wages, and decide whether Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen was right to show a flicker of hawkishness on Wednesday. This is what almost every major fund manager does, investing huge amounts of time and effort in econometric analysis. Most is wasted.The alternative is to look at the market\u2019s assumptions to see what\u2019s being ignored. Right now, it is the reflation trade, abandoned along with       Donald Trump\u2019s       credibility on Wall Street.After the election investors bet big on Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress adopting growth-friendly tax cuts, spending boosts and cuts to red tape. The Fed, they thought, wouldn\u2019t derail growth. Since shortly after the Fed\u2019s mid-December increase, investor assumptions have completely reversed. A divided Congress won\u2019t be able to do anything, the Fed might be making a mistake to tighten and inflation isn\u2019t just resting, it is in a coma.The reverse of the reflation trade is visible in equities, bonds and the economy. How one feels about it depends on a critical shift by the Fed, from being \u201cdata dependent\u201d\u2014backward looking\u2014to return to the traditional central bank approach of setting policy according to what it expects to happen, not what\u2019s already happened.The data on which the Fed no longer depends have indeed shown little of the dynamism needed to justify rate increases on a backward-looking basis. Wages have been rising fast in some sectors, but overall are growing only a little above inflation, despite unemployment well below the Fed\u2019s estimate of what counts as full employment (which Fed policy makers keep cutting, with the median estimate down again on Wednesday to 4.6%). Inflation remains stubbornly below the Fed\u2019s target. And economic data has been disappointing, with the most unpleasant surprises compared with forecasts in more than two years, according to a             Citigroup                   index.Yet, all this and more is now priced in. The bond market is priced for inflation over the next 10 years to average just 1.72%, now below both where it stood on election day and the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The 10-year Treasury yield is back down to where it was the day after the election, and on Wednesday its post-Fed rise wasn\u2019t enough to offset its drop in response to earlier disappointing inflation figures. As a result, the closely watched gap between 2-year and 10-year yields dropped below 0.8% for the first time since last summer\u2019s fears of deflation. In the past when it is fallen below zero a recession has almost always followed.Back in late November and December I was skeptical that Mr. Trump could deliver enough to justify the massive run-up in cyclical stocks and bond yields, which seemed to be based on wild overexcitement from investors. Now those same investors expect the administration to achieve nothing and have returned to their pre-election gloom about the economy. Again, the received wisdom seems to have gone too far, and again relies on too much guesswork.Investors should accept that they know far less about what\u2019s likely to happen to growth, wages and inflation than economists like to make out. Assumptions about the level of full employment or how inflation responds to full employment are little better than guesswork.The Fed may turn out to be right this time, and wages and then inflation may pick up as job vacancies prove hard to fill. Further, the Republicans will surely soon realize that they have to pull together and pass something\u2014anything\u2014on tax and red tape to avoid going into next year\u2019s midterm elections with nothing to show voters.Economic and political analysis is worth trying. But the hurdle to success for the reflation trade is much lower, and the idea that Mrs. Yellen might be right this time is worth a punt.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'This Time, the Fed May Turn Out to Be Correct.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 08:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-radical-thought-for-investors-1497530360", "news_title": "A Radical Thought for Investors ", "keywords": "fed rates,treasury yields,us economy,us recession,us unemployment,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news"}, {"content": "MetLife Inc.        MET 0.35%       Chief Executive       Steven Kandarian       widened the circle of potential candidates to succeed him, giving two senior executives significant additional responsibilities, the company said Thursday.Mr. Kandarian has no plans to retire\u00a0even though he is at MetLife\u2019s customary retirement age of 65. Last year, the company\u2019s board waived its age policy indefinitely so he could stay on. The board said at the time it wanted him to continue as CEO while the nation\u2019s biggest life insurer\u00a0spins off a large chunk of its U.S. life-insurance operations.In Thursday\u2019s move, MetLife named       Michel Khalaf,        53 years old, president of its U.S. business. Mr. Khalaf will retain his role as president of the company\u2019s European, Middle East and African operations.Executive Vice President       Marty Lippert,        57, who is responsible for MetLife\u2019s technology, customer service and some other operational matters, will now also assume responsibility for MetLife Holdings. That unit holds blocks of business in which the company has discontinued new sales.At least three other executives at MetLife are in potential position to be promoted to MetLife\u2019s top job, according to executive recruiters and analysts. Those are Chief Investment Officer       Steven J. Goulart,        Chief Financial Officer       John C.R. Hele,        and       Christopher G. Townsend,        who is president of the company\u2019s large Asia region.Typically, corporate boards also look at outside candidates for the CEO spot.MetLife had planned to complete its divestiture by June 30, but is behind schedule. The company is expected to obtain approval from Delaware insurance regulators\u2014the lead state insurance department in the matter\u2014in early July, according to Evercore ISI analyst       Thomas Gallagher.       It is unclear how soon the spinoff would occur once that approval is in hand.The spinoff will move the historic core of the nearly 150-year-old company\u2014selling life insurance to U.S. households\u2014into a new company named Brighthouse Financial. The remaining MetLife will be focused on group life-insurance and other benefits sold to employers, its international network of life-insurance operations and some other businesses.By splitting apart, MetLife also believes it can avoid being redesignated as a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d by a panel of federal regulators. Last year, a federal court rescinded the label in a legal challenge brought by MetLife, and the matter is now in the hands of a federal appellate court.Mr. Khalaf joined MetLife in 2010 through the company\u2019s acquisition of an international network of life-insurance companies from             American International Group Inc.Prior to joining MetLife in 2011, Mr. Lippert was a senior executive at             Citigroup                   and other banks.Mr. Kandarian has been president and CEO since May 2011 and added the title of chairman in January 2012. He joined MetLife in 2005 as its investment chief.MetLife also said Thursday it has named       Ramy Tadros       as chief risk officer. Mr. Tadros had run the insurance practice at consultancy Oliver Wyman.

The network is dropping its longtime marketing slogan \u201cFair & Balanced,\u201d New York Magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman reports. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance of what shedding \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 means for Fox News,\u201d Mr. Sherman writes. \u201cIt would be like the New York Times giving up \u2018All the News That\u2019s Fit to Print\u2019\u201d--which might not be that far off given the way print circulations are going. Shedding the slogan seems, from the outside, to be symbolic. It was invented by Roger Ailes, the network\u2019s former chief executive, who was ousted last year and died last month. Fox now leads with its other marketing line, \u201cMost Watched. Most Trusted.\u201d Fox News confirmed that the slogan was dropped in August 2016, but said \u201cthe shift has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions.\u201d 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.Could the promise of \u201caddressable TV\u201d finally be happening? There certainly has been some movement in the U.K. Archrivals Sky and Virgin Media\u2014the two biggest pay-TV providers in the U.K., with 57% and 23% of the market, respectively, according to Kantar Worldpanel\u2014have formed an unlikely ad sales partnership that will allow advertisers to target specific audiences across their combined 30 million set-top-box customers during linear TV ad breaks and video on demand, the Financial Times reports.--This is significant--The sales agreement will use Sky\u2019s existing AdSmart technology, which offers superspecific targeting options, such as whether a viewer has a south-facing garden or whether his or her car insurance is up for renewal. But as targeting gets more defined, the audience gets a lot smaller, which is why AdSmart has been fairly niche to date. This partnership helps extend its reach. At a time when Google and Facebook are making no bones about going after TV\u2019s money, TV is using technology to fight back. The pair punch home in the press release that the combined audience puts the partnership \u201con a par with leading social networks\u201d and that TV environments are \u201cbrand safe\u201d with \u201ctrusted measurement.\u201dInstagram has launched a tool so influencers can more clearly display when they have been paid to promote a product, Wired reports. The launch of the tool is timely, as a report published by influencer marketing agency Mediakix just a couple of days ago found Instagram\u2019s most-followed celebrities fail to label their promoted posts in accordance with FTC advertising guidelines 93% of the time. The tool, which displays \u201cpaid partnership with [brand]\u201d above a promoted photo, will help bring some consistency in an ugly web of #spon and #ad tags, which easily can be glossed over (or craftily hidden from view with the help of a few taps of the return key when writing a caption). Instagram is adding a layer of analytics for the marketers and influencers that use the tag to track how well their promotions are performing, dangling a carrot that should encourage more transparency.Kids are just so darn dumb.

He has now essentially merged that fund into his startup, CSC Generation, along with new investors.His CSC Generation has raised $10 million in financing led by China-based private-equity firm CSC Group, with participation from Khosla Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Maveron, Quest Venture Partners, Scrum Ventures, VTF, Rivet Ventures, OVO Fund, and eCommerce Growth Fund. The company has additional commitments for more funding, he said.E-commerce sites that CSC Generation have bought include jewelry site Ice.com; Directbuy.com, an online buying club akin to Costco; and bungalowclothing.com. The company also aims to launch its own e-commerce sites.While those sites have grown, the company is also focusing on using data from them to provide consumer lending to its customers.CSC Generation offers the ability for consumers to lease products, such as jewelry, apparel, handbags or electronics\u2014many of which consumers buy but only use for a couple of years, Mr. Yoshimura said. CSC\u2019s leases are currently for about six to nine months. The subscription economy, with media companies such as Netflix, has grown, but hasn\u2019t extended to other physical products, he said.\u201cYou can lease a car, but why not jewelry, apparel, a purse or a MacBook?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more consumer-friendly and environmentally-friendly way of consuming products.\u201dTo provide leases, CSC Generation builds a profile on its users based on a trove of data, such as how much time users spend on the sites, how many and which products they look at, what device they\u2019re using and even where they live.\u201cOur vision is you\u2019re able to lease any product,\u201d Mr. Yoshimura said. \u201cWe have a very low default rate\u2014much lower than other companies.\u201dUnlike other firms, CSC Generation can also adjust leases on specific products. For example, it can provide more leases and take more risk for products that have higher margins, Mr. Yoshimura said.The company can also use nontraditional credit checks. For example, if a user is rejected for a lease, CSC Generation can ask customers to log-in with LinkedIn to verify employment and other information. This could be useful, for example, for a professional who moves to the U.S. but doesn\u2019t have a U.S. credit score.\u201cIf a bank rejects you (for a loan), you\u2019re done,\u201d Mr. Yoshimura said. \u201cIf we reject you because you have no credit history, why not use alternative data resources to approve you?\u201dThe company currently keeps all the loans on its books, but aims to securitize loans eventually.Mr. Yoshimura was previously founder of 500friends, which provided loyalty and other incentive programs for e-commerce companies, and was acquired in 2014 by Merkle Inc.CSC Generation has hired Praveen Rao, formerly of             JP Morgan Chase,Western Union                   and             Visa,       as its president.\u201cJustin is exactly the type of scrappy, creative entrepreneur I want to work with,\u201d said Tom Cole, managing partner at Hone Capital, the U.S. arm of CSC Group.Write to Tomio Geron at tomio.geron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/csc-generation-turns-ecommerce-sites-into-product-leasing-1497526201", "news_title": "CSC Generation Turns Ecommerce Sites into Product Leasing", "keywords": "CSC Group,CSC Generation,corporate,industrial news,entrepreneurs,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       firing of former FBI Director James Comey is now a subject of the federal probe being headed by special counsel Robert Mueller, which has expanded to include whether the president obstructed justice, a person familiar with the matter said.Mr. Mueller is examining whether the president fired Mr. Comey as part of a broader effort to alter the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether associates of Mr. Trump colluded with Moscow, the person said.Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, denounced the revelation in a statement.\u201cThe FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,\u201d Mr. Corallo said.Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to the new turn in Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry came early Thursday morning in the form of a tweet. He suggested that he is unhappy with the focus on obstruction of justice, given that he believes there was no underlying crime.\u201cThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.Aides to Mr. Trump have warned him not to tweet about the Russia investigation, an inquiry in which any statement he makes could become fodder for investigators.Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller, declined to comment. The special counsel\u2019s pursuit of an obstruction of justice probe was first reported Wednesday by the Washington Post.Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is planning to interview Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director       Mike Rogers       as part of its examination of whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct justice, the person said.The special counsel also plans to interview Rick Ledgett, who recently retired as the deputy director of the NSA, the person added.While Mr. Ledgett was still in office, he wrote a memo documenting a phone call that Mr. Rogers had with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. During the call, the president questioned the veracity of the intelligence community\u2019s judgment that Russia had interfered with the election and tried to persuade Mr. Rogers to say there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russian officials, they said.Russia has denied any government effort to meddle in the U.S. election. Mr. Ledgett declined to comment, and officials at the NSA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. An aide to Mr. Coats declined to comment.Mr. Coats and Mr. Rogers told a Senate panel June 7 that they didn\u2019t feel pressured by Mr. Trump to intervene with Mr. Comey or push back against allegations of possible collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. But the top national security officials declined to say what, if anything, Mr. Trump requested they do in relation to the Russia probe.\u201cIf the special prosecutor called upon me to meet with him to ask his questions, I said I would be willing to do that,\u201d Mr. Coats said June 7. Mr. Rogers said he would also be willing to meet with the special counsel\u2019s team.Mr. Comey told a Senate panel on June 8 that Mr. Trump expressed \u201chope\u201d in a one-on-one Oval Office meeting that the FBI would drop its investigation into former national security adviser       Michael Flynn,        who resigned under pressure for making false statements about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. Mr. Trump has denied making that request.Mr. Comey said during the testimony that it was up to Mr. Mueller to decide whether the president\u2019s actions amounted to obstruction of justice. The former FBI director also said he had furnished the special counsel with memos he wrote documenting his interactions with the president on the matter.At a June 13 hearing at a House of Representatives panel, Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       declined to say who asked him to write a memo justifying Mr. Comey\u2019s firing. The White House initially cited that memo as the reason for the termination, and Mr. Trump later said in an NBC interview that he also was influenced by the Russia investigation. Mr. Rosenstein said he wasn\u2019t at liberty to discuss the matter.\u201cThe reason for that is that if it is within the scope of Director Mueller\u2019s investigation, and I\u2019ve been a prosecutor for 27 years, we don\u2019t want people talking publicly about the subjects of ongoing investigations,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said.\u2014Carol E.

The news comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with its forecast.For three MPC members\u2014      Kristin Forbes,       Ian McCafferty       and       Michael Saunders      \u2014intensifying inflationary pressures justified an immediate increase in the BOE\u2019s benchmark rate to 0.5%, a move that would reverse the quarter-point cut implemented in August.The remaining five members of the panel, including Gov.       Mark Carney,        voted to stay put for now, citing uncertainty over the outlook for growth, the minutes record. One seat on the nine-member panel is currently vacant following the departure in February of Deputy Governor       Minouche Shafik.All eight officials agreed, though, that their tolerance for rising inflation is wearing thin. Officials had previously said they were prepared to tolerate a burst of rapid price-growth to keep the economy on an even keel as the U.K. began exit talks with the European Union.But the minutes record their unease after annual inflation accelerated to 2.9% in May, well in excess of the BOE\u2019s 2% goal and the bank\u2019s own forecasts. They also noted the economy appeared poised to recover somewhat in the second quarter after a soft start to the year and that the labor market remained healthy.\u201cOverall, the degree of spare capacity in the economy appeared limited, but, at the same time, the inflation overshoot relative to the target could be more pronounced than previously thought,\u201d the minutes record.With inflation accelerating and promising signals on growth, \u201cthere were arguments in favor of a moderate tightening in monetary policy,\u201d the MPC said.The minutes of June\u2019s meeting contained other signals that officials are adopting a more hawkish stance on borrowing costs. A statement included as recently as May that interest rates could be cut as well as raised was dropped. Officials noted that domestic inflationary pressures in the British economy appeared to be intensifying. And they sounded upbeat on the prospects for exports and business investment to power growth while squeezed consumers take a breather.Joanna Davies,        senior economist at Fathom Consulting in London, said it is possible the MPC may raise the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate later this year to reverse August\u2019s cut to 0.25%. But she said she doubted such a move would be followed by others.\u201cWith economic growth set to soften, we would not view any such move as a step on the road to policy normalization, despite the more hawkish tone of this month\u2019s MPC meeting,\u201d she said.The minutes made no reference to last week\u2019s election in the U.K., which cost Prime Minister       Theresa May       her Parliamentary majority. The surprise result has raised doubts about Mrs. May\u2019s future as leader and her government\u2019s Brexit strategy.Mr. Carney had been due to speak Thursday alongside the U.K.\u2019s Treasury chief,       Philip Hammond,        at an annual gathering of bankers in London\u2019s financial district.

Instead, the city said this week the funding only would be enough to protect the neighborhood from a smaller, 10-year event.A feasibility study estimated a larger project would cost about $300 to $500 million or more.City officials said the new plans are the best approach to protect Red Hook with the available funds without requiring drastic changes to the neighborhood\u2019s physical landscape. The city is constricted in how it can spend the money because some of the funds are federal dollars.In Red Hook, the city plans to elevate Beard Street, along the neighborhood\u2019s southwesterly shore, allowing the road to serve as a kind of barrier between the community and the water. The groundwork would be prepared for a larger project if more funding became available in the future, city officials said.In August, a temporary barrier\u2014made up of sand bags and stacks of tubes known as Tiger Dams\u2014will be installed, the city said.The news marks the first time the city has said it would scale back plans for one of the major storm-protection projects aimed at safeguarding its coastline in the wake of the 2012 storm. Sandy left more than 130 people dead and caused an estimated $19 billion in damages in New York City.Scientists have said the city is increasingly vulnerable to flooding because of rising seas and climate change.The fate of the project could spell trouble for other, similar initiatives in Staten Island, Queens and along the east coast of Manhattan. Experts have said bringing the storm-protection initiatives to fruition could cost far more than initially was believed years ago.Councilman       Carlos Menchaca,        a Democrat who represents and lives in Red Hook, which suffered pervasive flooding during the 2012 superstorm, said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated.\u201dWhile he is grateful for the funding going toward the 10-year flood-protection project, he said the state and city should put more money toward the initiative.\u201cI\u2019m frustrated that we\u2019ve waited this long to get to this point,\u201d Mr. Menchaca said.The Red Hook project is a joint initiative between New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio.The state\u2019s $50 million contribution toward the Red Hook project will be paid for with a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant. The mayor plans to use city capital dollars to shoulder New York City\u2019s share of the project, after millions of federal dollars slated for it were diverted to fund Build it Back, the city\u2019s initiative to rebuild and elevate homes damaged by the storm, instead.

That makes Glencore\u2019s gambit to poach Rio Tinto\u2019s Australian coal assets from rival Chinese suitor             Yancoal        YAL -11.25%       for $2.55 billion an interesting case.Glencore\u2019s        GLNCY 1.02%       bid is typical of its opportunistic approach to asset-buying. The Swiss-based company already owns most of the coal assets surrounding Rio\u2019s mines. Blending Rio\u2019s high-quality coal with its own lower quality coal would improve the price it gets in Asian markets. Glencore should enjoy significant operational synergies with its existing mines, especially if it also buys out the adjacent mines owned by             Mitsubishi,       as planned. UBS puts its potential cost savings at $300 million or more. And Glencore is offering only $100 million more than Yancoal.But it\u2019s still a hefty premium: RBC Capital Markets estimated Rio\u2019s coal assets were worth only $2.2 billion at January spot prices, a few dollars higher than today\u2019s.For its billions, Glencore would get the risk of increased exposure to coal\u2014and finicky Chinese regulators. The main problem is the outlook for coal itself. Thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has the dubious distinction of being one of the most volatile commodities in recent years. Botched mine closures ordered by Chinese regulators sent prices in Asia up 90% from June to October 2016; over the next three months, they fell 20%.Misjudging the coal market has already helped sink Glencore\u2019s old rival Noble\u2014one reason the bid by Yancoal, which is 13% owned by Noble, is under threat. And while China\u2019s efforts to cut coal dependence have borne mixed fruit to date, the political rationale for appeasing citizens unhappy with terrible air pollution\u2014and potentially importing a lot more clean-burning U.S. natural gas\u2014is clear.Such trends make thermal coal a risky bet. Glencore shareholders might be better served if the company further diversified into agricultural commodities: Its recent overture toward agricultural heavyweight Bunge shows it is already interested.If Glencore does go ahead with its bid, Rio would be wise to accept.

The House of Representatives must also pass the measure for it to become law.On Thursday, Mr. Putin spoke for the first time about the June 12 protests that saw nearly 2,000 demonstrators detained across Russia, according to human-rights groups. He said that protests were acceptable as long as demonstrators didn\u2019t break any laws, but accused protest leaders of using them to try to boost their standing.\u201cOne thing is to organize protests. It is something else to use these rallies as an instrument of provocation and exacerbate the situation, for self-promotion,\u201d he told journalists after the program.When asked by the BBC about detained protest leader Alexei Navalny, Mr. Putin accused the U.K. state broadcaster of disseminating propaganda in support of the opposition blogger.This year\u2019s session highlighted some of the problems everyday Russians face. A 24-year-old woman with terminal cancer said she had been misdiagnosed because a local hospital had been closed.One group of people complained about a stinking waste dump near their house in Moscow region that a reporter said could be seen from space.\u201cI totally understand you,\u201d responded Mr. Putin, before discussing investment to combat waste issues.The problem has \u201cpiled up for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to do something as quickly as possible.\u201dWithin an hour of the program finishing, Russian television showed Moscow\u2019s governor at the waste site promising to resolve the issue.Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 06:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-says-new-sanctions-on-russia-are-a-result-of-domestic-political-battle-in-u-s-1497523136", "news_title": "Putin Says New Sanctions on Russia Are Due to Domestic Political Battle in U.S. ", "keywords": " cyberattack russia,putin,putin trump ties,russia sanctions,russia-us relations, trump russia links, us elections hacked,U.S. Senate,James Comey,Donald Trump,political,general news,society,community,international relations,arts,entertainment,international sanctions,human rights,civil liberties,politics,domestic politics,television,radio,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "BERN, Switzerland\u2014The             Swiss National Bank                   on Thursday defended its oft-repeated claim that the Swiss franc is \u201csignificantly overvalued,\u201d despite signs of modest economic growth, a high trade surplus and low unemployment.The SNB has for many years warned that the franc is too strong and repeated the \u201csignificantly overvalued\u201d assessment on Thursday as it kept its key deposit rate at minus 0.75%, where it has stood since early 2015.Because of Switzerland\u2019s stable economy and low debt, the franc tends to strengthen in times of global economic and political unrest as foreign investors pile into safe Swiss assets and Swiss residents keep their money at home rather than investing abroad.\u201cIn periods of uncertainty, [the franc] is still subject to increased upward pressure,\u201d SNB Chairman       Thomas Jordan       said at a media conference.\u2018                      The SNB assessment that the [franc] remains overvalued might be true from a long-run perspective, but it is poor guidance for the market                  \u2019In its policy statement, the SNB said: \u201cThe negative interest rate and the SNB\u2019s willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market are intended to make Swiss franc investments less attractive, thereby easing pressure on the currency.\u201dThe euro fetched 1.0880 francs midday Thursday in Europe, down slightly from Wednesday. The U.S. dollar strengthened a bit against the franc after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided Wednesday to increase U.S. interest rates.The hope in Switzerland was that reduced political uncertainty in Europe and tighter U.S. monetary policy would sap safe-haven demand for the franc. Though each has happened, the franc hasn\u2019t weakened much if any this year.Still, Switzerland\u2019s resilience has raised questions about whether there is a distinction between an overvalued currency and one whose strength reflects a fair valuation by investors.\u201cThe SNB assessment that the [franc] remains overvalued might be true from a long-run perspective, but it is poor guidance for the market,\u201d said Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin. \u201cIt rather is more likely that the [franc] remains structurally highly valued.\u201dThe SNB has backed up its view on the franc\u2019s excessive strength by massively loading up its balance sheet with foreign assets, using freshly created francs to buy them. At 694 billion francs ($714 billion), the SNB\u2019s foreign reserves are roughly equal to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.SNB balance-sheet data suggest that it intervened on a large scale in the early months of the year, ahead of key elections in Europe, but that it has scaled back in recent weeks after elections in France and the Netherlands delivered pro-European governments.Yet the Swiss economy hasn\u2019t shown many signs of buckling from the strong franc even though a big share of its economy is generated through exports, particularly to the eurozone. The trade surplus was 37.5 billion francs last year, a record high equal to about 6% of Swiss GDP. The current account, which includes trade and investment flows, is even larger as a share of the economy.Switzerland has emerged from years of falling consumer prices with low inflation rates in recent months.Meanwhile, the SNB said Thursday that it expects Swiss GDP to expand around 1.5% this year. It grew 1.3% in 2016 and 0.8% in 2015. Though far from a boom, Switzerland managed to avoid recession after the franc soared in the aftermath of the SNB\u2019s decision in January 2015 to abandon a ceiling on the franc\u2019s value against the euro.Asked to square the central bank\u2019s assessment that the franc is overvalued with these positive economic signals, Mr. Jordan said that the current account isn\u2019t a reliable indicator of currency strength, while Switzerland\u2019s economic growth has lagged behind that of the U.S. and Europe with inflation still benign.\u201cWe have to continue with our expansionary monetary policy\u201d and absorb some of the effects of the franc\u2019s strength, he said.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Swiss Leave Key Rate Unchanged.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 06:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-national-bank-leaves-key-deposit-rate-unchanged-1497513510", "news_title": "Swiss National Bank Defends Efforts to Weaken Franc", "keywords": "central bank intervention,currency intervention, dollar swiss franc exchange rate, euro swiss franc exchange rate,haven assets,interest rates,negative rates, snb,strong swiss franc,swiss central bank, swiss central bank intervention,swiss franc, swiss franc euro exchange rate,Schweizerische Nationalbank,SNBN.EB,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,monetary policy,trade,external payments,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Sign up:With one click,get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.Mega container ships may not be translating into far bigger volume for U.S. West Coast ports. The growth in container throughput at California\u2019s neighboring ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach slowed sharply in May, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Erica E. Phillips writes, even as imports at Georgia and Virginia jumped at a rapid rate. The gap opened as the number of megaship arrivals at the West Coast ports has doubled since the beginning of the year. The apparent shift in Asia-US supply chain routes comes after two new global shipping alliances launched in April, reducing the number of major alliances from four to three, which are deploying more megaships on major routes. The Georgia and Virginia port authorities hosted their first megaship in May--a 13,000-TEU COSCO vessel that was the largest container ship to transit the Panama Canal since its expansion. The arrival of bigger ships on the East Coast together with the shake-up in the shipping industry may be triggering a new structure in volume flows for the ocean lines and their customers\u2019 supply chains.U.S. consumers may be taking a break from propping up the U.S. economy. Retail sales fell 0.3% in May, the biggest decline since January 2016, the WSJ\u2019s Josh Mitchell and Khadeeja Safdar report, defying trends including low unemployment, a surging stock market and healthy late-spring imports by retailers. Although some of the decline reflected lower gasoline prices, sales suffered at big-box stores, car dealerships and electronics retailers. Shrinking profit margins and declining foot traffic have forced many retail chains to scale back, and retailer bankruptcies are growing as companies cope with a glut of stores and an ongoing shift to online shopping. Still, retailers are bringing in goods: The latest monthly Global Port Tracker from the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates LLC projects relatively healthy import volumes from May through July. With online sales growth far outpacing other categories, most of those goods may have to go to e-commerce distribution centers to get the attention of consumers.The U.S. auto industry is bracing for a long, slow summer. General Motors Co.       will extend its traditional seasonal shutdown at certain U.S. factories to deal with slumping sales and bloated inventory, the WSJ\u2019s Mike Colias reports, the latest sign that the industry is shifting into a lower production gear. That\u2019s tough news from a field that\u2019s provided the U.S. industrial sector much of its engine power in recent years but now is clearly pulling back. U.S. car sales, after hitting a record in 2016, have fallen nearly 2% over the past three months and automobiles are piling up at dealer lots. GM, with its inventory almost 44% higher from a year ago, will idle a factory near Kansas City, Kan., for five weeks starting this month, and may face more job cuts. Auto-related shipments at U.S. railroads are down nearly 5% this year through May and the downshifting at factories suggest the traffic won\u2019t pick up anytime soon.Qatar is trying to build new supply lines around a blockade by its Arab neighbors, in an effort that could reshape trade and transport in the region. The ban on transport links has affected Qatar\u2019s food supply and aviation industry, disrupted container shipping traffic and caused confusion about its oil & gas shipments. Now, the WSJ\u2019s Nicolas Parasie and Summer Said report Qatar is importing food from Iran and using its airspace. Qatar Airways is redeploying aircraft to new routes and tankers are looking at other transit ports such as Oman to ship their cargo. Brokers say shippers that supply Qatar with food, clothing and electronics remain wary of accepting and sending cargo to and from the country. Qatari tankers are avoiding the Suez Canal and looking into using ports in Oman since they are shut out from the United Arab Emirates. Right now, the moves are considered temporary, but Qatar will have to make the new routes work on a long-term basis if there is no diplomatic solution.\u2018The awkward May numbers for the California ports may be a late echo of the alliance realignment, especially if the shipping lines are continuing to transition to larger vessels calling less frequently.\u2019Year-over-year growth in sales at \u201cnonstore retailers,\u201d largely e-commerce, n the three months ending in May, compared to a 3.7% decline at department stores.A gunman shot and killed three fellow employees at a             United Parcel Service Inc.       sorting facility in San Francisco before turning the weapon on himself.

Unless, of course, you\u2019re talking about emerging markets. Then nearly anything that happens can be given a negative spin. That could actually work to investors\u2019 advantage.Take one common specter regularly summoned: the U.S. Federal Reserve. The idea is that a Fed raising rates will cause strains in emerging markets, pushing up the dollar and tightening financial conditions.The theory makes sense, but the timing is wrong. The dollar rose sharply well ahead of the Fed actually raising rates; that was when the pain was felt in emerging-market assets. Even then, because many emerging countries now have floating exchange rates, there has been a safety valve to prevent the kind of debt and currency crises seen in the past. Growth in emerging markets is forecast to pick up this year and next. Money is flowing back into the asset class, not out.So even with the Fed having raised rates three times since December, the MSCI Emerging Markets stock index is up 17% this year.             J.P. Morgan                   indexes show local-currency bonds up 11.7% and hard-currency bonds gaining 7.1%. True, the risk could re-emerge if the Fed became much more aggressive, but it has shown little sign of doing so.Another fear surrounds political risk. Emerging markets are certainly not short of that, from Brazil\u2019s corruption scandal to Venezuela\u2019s economic chaos, to Turkey\u2019s failed coup attempt. And there are tangible impacts: Brazil\u2019s stock market fell 9% in mid-May as President       Michel Temer       was dragged into controversy, and the real is lagging well behind its peers this year against the dollar.Yet developed-market political surprises are also on the rise.       Donald Trump       wasn\u2019t expected to win the U.S. presidency, but investors\u2019 knee-jerk reaction was to add risk in the U.S., not reduce it, and sell emerging markets. That trade has gone into reverse as expectations around U.S. policy have faded. Last week\u2019s U.K. election confounded expectations and has raised risks around Brexit, but there is little sign of that in markets. Developed markets seem eager to accentuate the positive.The consequence of this skewed perception, however, is that there is still compensation for taking risk in emerging markets. The J.P. Morgan local-currency bond index yields 6.2%, generating a positive real yield in a world where big swaths of \u201csafe\u201d developed-market bonds still carry nominal negative yields.Emerging markets could of course be the source of a shock again: China\u2019s efforts to transform its economy are clearly a big source of risk. But this year marks 20 years since the Asian financial crisis ignited a firestorm in emerging markets. Since then, the bigger shocks\u2014the global crisis of 2008, the eurozone\u2019s debt woes and Brexit\u2014haven\u2019t come from the emerging world.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 06:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-fed-is-an-overrated-risk-for-emerging-markets-1497521229", "news_title": "Why the Fed Is an Overrated Risk for Emerging Markets ", "keywords": "emerging market risks,emerging markets, fed interest rates, fed rates,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,equity markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,insurance,financial investments,risk management,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Nelson Peltz       rose to fame via his savvy and aggressive investing strategy.

If Turkey allows Qatar\u2019s autonomy to be crushed, officials in Ankara fear Mr. Erdogan\u2019s administration could be next to face international pressure.\u201cWhatever Qatar is accused of, Turkey can also be accused of, and Erdogan is aware of that. There is a sense in the Turkish leadership that they are aiming at Qatar but really are trying to target us,\u201d said       Asli Aydintasbas,        a Turkey specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cHence the reaction and the overreaction.\u201dSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain earlier this month cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar. They accused the emirate of sponsoring terrorism and demanded it end support for the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group these Arab nations have declared a terrorist organization.Turkey, by contrast, sees the Brotherhood as a legitimate movement with broad popular appeal. Once imprisoned for his own Islamist politics, Mr. Erdogan has a longstanding affinity with the group and with other Islamist organizations that seemed ascendant throughout the region in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.Following the 2013 military coup that ousted a Brotherhood-run government in Egypt, these groups have been crushed or driven underground almost everywhere. Amid this anti-Islamist backlash, Qatar is the only country left in the region that is aligned with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s position on the Brotherhood, and that also openly supports the Palestinian movement Hamas. Both Qatar and Turkey also oppose an escalation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s confrontation with Iran.Mr. Erdogan\u2014who has nurtured a personal bond with Qatari Emir       Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani      \u2014moved swiftly to offset the Saudi-led effort to isolate Qatar. Alongside Iran, Turkey opened air corridors to Qatari flights that have been barred from Saudi airspace. Ankara has also fast-tracked legislation to deploy thousands of troops to Qatar, aiming to prevent regime change in the wealthy emirate.Addressing the Qatar crisis this week, Mr. Erdogan said \u201ctaking action to isolate a country in all areas is inhuman and un-Islamic\u201d\u2014a remark that seemed to question the Islamic credentials of the House of Saud. Pro-government Turkish newspapers, meanwhile, have accused the U.A.E. of orchestrating last year\u2019s failed military coup against the Turkish leader.\u201cTurkey does not see this as a bilateral crisis but as a beginning of a regional crisis. Qatar supported the Arab Spring, moderate Sunni Islamic groups such as Muslim Brotherhood, and these are the positions that Turkey shares too,\u201d said Galip Dalay, research director at Al Sharq Forum, an Istanbul think tank backed by Qatar. \u201cTurkey feels all of its stances on major regional issues are also being targeted. If Qatar gives in to these pressures, Turkey will lose its closest ally.\u201dGroups supported by Turkey and Qatar also include jihadist militias in Syria and in Libya, some of them uncomfortably close to al Qaeda. In Libya, in particular, Qatar and Turkey have backed one side of the civil war against a rival alliance supported by Egypt and the U.A.E.These connections are one of the reasons why President       Donald Trump      \u2014overruling Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson\u2019s       attempts to defuse the crisis\u2014has backed the Saudi move on Qatar.\u201cThe nation of Qatar has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week. Qatar has denied the charge.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump is tenuous at best, and the Turkish leader failed to win any major concessions during a Washington trip last month. His new readiness to damage Turkey\u2019s ties with big Arab states\u2014and potentially the U.S.\u2014on Qatar\u2019s behalf has already alarmed the country\u2019s opposition.\u201cThe decision that President Erdogan has made was a wrong decision. His affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood is more important to him than his allied relationship with Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. and other countries,\u201d said       Ozturk Yilmaz,        a former ambassador who now serves as a lawmaker with CHP, Turkey\u2019s biggest opposition party. \u201cSiding with Qatar against other Arab allies would backfire one day or another.\u201dTo Mr. Erdogan\u2019s critics, this reckless plunge into yet another Middle East crisis also shows just how volatile Ankara\u2019s policies have become now that the Turkish president has eliminated most checks and balances.\u201cThe Turkish foreign policy has become highly personalized, just like its domestic policies,\u201d said       Bulent Gultekin,        a former governor of Turkey\u2019s central bank who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIn domestic policy, it worked in Erdogan\u2019s favor each time he was able to up the ante.

What is important is Macy\u2019s is planning to treat these people better, and if a new loyalty program to be rolled out in the fourth quarter of this year succeeds, it could help revive the chain.Macy\u2019s loyalty programs, which include credit cards that provide discounts and access to events, haven\u2019t generated enough loyalty. In the second quarter of 2015, it also touted the successful launch of Plenti, a points program that involves multiple companies, including             Exxon Mobil,AT&T                   and             Rite Aid.

Similarly,             Starbucks                  \u2019 rewards program offers the ability to pay by phone and order ahead, in addition to points that can be used for purchases.

Data the company collects through its loyalty program on the locations and spending patterns of these crucial customers should inform its decisions about inventory purchases and even where to close stores.For Macy\u2019s, a new loyalty program should reflect its aims outlined at its investor day last week to offer more focused and more fashionable selection of products, including a greater number of exclusive designs.

But now the flood of cash is pushing down returns, leading these funds to design riskier and more complex products, while increasing their leverage.Because ultralow interest rates and other monetary stimulus have pushed down yields across markets, pension funds and life insurers have struggled to match their long-dated liabilities. That has encouraged them to chase riskier assets, such as real estate, private equity and now direct lending to companies.That risk taking could backfire on investors for whom stable returns are particularly important. It could also be problematic for the companies and wider market, if defaults start rising and these investors suddenly pull out.\u201cIt is concerning,\u201d said       Niels Bodenheim,        private-markets director at consultancy bfinance. \u201cA pension fund is not always aware of the difference\u201d between safer direct-lending investments and riskier ones, he said.Last year, asset managers raised $25 billion from global investors for direct lending, according to data provider Preqin.\u00a0A decade ago, that was $2 billion. Some analysts expect the growth to increase at a faster pace.There is so much cash pouring in that the asset managers can\u2019t always invest it. In May, there was $62 billion idling in these funds, according to Preqin, when a decade ago it was $12 billion.A recent survey by bfinance found that managers of unlevered senior private debt funds expect a return of more than 8%, but are getting between 5% and 6%. While figures for previous years aren\u2019t directly comparable, there is \u201ca noticeable spread compression since 2012,\u201d the report said.Lending directly to companies will always bring more risks than pension and insurance funds\u2019 typical staple of bonds,\u00a0which can usually be traded on public markets and so are easier to sell on.And the risks may be rising.To increase their yield, funds are building up leverage and adding complexity to investments labeled as safe. Senior debt, which gets paid first in case of insolvency, is increasingly being packaged together in a single tranche with more-junior slices of debt, according to research and investors\u2019 accounts.Investors say that as newcomers to this market, pension funds and life insurers, especially in Europe, are just not used to dealing with such structures.Also, a market that was traditionally dominated by a dozen big lenders has become saturated by upstart funds. In 2008, 16 funds were doing direct lending. In 2016, it was 55, Preqin data shows.Bigger funds say these smaller players are the ones that pose the risks because they don\u2019t have the size to diversify their lending and properly assess borrowers.\u201cWe are stepping into the shoes of banks, and for that you need scale,\u201d said       Max Mitchell,        head of direct lending at             Intermediate Capital Group,       which manages \u20ac15.5 billion ($17 billion) of direct-lending assets around the world.Some smaller funds, though, say they match their size to that of the companies they lend to. That avoids the market for slightly larger firms that has become\u00a0overcrowded\u00a0as well as\u00a0more complex and levered, said       Alastair Brown,        chief of direct lending at Shard Credit Partners, a smaller London-based firm.A diversified group of loans to smaller firms can still return nine percentage points above risk-free interest rates, compared with the five percentage points above risk-free rates now yielded by bigger firms, he said.Also, analysts say that despite the new money there are still many opportunities in direct lending, because there is demand from the companies that banks aren\u2019t lending to but are too small to tap public markets.Investors say risks can be easily diversified across European countries, a market that has started catching up to the U.S. in recent years.A key test for the market will come when default rates go up, since a single insolvency is much more damaging for a fund than a bank. In April, shares on the London-based             Ranger Direct Lending Fund                   PLC plunged 22% after a fund it was invested in gave loans to an online lender that went bankrupt.Bill Kassul, a partner at Ranger, said investors will remain reassured in this sector, despite problems along the way, as long as direct lenders preserve their money.But       Greg Peters,        a credit portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said he is concerned some companies do direct lending as \u201ca short-time play.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a proliferation of new firms opening up with little capability and no track record and they\u2019re raising money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a story to be written for the next recession, it\u2019s in private credit.\u201dWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Return-Hungry Investors Play Risky Role of Lender.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-play-the-risky-role-of-lender-1497519005", "news_title": "Investors Play the Risky Role of Lender ", "keywords": " asset managers,direct lending,funds,pe industry news,Alastair Brown,Greg Peters,Niels Bodenheim,political,general news,personal finance,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Baidu Inc. is among China\u2019s tech giants looking to get a leg up in the competitive financial-services market. Credit-rating companies aren\u2019t so sure it\u2019s a good idea.Fitch recently placed Baidu on negative watch, citing \u201csignificantly higher\u201d business risks as it moves into making unsecured consumer loans and selling uninsured investments known as wealth-management products, which Fitch said are \u201cpart of the shadow banking system in China.\u201dMoody\u2019s decided last month to place Baidu\u2019s bond ratings on review for a downgrade, citing concerns over the firm\u2019s short history in the financial-services business.Baidu\u2019s financial services, which also include its mobile payment platform, now account for about 12% of its assets, or 25 billion yuan ($3.7 billion)\u2014representing rapid growth for a firm that formed its financial-services group only about a year ago. That has significantly changed Baidu\u2019s credit profile, said Moody\u2019s vice president and senior credit officer Lina Choi.\u201cThe execution risk is high,\u201d Ms. Choi said of wealth-management products, which are targeted at consumers looking to earn more than they could in bank deposits or bonds. \u201cIf these investments do not yield expected returns or generate losses for retail investors, that may result in reputation risks to Baidu.\u201dA Baidu spokeswoman declined to comment on the actions by Moody\u2019s and Fitch. On Baidu\u2019s most recent earnings conference call, however, then-Chief Financial Officer       Jennifer Li       said the firm\u2019s financial services were \u201cprogressing very well.\u201dThe credit-rating firms\u2019 reports haven\u2019t troubled Baidu\u2019s share price, which is up about 8% this year on             Nasdaq                   through Wednesday. Analysts said the bigger issue, reflected in its stock performance, is slowing growth, particularly in its core search business.\u201cInvestors have been concerned about Baidu\u2019s slowing growth rate compared with the other internet giants in China,\u201d said       Marie Sun,        an analyst at Morningstar.Along with Baidu, Chinese tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. also are moving into the attractive and risky fintech space as they all look to move beyond their core businesses. The fintech products they offer include short-term consumer loans and wealth-management products.Fitch said Baidu\u2019s credit risk is higher than that of Alibaba and Tencent because it doesn\u2019t have the financial might of those two rivals, which are more profitable and have stronger cash-generation abilities. Alibaba shares are up 56% this year through Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, and Tencent shares in Hong Kong have risen 44% through Thursday.Oftentimes, wealth-management products are bundles of corporate loans, trusts and other investment vehicles\u2014making it difficult for investors to understand what they are getting. The products have attracted increasing\u00a0regulatory oversight from China\u2019s central bank.Tencent recently joined with             China Rapid Finance,       a consumer-lending marketplace, to offer more investment products. Tencent also runs a distribution channel that lends users sums ranging from 500 to 300,000 yuan (roughly $75 to $44,000) through its online banking affiliate, with interest rates ranging from 7.3% to 18.25%. The average loan size distributed is around 8,200 yuan ($1,200).Alibaba Group\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, offers lines of credit and consumer loans with lending limits of 50,000 yuan a month. The company says more than 100 million users have taken out loans, with interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 8.8%.\u201cThere\u2019s a good appetite for personal loans and one that hasn\u2019t fully been met,\u201d said       Mark Natkin,        managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based tech consultancy. \u201cThe online lending platforms allow loan products to extend to a much greater percentage of the population.\u201dLast year, about 160 million Chinese went online to take out loans worth 1.2 trillion yuan ($177 billion). Analytics firm iResearch expects China\u2019s lending to grow at an annual rate of 50% for the next three years.One reason China\u2019s internet giants have waded into the fintech business is the vast amount of data they collect, and which they can use to assess creditworthiness in nontraditional ways, such as by analyzing a person\u2019s search history or online video-watching patterns.Baidu\u2019s finance group has focused particularly on the education-loan market, where it says it has a market share of roughly 75%. Typical borrowers are 20- to 35-year-olds who are attending a trade school or signed up for language or IT programs.A Baidu financial-services group executive said the company now has partnerships with more than 2,500 educational institutions in China and provides, at peak times, 3,000 loans each day to students.When Truman Chu needed a loan to help pay for his M.B.A. degree at Tsinghua University, the 33-year-old didn\u2019t turn to traditional banks but instead went to China\u2019s internet search giant.Mr. Chu applied for a loan from Baidu two years ago, after hearing about its lending program in association with Tsinghua\u2019s School of Economics and Management. He filled out an application on his smartphone while walking through campus. Fifteen minutes later, he received confirmation for a loan for 118,000 yuan ($17,370), which covered tuition for his first year of business school.\u201cIt was so convenient, unlike commercial banks where you have to go to a designated bank and line up and apply for it,\u201d said Mr. Chu, who is repaying his loan in three years at an annual interest rate of nearly 6%.Most of Baidu\u2019s education loans are for less than 30,000 yuan (roughly $4,400), though a small number of elite graduate loans can range higher. The Baidu executive says the company aims to serve one million students a year.Baidu said it offers sales incentives to some of the schools it works with and wires money directly to the institution when the loan is approved.Baidu\u2019s consumer interest rates range from 10.8% to 18%, with 70% of its consumer loans falling between 13% and 15%. For elite education loans, such as M.B.A. programs, Baidu\u2019s interest rates are lower to stay competitive with state-run bank rates. The average loan amount made by Baidu is 15,000 yuan ($2,200), with many borrowers getting more than one loan.In the U.S., average graduate or professional federal loans charge interest rates between 5% and 6%; private loan rates vary from 9% to 12%.Baidu says its loans are an option for students who can\u2019t get traditional bank loans. Mr. Natkin notes that there is a risk the borrowers don\u2019t fully understand the debt they are taking on.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a number of loan products that have been problematic,\u201d Mr. Natkin, the Beijing consultant, said, referring to unscrupulous peer-to-peer online lending practices. Still, industry executives see the huge potential of China\u2019s online lending marketplace.\u201cThe Chinese market is unique in that it\u2019s still relatively new in terms of offering unsecured credit to consumers,\u201d says       Douglas Merrill,        founder and chief executive of Zest Finance, an online lender that has worked with Baidu on underwriting technology. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive opportunity to create a whole new credit ecosystem.\u201d\u2014Lilian Lin contributed to this article.Write to Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidu-with-a-move-into-fintech-gets-wary-credit-ratings-look-1497519006", "news_title": "Baidu, With a Move Into Fintech,\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tGets Wary Credit-Ratings Look ", "keywords": "china ,consumer lending,fintech,microlending,student loans,wealth management products,Baidu,BIDU,Douglas Merrill,Marie Sun,Mark Natkin,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,internet search engines,banking,credit,financial services,internet,online,investing,securities,technology"}, {"content": "As the Museum of Sex approaches its 15th\u00a0anniversary, it is positioning itself as a serious-minded institution that examines its core subject through the lens of art, natural history and sociology.One of its principal attractions, however, remains \u201cJump for Joy: Bouncy Castle of Breasts.\u201d As its name implies, it is a children\u2019s-style bounce house\u2014only participants are bouncing off inflatable structures that resemble, well, breasts.While some might see this as a dichotomy, museum founder       Dan Gluck       sees it as a way to draw a wide range of visitors to his 17,500-square-foot space at the corner of 27th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.The idea, he explains, is to appeal on different levels: the highbrow and the low. It is an approach that carries over to the museum\u2019s gift shop, where the offerings range from books of art photography to a $15 bra made of candy.The approach appears to be working. Attendance at the museum, which is run as a for-profit institution unlike most major museums in the city, is expected to top 300,000 visitors in 2017, says Mr. Gluck, a 49-year-old former software entrepreneur who studied art in college. That is more than four times the number from the museum\u2019s first full year in 2003.\u201cI think we\u2019re a brilliant idea 15 years in the making,\u201d said Mr. Gluck, describing the museum\u2019s recent success. After a decade of running in the red, he said, MoSex\u2014as the museum is sometimes cheekily called\u2014has turned an annual profit in the past five years, though Mr. Gluck wouldn\u2019t provide figures.All this is inspiring Mr. Gluck to think bigger: In the coming month, the museum will add two new galleries, totaling 5,500 square feet of exhibition space.The exhibits lined up for the new spaces speak to the museum\u2019s eclecticism. One gallery will be set aside for \u201cNSFW: Female Gaze,\u201d a group show, curated with Vice Media, that features the work of more than 20 women artists, showcasing what the museum bills as \u201ca fearless new visual language of desire.\u201dAnd the other gallery? It will play host to a virtual-reality experience that is something of a cross between a movie and videogame, all with a sexual theme.Beyond that, the institution is tweaking some of its continuing exhibitions to give them a sharper edge and look. A show about the sex lives of animals, for example, has a newly installed jungle-themed carpet.Another initiative: A bar that doubles as gallery space.The first show in the space, dubbed \u201cNight Fever,\u201d will feature photos of the sexually charged disco scene in New York during the \u201870s. In conjunction with the exhibit, the museum recently has been hosting\u00a0Sunday-afternoon dance parties.As the museum maps out its future, Mr. Gluck has brought aboard       Serge Becker,        a New York restaurateur and nightlife impresario, as creative director. He says MoSex shows can and should be considered on the same level as those at a Manhattan art gallery or, in the case of the animal exhibition, the Museum of Natural History.\u201cThe subject matter really deserves a serious approach,\u201d he said.Still, even when the museum aims to be scholarly, it doesn\u2019t hide from its subject. Consider its ongoing show \u201cHardcore,\u201d which chronicles the history of pornography and includes sexually explicit photographs and movie clips.For that reason, some museum-industry experts say MoSex always will face a certain challenge with mainstream museumgoers. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to think about the line that audience is not going to cross,\u201d said       Susie Wilkening,        a museum consultant based in Seattle.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-nyc-museum-takes-sex-seriously-1497519002", "news_title": "This NYC Museum Takes Sex Seriously", "keywords": "museum of sex,nyc sex museum,Dan Gluck,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,theaters,entertainment venues,museums,historical sites,gardens,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "Southern Syria, once the quietest corner of the country\u2019s multisided conflict, has unexpectedly become the most volatile flashpoint between America and Iran as the two countries vie for control.The U.S. military has moved mobile artillery-rocket launchers into southern Syria for the first time, as American troops in the area face increasing dangers from Iran-backed forces. Iran\u2019s best-known military commander, meanwhile, was photographed praying with allied fighters in Syria, a visit seen by some U.S. officials as a public taunt by Tehran. Worried that the situation may spiral out of control, top U.S. military commanders are pressing Moscow to step in.\u201cThis is rapidly developing, it\u2019s not settled at all and I don\u2019t even know that there\u2019s a good direction determined yet,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to figure out what to do here. It\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest for us to get into an active fight with these pro-regime forces.\u201dFor years, the U.S. military has focused its firepower in Syria on defeating Islamic State and largely avoided direct confrontations with President       Bashar al-Assad\u2019s       forces and his Iranian allies. But the risks of a combustive confrontation in southern Syria have unexpectedly increased as the U.S. has ramped up its operations against Islamic State.The jostling is partly driven by a view among some U.S. officials that the vast desert could become a staging ground for President Donald Trump\u2019s nascent efforts to counter Iranian influence in the region, including Tehran\u2019s efforts to establish firm control over weapons supply routes running through Iraq, Syria and into Lebanon.Elite U.S. special operations forces have stepped up training and brought in more firepower to a small garrison known as al Tanf, near a key border crossing with Iraq. About 150 U.S. special operations forces are rotating in-and-out of the training base, U.S. officials said. In Syria\u2019s north, more than 750 U.S. Marines and soldiers are using helicopters, artillery and airstrikes to help Syrian fighters push Islamic State from Raqqa, the extremist group\u2019s largest remaining stronghold in Syria.Last month, the U.S. military carried out a rare airstrike on allies of Mr. Assad, who were heading toward the garrison and were viewed as a threat. That was followed by three more airstrikes, including the shootdown of an Iranian-made drone that had attacked U.S. military advisers in southern Syria.While the U.S. has stopped short of publicly identifying the kind of drone used in the attack, U.S. officials have said it was an Iranian-made Shahed 129. U.S. officials said they may never figure out who was piloting the Predator-size drone, but they have narrowed their suspicions down to either Iran or Syria.New details about last Friday\u2019s shootdown of the drone over the vast desert in southeastern Syria points to the expanding risks U.S. forces are taking in the area. U.S. forces watched as the drone repeatedly circled a small patrol base recently set up by Western advisers working alongside Syrian fighters, U.S. officials said. The drone dropped a munition near the small military outpost, but it didn\u2019t explode. As the drone continued to circle the area, a U.S. F-15 took aim and blew it out of the sky, they said.The increasing hostilities have triggered a debate in Washington over how to respond. Some Trump administration officials, including the State Department\u2019s point man on the fight against Islamic State, want to avoid taking provocative steps that could lead to clashes with fighters backed by Tehran, Damascus and Moscow, U.S. and Western officials said. Others, including top U.S. military commanders, see a need to more aggressively confront an increasing threat posed by Iran-backed forces trying to seize an advantage.Those pushing for a more aggressive approach have been encouraged by Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility toward Tehran, a marked departure from former President       Barack Obama,        who steered around military confrontations with Iran while negotiating a nuclear deal with the country\u2019s leaders.While the U.S. focuses on Islamic State, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces and their allies are pushing toward a key Iraq-Syria border crossing in the south now held by Islamic State. The offensive, U.S. officials said, appears aimed at preventing U.S.-backed Syrian rebels trained at al Tanf from moving north to seize the Abu Kamal border crossing.Control of Abu Kamal would allow the rebels to cut off any possible Iranian weapons shipments both to the Damascus government and to the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201cThe idea is to cut off access to the border and routes for weapons flows from Tehran to Beirut,\u201d said a U.S. official based in the Middle East who monitors the situation.The Abu Kamal border crossing in Deir Ezzour province has been a key land bridge for Islamic State forces to travel in and out of Iraq and Syria and also is strategic for its proximity to the extremist group\u2019s key source of revenue: nearby oil fields in Deir Ezzour.U.S. officials say Islamic State moved much of its leadership and equipment to the province as they came under increased pressure in Raqqa and Mosul in Iraq, and they expect the extremists to launch a last stand for its self-declared caliphate there.As the rival military forces jockey for position, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, head of the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State, has repeatedly asked the Russian military to constrain its allies in Syria, U.S. officials said. Gen. Townsend has sent blunt warnings to Russia that the U.S. won\u2019t shy away from a fight if Moscow doesn\u2019t help, they said.To help check further threats, the U.S. military has sent High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems into southern Syria for the first time to protect the small garrison at al Tanf. Military officials are concerned that forces backed by Damascus and Iranmay also try to seize a border crossing near the U.S. rebel-training base. The U.S. has established a 33-mile buffer zone around the base and told regime forces to steer clear.The expanding U.S. military moves are being countered by Iran. Earlier this week, Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran\u2019s elite Qods Force, was photographed praying in southern Syria with militants backed by Tehran.The photos didn\u2019t escape notice at the Pentagon, where Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       is intent on preventing Iran from seizing an advantage in Syria.\u201cJim Mattis has spent the last 15 years thinking about Iran,\u201d said one U.S. official. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to let the Iranians surprise him.\u201dOne U.S. official based overseas said the clashes in southern Syria are an indication that Washington can\u2019t dictate terms to rivals looking to thwart American plans.\u201cI think it\u2019s emblematic of the broader contradictions in our policy between the immediate focus on utilizing virtually any and all tools available to defeat Daesh, and the ripple effects from the choices we make on the post-ISIL landscape,\u201d said a second U.S. official. \u201cJust because we want to approach this sequentially doesn\u2019t mean Tehran will\u2014and clearly isn\u2019t.\u201dWrite to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com and Maria Abi-Habib at maria.habib@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrias-newest-flashpoint-is-bringing-u-s-and-iran-face-to-face-1497519000", "news_title": "Syria\u2019s Newest Flashpoint Is Bringing U.S. and Iran Face to Face ", "keywords": "iran syria,syria conflict,syria crisis,syrian rebels,syria war,trump iran,trump syria,u.s. iran ,u.s. syria,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "Valeria Collina       tried last June to enter the east London fast-food restaurant where her son       Youssef Zaghba       worked in the kitchen. He blocked her at the door, saying she couldn\u2019t sit there unaccompanied by a male relative.\u201cHe was becoming more and more unyielding in his views on Islam,\u201d Ms. Collina said in an interview outside Bologna. \u201cBut there was no reason to think it could end in the terrible act that he did.\u201dMore than a year before Zaghba and two other terrorists killed eight people in a rampage at London Bridge and nearby Borough Market earlier this month, the Italian-Moroccan man\u2019s steady radicalization had alarmed his family and raised the suspicions of Italian authorities. But despite the warning signs, Italian security personnel with an aggressive approach to extremists and years of experience combating the mafia were largely helpless to do much, and he slipped through their grasp.\u201cYou hear about the guys who become terrorists after coming out of jail or those who are ex-drug addicts looking for something to latch onto,\u201d Ms. Collina said. \u201cBut Youssef is a different case and maybe that makes it more dangerous and harder to control.\u201dThe problem of Islamic extremism has been less severe in Italy than in other European countries, in part because Muslim immigration has been more limited here than elsewhere in the region. About 2.7% of the country\u2019s population is Muslim, compared with 8.7% in France, according to the World Religion Database.Italy hasn\u2019t suffered a major Islamist terrorist attack. The country has seen about 100 foreign fighters depart for battlefields in the Middle East, and several hundred people are under special observation for the risk of radicalism in Italian jails\u2014far fewer than in other large European countries.The country has long had some of Europe\u2019s strictest antiterrorism laws, a legacy of its experience combating the mafia and homegrown political terrorism. Authorities have broad authority to wiretap suspects and to order preventive detention if they feel a subject could repeat an offense or hide potential evidence.But since most of the country\u2019s suspected Islamist extremists are foreign-born, authorities\u2019 main tool in combating them has been expulsion and repatriation. Italy has been especially aggressive at expelling people who display extremist views, even if they haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Since January 2015, the country has expelled 184 suspected extremists.Such techniques didn\u2019t apply to Zaghba, who was born in Morocco of an Italian mother and a Moroccan father and had dual citizenship. Ms. Collina, born in Bologna, moved to Morocco about 25 years ago after converting to Islam and marrying Zaghba\u2019s father. She gave birth to her son there in 1995. The two returned to Italy in 2015 after Zaghba failed two university exams in Morocco.In 2014 when Ms. Collina and her son still lived in Morocco she noticed that he had an Islamic State flag on his             Facebook                   profile. He told her he wanted to go to Syria.\u201cHe\u2019d say to me, \u2018That\u2019s pure Islam, I\u2019m going to go there,\u2019\u201d Ms. Collina said. \u201cBut I never thought he wanted to go to Syria to fight and even less that he would do a terrorist attack.\u201dOnce they had moved to Italy, she said, Zaghba told her he preferred the way she dressed in Morocco, where she wore a face covering known as a niqab that left only a narrow opening for her eyes. Another time he scolded her because a small bit of her pants could be seen under her long robes, Ms. Collina said.In March 2016, Italian police stopped Zaghba at the Bologna airport with a one-way ticket to Istanbul. They found Islamic State propaganda on his phone and his mother told them her son wanted to reach Syria. Antiterrorism agents searched her house, taking away a tablet computer, documents, cellphones and phone cards.\u2018He believed in ISIS and I tried to show him what they do is wrong.\u2019But the authorities lacked sufficient evidence to hold Zaghba and had to release him after a few hours. They took away his passport and continued to monitor his movements, but couldn't expel him because he was an Italian citizen. About a month later, a court-appointed attorney helped him get his passport back, and almost immediately he departed for London.It was there, according to Ms. Collina, that her son underwent the radicalization that would lead to the terrorist attack, specifically at the gym where Zaghba met Khuram Butt, another of the London Bridge attackers.\u201cHe had his politics and I had mine,\u201d his mother said. \u201cHe believed in ISIS and I tried to show him what they do is wrong.\u201dWrite to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com and Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/terrorist-youssef-zaghba-was-unyielding-in-his-views-on-islam-his-mother-says-1497519002", "news_title": "Terrorist Youssef Zaghba Was \u2018Unyielding in His Views on Islam,\u2019 His Mother Says", "keywords": " borough market attack, europe terrorism, islamic state,london bridge attack, radicalization,Valeria Collina,Youssef Zaghba,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "ATHENS\u2014When Greece imposed capital controls in the summer of 2015, the measures were a critical bulwark for banks left teetering after fears of a Greek exit from the European Union caused citizens to pull billions of euros in deposits.Two years later, the country is a case study in capital controls. The measures prevented a collapse in the banking system, and predictions they would throw grit into the wheels of the economy haven\u2019t materialized. Instead, controls have produced some surprising results, including helping Greece combat tax evasion, a perennial scourge.As Greece\u2019s creditors prepared to approve Thursday the final payment in the country\u2019s up-to-\u20ac86 billion ($96.5 billion) bailout, there was no talk of lifting the measures\u2014a reflection of the continued fragility of its battered economy.\u201cIf we put aside the chaos created in the first couple of months, the mechanism currently in place is running smoothly,\u201d says       Nikos Manesiotis,        who runs a food-import company and has had to navigate the measures to pay foreign suppliers. \u201cBut Greece remains the black sheep of Europe.\u201dGreece\u2019s experience adds to the debate over whether capital controls can be a positive force in checking destabilizing flows of capital, a view more economists and policy makers are espousing. China has restricted yuan spending abroad in an effort to stabilize its economy. In Cyprus, the only other eurozone member that has experienced capital controls, the measures succeeded in saving the banking system, but the economy shrank 10% during the two years that capital controls were imposed.In Greece\u2019s case, authorities imposed controls after a prolonged economic crisis was heightened amid threats the country would abandon the euro. Greek households and businesses withdrew a quarter of deposits, or \u20ac40 billion, from banks in the first six months of 2015.With ample warning about the measures, which began in June 2015 and included strict limits on bank withdrawals and money transfers, Greeks had plenty of time to stash their cash away. Cash in circulation shot up to \u20ac42 billion in May 2016, \u20ac10 billion higher than at the end of 2014, according to             Bank of Greece                   data.\u201cOver the first half of 2015, the domestic banking system experienced a slow-motion bank run,\u201d says Eurobank Group chief economist       Platon Monokroussos.       \u201cMost of this excess liquidity remained within the country, but under the mattress.\u201dThe weekly limit on cash withdrawals is \u20ac420, and the average Greek salary is \u20ac700 a month.Greek companies have had little trouble securing permission to move money overseas, with the special committees charged with approving such transfers typically dispatching them in days, according to officials, economists and businessmen. \u201cI don\u2019t like having to fill in all these forms and submit them,\u201d says Kalypso Kannelli, a wood importer. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t created much trouble.\u201dAnd rules allowing foreign investors to take out money they have brought into the country haven\u2019t crimped the flow of money coming from abroad. For instance,       Chen Bo,        head of corporate communication for private Chinese conglomerate Fosun, says his company has put hundreds of millions of euros into Greek tourism and retail over the past few years. The measures haven\u2019t deterred Fosun from planning more investments in the medium and long term.Capital controls have chalked up one major accomplishment: putting the squeeze on Greece\u2019s notorious tax-evasion problem.Cash withdrawal limits have forced Greeks to use more plastic, which is free from restrictions. The number of noncash transactions has tripled since 2014. About 1 million debit cards were issued in the summer of 2015, five times the rate before the bank restrictions, and that number has continued to grow.The result has been an extra \u20ac1 billion in tax revenue a year, according to Greek officials\u2014a major explanation behind the eightfold increase in the country\u2019s primary surplus last year.But fears over the fragility of Greece\u2019s banks, a big motivation for the capital controls in the first place, continue.Late last year Greek bankers were working on a plan to ease the restrictions, but talks foundered when tensions over fresh austerity measures drove Greeks to pull more money from banks.Deposits have fallen \u20ac2.4 billion since December and are now at their lowest levels since November 2001. The Greek banking system has lost about \u20ac120 billion in deposits, or about half the total, compared with peak levels in 2008.Without a return of confidence in the banks, the government can\u2019t lift the controls. \u201cIt would be catastrophic if we lifted them and then had to impose them again,\u201d says one senior bank official.\u201cMany companies use foreign bank accounts for all their transactions,\u201d says Mr. Manesiotis, the food importer. \u201cEven if they are lifted, it will require a long time before they trust the Greek banking system again. Nobody has currently any reason to do so.\u201dWrite to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-a-case-study-in-capital-controls-1497519001", "news_title": "Greece: A Case Study in Capital Controls", "keywords": "capital controls,greece bailout,greece budget,greece capital controls,greece debt,grexit,Platon Monokroussos,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,government finance,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,financial crime,fraud,tax fraud,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is expected to suspend its search for a chief executive\u00a0on Thursday,\u00a0dealing a blow to reform efforts at an agency that has become synonymous with dysfunction.The bistate agency started its search more than two years ago in the wake of a report commissioned by the governors of New York and New Jersey that recommended a comprehensive governance overhaul to depoliticize decision making.The chief executive would have replaced an executive director and a deputy who are each appointed by the governors of New York and New Jersey.The post ought to be one of the most coveted jobs in public transportation with oversight over most of the region\u2019s major bridges, tunnels and airports as well as the 16-acre World Trade Center site.But Port Authority chairman       John Degnan       is expected to tell colleagues at a board meeting in Jersey City, N.J., Thursday that the search is suspended because of a failure to find a suitable candidate.The agency\u2019s executive director,       Patrick Foye,        had applied for the CEO position.A person familiar with Mr. Degnan\u2019s thinking said that \u201cseveral important candidates\u201d had been reticent to take the position because it wasn\u2019t enshrined in law in New Jersey. Their fear was that the agency could eliminate the position in the future.The person said that had contributed to the agency being unable to find someone \u201csatisfactory to both governors.\u201dThe CEO search began in the aftermath of the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal.Earlier this year, the agency\u2019s former deputy executive director,       Bill Baroni,        and a former aide to New Jersey\u2019s governor,       Bridget Anne Kelly,        were sentenced to prison for their roles in a conspiracy to misuse Port Authority property in an act of political retribution. They have said they would appeal.The pair were found to have created gridlock in a New Jersey town by closing access lanes to the bridge to punish a mayor for refusing to endorse New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s re-election bid.A second high-ranking Port Authority official,       David Wildstein,        pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and awaits sentencing.Because of the bistate nature of the Port Authority, agency reforms must be enacted in both New York and New Jersey. Reform bills that cemented the CEO position in law passed in both states in 2014, but they were vetoed by both governors.Subsequent reform legislation passed in New York. Democrats in New Jersey\u2019s senate have repeatedly blocked parallel legislation saying it was too weak.New Jersey State Sen.       Loretta Weinberg       said the legislation hadn\u2019t been the sole impediment to finding a suitable candidate. \u201cCEO candidates have been found,\u201d Ms. Weinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just they\u2019ve never gotten both governors to sign off.\u201dThe agency\u2019s executive director, Patrick Foye, had applied for the CEO position. When it became apparent in the fall of 2015 that he wouldn\u2019t get the role, he tendered his resignation, effective March 2016.New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       persuaded Mr. Foye to stay on past the deadline, and he remains in the position today.Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni and a former aide to New Jersey\u2019s governor, Bridget Anne Kelly, were sentenced to prison this year.

In another notable example this week, shares in mainland China-based auto maker Great Wall Motor surged 21% in one day on Monday. The stock had been one of the most heavily shorted in Hong Kong: Almost 15% of its shares are out on loan, a proxy for short interest, according to IHS Markit.Sure, there have been some bullish notes from analysts on Great Wall recently, that may have contributed to its sudden rise. But short sellers in Hong Kong are also getting caught out by the market\u2019s structure, notably the prevalence of small free-floats and dominant shareholders. Only a third of Great Wall\u2019s shares, for example, are tradable in Hong Kong, with the rest listed in Shanghai. The small free float in this $16 billion company means it doesn\u2019t take much for shorting the stock to become a crowded trade.Anyone piling into short positions in stocks such as Great Wall is also at risk if investors from mainland China, notorious momentum traders, start flocking in. These investors, who can buy stocks in Hong Kong via a trading link called Stock Connect, now own around 26% of Great Wall\u2019s shares listed there, up from 10% at the start of the year. The inflow may have caused some short sellers to capitulate this week, while the tight liquidity in trading of the stock looks likely to have exacerbated its volatility.Other heavily shorted stocks have seen similar jumps recently. Shares in property developer Sunac rose 12% Tuesday. Its chairman owns 54% of the company while mainland investors own 23%. With such a small free float, investors with short positions can easily get squeezed. Another property developer, China Evergrande, has been one of Hong Kong\u2019s most heavily shorted stocks. Yet its shares have tripled this year, partly because of share buybacks by the company, which has left its free float at only 22%. Shorts now account for around a fifth of this free float, making them highly vulnerable to sudden inflows from the north.In Hong Kong, it takes more than looking at financial statements to be a successful short seller.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 04:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/going-short-is-a-quick-route-to-pain-in-hong-kong-1497516907", "news_title": "Going Short Is a Quick Route to Pain in Hong Kong", "keywords": " china autos, china stocks, hong kong china stock connect, hong kong shorts, hong kong stocks,short selling,Great Wall Motors,2333.HK,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,sports utility vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "U.S. authorities temporarily evacuated the Port of Charleston in South Carolina to investigate a potential threat on a container ship before giving the all clear.The U.S. Coast Guard said it became aware of a possible threat in a container aboard the Maersk Memphis at about 8 p.m. ET at Charleston\u2019s Wando terminal.

Not, it seems, investors in emerging markets.The Fed\u2019s overnight interest-rate increase, the second this year, drew a muted response in early trading Thursday. In Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 1% and Korea\u2019s Kospi index slipped 0.6%; both remain up by double-digit percentages for the year. The U.S. dollar was broadly steady against major global currencies.At the start of the year there were concerns that as U.S. interest rates rise, money would flow out of emerging markets. But the Fed\u2019s tightening has been gradual and well-telegraphed, and central banks in Europe and Japan have continued their loose-money policies. Combine that with investors\u2019 unceasing pursuit of high-yield assets, and the result has been a boon for emerging markets stocks and bonds. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, one of the biggest funds that invests in emerging-market stocks, has gained 19% this year.And even though the Fed is now detailing plans to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year\u2014which could push up long-term U.S. Treasury yields\u2014many investors remain emerging-market optimists.The Fed\u2019s current approach to shrinking its balance sheet \u201cis like trying to empty a bathtub with a thimble,\u201d said       Ashley Perrott,        head of pan-Asian fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Singapore.\u201cIf the economic data stays decent and the economic trajectory is as they expect it to be, then I don\u2019t think the rundown in the balance sheet is likely to upset other markets too much,\u201d he said.Foreigners bought an estimated net $20.5 billion of emerging-market stocks and bonds in May, the sixth straight month of net inflows, according to the Institute of International Finance. This year\u2019s pace is on par with the average from 2010 to 2014, it said.It isn\u2019t just the search for yield that is boosting the allure. Also helping: Resilient trade and economic growth for many emerging markets, including China, where first-quarter growth was rosier than expected.The concern, however, is that the wave of money into emerging markets could just as easily recede, as during the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d of 2013, when investors stampeded out of emerging market assets after the Fed indicated it could begin winding down its bond purchases.This year\u2019s contrasting calm can be credited to better communication between central bankers and investors.\u2018Hot money is always a cause for concern.\u2019\u201cEmerging markets four or five years ago were so worried about the Fed slowing asset purchases and entering a rate-hiking cycle,\u201d said       Arthur Kwong,        head of Asia Pacific Equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cBut now that\u2019s not the case. There has been so much time and communication from the Fed that there are very few surprises anymore.\u201dSure, some large money managers are trimming their holdings. Goldman Sachs Asset Management said last week it has cut its exposure to emerging-market currencies.Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week showed that fast-moving investors like hedge funds did little to change their bullish positioning on emerging-market currencies, according to analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\u201cHot money is always a cause for concern,\u201c said       Dwyfor Evans,        head of macro-strategy for Asia Pacific at             State Street Global Markets.       \u201dWe know that just looking at history of markets over the past 20 years, hot money is hot money by definition and doesn\u2019t stay in emerging markets when there are compelling reasons for it to move elsewhere.\u201dBut he added that low volatility is typically a beneficial factor for emerging markets and the gains in risky assets for much of the year are still supported by the broader macroeconomic environment.\u201cI think it\u2019s only natural at this stage for investors to start thinking about how to protect themselves in emerging markets and risk markets broadly,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com and Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-15 02:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emerging-markets-no-longer-fear-the-fed-1497508281", "news_title": "Emerging Markets No Longer Fear the Fed", "keywords": "boj,easy money,emerging market bonds,emerging-market funds,emerging markets,emerging market stocks,fed,fed policy,fed tightening,interest rates,monetary policy,taper tantrum,economic news,banking,central banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,credit,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "U.S. states are forecast to barely increase spending in the next fiscal year as they grapple with weak revenue and uncertainty about policy changes in Washington, D.C., according to a new report released Thursday.The cautious outlook is reflected in governors\u2019 budget proposals for the year that begins July 1 in 46 states, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. The proposals are aiming for just a 1% increase in general-fund spending in fiscal 2018, the smallest increase since fiscal 2010, when states were grappling with fallout from the last recession, Nasbo found in its latest report.The small spending increases reflect a persistent problem: weak revenue collection that has dogged states in the last couple of years, raising some worries about how prepared states are for the next recession, according to budget experts.Nasbo found that revenue collections are coming in weaker than expected for the current fiscal year in a total of 33 states, also the highest number since 2010. Many states also missed projections in the prior fiscal year.\u201cState\u2019s have been dealing with back-to-back years of sluggish revenue growth,\u201d said John Hicks, Nasbo\u2019s executive director. The data show \u201chow thin states\u2019 margins are.\u201dNasbo said states are forecasting modestly improved revenue collections in the next year. Still, spending levels in final budgets, which some state legislatures are still hammering out, aren\u2019t likely to deviate much from the governors\u2019 proposals, Mr. Hicks said.Wild cards that could reduce the amount of federal money flowing to the states include possible changes in Washington to Medicaid, the tax code and non-defense spending levels, said Nasbo.Gabriel Petek, sector leader for U.S. states at Standard & Poor\u2019s, said sluggish economic growth in the U.S. has helped cause persistent revenue challenges across the states. The specific reasons for that weakness vary, from low energy prices in some states to a shift to more online sales hurting others, according to another state-budget report from the National Conference of State Legislatures.Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, New York and Oklahoma have all dealt with weaker-than-expected business taxes, NCSL said. Meantime, sluggish sales and individual income taxes have dogged Mississippi. At least 11 states went into extended or special legislative sessions to hammer out the next budget, NCSL said.\u201cCaseloads and the need for government services continue to increase, and revenues are not keeping pace with demand,\u201d NCSL\u2019s report said.The weakness has put states in an unusually vulnerable position, considering June marks eight years since the end of the last recession, Mr. Petek said. S&P has downgraded ratings for 15 states since the beginning of 2016, compared with just two upgrades, reflecting strained finances and weak revenue, he said.\u201cThe combination has left many states with narrow fiscal margins, which is indeed uncharacteristic for a mature economic expansion,\u201d he said.One of those downgrades came Friday, when S&P lowered the rating on Massachusetts\u2019 general obligation debt one notch to AA because the ratings firm didn\u2019t feel the state was rebuilding its cash reserves well enough. States lean on these reserves to help manage fiscal downturns.Massachusetts Gov.       Charlie Baker,        a Republican in office since January 2015, said in a statement that the state has avoided tax increases while paying down long-term obligations and ending a prior state practice of drawing down reserves to pay for operating expenses. He said he is urging the Democratic-led legislature to make moves to grow reserves more quickly.States in general have made good progress boosting rainy day funds since the last recession, according to Nasbo. Still, Mr. Petek said states have only replaced about one-third of the jobs cut in response to the last recession, suggesting little margin for spending cuts they might also need to manage another downturn.\u201cYou\u2019re touching on critical services that have to be cut back,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have a lot of fiscal flexibility.\u201dWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.comAppeared in the June 15, 2017, print edition as 'States Expect to Lift Spending for Next Year by 1%.'", "news_time": "2017-06-15 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-plan-meager-spending-increases-in-next-year-1497499261", "news_title": "States Plan Meager Spending Increases in Next Year ", "keywords": "charlie baker,massachusetts,medicaid,s&p,state budgets,states,tax code,National Association of State Budget Officers,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}]
