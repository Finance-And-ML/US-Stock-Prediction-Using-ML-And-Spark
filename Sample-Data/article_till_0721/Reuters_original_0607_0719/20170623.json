Nonetheless, he has to feel pretty good about his club coming off a successful road trip. Austin Jackson had three hits with three RBIs, Erik Gonzalez homered and the Indians took three of four games against the Baltimore Orioles with a 6-3 victory on Thursday night. Cleveland has won eight of its past nine games and outscored Baltimore 28-10 in the series. The Orioles have allowed at least five runs in 19 consecutive games -- one shy of the major league record set by the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.  I don't care about a week ago,  Francona said.  We showed up today to win today. That's what we always do. We'll enjoy it for a few minutes and then we'll get on the plane and we'll get ready for Minnesota. That's the way we always do it. I think that's the best way to not get too down or too full of yourself. Stay right in the moment.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at OriolesCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchCleveland's Mike Clevinger (3-3) got his first victory in five starts. He allowed two runs and six hits with four strikeouts and four walks in five innings. The Indians' Jose Ramirez went 1-for-4, ending his consecutive multi-hit game streak. He was the first Cleveland player since 1936 with two or more hits for nine consecutive days. Gonzalez had a solo home run in the sixth inning that boosted the Indians' margin to 5-2. Edwin Encarnacion had an RBI single in the ninth. Manny Machado pulled the Orioles within 5-3 with an RBI double in the ninth off Andrew Miller, who was one of five Cleveland relievers used in the game. Seth Smith hit his eighth home run for Baltimore. Orioles left-hander Wade Miley (3-5) labored through another start, allowing four runs, eight hits and two walks with three strikeouts in just five-plus innings and 111 pitches. Miley has given up 19 earned runs in his past four starts (15 2/3 innings).  We're going out there and working our tails off trying to work on track, and I think we're moving in the right direction,  Miley said. Baltimore lost for the 11th time in 15 games.  It's depressing, but it's part of the deal,  Orioles designated hitter Mark Trumbo said.  It's part of the game. There's not a single person that has any sympathy for us, and I get it. Tomorrow's a new day. It's a cliche, but it's the truth, and we're going to keep fighting. That's our job. We take pride in it.  Smith hit his fourth leadoff home run of the season when he hammered an 89 mph changeup by Clevinger into the left-field bleachers. The Indians took a 2-1 lead in the second on an RBI triple by Jackson and a single by Yan Gomes. Clevinger then hit two batters that helped load the bases in the bottom half of the inning. After getting Smith to hit into a 1-2-3 double play, Clevinger walked Machado and Jonathan Schoop to tie the score. Jackson gave the Indians another spark in the third with a two-out, two-run single for a 4-2 lead.  This is a good momentum boost for us going home,  Jackson said.  It's tough going on the road and getting some wins. And I think that from the first game in Minnesota, we just set a tone in the clubhouse where we went out there and we performed well.

Bench coach John Russell managed the team in Showalter's absence. ... Indians RHP Cody Allen missed the past two games because his wife was giving birth in Cleveland. Allen could be back Friday when the team returns home. ...

The court decision was the first ruling against Choi Soon-sil, a long-time confidante of the ousted South Korean president, who has been arrested and is being held in jail over the corruption scandal that ended her administration. Prosecutors had demanded a seven-year jail term for Choi on charges of obstruction of business and links to Park in order to force a university to give her daughter preferential treatment. In the sentencing ruling cited by Yonhap, the Seoul Central District Court said it  accepts the evidence that Choi conspired with school officials to give her daughter favors .  Choi violated laws and proper procedures to benefit her daughter,  the court said. Reuters was not able to reach court officials immediately to confirm the report. Choi also faces separate charges, which have yet to be heard, of extortion, abuse of power and attempted fraud to extort bribes from business conglomerates. She and Park have denied all charges against them.

The court also sentenced the president of the university to two years in prison, Yonhap reported.  Choi's 20-year-old daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, an Asian Games equestrian gold medalist, fled to Europe last year. She returned to South Korea earlier this month and claimed that she wanted to clear up any misunderstandings. Her entrance to the university and her high school diploma were canceled after authorities found her high school attendance and test grades had been forged. Prosecutors have twice sought an arrest warrant for Chung to detain her over the corruption scandal, alleging that Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) had provided her with financial assistance to sponsor her equestrian training.  Chung has denied any involvement and had said she was unaware of how Samsung's sponsorship had influenced her equestrian career. However, she later acknowledged during questioning that she knew about Samsung being her patron and that her mother had asked her to keep it secret. The court denied prosecutors' requests to arrest Chung while her mother, Park, and Samsung Group chief Jay Y. Lee were being held in detention. Lee also denies all charges against him.

That summed up the night for 2015 Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta, who has been struggling this year but turned in a vintage all-around performance on Thursday night, leading the Chicago Cubs to an 11-1 win over the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. Arrieta (7-5), in a good mood after his first win since beating the Marlins on June 6, said there were various reasons for the buzz-cut look he showed off for the first time on Thursday.  You come to Miami, and you know it's going to be hot and humid,  said Arrieta, who is 3-0 with a 1.38 ERA in his career against the Marlins.  It was time to take it down, minimize some sweat, and let it roll, man.  I feel like I've got a decent face. It doesn't matter if I don't have any hair.  The new look certainly worked Thursday. Arrieta, an All-Star and World Series champion last year, held Miami to six hits, no walks and one run in seven innings. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MarlinsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchOffensively, he went 2-for-4 with one run scored and one RBI, helping spark two rallies in what became a 16-hit, three-homer Cubs attack. Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Arrieta could have gone longer, but he wanted to be cautious due a blister on the pitcher's right thumb, which has given him trouble lately.  The cut is good -- he's fine,  Maddon said.  I did not want to press our luck at that point. But to get Jake pitching that type of quality game for us will be big.  Arrieta's vintage performance was supported by Kris Bryant's three-run homer. It was Bryant's 16th home run of the season, and it helped propel the Cubs (37-35) to their fourth win in their past five games. For Bryant, it was his first three-RBI game since April 15. Other Cubs heroes included Wilson Contreras, who hit a two-run homer, and Addison Russell and Ian Happ, who each went 4-for-5 with two RBIs. Russell homered and doubled twice for his first career game with three extra-base hits. Chicago's Mark Zagunis made his major-league debut, starting in right field and batting ninth. He got an RBI in his first at-bat, grounding out to shortstop. He finished 0-for-5. Marcell Ozuna hit his 20th homer of the season, a solo shot, to lead Miami (32-39). Ozuna is three short of tying his career high for homers. Marlins starter Jeff Locke (0-3) has yet to win during his brief career in Miami. He lasted four innings, allowing seven hits, three walks and five runs.  I just didn't make enough good pitches,  Locke said. Chicago got to Locke in the second inning. Russell and Happ singled, and Javier Baez was walked intentionally with one out. That set up Arrieta (infield single) and Zagunis (groundout) for their RBIs. Ozuna's leadoff homer in the bottom of the second cut Miami's deficit to 2-1. He hit a 3-0 pitch to left-center field.  We felt,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said,  that we were in the game right there.  That soon changed. Chicago took a 5-1 lead when Bryant's blast was preceded by Arrieta's single and a two-out, four-pitch walk to Anthony Rizzo. Russell gave Chicago a 6-1 advantage with a solo homer in the fifth, his seventh long ball of the season. Contreras hit his two-run shot in the sixth, and the rout was on for Chicago.  I don't want to get too crazy over one game,  Maddon cautioned.  But it was a nice game. We had good at-bats, utilizing more of the field.

Banco de Mexico raised its benchmark rate MXCBIR=ECI by a quarter percentage point to 7.00 percent, as expected by all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters last week. One member voted to hold rates, the bank said in a statement. The central bank has now raised its main interest rate in the last seven meetings. The rate has reached the highest level since early 2009, with inflation at more than an eight-year high. Policymakers said in their statement that with Thursday's hike  the reference rate has reached a level that is consistent with the process of efficient convergence of inflation to the 3 percent target,  though they said they would be vigilant.  I think they are saying they are done with the hikes,  said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura in New York.  That is very clear.  Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve were to hike interest rates later this year, as many in the market expect, Banco de Mexico might be able to leave its benchmark rate on hold, governor Agustin Carstens said in an interview with U.S. news agency Bloomberg. The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard Garrido Certainly it is possible, it depends on the context,  Carstens said.  We believe that where we are now will lead us to the 3 percent (inflation target) level at some point. We are ready to make the statement that up to today we think it is sufficient but we will be very vigilant.  Yields on short-term interest rate swaps MXNIRS fell sharply after the decision as investors cut bets on any more interest rate hikes. In a poll from last week, analysts had projected one more rate hike before the end of the year, taking it to 7.25 percent.  The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard GarridoThe board said the majority of members voted to hike in order to anchor inflation expectations and also to take into account last week's move by the Fed to hike borrowing costs. Analysts expected Mexico would match the Fed's quarter-point rate hike last week in a bid to maintain the appeal of peso-denominated debt to yield-hungry investors. Policymakers said in their statement the risks to growth were tilted downwards, but had improved on the margin. They said the risks to inflation were neutral given  the current stance of monetary policy.   Data earlier on Thursday showed that the annual inflation rate in early June rose more than expected to 6.30 percent, its highest since January 2009. But policymakers said in their statement that the inflation rate would peak in the coming months. The inflation rate has risen because of weakness in the peso, but the currency has rallied back from a record low it hit in January as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose big tariffs on imports from Mexico.

The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was effectively flat at 97.492. The index peaked at a one-month high of 97.871 on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week and left the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year. But it has been stuck in a tight range since, awaiting fresh catalysts.  While the market was able to draw incentives from the Fed last week, there really were not a lot of factors for the dollar to move on this week in the absence of major indicator releases and political events,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  But inflation is likely to be the theme that moves currencies next week which will see the release of various U.S. indicators. They will be key as this week's slump in crude oil has clouded the U.S. inflation outlook.  U.S. data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index.  While most U.S. indicators bear watching, what really matters for the dollar are wages and inflation-related data, culminating with the non-farm payrolls in two week's time,  said Makoto Noji, a senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. The dollar was flat at 111.320 yen. It had scaled a near one-month peak of 111.790 on Tuesday before edging down in tandem with U.S. yields, which were nudged lower by falling oil prices. The greenback was still on track for a gain of 0.4 percent this week. The euro was also steady, at $1.1158. It was poised to lose about 0.4 percent this week. Commodity-linked currencies held to significant gains made overnight following a rebound in crude oil prices from 10-month lows. The Canadian dollar was flat at C$1.3223 per dollar after rallying 0.75 percent on Thursday. The loonie also received a helping hand from solid domestic retail sales which boosted expectations for an interest rate hike in July from the Bank of Canada. The Norwegian crown was little changed at 8.4887 crowns per dollar after rising about 0.5 percent overnight. The crown was also supported as Norway's central bank lifted its rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018 and said a rate cut was no longer likely. The pound was 0.1 percent higher at $1.2700, its strongest in three days, as it rode momentum gained late on Thursday after Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes said  lift-off  of British interest rates should not be delayed any longer. Conflicting signals from top BoE officials this week, including those by Governor Mark Carney who said it was not the right time to hike rates, have sent sterling on a roller coaster ride. The currency has gone from a high of $1.2814 on Monday to a low of $1.2589 on Wednesday, its weakest in two months. The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.7547 and the New Zealand dollar was down 0.1 percent at $0.7258 .

The review will focus in part on accusations from some current and former employees that bribes were involved, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP, which is in the early stages of the probe, was hired by the ride service after employees gave contradictory accounts of how Uber obtained the medical records, one of the people said.  The firm is also exploring whether former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knew how Uber came into possession of the records, the person added. Kalanick through a spokesman declined to comment. Uber also declined to comment, and O'Melveny & Myers did not respond to a request for comment.      Members of Uber's board were briefed about the investigation in recent days, shortly before five major Uber investors sent a letter to Kalanick to demand his resignation, said the person. The probe was likely one reason the board turned against Kalanick, who stepped down on Tuesday, the first person said. The investigation is ongoing and has not reached any conclusions on whether Uber improperly obtained the records. Reuters has no evidence that bribery occurred.  The rape victim sued Uber last week, accusing the ride service operator of improperly obtaining and sharing her medical records. The suit said that shortly after the rape occurred, former Uber Asia chief Eric Alexander  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.  Alexander, through spokeswoman Heather Wilson, denied paying any bribes and said that the files containing the victim's records had been obtained through appropriate, legal methods. An employee walks inside the office of ride-hailing service Uber in Gurugram, previously known as Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, April 19, 2016.Anindito MukherjeeA Delhi police spokesman did not answer multiple phone calls from Reuters to seek comment. The rapist was convicted in 2015. According to a person familiar with conversations between Kalanick and Alexander, the two executives had discussed obtaining the victim's records because they suspected the rape might have been fabricated by an Uber rival to damage the company.  Another person said Alexander showed the medical files to colleagues in New Delhi more than once. Wilson denied that Alexander had discussed or shared the records with colleagues. She said that Alexander believed the victim was raped and never expressed the view that it was a set up. Uber fired Alexander earlier this month. Kalanick, 40, announced late on Tuesday that he was resigning as chief executive, though he would remain on the board of Uber. He said he had accepted  the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.  Privately held Uber has grown from startup to a global ride  service valued at $68 billion in less than a decade, driven by Kalanick, who set the tone of a company that challenged laws and norms to succeed.  Confidence in Kalanick had been strained this year by claims of sexual harassment in the company and a lawsuit accusing Uber of benefiting from trade secrets stolen from self-driving car technology from Alphabet Inc's Waymo.

The Nikkei was flat at 20,119.55 in midmorning trade. The index is on track to gain 0.9 percent for the week -where it touched its highest levels since August 2015.

The stock has stayed strong since it announced last week on Twitter that it would release Super Mario Odyssey for Switch on Oct. 27.

NTT Docomo fell 0.5 percent, KDDI Corp dropped 0.8 percent and SoftBank Group slid 0.8 percent. According to NHK, the ministry conducted undercover investigation at 300 mobile phone shops nationwide earlier this year on whether staffers fully explained the plans.

The rain and starting pitching issues just made Thursday another long day for the Minnesota Twins. Matt Davidson had three hits, including a towering home run, while Jose Abreu and Todd Frazier each supplied first-inning, two-run homers in Chicago's 9-0 win against Minnesota on Thursday. Jose Quintana (4-8) enjoyed the run support to win his second straight start and the White Sox snapped a three-game losing streak. The game was delayed for 4 hours, 50 minutes at the start because of persistent rain showers.  It's miserable,  Frazier said of the delay.  You try and find some things to do. Play cards. Hang out with the guys. If you had a set time, it'd help. But we came out banging, man. We took it to 'em in that first inning. That was huge.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at TwinsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchAs soon as play began, Chicago jumped on Twins starter NikTurley's offerings. Turley (0-2) got only two outs in his third major league start, allowing five runs on six hits. He was optioned back to Triple-A Rochester after the game.  You just watch the inning unfold, there was ball one on, I think, eight of the nine hitters he faced,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  It just got out of hand. I wanted to try and get him through because I needed some innings, but we got to four and they got a couple more hits. I tried to stop the bleeding.  Quintana did his part after getting a big lead. He pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings while giving up five hits and striking out nine. Turley struggled with command, getting behind each of the first five batters. Abreu lined a homer to left as the third batter of the inning and Frazier followed Avisail Garcia's hit with another two-run homer. Adam Engel had four hits and his first career RBIs for the White Sox, who avoided being swept at Target Field for the fifth time in the park's eight-year history.  I tip my hat to them, because obviously they're the ones dealing with all the chaos, so to speak,  Chicago manager Rick Renteria said of the players dealing with the rain delay.  They're the ones who play the game. They're the ones who have to get their minds ready to go out and perform. They've been able to respond well. That's just part of who they are, their character, and hopefully that's something they'll be able to continue to do.  Davidson had his team-leading 17th homer to lead off the fifth. He's second to New York's Aaron Judge in homers among American League rookies and has homered in seven of his past 10 games. Turley has been the last minor league recall the Twins have used to try and fill in the depleted and ineffective rotation, but the left-hander has struggled in each of his three starts, not pitching past the fifth inning in any outing. He owns a 16.39 ERA in his three career appearances.  I feel like today it was a lot to do with my mentality,  Turley said.  There's no excuse. It's just I went out there and I was a little cautious instead of pitching my game. So, I started getting behind guys. I know if I get ahead and stay aggressive in the zone then I'll be alright. But I kept getting behind guys, you can't do that here.  Quintana has started to round into form after a disappointing start to his season. The left-hander has a 2.25 ERA (six earned runs, 24 innings) in four June starts after starting the month with a 5.60 ERA.  I'm really happy with changeup today,  Quintana said.  Almost tonight, right? It's a long day here. All my stuff was real good.  NOTES: The delay at the start of the game due to rain was the longest delay in Twins history. ... Minnesota placed INF Ehire Adrianza on the disabled list after the game with abdominal issues. Manager Paul Molitor said Adrianza will be having tests to determine the problem. ... Each of Chicago 1B Jose Abreu's 13 home runs has come on the road this season. The last homer he hit at home was Sept. 15, 2016, against Cleveland. ... Twins LHP Hector Santiago (left shoulder strain) got through a successful rehab start with Triple-A Rochester on Wednesday but the team is waiting to decide the next step of Santiago's rehab. Santiago threw three hitless innings and gave up one walk. ... White Sox manager Rick Renteria expressed his excitement in Chicago returning home for 10 games starting Friday against Oakland.

Fitch has also assigned CNLP's senior unsecured rating at 'B', with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. CNLP's ratings are supported by the strong industry demand for high-standard warehouses, the company's national geographic coverage and its extensive network. CNLP will also benefit from its advantage in China's Yangtze-River-Delta (YRD) region, being one of the largest logistic-property owners in the area. However, its ratings are constrained by small scale, low interest coverage of below 1.0x at 0.57x in 2016, and continuing funding demand for capex. CNLP's reliance on debt for this expansion indicates its limited financial flexibility, and is therefore a further constraint to its rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS Growing Industry, Regional Imbalance: China's high-standard warehouse industry is still underdeveloped. This presents enormous potential, accounting for only 2%-3% of total warehouse supply of around 1 billion square metres (sqm) as of end-2015 - in sharp contrast to a penetration rate of over 20% in the US. The industry has been growing rapidly over the past decade, driven by compound annual growth rate (CAGR) growth of over 40% in the e-commerce sector in 2011-2015. E-commerce (including related third-party logistics, or 3PLs) is likely to comprise 50% of the new warehouse demand in 2017, according to CBRE Research. Nevertheless, the favourable industry outlook and higher investment return have attracted so many new entrants that some Tier 2 cities in China started to show signs of overcapacity in 2016, especially in western China such as Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan. On the other hand, Fitch expects Tier 1 city rents to hold firm and enjoy 3%-6% rent reversion due to limited land supply. We are likely to see rent divergence in different cities and some weakness in the rental growth of lower-tier cities in 2017. Strong Network Effect, YRD-Focused: CNLP is one of the top 10 high-standard warehouse owners in China, with more than 2 million sqm of completed logistic properties. CNLP is relatively stronger in the YRD, with 30%-40% completed gross floor area (GFA) concentrated in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces - of which Suzhou alone accounts for 20%-30%. JD.com is the largest customer and contributed 31% of CNLP's total revenue in 2016; 34% of the GFA completed is occupied by multi-location tenants. The market competition will continue to be intense, although Fitch believes that the industry will be increasingly dominated by large players with a strong network and solid customer relationships. Small Scale, Declining Occupancy Rate: CNLP had recurring EBITDA of USD17 million in 2016, much smaller than the industry leader Global Logistic Properties Limited's (BBB+/Stable) EBITDA USD772 million in the year ended March 2017. CNLP had a thin EBITDA margin of only 40% in 2016, due mainly to its small scale. The company is also facing a declining occupancy rate for its completed and 'stabilised' logistic assets, which dropped to 86.6% in 2016 from 97.3% in 2014. Judging by the relatively low occupancy rate of the 2016 new projects, Fitch expects the occupancy rate for stabilised assets to further decline in 2017, which will exert pressure on CNLP's EBITDA margin and pace of expansion. CNLP defines 'stabilised projects' as those in operation for more than 12 months or achieving a 90% occupancy rate. High Capex, Low Interest Coverage: CNLP's recurring EBITDA interest coverage was only 0.57x in 2016 (excluding all IPO-related expenses). Coverage may edge lower in 2017 because the interest payment will more than double after CNLP replaces all equity-like hybrid instruments with traditional debt funding, even if EBITDA doubles in 2017. Fitch expects coverage to rise to above 1x by end-2019 when more than 80% of CNLP's assets become stabilised. However, any significant changes in market demand/supply dynamics may delay the improvement in CNLP's interest coverage. Low Leverage: CNLP's LTV (net debt to investment property assets) was low at 26% at end 2016. However, Fitch expects the leverage headroom to be small as CNLP's unsecured assets/unsecured debt coverage was only 1.1x and will continue to hover around 1x in the next three years. CNLP had CNY1.5 billion in unpledged investment property at end-2016, while unsecured offshore debt amounted to CNY1.4 billion. DERIVATION SUMMARY CNLP's business profile is in line with the 'B+'/'BB-' category, but the recurring EBITDA interest coverage of only 0.6x is more in line with a 'B-' rating, which results in a final rating of 'B'. CNLP is still far away from 'BB-' rated peers such as Lai Fung Holdings Limited (BB-/Stable) with an interest coverage of 1.3x and better asset quality; and PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk (BB-/Positive) with an interest coverage of 2.5x, helped by its quality malls but constrained by its small scale and exposure to development property. CNLP's financials are weaker than PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka Tbk (KJIA, B+/Stable), whose recurring EBITDA is generated from its long-term electricity sales and purchase agreements with state-owned PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN,  BBB-/Positive), and the interest coverage hovers consistently above 1x with temporary disruption due to power plant repair work. However, CNLP is expanding faster than KIJA, driven by demand from China's fast-growing e-commerce industry. Fitch expects CNLP's financial profile to be closer to a 'B' rating in 2019-2020, depending on market conditions and the ramp-up of progress in CNLP's new projects. CNLP's weaker financial profile than other investment-property owners is also due to the logistic property sector's longer return period and CNLP's fast expansion. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Completed and stabilised assets-occupancy rate to edge down to 86% in 2017-2018 due to a lower occupancy rate for pre-stabilised assets. - Effective rent growth of 2% in 2017-2018. - Total completed net leasable area of 2.6 million sqm and 3.5 million sqm in 2017-2018. - EBITDA margin to improve to 49% in 2017 and 59% in 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Stable occupancy rate for completed and stabilised assets above 80% -Recurring EBITDA/interest coverage sustained above 1.2x -   Net debt/recurring EBITDA sustained below 10x (2016: 27.8x) Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Recurring EBITDA/interest coverage fails to improve significantly -Inability to secure funding for expansion or deterioration in liquidity - Weakening of business profile that would be reflected in a significant drop in occupancy rates or a sustained fall in rentals LIQUIDITY Weak Liquidity: CNLP had about CNY2 billion in cash equivalents as of end-2016 compared with CNY604 million of short-term debt. Liquidity is bolstered by CNY3 billion of equity proceeds from its IPO in June 2016. However, Fitch expects CNLP to rely on capital market debt, further equity placements, or to sell land to fund its CNY2 billion-3 billion capex per year over the next three years.

The remarks came a day after Fujimori's supporters in Congress delivered their biggest blow yet to Kuczynski in his year in office by ousting his finance minister and targeting his interior minister for a potential censure.  I think it's time to look at it,  Kuczynski told reporters about pardoning Fujimori, confirming comments attributed to him in an interview published on Thursday by the Economist magazine. Keiko Fujimori welcomed Kuczynski's remarks in the first hint of a truce with the opposition since last year. She has led her father's right-wing populist movement since he was jailed in 2009 for human rights violations.  It's time to act. Use your power as president. Pardon him,   Keiko Fujimori said on Twitter. Fujimori is a divisive figure in Peru, considered a corrupt dictator by some but admired by others who credit him with fixing the economy and ending a bloody insurgency in the 1990s. Kuczynski, who narrowly beat Keiko Fujimori in last year's presidential election, said at the start of his term that he would not pardon Fujimori but would be willing to sign legislation to let aging prisoners carry out their sentences under house arrest. However, Kuczynski's government has been dogged by clashes with Keiko Fujimori's party, which secured a solid majority of congressional seats in elections last year. Tensions between the executive and Congress heightened this week following a weeks-long battle over the finance minister, who was accused of interfering in an autonomous institution after he asked the comptroller to approve a controversial contract modification. A presidential pardon would anger Fujimori's opponents, who rallied behind Kuczynski to help him scrape together a victory against Keiko Fujimori in a tight run-off.  (Kucynski's) being cornered and instead of fighting it out like a statesman, he's ceding to their pressure,  Peru's biggest labor group, the CGTP, said. Fujimori, who governed Peru from 1990-2000, is serving a 25-year sentence for convictions that include graft and leading death squads that killed civilians. Former president Ollanta Humala rejected a request for a humanitarian pardon for Fujimori in 2013 after a medical committee concluded he did not suffer from a terminal illness. Fujimori, now 78, often leaves his prison cell to receive medical treatment for various ailments at clinics in Lima.

Tension has been high for months over North Korea's nuclear and missile development, and due to fears it will conduct a sixth nuclear test and more ballistic missile launches in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Asia's first Winter Olympics outside Japan will see South Korea's alpine town of Pyeongchang and the coastal city of Gangneung host thousands of athletes and officials when the Games start in February.  There are obviously geopolitical issues,  Zenkel said, speaking by telephone.  I don't think there's an Olympics or any global sporting event without them.  We're all aware of the issues facing that particular location and we're playing close attention and staying in touch with the different organizations and the experts we have access to,  Zenkel said, adding the network gets information from the U.S. State Department. NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, is the U.S. exclusive broadcaster for the Olympics, and it usually uses the games to host its best advertisers and clients on site.  It hosted hundreds of clients in Sochi in 2014 and about 1,500 in Rio last year.  In South Korea, however, NBC would not be inviting guests to the Games and would instead be hosting them in the U.S. ski town of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Zenkel said.  Contrary to media reports, Zenkel said NBC made that decision as far back as 2014, and it was because of limited accommodations near the Olympic venues, unrelated to any security concerns.  NBC's priority was finding housing for its workers, many of whom are coming from abroad, Zenkel said. Clients who want to go can still be invited by sponsors which are doing hospitality at the Games, he added. A 13-hour time difference between New York and South Korea could actually work to NBC's advantage for showing live events such as skiing and figure skating in U.S. prime time, Zenkel said, adding that events for U.S. ski racers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin should be a draw.   The events in morning or early afternoon will take place in prime time when our largest audience comes together,  he said. Reporting by Liana B.

Brent crude futures were at $45.31 per barrel at 0222 GMT, up 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $42.84 per barrel. Oil prices have fallen about 20 percent this year despite an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) that has been in place since January. That's the worst first-half performance for crude oil since 1997, when rising output and the Asian financial crisis led to sharp price falls. The weak markets are a result of doubts over OPEC's ability to rein in a fuel supply overhang that has dogged markets since 2014 as production has largely outpaced consumption.  Markets remain sceptical of OPEC's ability to balance supplies,  ANZ bank said on Friday. At the heart of the glut is that rising production levels from the traditional suppliers of OPEC and Russia have been met by soaring output from the United States. Thanks largely to shale drillers, U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by more than 10 percent over the last year to 9.35 million bpd, close to levels of top exporter Saudi Arabia.

Tension has been high for months over North Korea's nuclear and missile development, and due to fears it will conduct a sixth nuclear test and more ballistic missile launches in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Asia's first Winter Olympics outside Japan will see South Korea's alpine town of Pyeongchang and the coastal city of Gangneung host thousands of athletes and officials when the Games start in February.  There are obviously geopolitical issues,  Zenkel said, speaking by telephone.  I don't think there's an Olympics or any global sporting event without them.  We're all aware of the issues facing that particular location and we're playing close attention and staying in touch with the different organizations and the experts we have access to,  Zenkel said, adding the network gets information from the U.S. State Department. NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, is the U.S. exclusive broadcaster for the Olympics, and it usually uses the games to host its best advertisers and clients on site.  It hosted hundreds of clients in Sochi in 2014 and about 1,500 in Rio last year.  In South Korea, however, NBC would not be inviting guests to the Games and would instead be hosting them in the U.S. ski town of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Zenkel said.  Contrary to media reports, Zenkel said NBC made that decision as far back as 2014, and it was because of limited accommodations near the Olympic venues, unrelated to any security concerns.  NBC's priority was finding housing for its workers, many of whom are coming from abroad, Zenkel said. Clients who want to go can still be invited by sponsors which are doing hospitality at the Games, he added. A 13-hour time difference between New York and South Korea could actually work to NBC's advantage for showing live events such as skiing and figure skating in U.S. prime time, Zenkel said, adding that events for U.S. ski racers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin should be a draw.   The events in morning or early afternoon will take place in prime time when our largest audience comes together,  he said. Reporting by Liana B.

(GHIH) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A+' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also assigned an expected 'A+(EXP)' rating to GHIH's proposed senior unsecured US dollar notes, to be issued by its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Hengjian International Investment Limited. GHIH will provide an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the proposed offshore notes. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The note is expected to be a bullet bond. The final ratings on the proposed US dollar notes are contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Links to Guangdong Province: The ratings of GHIH are credit linked to those of Guangdong province. This reflects its 100% state ownership, strong provincial financial oversight and its strategic importance to the province. These factors result in a high likelihood of extraordinary support, if needed. Therefore, GHIH is classified as a credit-linked public sector entity under Fitch's rating criteria. Guangdong's Strong Creditworthiness: Located in the southern China, Guangdong province's gross regional product ranks first among all Chinese provinces. The province has a robust budgetary performance, a strong and well-diversified socio-economic profile and a large portfolio of high-quality state-owned assets. These strengths are mitigated by its moderately high contingent liabilities arising from provincial government-owned public sector entities. Legal Status  Mid-Range : GHIH is registered as a local state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law. It is wholly owned by Guangdong State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Guangdong SASAC) and is supervised by the Guangdong provincial government. The government does not plan to dilute its shareholding in GHIH. Strategic Importance  Stronger : GHIH is designated as the province's sole state-owned asset operation and state-owned capital investment company. It manages a portfolio of key infrastructure assets, including power generation, grid operations and the region's intercity railway. In addition, it plays a vital role in supporting industry upgrades and fostering strategic emerging industries. Its unique status provides the company with a critical role in the management and reform of state-owned assets. Control  Stronger : GHIH's board members are mainly appointed by the Guangdong provincial government and major projects require government approval. The province closely monitors the company's financing plan and debt levels and it is required to regularly report its operational and financial results. Integration  Stronger : The government has provided ongoing capital injections and subsidies to monetarily support GHIH's business. The fiscal support aims to partly fund its capital expenditure and debt servicing. GHIH also receives non-monetary government support, which helps it maintain a robust long-term relationship with major banks, including policy banks and China's major state banks. Balancing Policy and Commercial Objectives: One of the company's core objectives is to incubate investments in strategically important emerging industries and develop and connect industry clusters. GHIH exits these investments when they mature and recycles the capital into new projects to support regional economic development. RATING SENSITIVITIES Linked with Guangdong Province: Positive rating action would stem from a similar change in the province's ratings, in conjunction with continued strong government support. Negative rating action could derive from negative action taken on Fitch's internal assessment of Guangdong province. The notching between GHIH and its sponsor may be widened if the company's policy role and strategic importance to the government weaken, if the government dilutes its control or shareholding or if the likelihood of support from the sponsor is diminished. Rating action on GHIH would lead to a similar action on the proposed US dollar notes.

The House of Representatives narrowly passed its healthcare bill last month. If the Senate passes its bill, the House will either have to vote on the Senate version of the legislation or the two chambers will have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee.  Obamacare extended coverage to some 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Since its passage in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program and argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans' healthcare.  Here is how the two bills compare on their main provisions:  Medicaid Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen states with Republican governors, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Both bills would roll back the expansion and significantly overhaul the program, which provides insurance to nearly 70 million people. SENATE: The draft legislation would phase out Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid over three years, from 2021 to 2024. It would then overhaul the program and reduce its federal funding more than the House bill would, beginning in 2025. HOUSE: The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until Jan. 1, 2020. After that date, expansion would end, and people who enrolled in the expansion could not re-enroll once they leave. Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. Taxes     SENATE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes beginning after Dec. 31, 2016, including the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on wealthy Americans. The tax on branded prescription brands would be repealed in 2018, and the legislation would delay the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance. It would also provide more generous tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance for people between zero and 350 percent of the federal poverty level based on income. Under Obamacare, those between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level were eligible for tax credits.  HOUSE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes retroactively after Dec. 31, 2016, and delay the Cadillac tax to 2026. It would provide flat age-based tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels.  Mandates Both bills would repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate that nearly everyone purchase health insurance or else pay a fine, and the mandate that employers provide insurance to employees.  Coverage SENATE: The legislation would maintain the popular Obamacare provision that young adults be allowed to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26. It would also prevent insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions, but would give states flexibility to opt out of so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage, that experts said could make it harder for some sick people to find affordable plans. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans. HOUSE: The bill would allow young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. It would allow states to opt out of essential health benefits and Obamacare's requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers could charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans.

The legislation met a wall of opposition from Democrats and initial skepticism among some Republicans, leaving Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell a narrow path to passage. The bill would roll back an expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled over three years, cut its federal funding beginning in 2025, restructure Obamacare's tax credits for low-income Americans, and repeal several taxes.  To pass the bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes. The Senate is comprised of 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats (In the event of a deadlocked vote, Republican Vice President can vote to break the tie.)     Several Republicans on Thursday expressed reservations or opposition to the bill: Opposed Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah said in a joint statement:  We are not ready to vote for this bill. ... There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.  The four said they were open to negotiation, with Cruz saying in a separate statement that he wants to  get to yes.  Supportive Richard Burr of North Carolina said outside the Senate:  I'm supportive of it. I think it strikes a balance.  He added that the blueprint  can still be amended and probably will.  Three members of the Senate Republican leadership - John Cornyn of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota, and John Barrasso of Wyoming - all put out supportive statements, saying the bill would help improve the affordability of healthcare. Barrasso said the bill was not perfect, and  we will be working to improve on this draft.  Undecided - Leaning Yes Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania said he was  still studying it but it strikes me as a good first step in what will be an ongoing process of fulfilling a commitment we made to the American people.  Richard Shelby of Alabama:  We're looking at it. My plan is to support the thrust of the bill. If it’s a good bill overall, I'm going to support it.  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee listed a number of benefits for his constituents in the draft, including that it makes no change in Medicare benefits.  I'm going to stay focused on it next week as the bill goes to the Senate floor ... and my focus will be on how it affects Tennesseans.  Undecided Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia:  I will review the draft legislation released this morning ... to evaluate whether it provides access to affordable health care for West Virginians.  Bill Cassidy of Louisiana:  I'm undecided. I have to read the text.  Marco Rubio of Florida said he will  decide how to vote on health care on the basis of how it impacts Florida.  Dean Heller of Nevada said he had  serious concerns  about the bill's impact on Medicaid in his state. Susan Collins of Maine said it was  too soon  to judge the bill and she has some concerns about cuts to Medicaid after 2025 and defunding of Planned Parenthood. Rob Portman of Ohio said in a statement that he continued to have  real concerns  about the Medicaid policies in the bill, especially those that affect drug treatment. He said his decision will depend on what is in the final version of the bill. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said,  I'm going to read it.  James Risch of Idaho:  It’s a work in progress. Ask me again when we see the final product.  John McCain of Arizona said he is reading the bill.  It’s a big thing, we just found out about it. I am just waiting until I can absorb the entire bill.  Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a statement that any replacement plan must be a net improvement over Obamacare, and he would be  reviewing the draft legislation over the next several days.

Flooding and road closures stretched from east Texas into northwestern Florida after Cindy made landfall early on Thursday near the Louisiana-Texas border and weakened to a tropical depression, the National Weather Service said. Cindy is expected to dump 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) of rain as it heads north and east into the Ohio Valley and the Appalachian Mountains through Saturday, said Brian Hurley, a weather service meteorologist. Totals could reach 9 inches (22.5 cm) in some areas.  We're looking at quite a bit of rain. That's going to be the main threat,  he said. At least two tornadoes were reported near Birmingham, Alabama, destroying several buildings and injuring at least four people, according to the National Weather Service and local media.  None of the injuries were life-threatening, said Nick Dyer, police chief in Fairfield, where one tornado hit.  The center of the dying tropical storm could pass near Washington by Saturday morning and move off Massachusett's Cape Cod on Saturday evening, followed by a cold front, the National Weather Service said. By midday Thursday the storm had cut Gulf of Mexico oil production by 16 percent, representing around 288,000 barrels per day of output, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. Energy operators had evacuated 39 production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, or roughly 5 percent of them. The storm's only reported fatality occurred on Wednesday, when a 10-year-old boy was struck by a log dislodged by a large wave as he stood near the shore in Fort Morgan, Alabama, the Baldwin County coroner said.

They tell her she is  not a good woman , what she is doing is  shameful  and that her rightful place is inside her south Delhi home - caring for her sick husband and five children. But after fleeing the Taliban five years ago - where she was drenched in kerosene and almost burnt alive, her husband was ordered killed, and her children were threatened with kidnap - the 32-year-old refugee woman is past caring what people think. She is on her way to becoming a business woman.  I had no choice but to work, and now I am proud,  said Naz.  I am feeding my family and changing the view of women in my community, but most importantly I am doing a job which is showing that refugees also can do something good.  Naz is one of five Afghan refugee women who are not only battling traditional gender roles by going out to work, but who have also become unlikely warriors in the Indian capital's fight to curb plastic waste pollution. The task is immense and 10 hands will not solve it. But this project is gaining international support for its twin roles of addressing India's chronic waste problem and empowering refugee women who often flounder in their adopted homelands. Employed under  Project Patradya  - an initiative led by Delhi University students - the Afghan women produce and supply edible bowls, cups and cutlery to cafes and ice-cream parlors as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastic ones. Made from millet and wheat flour, the biscuit-like tableware is gaining popularity in the West as a sustainable, environment-friendly option to disposable plastic utensils, and those behind the initiative believe India is an untapped market.  We wanted to create a social enterprise model which was not only looking at improving the environment but also had a business plan that could employ excluded communities such as refugees,  said 20-year-old commerce student Nishchay Hans.  Plagued With Plastic Pollution Hans is one of more than 40 students at Kirori Mal College (KMC) who are part of Enactus, a charity that supports young people across the world work with poor communities and build sustainable, eco-friendly businesses.  Their projects range from creating mobile salons for unemployed hairdressers in Ghana to working with villagers in Malaysia to build home stays - all with the aim of eventually handing over the businesses to communities to run themselves. With New Delhi generating around 650 metric tonnes (650,000 kg) of plastic waste daily, only 60 percent of which is recycled, KMC students honed in on plastic pollution as a serious and neglected social problem. They found disposable plastic plates, bowls, cups and utensils make up much of the plastic waste in Delhi's burgeoning landfills, where it can take up to up to 1,000 years to decompose and leak pollutants into the soil and water. Most of the litter and pollution affecting oceans also derives from plastics. This has dire consequences for marine species, which in turn is harmful for those further up the food chain, including humans, who consume the contaminated fish. During their months of research, the students visited Delhi cafes and consulted restaurateurs, bakers and customers -- eventually settling on the idea of edible tableware as an alternative to use-and-throw utensils. The students then approached the city's refugees to join their venture in a move welcomed by the United Nations.    Not only are refugees learning valuable new skills, they are also part of a meaningful and innovative initiative,  said Ipshita Sengupta, policy associate at the U.N. Refugee Agency.  Such projects demonstrate that refugees are active members of our society making positive contributions to the communities they live in.   Bomb Blasts to Business Women India - a safe haven in a volatile region - is home to more than 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom were forced to flee conflict or persecution in neighboring countries such as Sri Lanka, China, Afghanistan and Myanmar. But the country has not signed the landmark 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out the legal obligations of states to protect refugees, nor does it have any domestic legislation in place to ensure their basic rights. As a result, many refugees are vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. They cannot easily access education and health services and endure job discrimination and low pay. The 11,000-plus Afghan refugees in India fare better than some other poor communities, but many still live hand to mouth. Opportunities to improve their lives and gain new skills are limited, so when Naz and the four other women were offered the chance to join Project Patradya, they did not hesitate. Most are the wives of once wealthy businessmen who had good lives in Kabul, but the constant fear of suicide attacks at schools, bomb blasts at markets and death and extortion threats from the Taliban left them with to choice but to flee. In India now for almost five years, the roles have reversed and these women are the breadwinners - some now widows, others have husbands who are too sick to work or unable to find a job. They work five hours daily at a charity office, above a hardware store along the bustling narrow lanes of Bhogal market, where they sit around a large table, carefully kneading and rolling dough, cutting and placing it into baking moulds. As well as making the products, the women are also trained in sales and marketing, meet customers and take orders, with the understanding they will run the business within three years. Patradya has been in operation for six months and is currently supplying edible tableware to 10 cafes and ice-cream parlors in Delhi, as well as taking online orders. The women are turning over a small profit, averaging 7,500 rupees ($115) monthly, which is divided equally between them.  It's just the beginning, so the money is not much,  said Hasiba Fata, a 41-year-old mother of four, as she sprinkled flour over the ball of dough in front of her.  But we are excited about the idea that we can become business women and run our own company, employ other people and also do something for the environment. Maybe it's possible.

Evans, 62, bandaged Murimi's bleeding arm and hurtled back down the hill to his stone farmhouse in Laikipia, which has been hit by a wave of land invasions.  He was having trouble breathing but he was still talking,  Evans said sadly, his eyes shielded by a navy hat. Dozens have been killed and injured in Kenya's drought-stricken Laikipia region as armed herders searching for scarce grazing land have driven tens of thousands of cattle onto private farms and ranches from poor-quality communal land. When they reached Ol Maisor farm, Evans discovered a second bullet had torn a huge hole in Murimi's left side.  It was too late. He died,  said Evans, looking out over his land which has been forcibly occupied since May 2016 when more than 20 herders with axes and torches cut six km (4 miles) of wooden post fence and ransacked a local school.   I've had three guys killed on this farm in the last month.  Prominent victims of the Laikipia violence include British safari company owner Tristan Voorspuy, who was shot dead in March, and Italian-born Kuki Gallmann, author of the memoir  I Dreamed of Africa , who was injured in April.  With increasingly severe droughts, population growth and the enclosure of public lands, many traditional nomads, who are often poor and illiterate, lack grass for herds so move south to where private owners limit livestock numbers and rotate animals. Between 40 and 75 percent of Laikipia - the country's second most important wildlife area after the Maasai Mara - is owned by cattle ranches and wildlife conservancies of up to about 100,000 acres. Each cow needs at least 10 acres of land to be healthy, says Evans, who normally keeps 3,000 beef cattle on his 29,000-acre ranch, as well as allowing wild elephants and zebras to graze.  The invaders have brought 30,000 cattle on to his farm.  We have nowhere to graze,  said John Leparsanti, a Samburu herder dressed in a red cloak who lives near the Evans family, 200 km (124 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.   I cannot wait and see livestock dying and yet there is grass here.  Elections Laikipia residents say local politicians are encouraging herders to invade private land to win support ahead of August elections and displace those who might vote against them. Maasai-owned Il Ngwesi, a 16,000-acre wildlife conservancy where Britain's Prince William has stayed, has also been hit. Foreign tourists had to be evacuated by helicopter in February after armed herders forced their way on to land next to luxury eco-lodges reserved for wildlife.  One Samburu invader died in the firefight, according to local administrator Maurice Kisio, which led to revenge attacks. Some 4,500 Il Ngwesi residents have been driven from their homes in recent months, Kisio said, as women in bright wrap skirts and beads queued to register for food aid while khaki-clad rangers with AK47s looked on.      Rose Kuraru, 27, was pregnant when she was shot by Samburu gunmen while cooking dinner in March, along with her six- and eight-year-old sons, in Il Ngwesi's Arjijo village. They all survived after politicians flew Kuraru by helicopter to hospital for a Caesarean-section and surgery.  I am fearful,  said shaven-headed Kuraru, sitting in bed breastfeeding her baby girl, swaddled in a white blanket.  They want to take Il Ngwesi for themselves.   Trouble began after Laikipia North member of parliament Mathew Lempurkel, a Samburu, promised to evict white landowners from Laikipia ahead of the 2013 elections, residents said.  He was telling us: 'I will take the whites back to their place and I will give you all this land',  said Teresia Karmushu, who fled her Il Ngwesi home in March after Samburu started shooting into people's houses at night.  We didn't want the speech ... because these whites are helping us,  she said, adding that many locals, like her husband, work in the tourism and conservation industry.  Lempurkel denies calling for violent evictions or inciting Voorspuy's murder, for which he was arrested in March with charges later being dropped for lack of evidence.    We don't want to go a Zimbabwe way,  he said, referring to the violence that ensued when followers of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe stormed onto white-owned farms in the early 2000s.  Let the government compensate our white brothers and let the land revert back to the ancestral owners... Why should foreigners from the UK own millions and millions of (acres of) land in Kenya?  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Grievances There are long-standing grievances over skewed land ownership in Kenya, as in other former white settler colonies, like South Africa, where President Jacob Zuma mooted the idea of expropriating land from white farmers without compensation. British colonialists gave most of Laikipia to Europeans after getting the Maasai to sign a treaty in 1911 agreeing to move some 300 km southwest to a native reserve. At least 20,000 people were forcibly moved off their land at gunpoint, according to historian Lotte Hughes. After independence, President Jomo Kenyatta gave or sold most of the departing whites' land to his own ethnic group, the Kikuyu, many of whom had also lost their land under colonialism. More recently, wealthy Kenyans, foreigners and conservationists have bought land in Laikipia.  That is a source of pain to any Maasai,  said Maasai campaigner Johnson Mali ole Kaunga, who says the treaty was  fraudulent  because the illiterate clan leaders who put their thumbprints on it did not have authority to give the land away. Kenya's National Land Commission (NLC), an independent government body set up in 2012, is investigating about 50 historical injustices claims submitted by the public, several involving Laikipia, said Commissioner Samuel Tororei. Some cases will involve public hearings, he said, before the NLC can recommend an apology, compensation or land restitution. Parliament has yet to pass regulations guiding the process and proposals to create a compensation fund. Evans said he would willingly sell his land, which his father bought in 1968, to the government but he is tired of being scapegoated as an 'outsider'.  I was born here,  said Evans.  We are home ... I'm a Kenyan as much as anybody else.

Many are left destitute - robbed of their inheritance - while others are enslaved by their in-laws, accused of witchcraft or forced into abusive sexual rituals. International Widows' Day on June 23 aims to raise awareness of the often hidden injustices faced by widows.  Here are some facts: - There are an estimated 258.5 million widows globally with 584.6 million offspring. - Deaths through conflict and disease contributed to a 9 percent rise in the number of widows between 2010 and 2015. - The biggest jump has been in the Middle East and North Africa, where the estimated number of widows rose 24 percent between 2010 and 2015, partly due to the Syrian war and other conflicts. - One in seven widows globally - 38 million - lives in extreme poverty. - One in 10 women of marital age is widowed. The proportion is about one in five in Afghanistan and Ukraine. - A third of widows worldwide live in India or China. India, with an estimated 46 million widows in 2015, has overtaken China (44.6 million) to become the country with the largest number of widows. - Widow  cleansing  rituals in some sub-Saharan countries may require a widow to drink the water used to wash her dead husband's body or to have sex with an in-law or a stranger. - Campaigners for widows' rights say such rituals, which are intended to rid a widow of her husband's spirit, spread disease and are a violation of dignity. - Widows are regularly accused of killing their husbands either deliberately or through neglect - including by transmitting HIV/AIDS - in India, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and sub-Saharan Africa. - Property seizures and evictions by the late husband's family are widespread in many places including Angola, Bangladesh, Botswana, India, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. - A significant number of girls are widowed in childhood - a reflection of the prevalence of child marriage in developing countries and the custom of marrying off young girls to much older men.

San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera last month sought a court order compelling Uber Technologies Inc to comply with the city's demands for information about the company's drivers. The city Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office wants the names, addresses and driver's license numbers of Uber's drivers. Superior Court Judge Richard Ulmer in San Francisco said in court that he will rule that the tax office has the authority to subpoena Uber for the information, Herrera said in a statement. The official ruling was expected as early as late Thursday. Uber had provided the city with the driver information for more than two years, but stopped in December. The company argues that the request violates driver privacy and could endanger drivers' safety. Ulmer said Uber had failed to show that the information requested constitutes a protected trade secret or that its disclosure would violate drivers' privacy. The city says the driver data provided through the subpoena would be protected and treated as confidential taxpayer information and not posted publicly. However, the city says it would use the subpoenaed information to contact Uber drivers and request they fill out a business registration. Information provided on the registration, which may include a business name and address such as a post office box, would be posted on a public website. The case does not involve Lyft Inc, Uber's ride-hailing competitor also based in San Francisco. Lyft does provide driver data to the city. The judge directed Uber and the city to confer and report back to him by July 3. In a separate case, San Francisco earlier this month issued subpoenas to Uber and Lyft for a broad scope of records on driving and business practices as part of an investigation to determine whether the companies have become a public nuisance. That case is ongoing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-sanfrancisco-idUSL1N1JJ1SS"},

Springer came out of the game, but that was the end of the bad news for the red-hot Astros. Jake Marisnick, who replaced Springer, and Marwin Gonzalez hit three-run homers in the second inning and rookie right-hander David Paulino pitched 5 1/3 solid innings, leading the Astros to a 12-9 victory over the Athletics and a sweep of their four-game series at the Coliseum. X-rays on Springer's left hand were negative. He is day to day with a contusion and hopes to play Friday at Seattle.  He's already lobbying for leading off tomorrow,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said of Springer, who has 21 home runs.  We were very, very cautious with pulling him out. He wanted to stay in and run and see if he could get the feeling back in his hand, but I told him I wanted to get Jake in there. It all worked out with Jake hitting a homer and George being OK. It ended up being a really good day for us.  The Astros defeated the A's at Oakland Coliseum for the 10th straight time and have won 15 of the past 16 games overall against Oakland. Houston, which swept the A's in Oakland for the third straight time, had their seventh series sweep of the season and fifth on the road. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at AthleticsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchThe Astros improved to a major league-best 50-24. The last-place A's (31-42) trail the first-place Astros by a season-high 18 1/2 games in the American League West. Former A's outfielder Josh Reddick went 3-for-4 with a double, a triple and a solo homer, his seventh blast of the season for the Astros. He also walked and scored four runs, matching his career high, and finished a single shy of his first career cycle. Evan Gattis had three RBIs. The A's were coming off a four-game sweep of the Yankees before being swept by Houston.  They were in pretty high spirits,  Reddick said, looking back to the start of the series.  We just had a tough homestand as well, so we were kind of down in the dumps a little bit. To be able to come out here and put it on them for four games was pretty special. Anytime you can sweep somebody it's going to be fun.  Paulino (2-0) gave up three runs and seven hits, struck out six and walked two. He was coming off his first career major-league victory, a 7-1 win over Boston on Saturday. Now he has his first winning streak in the big leagues. The A's trailed 10-0 after two innings but made a late push, scoring six times in the eighth inning to cut Houston's lead to 12-9. Rajai Davis, catcher Bruce Maxwell, Adam Rosales and Matt Olson doubled during the inning. Reliever Dayan Diaz gave up five runs and retired only one batter before giving way to Michael Feliz, who gave up one run. Chris Devenski pitched a perfect ninth with three strikeouts for his third save. Hahn (4-4) gave up 10 runs (nine earned) -- both career highs -- in two innings. He allowed six hits, including two home runs, walked three and struck out none. Hahn had gone 2-0 with a 2.81 ERA in his three previous starts.  I really don't have an answer for it,  Hahn said.  I just didn't have good stuff. I think it was one of those starts where no matter what I did, no matter how much I battled I couldn't find anything.  Maxwell was called up from Triple-A Nashville and went 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI and a run for the A's. Maxwell took the roster spot of catcher Stephen Vogt, a two-time American League All-Star who was designated for assignment as the A's continued a youth movement. Olson was also called up from Nashville and went 2-for-3 with a double, two walks and a run. The Astros took a 2-0 lead in the first inning. After hitting Springer, Hahn had back-to-backs walks and then gave up sacrifice flies to Carlos Beltran and Gattis. Houston scored eight times in the second to make it 10-0. Yuli Gurriel hit a leadoff single and moved to third on Norichika Aoki's double. Marisnick followed with blast to left-center field, his career-high 10th homer of the season.  We were being selective,  Marisnick said.  We were making them come in the zone, taking our walks and when we had the chance, put some good swings on balls.  The Astros reloaded the bases on Reddick's double, a walk to Carlos Correa and an error by A's first baseman Yonder Alonso.

The United States doesn't import much Chinese aluminum metal because China doesn't export aluminum in that form, just 17,000 tonnes last year.  China's massive aluminum sector is highly vertically integrated to the point that over half of all smelter output is in the form of hot, molten metal which is then transferred to a products casting plant.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2rZ7llh * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2stXAzc * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2stKbak By John Kemp LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Oil traders have become increasingly doubtful that OPEC will manage to cut crude stocks down to the five-year average in 2018 and keep them there. Calendar spreads for Brent futures throughout the rest of 2017 and 2018 have weakened significantly since OPEC agreed to roll over its production allocations at the end of May. Calendar spreads (price differences between futures contracts for delivery in different months) are closely linked to the expected level of oil inventories. Physical traders and refiners use spreads to hedge oil stored at tank farms and refineries as well as onboard ships in transit or acting as floating storage. But spreads can also be used by traders and specialist hedge funds to speculate on the level of global oil stocks in future. High and/or rising inventories are normally associated with a contango structure, where the price for oil delivered in future is higher than for immediate delivery. Low and/or declining global inventories are normally associated with a backwardation, where the price for future deliveries is below the spot price. The theoretical relationship between stocks and spreads was formulated by economist Holbrook Working in the 1930s in relation to U.S. grain futures. But the same relationship has been visible in oil, where the shift in Brent spreads between contango and backwardation has mirrored the build up and draw down in inventories since the 1990s. Brent spreads have therefore become one of the favourite ways for speculative traders to express a view on the outlook for oil production, consumption and stocks. Spreads for the remaining months of 2017 have moved into an increasingly wide contango since May 25 (tmsnrt.rs/2rZ7llh). Spreads for 2018 have seen an even more startling move from a small backwardation into a broad contango over the same period (tmsnrt.rs/2stXAzc). On May 24, the day before OPEC last meeting, Brent futures for December 2017 were trading at a premium of 99 cents per barrel over contracts for December 2018. By June 21, December 2017 futures were trading at a discount of $2.69, a shift in the spread of more than $3.50 per barrel in less than a month (tmsnrt.rs/2stKbak). Plentiful Stocks Calendar spreads are not an infallible guide to future stock levels especially beyond the next few months. Spread traders are often proved wrong. But the emergence of a large contango implies many hedgers and speculators now expect stocks to remain higher than before. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, have pledged to do  whatever it takes  to bring OECD inventories down to the five-year average. But many analysts and traders are sceptical the current level of cuts will be enough to bring stocks down to the target this year or prevent them rising again next year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts global inventories will fall by an average of 0.2 million barrels per day in 2017 before increasing by an average of 0.1 million bpd in 2018. EIA forecasts OECD commercial stocks will still stand at 2,989 million barrels at the end of 2017, almost 230 million barrels higher than the year-end average for 2012-2016. The agency also predicts OECD stocks will rise to 3,020 million barrels at the end of 2018, which would be almost 260 million barrels over the 2012-2016 average. The forecasts assume OPEC's output agreement is extended beyond March 2018 but compliance deteriorates ( Short-Term Energy Outlook , EIA, June 2017). If these forecasts prove correct, OPEC will only have made limited progress towards its goal of rebalancing the market even by the end of 2018. Storage and Shale The recent drop in oil prices has been concentrated in near-term futures contracts. Brent for delivery in October 2017 has fallen by $9.50 since May 23, while Brent for delivery in December 2018 is down by only $5.50 per barrel. Sharp falls in the cost of crude for delivery in the near future provide an enhanced incentive to buy and store excess oil, helping the market carry a higher level of inventories than anticipated before. Near-term price declines also send a strong, urgent signal to U.S. shale producers to curb their drilling to avert an even bigger build up of inventories in future.

The government's new food inspection system simplified trade after a nearly year-long row over the quarantine service's zero-tolerance approach to ergot. Traders had said they could not guarantee zero trace and boycotted tenders, effectively shutting off the world's biggest wheat importer from the grain trade. The new inspection regime, launched this year, applied a more common global standard, allowing 0.05 percent of ergot in shipments and helping regular state grain tenders to proceed. But an Egyptian court this month ordered that the new system be suspended, although the government said it would appeal that decision and keep its inspection system in place as it did so. The court's written verdict, seen by Reuters on Thursday, said the new system  resulted in a breach of the (import) requirements stipulated by the Agriculture Ministry's quarantine service, which banned the entry of wheat shipments containing pests that are prohibited from entering the country, including the fungus ergot.  This opens the possibility that the quarantine service could restore its zero-tolerance rule. However, for now, the government has not empowered the quarantine service to do so.  After last year's trade row, Egypt moved the inspection process away from the quarantine service to the Trade Ministry's General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC). The Agriculture Ministry said last week it would not return inspection authority to its quarantine service. A group of quarantine inspectors had challenged the new system in court, arguing it illegally handed inspections to a body ill-equipped to oversee the process, allowing imports to enter with hazardous contaminants harmful to animals and plants. Lawyers who raised the case said the government was obliged to suspend its new inspection system during an appeal, a process that could take months. On Thursday, Egypt's state grain buyer GASC holds its latest international purchase tender for wheat. Results are expected the same day. GASC has managed to continue purchasing grains despite the court ruling in part because the government has insisted it would not revert to a ban on ergot. That position is now complicated by the court's ruling.

San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera last month sought a court order compelling Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to comply with the city's demands for information about the company's drivers. The city Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office wants the names, addresses and driver's license numbers of Uber's drivers. Superior Court Judge Richard Ulmer in San Francisco said in court that he will rule that the tax office has the authority to subpoena Uber for the information, Herrera said in a statement. The official ruling was expected as early as late Thursday. Uber had provided the city with the driver information for more than two years, but stopped in December. The company argues that the request violates driver privacy and could endanger drivers' safety. Ulmer said Uber had failed to show that the information requested constitutes a protected trade secret or that its disclosure would violate drivers' privacy. The city says the driver data provided through the subpoena would be protected and treated as confidential taxpayer information and not posted publicly. However, the city says it would use the subpoenaed information to contact Uber drivers and request they fill out a business registration. Information provided on the registration, which may include a business name and address such as a post office box, would be posted on a public website. The case does not involve Lyft Inc, Uber's ride-hailing competitor also based in San Francisco. Lyft does provide driver data to the city. The judge directed Uber and the city to confer and report back to him by July 3. In a separate case, San Francisco earlier this month issued subpoenas to Uber and Lyft for a broad scope of records on driving and business practices as part of an investigation to determine whether the companies have become a public nuisance.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.  Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.      As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.  The  whatever it takes  pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.   You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,  said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant.  Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.   The oil price decline and Saudi's ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia's future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.  Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.  Waiting It Out  Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.  They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.  OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.   We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,  Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday.  But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,  he added.  An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.  OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.  Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.  Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.  Shale Returns at Full Force   Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.     The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country's total crude output.  Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.   A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,  said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.  OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.  Mistakes of the Past  Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.  Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.  Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC's other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even  the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at .  That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.   For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,  said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.  Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.  While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.

San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera last month sought a court order compelling Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to comply with the city's demands for information about the company's drivers. The city Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office wants the names, addresses and driver's license numbers of Uber's drivers. Superior Court Judge Richard Ulmer in San Francisco said in court that he will rule that the tax office has the authority to subpoena Uber for the information, Herrera said in a statement. The official ruling was expected as early as late Thursday. Uber had provided the city with the driver information for more than two years, but stopped in December. The company argues that the request violates driver privacy and could endanger drivers' safety. Ulmer said Uber had failed to show that the information requested constitutes a protected trade secret or that its disclosure would violate drivers' privacy. The city says the driver data provided through the subpoena would be protected and treated as confidential taxpayer information and not posted publicly. However, the city says it would use the subpoenaed information to contact Uber drivers and request they fill out a business registration. Information provided on the registration, which may include a business name and address such as a post office box, would be posted on a public website. The case does not involve Lyft Inc, Uber's ride-hailing competitor also based in San Francisco. Lyft does provide driver data to the city. The judge directed Uber and the city to confer and report back to him by July 3. In a separate case, San Francisco earlier this month issued subpoenas to Uber and Lyft for a broad scope of records on driving and business practices as part of an investigation to determine whether the companies have become a public nuisance. That case is ongoing.  Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Leslie Adler and Dan Grebler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-sanfrancisco-idUSL1N1JJ1NO"},

Arizona went 7-1 on a three-city trek that included stops in Detroit and Philadelphia. The Diamondbacks' .875 winning percentage on the trip is the highest in franchise history for a three-city road trip. The victory moved the Diamondbacks (46-27) three percentage points ahead of Colorado (47-28). Both teams are one game behind Los Angeles (47-26), pending the outcome of the Dodgers' game Thursday night. The Rockies finished a 5-2 homestand by losing their third series at Coors Field home and first in nearly two months. They dropped three of four to Washington and then lost two of three to Seattle. Chris Owings in the third and Paul Goldschmidt in the fourth hit three-run homers that gave the Diamondbacks an early 9-1 bulge as they went on to win the rubber match of the three-game series. It was just the third series loss for the Rockies at Coors Field this season, and they fell to 6-2 in rubber games.  I think we were just able to get some guys on base,  said Goldschmidt who had three hits and four RBI.  And when you do that here, one swing of the bat can open it up.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at RockiesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchArizona starter Zack Godley (3-1) gave up two hits in the first inning, including Charlie Blackmon's 24th career leadoff homer and second this season on a ball that was nearly in the dirt. Two batters after Blackmon belted his 16th home run, Nolan Arenado singled. And that was pretty much it for the Rockies' offense against Godley. After Arenado's hit, Godley retired 19 of his next 20 batters, including 13 straight after DJ LeMahieu grounded into an inning double play in the third. The streak ended when Raimel Tapia led off the eighth with a single. Pinch-hitter Pat Valaika followed Tapia with a run-scoring double that finished Godley, who gave up four hits and three runs with one walk and a career-high tying eight strikeouts in seven-plus innings. Godley also singled home a run in the eighth inning for his second career RBI in 45 at-bats.  I think he got off to a wobbly start,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo.  The command of his pitches wasn't as consistent as it was in the middle frames. He started to have fastball location and I think the changeup, curveball off it was very effective. He got a number of swing on secondary stuff on balls in the zone.  It was the second straight lopsided victory for the Diamondbacks, who erupted for 10 runs in the fourth inning on Wednesday, the biggest inning on the road in franchise history, and walloped the Rockies 16-5 after a 4-3 loss Tuesday night. The Diamondbacks roughed up faltering rookie Antonio Senzatela (9-3). In 14 previous starts totaling 83 1/3 innings. Senzatela yielded 13 home runs. But the only three-run blast was hit by Ben Zobrist of the Chicago Cubs on June 11 at Wrigley Field. After Goldschmidt, who had three hits and four RBIs, singled home a run in the third inning, Senzatela walked Jake Lamb before Owings hit his sixth homer. Jeff Mathis led off the fourth with a single and was sacrificed to second by Godley. Senzatela walked Jeremy Hazelbaker before Nick Ahmed singled home a run, and Goldschmidt followed with his 18th home run.  I didn't see the command that we've seen from Antonio over the last couple games to be honest with you,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  A little bit different than what we saw the first couple months.  Senzatela, 22, who had never pitched above Double-A before making the Opening Day rotation, had a 3.19 ERA after his first 10 career starts. But in his past five starts, Senzatela has a 8.20 ERA (26 1/3 innings, 24 earned runs) to raise his overall ERA to 4.79. He has surrendered eight homers in his past four games compared with seven homers in his first 11, a span of 67 innings. In five innings against the Diamondbacks, Senzatela allowed career highs in hits (eight) and runs (nine).  Today I feel really good,  Senzatela said.  But I throw a couple pitch(es) up, and they got me. I didn't have really good fastball command. It was a bad day.  This is third time in franchise history that Rockies starters have yielded nine or more earned runs in consecutive games and first time in nearly 20 years. On July 1-2, 1998, at Seattle, Mike Saipe allowed nine earned runs in his second and last major league start Darryl Kile yielded 10 earned runs the following day. Asked whether opponents are starting to figure the Rockies' rookie starters or they're simply not executing, Colorado manager Bud Black said,  Time will tell. I think that's the best way I'm going to answer that one. Time will tell.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) commitment to provide financing to Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO), Canada's largest nonbank lender, marks the billionaire's latest effort to shore up a company in desperate need of cash, or at least his full-throated support.  It's a typical Buffett bailout trade,  said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall.  He's set it up where he's risking a small amount to make a lot.   Home Capital joined Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other companies that have welcomed Buffett's largesse, accepting a C$2 billion (US$1.51 billion) credit line - carrying a 9 percent interest rate - and up to C$400 million (US$302 million) in equity, for a 38.4 percent stake. Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital's share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak.  The deal is really low risk,  said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock.  It's an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.  Berkshire's infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud.  The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,  said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst.  It implies a seal of approval.  Last Resort Berkshire's investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills.  Today's announcement is a modest positive,  wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst.  But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.  Berkshire's Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. From 2008 to 2011, Buffett spent more than $25 billion to buy high-yielding stocks and bonds in companies including Bank of America, GE, Goldman, Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) and Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment.  Home Capital's strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,  Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Reputational Risks Home Capital's problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. Berkshire's investment reflects its willingness to commit to companies whose practices have drawn criticism, including Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), now embroiled in scandal for creating unauthorized customer accounts.  Reputational risk is why he's getting 9 percent interest  at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire's more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett's foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country's housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is  not going to stop the credit cycle up there,  said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital.  But it's a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.

Shares in Home Capital (HGC.TO) closed up 27 percent on Thursday.  Shares in other Canadian alternative lenders also rose on Thursday. Equitable Group Inc (EQB.TO) closed up 12.5 percent. Street Capital Group (SCB.TO) closed up 8.3 percent. Shares in mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada Inc (MIC.TO) were up 11.5 percent. The deal may bring to a close a two-month effort by Home Capital's board, and advisers RBC Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets, to replace a costly credit facility with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) and shore up the lender's balance sheet.  The credit facility was arranged earlier to provide   funding for Canada's largest non-bank lender which had suffered from the withdrawal of 95 percent of its high interest deposits in the past two months. Alan Hibben, a former Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) executive who was recruited to the Home Capital board last month, said over 70 parties had expressed interest in investing in the lender. In an interview, Hibben said Home Capital was drawn to Berkshire Hathaway because of Buffet's credibility with both investors and depositors.  The board decided it would be nice for a sponsor to give us a view where somebody could say 'wow, if that smart person thinks the Home Capital business model and portfolios are good, I'm going to think that',  he said. Hibben said Buffett had become involved  later in the process  with Home Capital approaching Berkshire Hathaway rather than the other way round. Home Capital has played an important role in Canada's mortgage market, lending to new immigrants and self-employed workers who may not be able to get loans from the country's biggest banks.  Related Coverage'Bailout' Buffett burnishes 'lender of last resort' imageBut home prices in Toronto and Vancouver have fallen after the government introduced measures to cool overheating prices with household debt in Canada has reaching record levels. Investors are wondering whether the deal will be as successful as Buffett's decidedly bigger deal to buy Goldman Sachs (GS.N) preferred shares during the global financial crisis in 2008. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” said Berkshire's chairman Warren Buffett, in a statement on the deal released by Home Capital on Thursday.  Short Seller Not Convinced Short sellers are continuing to take positions in Home Capital though, aiming to profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.  Combined short interest in the company's Canadian and U.S.-listed shares (HMCBF.PK) stands at about $183 million, up $62 million this month, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Marc Cohodes, a short seller who has been betting against Home Capital for two years, said on Thursday he continued to do so.   If it wasn't Warren Buffett's name, the stock would be way, way way, down today,  he said in an interview.  Home Capital was forced to raise new capital after depositors rushed to withdraw funds from its high-interest savings accounts. They pulled 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high-interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Officer Martin Reid. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada's biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital reached a settlement with the commission last week and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about mortgage underwriting problems.  The 'endorsement' from Warren Buffet may prove to rehabilitate depositor confidence, thus turning deposit flow positive,  said National Bank of Canada analyst Jaeme Gloyn. The Berkshire credit agreement comes with an interest rate of 9.0 percent, with a standby fee on funds not drawn down of 1.0 percent, compared with 2.5 percent previously.  The facility will be in place for a year after which Hibben said the company will assess if it still needs a facility of that size.  That's an awfully big number for a small bank like ours, particularly as we're going to hold likely a billion dollars of cash,  he said. Home Capital on Tuesday said it would sell a commercial mortgage book, raising close to C$1.2 billion in a deal expected to complete in the third quarter.  Berkshire Hathaway will also take a 38.4 percent stake in the company after buying $400 million worth of Home Capital stock.  It will make an initial investment of C$153 million to buy a 20 percent stake. The price is a 15 percent discount to the average share price prior to Berkshire's final proposal on June 13 and a 33 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price. The rest of the shares will be acquired at C$10.30 in a deal that still needs shareholder approval. Buffett has not been especially active in Canada in recent years. He was a shareholder in oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) but sold the stake in 2016.

Four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form, leaving Republicans short of the votes they need for passage. Democrats are united in opposition.     The 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump by rolling back former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to millions of Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. Trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store.  I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!  he wrote on Twitter. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass a similar bill in May, only to criticize it in private as  mean  once it passed. He said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan  with heart.   Democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage.  The president said the House bill was mean,  said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.  The Senate bill may be even meaner.  Obama weighed in on Facebook.  If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,  he wrote. The Senate's most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the U.S. government's role. Related CoverageTrump says he is 'very supportive' of Senate healthcare billFactbox: How Senate, House Obamacare overhaul bills compareFactbox: Where key U.S. Republican senators stand on healthcare bill This current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people,  said Senator Rand Paul, who along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support it in its current form. Shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bill's release, with the overall S&P; 500 healthcare sector closing up 1.1 percent at an all-time high.  The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,  said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Sharper Cuts to Medicaid Over months of often bitter debate, Republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement, while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world's largest economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, and the legislation is unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in 3 Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is surrounded by reporters as he walks to the Senate floor of the U.S. Capitol after unveiling a draft bill on healthcare in Washington, U.S. June 22, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe Senate measure maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. The Senate bill would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House version, waiting until after the next presidential election in 2020, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the 70 million Americans who depend on the program.  The legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.  Those subsidies would be based on income, rather than the age-based subsidies contained in the House bill - a  major improvement,  according to Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bill's impact on the poor.  The Senate legislation provides less money, however, for the opioid epidemic, allocating $2 billion in 2018, compared with  $45 billion over 10 years in the House version.  Slideshow (10 Images)Both versions would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners, a key target for Republicans.  They also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers, and remove the fine that Obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021. It proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with Senate rules. They could be included in another Senate bill. McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill, which Republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace.  Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,  he said. Democrats say they offered to help fix Obamacare but were rebuffed. The bill's real-world impact is not yet known, but the CBO is expected to provide an estimate early next week. As lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnell's personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting:  No cuts to Medicaid.  U.S. Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction. Aside from the quartet of conservatives, none of the other 48 Republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand. But several said they would check with home-state constituents before taking a position.  I expect there's going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote,  said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) commitment to provide financing to Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO), Canada's largest nonbank lender, marks the billionaire's latest effort to shore up a company in desperate need of cash, or at least his full-throated support.  It's a typical Buffett bailout trade,  said Jared Dillian, an independent investment strategist and former trader betting the value of the Canadian dollar and several Canadian banks will fall.  He's set it up where he's risking a small amount to make a lot.   Home Capital joined Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other companies that have welcomed Buffett's largesse, accepting a C$2 billion (US$1.51 billion) credit line - carrying a 9 percent interest rate - and up to C$400 million (US$302 million) in equity, for a 38.4 percent stake. Its share price soared 27.2 percent on Thursday to C$19.00, leaving Buffett with a potential 90 percent paper profit on shares he is buying for just C$10 each. Home Capital's share price nonetheless remains nearly two-thirds below its 2014 peak.  The deal is really low risk,  said John Huber, a portfolio manager at Saber Capital Management LLC in Raleigh, North Carolina, which owns Berkshire stock.  It's an opportunistic deal that gives him very attractive risk-return terms.  Berkshire's infusion was much needed by Home Capital, which has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run after being accused of, and then admitting to, concealing mortgage fraud.  The assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving,  said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst.  It implies a seal of approval.  Last Resort Berkshire's investment lets Buffett deploy some of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills.  Today's announcement is a modest positive,  wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst.  But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.  Berkshire's Columbia Insurance unit is acquiring the Home Capital equity, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Meanwhile, the credit line, if fully tapped, could generate C$180 million for Berkshire. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. From 2008 to 2011, Buffett spent more than $25 billion to buy high-yielding stocks and bonds in companies including Bank of America, GE, Goldman, Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) and Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N). His $5 billion Bank of America bet looks particularly savvy: it throws off $300 million in annual dividends, and Berkshire is sitting on an $11 billion gain on accompanying warrants. But with most of those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment.  Home Capital's strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,  Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to requests for further comment. Reputational Risks Home Capital's problems accelerated in mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. Berkshire's investment reflects its willingness to commit to companies whose practices have drawn criticism, including Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), now embroiled in scandal for creating unauthorized customer accounts.  Reputational risk is why he's getting 9 percent interest  at Home Capital, Seifert said. Berkshire has other investments tied to real estate, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. It also has several investments in Canada, including the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, for which it paid about $C3.1 billion in 2014. Many of Berkshire's more than 90 business units also offer goods and services in the country, including the Ben Bridge jeweler, Benjamin Moore paints and the BNSF railroad. Despite his paper profit on Home Capital, Buffett believes investment gains and losses in a given period are usually meaningless. Buffett's foray into Canadian real estate comes amid uncertainty about that country's housing sector. The Ontario government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is  not going to stop the credit cycle up there,  said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital.  But it's a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.

The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 in June from a final 53.1 in May. The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the 10th consecutive month.  Slower growth was signaled in June, with both orders and output rising at the weakest rates since late last year amid reports of a slight softening in market conditions,  said Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.  That said, external demand is holding up well, and the sector continues to operate within a solid growth range.  The index for new orders, which includes both domestic and overseas orders, fell to a preliminary 51.3 from a final 53.4 in May to reach the lowest level since November. The flash index for new export orders fell to 52.5 in June from 53.0 in the previous month. The drop in the flash PMI index is unlikely to dent growing optimism about Japan's economy.

The dollar index against a basket of major currencies stood little changed at 97.547. The index peaked at a one-month high of 97.871 early in the week after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week and left the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year. But it has been stuck in a tight range since, awaiting fresh catalysts.  While the market was able to draw incentives from the Fed last week, there really was not a lot of factors for the dollar to move on this week in the absence of major indicator releases and political events,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  But inflation is likely to be the theme that moves currencies next week which will see the release of various U.S. indicators. They will be key as this week's slump in crude oil has clouded the U.S. inflation outlook.  U.S. data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index. The dollar was flat at 111.290 yen. It had scaled a near one-month peak of 111.790 on Tuesday before edging down in tandem with U.S. yields, which were nudged lower by falling oil prices. The euro was also steady, at $1.1150. It was poised to lose about 0.4 percent this week. Commodity linked currencies held to significant gains made overnight following a rebound in crude oil prices from 10-month lows. The Canadian dollar was flat at C$1.3235 per dollar after rallying 0.75 percent on Thursday. The loonie also received a helping hand from solid domestic retail sales which boosted expectations for an interest rate hike in July from the Bank of Canada. The Norwegian crown was little changed at 8.4894 crowns per dollar after rising about 0.5 percent overnight. The crown was also supported as Norway's central bank lifted its rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018 and said a rate cut was no longer likely. The Australian and New Zealand dollars were both flat at $0.7541 and $0.7263, respectively.

Howard is one of Hollywood's best known directors with films such as  Frost/Nixon  and  A Beautiful Mind  to his credit. Lucasfilm's president, Kathleen Kennedy, announced on Wednesday that filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, best known for the 2014 hit  The Lego Movie,  had left the project due to creative differences.  Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are talented filmmakers who have assembled an incredible cast and crew, but it’s become clear that we had different creative visions on this film, and we’ve decided to part ways,  Kennedy said in a statement on StarWars.com. Kennedy announced Howard's hiring for the film on Thursday, saying in a statement,  At Lucasfilm, we believe the highest goal of each film is to delight, carrying forward the spirit of the saga that George Lucas began forty years ago.  Director Ron Howard poses for photographers at the British Academy Film Awards Nominees Party at Kensington Palace in London, Britain February 11, 2017.Neil HallFilm trade publications reported that Lord and Miller had clashed with Kennedy and veteran  Star Wars  writer Lawrence Kasdan over the comedic direction of the film.  The untitled Han Solo movie will follow the origin story of young Han Solo, the handsome, roguish space smuggler made famous by actor Harrison Ford. It started filming in February in London. Production is on a brief hiatus amid the directorial changes until Howard takes over on July 10, Lucasfilm said.  Rising star Alden Ehrenreich will play Han Solo, while Donald Glover will play Lando Calrissian, made famous in George Lucas' original  Star Wars  trilogy by actor Billy Dee Williams. Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Thandie Newton will also star in the film.  The spin-off is part of Walt Disney Co's expanding slate of  Star Wars  movies, which was rebooted by 2015's blockbuster hit,  Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Along with 20 other banks backing the expansion, they are expected to face increasing pressure from environmental and indigenous activists, who have said they would ask the financial institutions to drop Trans Mountain once they are named. Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank provided nearly a third of the credit, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The four lenders to Kinder Morgan Canada, majority-owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Energy infrastructure projects in Canada have faced opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities whose land they cross. Opposition to Trans Mountain's expansion is set to mount after the effective rise of an unfriendly provincial government last month in Canada's British Columbia, which the pipeline passes through. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental organizations this month called on 28 major banks - including all four of the main lenders - to back away from Trans Mountain. Jason Opena Disterhoft, senior campaigner for Rainforest Action Network, one of the groups, said the banks have chosen to back the expansion despite being aware of what he says are the environmental impacts.  We are in communication with those banks,  he said.  We'll be following up with them and holding them to account.  One bank targeted by the groups' letter has since publicly distanced itself from the expansion. ING Groep NV of the Netherlands said last week on Twitter that it is not among the banks funding Trans Mountain. A bank spokesman said on Thursday it does not lend to projects directly linked to oil sands. The Trans Mountain expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, which is designed to carry crude from Canada's oil sands to the West Coast. The expansion has obtained both federal and regulatory approvals and has passed an environmental assessment under British Columbia's incumbent Liberal Party, which lost its legislative majority in a May 9 election. The opposition Greens and New Democrats parties, both of which oppose Trans Mountain's expansion, have sealed a deal to unseat the Liberals.

Four sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Alibaba and Tencent would invest in the Shanghai-listed unit of the telecoms group - China United Network Communications Ltd (600050.SS) - as part of the capital-raising effort. One of the sources said Alibaba and Tencent would lead the group of investors, while Baidu (BIDU.O), the third of China's constellation of tech giants, has pulled out. The source did not comment on the reason for that decision. China Unicom, formally known as China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd, plans to raise around 70 billion yuan ($10.25 billion) through the Shanghai unit, the sources said. That would mark the largest capital raising in Asia since the initial public offering of insurer AIA Group (1299.HK) in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. About 50 billion yuan would be raised through new share issues, while China's second-largest telecom carrier would also sell part of its stake in the Shanghai-listed unit, two of the sources said. The sources could not be identified as the negotiations are not public. Other potential investors approached by China Unicom, named last year as part of a pilot mixed-ownership reform scheme, include the country's other major internet firms and some state-backed institutions, such as China Life Investment Holding Co Ltd, one of the sources said.  Alibaba, Tencent and other potential investors have yet to finalize the terms of any purchase, the sources said, though the deal is likely to be finalised by this summer. China United Network did not respond to requests for comment. China Unicom Group and China Life Investment Holdings could not immediately be reached. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent declined to comment. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees state-owned enterprises (SOEs), also did not respond to a request for comment. In the Red China Unicom is one of China's three major state-owned telecom firms, along with China Mobile (0941.HK) and China Telecom (0728.HK), but also the weakest. FILE PHOTO: People walk past outside the China Unicom office building in Beijing, October 9, 2013.Petar Kujundzic/FilesIt is one of the world's largest mobile carriers by subscribers, but competition in China is cut-throat and its earnings have struggled in recent quarters. Private firms have shot ahead in developing cloud and big data services as well as mobile software. China Unicom is widely seen as over-staffed, inefficient and slow to develop key technologies - prompting Beijing to add it last year to the first batch of SOEs who would see mixed-ownership reform. In March, its Hong-Kong listed arm, China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd (0762.HK), reported a 94 percent drop in profit for 2016. China has thousands of state-owned enterprises, many of them bloated and debt-ridden, and its mixed-ownership reforms are aimed at reviving the sector with private capital, creating stronger conglomerates capable of competing on the global stage. The central government issued guidelines in 2015 aimed at overhauling its SOEs, saying it would close down the most uncompetitive firms and modernize the ownership structure of those that remained. Earlier this week, the official China Securities Journal said China had completed 48 deals by June 20 to allow private capital to invest in government-run enterprises - up ninefold compared with the same period last year. And that would accelerate, it said. Other SOEs selected to carry out Beijing's pilot mixed-ownership reform scheme include China Eastern Air Holding [SASAHW.UL], China Southern Power Grid [CNPOW.UL] and China State Shipbuilding Corp [SASACN.UL]. China Eastern Air earlier this week sold almost half of its freight unit to four firms, including Legend Holdings (3396.HK) and Global Logistic Properties (GLPL.SI), in the Chinese aviation sector's first mixed-ownership reform deal. China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit said in early April it would be part of the mixed-ownership pilot, but gave no details. The stock, whose market value exceeded $23 billion as of late March, has been halted from trading since then. Mixed-ownership may not be welcomed by listed companies, pushed to invest in state firms, but the need for government support is great even for China's largest private conglomerates, analysts said. For China Unicom, analysts said mixed-ownership reform could be a game-changer - even if substantial restructuring will be difficult, with or without private investors.

World number three Rory McIlroy, who missed the cut at last week's U.S. Open after sitting out a month with a niggling rib problem, was among a group of 18 golfers four shots back in a share of 19th place. Australian Jason Day (72), who also missed the cut last week in the latest misfire of what has so far been an underwhelming season, has plenty of work ahead if he plans to play the weekend after mixing a double-bogey with three bogeys and three birdies. Defending champion Russell Knox finished one-under 69. Spieth has already switched putters twice this season but his current flatstick was working just fine on Thursday, the world number six snagging five birdies in his first eight holes en route to a seven-under-par 63 at TPC River Highlands. He closed his round in style with birdies on three of his final six holes, including at the par-four 18th where his wedge from 136 yards stopped within 5 feet of the hole, to take a slender lead over Johnson Wagner and Brett Stegmaier.  We played the practice round and the pro-am and really thought this was a good track for us. Sometimes you just fall into that,  said Spieth. Spieth's putting prowess spurred much of the success early in his career but the 23-year-old has gone cold on the greens this year, most recently last week at the U.S. Open where he finished in a share of 35th place. But the Texan, seeking his second PGA Tour win of the season, looked more than comfortable on his first trek around the TPC River Highlands layout where he had it all clicking and equaled his low round of the year. Northern Irishman McIlroy started on the back nine where he collected two of his four birdies. He snared a 15-footer at the par-four 17th but followed up with a bogey, his only miscue on the greens all day, when he missed a three-footer for par. Among those level with McIlroy are Patrick Reed, Swede David Lingmerth and Jim Furyk, whose final-round 58 last year at the Travelers is the lowest round on the PGA Tour.

U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Michigan issued an order staying the deportation of the Iraqis for at least two weeks as he decides whether he has jurisdiction over the matter. Goldsmith said it was unclear whether the Iraqis would ultimately succeed.  The arrests shocked the close-knit Iraqi community in Michigan. Six Michigan lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives urged the government to hold off on the removals until Congress can be given assurances about the deportees' safety. The Michigan arrests were part of a coordinated sweep in recent weeks by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes.  The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's revised temporary travel ban.  Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March. Protesters rally outside the federal court just before a hearing to consider a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Iraqi nationals facing deportation, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., June 21, 2017.Rebecca CookA U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling. Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union representing the Iraqis in Michigan, said:  The court's action today was legally correct and may very well have saved numerous people from abuse and possible death.  The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case. Only immigration courts can decide deportation issues, which can then only be reviewed by an appeals court, it said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said that people with convictions for murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary and drugs and weapons charges were among the Iraqis arrested nationwide. The ACLU argued that many of those affected in Michigan are Chaldean Catholics who are  widely recognized as targets of brutal persecution in Iraq.   Some Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee. In a letter on Thursday, Tennessee Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat, asked the Iraqi ambassador whether Iraq would be able to ensure safe passage for them if they were returned.

After years of overmining, unregulated industrial discharges and excess use of pesticide and fertilizer, China has promised to take action to tackle polluted soil, although the environment ministry has warned that clean-up efforts will be slow and costly. As well as spelling out punishments for offenders, the new law will make state funds available to support clean-up projects and establish a nationwide monitoring network, China Daily said.

The draft law also allows authorities to establish  priority protection  areas and ban grazing or the growing of certain crops in heavily polluted regions, as well as encourage crop rotation, reforestation and the creation of wetlands, according to the official People's Daily. It will also enable authorities to ban construction projects around schools, hospitals or residential areas in order to mitigate potential pollution risks, the People's Daily said.

The financing round, the largest for a financial technology company since Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union, was led by the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Lakestar, Blockchain said on Thursday.  Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain's total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet's venture firm GV, said the firm invested because  the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.  Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product.  Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,  Smith said.  My grandmother uses our product today.  The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention.  Last week, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) announced a blockchain-based insurance product. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States.  The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day.  In you're in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,  Smith said,  you are open to new ideas and new products.

Zavala will only be finance minister temporarily, said one of the sources. The cabinet shuffle follows an overwhelming vote of no-confidence that the opposition-controlled Congress delivered to outgoing Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne on Wednesday after an audio recording surfaced in which he appeared to pressure the comptroller to approve a controversial project. Earlier on Thursday, Kuczynski did not rule out that Zavala might replace Thorne following a report by local newspaper El Comercio that it was under consideration.  I can think of several ministers in the past that have been prime ministers while running a ministry. It wouldn't be the first time if it does happen,  Kuczynski told reporters. Zavala, 46, will be tasked with reviving slumping investments in the world's second-biggest copper producer while trying to ease growing tensions with the right wing opposition. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker, took office nearly a year ago with plans to bolster economic growth through infrastructure development and lower taxes, but a graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht and the worst flooding in at least 20 years have derailed those plans.

I am feeding my family and changing the view of women in my community, but most importantly I am doing a job which is showing that refugees also can do something good.  Naz is one of five Afghan refugee women who are not only battling traditional gender roles by going out to work, but who have also become unlikely warriors in the Indian capital's fight to curb plastic waste pollution. The task is immense and 10 hands will not solve it. But this project is gaining international support for its twin roles of addressing India's chronic waste problem and empowering refugee women who often flounder in their adopted homelands. Employed under  Project Patradya  - an initiative led by Delhi University students - the Afghan women produce and supply edible bowls, cups and cutlery to cafes and ice-cream parlors as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastic ones. Made from millet and wheat flour, the biscuit-like tableware is gaining popularity in the West as a sustainable, environment-friendly option to disposable plastic utensils, and those behind the initiative believe India is an untapped market.  We wanted to create a social enterprise model which was not only looking at improving the environment but also had a business plan that could employ excluded communities such as refugees,  said 20-year-old commerce student Nishchay Hans.  Plagued With Plastic Pollution Hans is one of more than 40 students at Kirori Mal College (KMC) who are part of Enactus, a charity that supports young people across the world work with poor communities and build sustainable, eco-friendly businesses.  Their projects range from creating mobile salons for unemployed hairdressers in Ghana to working with villagers in Malaysia to build home stays - all with the aim of eventually handing over the businesses to communities to run themselves. With New Delhi generating around 650 metric tonnes (650,000 kg) of plastic waste daily, only 60 percent of which is recycled, KMC students honed in on plastic pollution as a serious and neglected social problem. They found disposable plastic plates, bowls, cups and utensils make up much of the plastic waste in Delhi's burgeoning landfills, where it can take up to up to 1,000 years to decompose and leak pollutants into the soil and water. Most of the litter and pollution affecting oceans also derives from plastics. This has dire consequences for marine species, which in turn is harmful for those further up the food chain, including humans, who consume the contaminated fish. During their months of research, the students visited Delhi cafes and consulted restaurateurs, bakers and customers -- eventually settling on the idea of edible tableware as an alternative to use-and-throw utensils. The students then approached the city's refugees to join their venture in a move welcomed by the United Nations.    Not only are refugees learning valuable new skills, they are also part of a meaningful and innovative initiative,  said Ipshita Sengupta, policy associate at the U.N. Refugee Agency.  Such projects demonstrate that refugees are active members of our society making positive contributions to the communities they live in.   Bomb Blasts to Business Women India - a safe haven in a volatile region - is home to more than 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom were forced to flee conflict or persecution in neighboring countries such as Sri Lanka, China, Afghanistan and Myanmar. But the country has not signed the landmark 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out the legal obligations of states to protect refugees, nor does it have any domestic legislation in place to ensure their basic rights. As a result, many refugees are vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. They cannot easily access education and health services and endure job discrimination and low pay. The 11,000-plus Afghan refugees in India fare better than some other poor communities, but many still live hand to mouth. Opportunities to improve their lives and gain new skills are limited, so when Naz and the four other women were offered the chance to join Project Patradya, they did not hesitate. Most are the wives of once wealthy businessmen who had good lives in Kabul, but the constant fear of suicide attacks at schools, bomb blasts at markets and death and extortion threats from the Taliban left them with to choice but to flee. In India now for almost five years, the roles have reversed and these women are the breadwinners - some now widows, others have husbands who are too sick to work or unable to find a job. They work five hours daily at a charity office, above a hardware store along the bustling narrow lanes of Bhogal market, where they sit around a large table, carefully kneading and rolling dough, cutting and placing it into baking moulds. As well as making the products, the women are also trained in sales and marketing, meet customers and take orders, with the understanding they will run the business within three years. Patradya has been in operation for six months and is currently supplying edible tableware to 10 cafes and ice-cream parlors in Delhi, as well as taking online orders. The women are turning over a small profit, averaging 7,500 rupees ($115) monthly, which is divided equally between them.  It's just the beginning, so the money is not much,  said Hasiba Fata, a 41-year-old mother of four, as she sprinkled flour over the ball of dough in front of her.  But we are excited about the idea that we can become business women and run our own company, employ other people and also do something for the environment. Maybe it's possible.

The sale is the latest capital-raising exercise by a technology startup creating its own digital currency and selling tokens to the public, a practice that has no regulatory oversight. It will be one of the most eagerly expected token sales in recent months, analysts said. Blockchain, a distributed ledger that came to prominence as the underlying technology behind digital currency bitcoin, is gaining popularity for its potential to track assets across all industries.  U.S. startup Civic sold $33 million in digital currency tokens for its identity verification project in a public sale, Reuters reported on Thursday. Block.one calls the sale of EOS a  token distribution.  The company wants EOS to be used by large businesses, enabling corporations to automate processes, monitor assets, and create multiple applications. Brock Pierce, co-founder of block.one, told Reuters that EOS aims to be the foundation for business applications in the blockchain world. The token sale will take place over a one-year period on ethereum, another blockchain-based currency, and some 1 billion tokens would be sold over 341 days starting on June 26, Pierce said. According to block.one's distribution schedule, 20 percent of the EOS tokens will be sold during the first five days of the  book opening, while 70 percent will split evenly into 350 consecutive 23-hour periods of 2 million EOS tokens each, starting on July 1. The remaining 10 percent will be reserved for block.one and cannot be traded or transferred on the ethereum network. EOS will be priced based on market demand, said Brendan Blumer, chief executive of block.one in a statement. The last blockchain platform token that went on sale was Qtum in March, which raised $15.6 million.  Blockchain Capital's Pierce said EOS could raise more than the $150 million raised by Bancor a few weeks ago. Bancor so far has raised the largest amount of capital in a token sale. Bancor enables the creation of so-called  smart tokens,  which can hold one or more tokens or digital currencies in reserve.   The goal of the EOS token sale is to make it truly democratized and provide equal access to everyone,  said Pierce.

Home Chef could fetch more than $600 million based on expected 2017 revenue of more than $300 million, the sources said on Thursday. Such an outcome would show that Amazon's $13.7 billion deal this month to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) is not perceived as a major threat to companies such as Home Chef. Home Chef is working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) to review its options, the sources said. While a sale of the company is the most likely path, Home Chef is also open to receiving a minority investment, the sources added.  Home Chef has been approached by grocery store companies and consumer packaged goods companies looking to acquire it or invest in a minority stake, according to the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Home Chef could not be reached for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.  Meal kit delivery companies, which operate on a subscription service to deliver ingredients and recipes that allow customers to easily prepare meals, have grown in popularity in the last few years. With its initial public offering next week, Blue Apron is seeking to convince stock market investors that its business forms the basis of a sustainable industry and is not just a fad. HelloFresh, Chefs Plate and Chef'd are among other meal kit delivery companies. The increasingly crowded industry has already seen some casualties. Startups Sprig and Maple shut down this year after struggling to cover their costs.   Home Chef, founded in 2013 in Chicago by Pat Vihtelic, seeks to stand out from the pack by offering family-friendly food and recipes that are straightforward to prepare. The approach has helped the company retain customers and avoid high customer churn, making it profitable.  Blue Apron, on the other hand, posted a net loss of $54.9 million last year, driven by spending on logistics and marketing, even as its revenue more than doubled to $795.4 million. Several consumer packaged goods companies have shown an interest in meal kit companies in recent months. Unilever Plc's (ULVR.L) venture arm led a $9.2 million fundraising round into organic-focused Sun Basket last month.

The global miner said that since the start of 2016 it has reduced the face value of outstanding bonds to about $9.5 billion from around $21 billion. Analysts, on average, expect Rio to post half-year profit of $4.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.  Rio cut net debt by about $4.2 billion in 2016 and said in February it would like to see further debt reduction as it looks to withstand any volatility in commodity markets. Early redemption costs from the latest buyback would likely reduce its cash flow from operating activities by about $260 million in the first half ending on June 30, the company said. Reductions in underlying earnings and cash flow would be offset by savings in future periods, it said. Earlier this week, Rio selected Yancoal (YAL.AX) to buy its Coal & Allied division in Australia for $2.45 billion, surprising commodities trading giant Glencore, (GLEN.L) which had put in a higher bid.

The cabinet shuffle follows an overwhelming vote of no-confidence that the opposition-controlled Congress delivered to outgoing Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne on Wednesday after an audio recording surfaced in which he appeared to pressure the comptroller to approve a controversial project. Earlier on Thursday, Kuczynski did not rule out that Zavala might replace Thorne following a report by local newspaper El Comercio that it was under consideration.  I can think of several ministers in the past that have been prime ministers while running a ministry. It wouldn't be the first time if it does happen,  Kuczynski told reporters. Zavala, 46, will be tasked with reviving slumping investments in the world's second-biggest copper producer while trying to ease growing tensions with the right wing opposition. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker, took office nearly a year ago with plans to bolster economic growth through infrastructure development and lower taxes, but a graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht and the worst flooding in at least 20 years have derailed those plans.

Home Chef could fetch more than $600 million based on expected 2017 revenue of more than $300 million, the sources said on Thursday. Such an outcome would show that Amazon's $13.7 billion deal this month to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) is not perceived as a major threat to companies such as Home Chef. Home Chef is working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) to review its options, the sources said. While a sale of the company is the most likely path, Home Chef is also open to receiving a minority investment, the sources added.  Home Chef has been approached by grocery store companies and consumer packaged goods companies looking to acquire it or invest in a minority stake, according to the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Home Chef could not be reached for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.  Meal kit delivery companies, which operate on a subscription service to deliver ingredients and recipes that allow customers to easily prepare meals, have grown in popularity in the last few years. With its initial public offering next week, Blue Apron is seeking to convince stock market investors that its business forms the basis of a sustainable industry and is not just a fad. HelloFresh, Chefs Plate and Chef'd are among other meal kit delivery companies. The increasingly crowded industry has already seen some casualties. Startups Sprig and Maple shut down this year after struggling to cover their costs.   Home Chef, founded in 2013 in Chicago by Pat Vihtelic, seeks to stand out from the pack by offering family-friendly food and recipes that are straightforward to prepare. The approach has helped the company retain customers and avoid high customer churn, making it profitable.  Blue Apron, on the other hand, posted a net loss of $54.9 million last year, driven by spending on logistics and marketing, even as its revenue more than doubled to $795.4 million. Several consumer packaged goods companies have shown an interest in meal kit companies in recent months. Unilever Plc's (ULVR.L) venture arm led a $9.2 million fundraising round into organic-focused Sun Basket last month.

The USDA had  recurring concerns about the safety of the products intended for the American market,  after increasing tests on Brazilian beef in March, according to a statement. The agency raised scrutiny on Brazilian beef and ready-to-eat products as a precaution following an investigation into corruption involving Brazil's health inspectors that targeted meat companies JBS SA and BRF SA. JBS, the world's largest meat packer, declined to comment on the U.S. ban. The USDA's action threatens the reputation of meat from Brazil, the world's top exporter of beef and poultry, even though the United States is not a top customer. It also could boost domestic sales in the United States.  Product was already on the water and that's not going to be allowed in,  Altin Kalo, a U.S. livestock analyst at Steiner Consulting Group, said about shipments headed to the United States from Brazil via boat. Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world, the agency said. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, according to the USDA. The agency said none of the rejected lots made it into the U.S. market. The move to block Brazilian meat is a turnaround for Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who warned in March that Brazil might retaliate if the United States halted beef imports. On Thursday, he said in a statement that  although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers.  The U.S. suspension will remain in place until Brazil's Agriculture Ministry  takes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory,  according to the agency. A slew of global buyers, including China, Egypt and Chile, curtailed imports of Brazilian meat after Brazilian federal police unveiled an investigation into alleged corruption in the sector on March 17. Brazilian authorities said at the time that meat companies made payments to government health officials to forego inspections and cover up health violations. The United States began allowing shipments of fresh beef from Brazil last year after banning them due to concerns about foot and mouth disease in cattle.

Distributable revenue is government income that is shared at various levels of state including the federal government, state governments and local government councils. The revenues were boosted by  significant increases in revenues from companies income tax,  said the statement issued by the accountant general. But it said the rise was offset by a  slight drop in the average price of crude oil from $55.38 to $55.18 per barrel and a decrease in export volume by 1.023 million barrels, reduced oil revenue by $57.12 million . OPEC member Nigeria, which is in a recession largely caused by the fall in global crude prices since mid-2014 and attacks on energy facilities in its Niger Delta energy hub last year, relies on crude oil sales for two-thirds of its government revenue. Attacks on energy facilities that cut oil production have halted since the start of the year with talks between the government and Delta community leaders to address the grievances of militants who want the oil hub to receive a greater share of the country's energy wealth.

Withdrawals of $2.2 billion struck U.S.-based equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the week ended June 21, the research service said, during a rollercoaster week for stocks and as the Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate hike of 2017. The S&P; 500 recorded three down days and two up during the measurement period, gaining just a tenth of a percent overall, as oil prices dove, but healthcare and technology stocks gained favor. In the previous week, U.S.-based stock funds managed to attract $10.9 billion. Not coincidentally, investors turned to their all-time favorite safe haven of bonds, placing $3 billion in U.S.-based, taxable, fixed-income funds during the latest week, Lipper said. The debt funds attracted cash for the 14th straight week even as the average fund in the category showed slightly negative performance for the first time in six weeks, the data showed.  There's some concern out there,  said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.  We're not getting the inflation that everyone is expecting.  A narrowing gap between the prices of long- and short-term U.S. Treasuries showed the distance between the inflation expectations of monetary policymakers and financial markets. The difference in yields between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 96 basis points during the week, the narrowest since December 2007. Investors normally demand a premium for longer-term debt, in part because quickening inflation erodes the bonds' value. Fed officials, by contrast, have called low inflation readings  transitory.   The Fed is focused on a forecast of the near-term decline in inflation prints being temporary,  said Jeffrey Rosenberg, BlackRock Inc's chief fixed-income strategist.  Market prices are not forecasting them being temporary.  Investors also poured money into emerging markets as U.S.-based emerging market equity funds attracted $143 million over the weekly period, their sixth straight week of inflows. U.S.-based emerging market debt funds attracted $217 million over the weekly, the group's 20th straight week of inflows, Lipper added.

He was wrong. He hit two. Gomez powered a home run barrage to lead the Texas Rangers to a series-splitting 11-4 win over the Blue Jays at Globe Life Park.  I put myself in position where I could drive the ball,  said Gomez, who went 3-for-4 and tied a career high with five RBIs. Texas (36-36) climbed back to .500 by snapping a two-game skid and splitting the four-game set with Toronto. The Rangers completed their homestand at 4-3. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RangersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchGomez, Mike Napoli, and Robinson Chirinos each clubbed long balls off Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman, who dropped to 7-4 and lost for the first time in six road decisions this season. Gomez added another homer, a two-run shot, in the eighth to give him five home runs and 14 RBIs in six games since returning from the disabled list.  I've seen this before with Carlos, when he's locked in, he's extremely challenging, he's a true professional hitter with a ton of power,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said. Texas starter Martin Perez wasn't sharp but enjoyed plenty of offensive support in improving to 4-6 after working six innings, giving up four runs (three earned) on nine hits. Perez is 4-0 this season when backed by at least three runs. The Blue Jays (35-37) dropped to 0-9 in games with a chance to get to .500 this season.  It's been a battle trying to get back to that .500 mark,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  The most important part is that it seems we get knocked around pretty good on that day.  Perez was staked to a 7-0 lead through four innings. The Rangers got going in the first on Adrian Beltre's two-out double to left, scoring Elvis Andrus from first. The relay throw to shortstop Troy Tulowitzki was dropped to negate a play at the plate. Napoli got to Stroman an inning later with his 14th homer, an opposite-field blast to right to plate Gomez. Stroman initially avoided giving up a fourth run in the third when Andrus was thrown out at the plate. With one out and the infield in, Beltre's chopper to third was fielded cleanly by Russell Martin, who gunned down Andrus. Rougned Odor followed with a single before Gomez ripped a three-run bomb off the left-field foul pole. Chirinos had a solo shot in the fourth. Stroman didn't come back out for the fifth.  The long ball hurt me,  he said.  It was kind of the feel for my pitches out there. I'm not really worried about it, just didn't have a good feel of my sinker and all of the other pitches kind of played off of that. I'll make a few adjustments and we can get back out there Wednesday.  Perez ran into trouble in the fifth, as the Blue Jays scored four runs after two outs. The rally started when Dwight Smith was hit by a pitch. Luke Maile's double got Toronto on the board. Hits from Martin and Kendrys Morales, with the bases loaded, pulled the visitors within three runs. The Rangers head out on a 10-day, 10-game road trip starting Friday at the New York Yankees. Texas is 14-19 on the road. Toronto completes its seven games on the road with three in Kansas City beginning Friday. NOTES: Texas RHP Yu Darvish opens the upcoming 10-game road trip Friday at Yankee Stadium squaring off against RHP Masahiro Tanaka for the first time in the majors. The two did meet four times in Nippon Professional Baseball, with Darvish winning three of those matchups. ... Toronto 3B Josh Donaldson was scratched from the lineup less than an hour before the first pitch due to left knee soreness. He was slated to be the DH and bat third, but was replaced by Kendrys Morales, who was set to have a day off. ...

Christopher Giancarlo, now the regulator's acting chair, will keep the heat on derivatives and commodities markets with tough policing, he said on Thursday. Giancarlo told a confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee that his priority was to  oversee robust enforcement of our rules and root out bad actors and wrongful practices.  He cited the steps he had taken as acting chair since Republican President Donald Trump nominated him in March, including appointing a new enforcement director, strengthening whistleblower protections and seeking more funding for enforcement. The committee will vote at a later date to confirm Giancarlo, said its chairman, Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. Both the committee and full Senate are expected to easily approve his appointment. Roberts pressed Giancarlo to  provide necessary and appropriate relief  to farmers and energy producers from regulations. Giancarlo, who worked in the private sector before joining the CFTC in 2014, has made easing regulation a cornerstone of his approach in public life. Giancarlo's role at the CFTC has changed dramatically in the past year. Before November's election, he was the sole Republican commissioner serving alongside a Democratic chair, Timothy Massad, and Commissioner Sharon Bowen. Massad left when Trump took office in January, according to the custom of agency heads belonging to the same party as the president. Bowen said on Tuesday she would depart as soon as another commissioner is confirmed. While Giancarlo and Bowen have found common ground, Bowen said the situation was difficult for the commission, which is supposed to have five members and was given greater authority in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Having just two commissioners makes routine business difficult, but makes important policy decisions almost impossible,  she said at a market advisory committee meeting.  Without a full complement of commissioners to consider the far-reaching implications of our decisions, we are frozen in place while the markets we regulate are moving faster every day.

Surf Air Europe's first flight will be from London Luton to Ibiza, and for a subscription of 1,750 pounds ($2,216.55) a month, customers will be able to fly within Europe to destinations such as Cannes, Zurich, Geneva and Milan as much as they like. Surf Air Europe Chief Executive Simon Talling-Smith said that between U.S. and European operations it hopes to achieve revenues of $100 million for 2017, with European flights making up about a fifth of the group's total business by the end of the year.     The London-headquartered airline will try to better what its sister company, Surf Air, has done in California. Launched in 2013, that company now has 3,000 members.  He also confirmed that the group was ordering Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Pilatus planes.   In the U.S. we have 12 Pilatus, and we have another 43 on order. We've just now taken delivery of our first jet aircraft, which is an Embraer Phenom 300, which will be operating in Europe,  Talling-Smith told Reuters.  We intend to build up a similar sized fleet of jets over the next three to five years.  He said that a couple of hundred people had pre-purchased membership ahead of the launch, and that this was in-line with his expectations. Surf Air says that it provides flexibility for business passengers who need to travel. The 1,750 pound monthly fee compares with a last minute, flexible business class return between London and Zurich of about 500 pounds. It also cuts down on waiting times at airports.      We have the opportunity for our members to get to the airport just 15 minutes before the flight goes,  Talling-Smith said.

Withdrawals of $2.2 billion struck U.S.-based equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the week ended June 21, the research service said, during a rollercoaster week for stocks and as the Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate hike of 2017. The S&P; 500 recorded three down days and two up during the measurement period, gaining just a tenth of a percent overall, as oil prices dove, but healthcare and technology stocks gained favor. In the previous week, U.S.-based stock funds managed to attract $10.9 billion. Not coincidentally, investors turned to their all-time favorite safe haven of bonds, placing $3 billion in U.S.-based, taxable, fixed-income funds during the latest week, Lipper said. The debt funds attracted cash for the 14th straight week even as the average fund in the category showed slightly negative performance for the first time in six weeks, the data showed.  There's some concern out there,  said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.  We're not getting the inflation that everyone is expecting.  A narrowing gap between the prices of long- and short-term U.S. Treasuries showed the distance between the inflation expectations of monetary policymakers and financial markets. The difference in yields between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 96 basis points during the week, the narrowest since December 2007. Investors normally demand a premium for longer-term debt, in part because quickening inflation erodes the bonds' value. Fed officials, by contrast, have called low inflation readings  transitory.   The Fed is focused on a forecast of the near-term decline in inflation prints being temporary,  said Jeffrey Rosenberg, BlackRock Inc's chief fixed-income strategist.  Market prices are not forecasting them being temporary.  Investors also poured money into emerging markets as U.S.-based emerging market equity funds attracted $143 million over the weekly period, their sixth straight week of inflows. U.S.-based emerging market debt funds attracted $217 million over the weekly, the group's 20th straight week of inflows, Lipper added.

Delays have pushed back the nuclear power plant's construction, and the expected cost of top-up payments ... has increased from 6 billion pounds 30 billion pounds,  the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) said. The NAO is publishing its report just as the government has committed to help to curb energy costs as part of its new policy objectives. Hinkley Point C is Britain's first new nuclear plant to be built in decades. It has been plagued by delays and criticized for its guaranteed price for electricity, which is higher than current market prices. EDF's UK arm EDF Energy is building the 18 billion pound plant in southwest England with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which has a 33.5 percent stake.  Britain awarded the project a minimum price guarantee of 92.5 pounds per megawatt hour (MWh), inflation linked, for 35 years. Under the contract, the government will pay the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the minimum it has promised - so-called top-up payments. British spot wholesale electricity prices have fallen since the deal was struck in 2013, and currently trade around 40 pounds per MWh. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the project would ensure nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix in Britain.  Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships,  she said. The plant, which EDF initially promised would be powering ovens to cook Britons’ Christmas dinner in 2017, is expected to start generating electricity in 2025. BEIS said the project would add 10-15 pounds annually to household electricity bills up to 2030. But the watchdog's report criticized the government for failing to fully consider the impact on bills beyond 2030. The NAO also said there was a risk the project would need further financial support.   The UK government could come under pressure to provide more support or take on additional risk, particularly given (Hinkley's) potential importance for ensuring energy security,  it said. When built Hinkley Point C is expected to generate around 7 percent of Britain's electricity, and will help to replace the country's aging nuclear fleet, and closing coal plants. EDF Energy said the NAO report showed the project was good value compared with other low-carbon energy alternatives, and that EDF Energy and CGN bear the construction risk of the project.  Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower,  an EDF Energy spokesman said. EDF and CGN also plan to build two more reactors at Sizewell in eastern England. Editing by Jane Merriman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-nuclear-costs-idUSKBN19D2WP"},

Sogard came up big again Thursday. He finished with two doubles and two runs scored, and helped preserve the lead with a sparkling defensive play in the eighth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers salaved a split of a four-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates with a 4-2 win at Miller Park.  He just keeps doing it,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. Sogard had three hits against the Pirates, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. He also has reached base in 28 of his 35 games this season and has been on base twice in 19 of those.  I'm having a blast,  Sogard said.  Being around these guys every day. It's a fun group of guys to go to battle with. We fight every day and we're having fun doing it.  Travis Shaw had a big day too, finishing with three hits -- two doubles and a home run -- as the Brewers tagged Pittsburgh starter Ian Nova (7-5) for four runs, 11 hits and two walks in seven innings.  He's a pro,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Nova.  He's got a lot of experience. Settled himself down. Had a couple of real pitch-efficient innings as well. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at BrewersPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch We just weren't able to do enough on our side of the board to score runs to tilt the thing back our way or get some different help out of the bullpen.  Brewers starter Chase Anderson (6-2) went six innings and allowed two runs and two hits while striking out seven.  (My) arm felt really good today,  Anderson said.  (My) legs got a little tired as the game went on because of the humidity. This team, it's been a lot of fun, this run. The defense today, Sogard's play was unbelievable. Those are the things that win championships.  Anderson came into the game riding one of the best stretches of his career -- 3-1 with a 1.04 ERA in his last four starts -- but got into a little early trouble. He hit Josh Harrison with a pitch and Harrison stole second before scoring the first run on Josh Bell's RBI single in the top of the first. Milwaukee's offense answered in the bottom of the inning, tying the score when Eric Thames snapped an 0-for-15 slump with a RBI base hit that scored Sogard. Domingo Santana bounced into a double play, but Shaw put the Brewers ahead with solo home run to center. Pittsburgh evened things up in the fourth on Gregory Polanco's fifth home run of the year. Shaw came through again in the fifth with a double to right that drove in Santana, putting Milwaukee back in front 3-2, and nearly broke the game open in the seventh when he doubled off the top of the wall in left. Sogard, who led off the inning with a double, scored easily on the play, but Santana, who walked ahead of Shaw, took his time rounding third thinking it was a home run and was tagged out, ending the inning.  From a baserunning standpoint, that can't happen,  Counsell said.  It was certainly in question so we have to keep running. Those are the types of things that make it just a little bit harder on ourselves.  The call stood after a crew chief review.  I didn't want to give up on the ball,  said left fielder John Jaso, who played the ball off the wall.  I had no idea of what was going on behind me. I knew it was like a guaranteed double, at least, if not a homer. I just played back, waiting for it to hit the wall. It did and it gave me a really good bounce off the wall obviously to make a strong throw.  With a 4-2 lead, Milwaukee returned the favor in the eighth, getting Jacob Barnes out of a jam when Sogard made an off-balance but perfect throw to get Adam Frazier at the plate trying to score on a hard-hit ground ball from Polanco.  The best part about the play was there was just no hesitation,  Counsell said.  Get to the ball and throw it home. Any hesitation and there's trouble.  Corey Knebel worked a perfect ninth for his 12th save of the season. NOTES: Pittsburgh placed C Francisco Cervelli on the seven-day concussion list for the second time this season. Cervelli missed the last two games with what the team originally described as  flu-like symptoms,  which actually were brought on by a concussion on June 6. ... The Pirates recalled C Jacob Stallings from Triple-A Indianapolis to replace Cervelli on the roster. ... Brewers LF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) and 2B Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) were scheduled to be in the Class A Wisconsin starting lineup Thursday night as they begin minor league rehab assignments.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED6MZ0ULFD"},

Pedro Parente said at an event in São Paulo that a proposal would be delivered for board approval as soon as next month. While terms of the deal remain under analysis, he said an initial public offering would create  more value  for Petrobras, as the oil firm is known. In a statement, Petrobras said the unit IPO will consist of existing shares, in a mechanism known as a secondary offer. Parente did not specify terms or a timetable for the IPO, but if the board approves the plan in July, it could be priced as early as October, based on standard IPO calendars in Brazil.  We see market conditions that are extremely favorable, with investors willing to pay high valuations to encourage good companies to list their shares,  Parente said. Petrobras is increasingly relying on cost reductions, asset sales, spinoffs and capital-spending cuts to trim debt of about $100 billion and turn the page on a massive corruption scandal. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras has gone back and forth on plans to spin off or list BR Distribuidora over the past two years, backing off in part due to legal and operational challenges and investor skepticism.  BR Distribuidora, which controls Brazil's largest gasoline, ethanol and diesel-station network, was valued at around $10 billion by UBS Securities analysts two years ago. Earlier this year, Petrobras unveiled a two-year, $21 billion asset sale and partnership program.  During the event, Parente said improving operational profitability in the face of low oil prices highlights how recent cost-cutting efforts have bolstered the finances of the state behemoth.

Delays have pushed back the nuclear power plant's construction, and the expected cost of top-up payments ... has increased from 6 billion pounds 30 billion pounds,  the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) said. The NAO is publishing its report just as the government has committed to help to curb energy costs as part of its new policy objectives. Hinkley Point C is Britain's first new nuclear plant to be built in decades. It has been plagued by delays and criticized for its guaranteed price for electricity, which is higher than current market prices. EDF's UK arm EDF Energy is building the 18 billion pound plant in southwest England with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), which has a 33.5 percent stake.  Britain awarded the project a minimum price guarantee of 92.5 pounds per megawatt hour (MWh), inflation linked, for 35 years. Under the contract, the government will pay the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the minimum it has promised - so-called top-up payments. British spot wholesale electricity prices have fallen since the deal was struck in 2013, and currently trade around 40 pounds per MWh. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the project would ensure nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix in Britain.  Consumers won't pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships,  she said. The plant, which EDF initially promised would be powering ovens to cook Britons’ Christmas dinner in 2017, is expected to start generating electricity in 2025. BEIS said the project would add 10-15 pounds annually to household electricity bills up to 2030. But the watchdog's report criticized the government for failing to fully consider the impact on bills beyond 2030. The NAO also said there was a risk the project would need further financial support.   The UK government could come under pressure to provide more support or take on additional risk, particularly given (Hinkley's) potential importance for ensuring energy security,  it said. When built Hinkley Point C is expected to generate around 7 percent of Britain's electricity, and will help to replace the country's aging nuclear fleet, and closing coal plants. EDF Energy said the NAO report showed the project was good value compared with other low-carbon energy alternatives, and that EDF Energy and CGN bear the construction risk of the project.  Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower,  an EDF Energy spokesman said. EDF and CGN also plan to build two more reactors at Sizewell in eastern England. Editing by Jane Merriman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-nuclear-costs-idUSL8N1JJ2RN"},

Pedro Parente said at an event in São Paulo that a proposal would be delivered for board approval as soon as next month. While terms of the deal remain under analysis, he said an initial public offering would create  more value  for Petrobras, as the oil firm is known. In a statement, Petrobras said the unit IPO will consist of existing shares, in a mechanism known as a secondary offer. Parente did not specify terms or a timetable for the IPO, but if the board approves the plan in July, it could be priced as early as October, based on standard IPO calendars in Brazil.  We see market conditions that are extremely favorable, with investors willing to pay high valuations to encourage good companies to list their shares,  Parente said. Petrobras is increasingly relying on cost reductions, asset sales, spinoffs and capital-spending cuts to trim debt of about $100 billion and turn the page on a massive corruption scandal. Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras has gone back and forth on plans to spin off or list BR Distribuidora over the past two years, backing off in part due to legal and operational challenges and investor skepticism.  BR Distribuidora, which controls Brazil's largest gasoline, ethanol and diesel-station network, was valued at around $10 billion by UBS Securities analysts two years ago. Earlier this year, Petrobras unveiled a two-year, $21 billion asset sale and partnership program.  During the event, Parente said improving operational profitability in the face of low oil prices highlights how recent cost-cutting efforts have bolstered the finances of the state behemoth.

The U.S. index provider said on Wednesday it would add 222 China-listed large cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets. The decision was hailed as a major endorsement of China's reform agenda, but it also comes at a time of renewed concerns following a flurry of corporate scandals and a surge in public campaigns by activist investors alleging problems with fraud, financial engineering and market manipulation. Given that the Beijing government is also stepping up its interference in corporate affairs by insisting that Communist Party committees be established at state firms, some governance activists are questioning MSCI's decision.  Is this the right time for global investors to have to be exposed to China? It's hard to argue that the level of investor protection, regulatory consistency, and overall corporate governance in China is high enough,  said Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA). China ranks ninth out of 11 Asian economies for corporate governance, according to the ACGA. Its overall scores have declined since 2014. This stems largely from the authorities' heavy-handed intervention during the 2015 market crash, when the government put a cap on share sales and allowed more than 50 percent of companies to suspend their shares. The ACGA also highlighted slow progress on reform of state firms, poor audits and disclosure, and low levels of management accountability. “We continue to encounter managements of large A-share companies who have yet to appoint an investor relations officer and who see no reason for senior management to meet shareholders,  Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management, said in a note to clients and media.  Governance is often a challenge, as management may owe primary allegiance to municipal, provincial or national administrations,  said Greenberg, adding many of these issues should have been fixed by now. Government interference at listed companies has grown after Beijing began imposing Communist Party committees at state firms. These committees have the power to overrule the board of directors, marking a  step backwards  for China corporate governance, said Allen. Several such companies feature in MSCI's selection after the index compiler added a surprise 53 extra stocks to its original list, many of them  old economy  companies in the troubled financial and industrials sector such as China Construction Bank and PetroChina. Alpha Opportunities Benchmark providers take into consideration the quality of regulation and supervision when deciding how to classify a country, but they do not screen individual companies for corporate governance issues when adding them to global benchmarks.  These are purely quantitative indexes, where we take into consideration the size and liquidity of the stock, but not governance aspects,  Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, told reporters on Wednesday. To be sure, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC), the country's markets regulator, has increased enforcement in the financial sector. The government is expected to update its 15-year-old corporate governance code this year. CSRC vice-chairman Fang Xinghai also seemed to confirm a widely-held view that inclusion should promote better governance over the long-term when he pledged on Wednesday to continue with reforms and ensure “good” companies come to the market. In the meantime, active investors that measure their performance against the EM index said the challenges of investing in China created ripe opportunities for those prepared to do their homework.  It works both ways. All the problems that people complain about, including a lack of transparency and corporate governance, all create investment opportunities,  said Qi Wang, a former MSCI executive director and currently chief executive for asset manager MegaTrust Investments.  Governance in Chinese companies is so varied, it creates alpha opportunities for those who can see through these issues.

The Liberals have little chance of fulfilling those promises because they lost their majority control of the legislature, paving way for a coalition government of New Democrats and the Greens to take power as early as next week through passage of a no-confidence motion. The Liberals, who have ruled for 16 years, used the  Speech from the Throne,  on Thursday to present an agenda that could form the party platform for a new election. Defeat of the Liberals in the May election created uncertainty for businesses in Canada's third-most-populous province, notably oil and gas projects such as Kinder Morgan Inc's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which is opposed by New Democrats and the Greens. Yet the outlook remains unclear as some experts predict another election could soon be called as the New Democrats-Greens alliance only has 44 seats, one more than the Liberals. The loss of a single lawmaker could result in deadlocked legislature, sparking a new election. The Liberals promised reforms to electoral financing, an area where British Columbia has been criticized for its lack of regulations. They also called for holding a referendum on broader rules governing elections. The Liberals said the incumbent party had an obligation to try to rule.  It has a duty to present an agenda for consideration and seek the confidence of this house,  the speech read. The requirement that the legislature elect a neutral parliamentary speaker could endanger the fledgling New Democrat-Green government because the official is usually chosen from the ruling party or parties. Electing a Green or New Democratic speaker would reduce the alliance's seat count to a 43-43 tie with the Liberals. The speaker is allowed to vote to break a tie, but repeated votes in favor of one party would undermine the impartiality of the role. The Speech from the Throne was written by the Liberals but delivered by the province's nonpartisan nominal leader, Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon.

Given the floor for 10 minutes at the end of a Brussels summit dinner, her first since she launched the two-year withdrawal process in March, May outlined five principles, notably that no EU citizen resident in Britain at a cut-off date would be deported. There are roughly 3 million living there now. That was, she told them,  a fair and serious offer , a British official said. It was  aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK, building careers and lives, and contributing so much to our society . Promising details on Monday, May also said those EU citizens who had lived in Britain for five years could stay for life. Those there for less would be allowed to stay until they reach the five-year threshold for  settled status . Red tape for permanent residency would be cut there would be a two-year grace period to avoid  cliff edge  misfortunes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who earlier said she wanted  far-reaching guarantees , described giving full rights to those in Britain for five years as  a good start  but said many questions remained.  It is a first good step which we appreciate,  said Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern.  Many details are left open. A lot of European citizens are concerned and not covered by May’s proposal. There is a long, long way to go for negotiations.  Other leaders offered few details on their reservations. Related CoverageWith 'Eurovision' vote, EU agencies to leave LondonMerkel says May's offer on expats 'good start' but many questions remainMay's push to set the cut-off date as early as March 29 this year, is unlikely to wash with many in the European Union, whose position is that nothing must change until Britain leaves -- scheduled for March 30, 2019. And there was much missing from an outline offer which the British previously called  generous . No Discussion Another sticking point could be May's rejection of another EU demand that expats be able to enforce their rights in the EU court. The source said they would have to accept British judges.  Brussels has been dismissive of May's call for sweeping and quick guarantees for expats, including over a million Britons on the continent, and says only detailed legal texts can reassure and take account of complex, multinational family situations. British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 22, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesLeaders had agreed with summit chair Donald Tusk not to open discussions with May and she left immediately afterwards, leaving the other 27 to discuss other Brexit issues without her. They were briefed by Michel Barnier, who launched the Brexit negotiations for them on Monday, and discussed the move of two EU agencies from London after Britain quits. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, among others, had made clear that they did not want to be drawn into Brexit talks and wanted to focus on the future of the EU minus Britain. May seemed keen to calm the mood with the continentals after weeks of sniping during her election campaign, stressing that London wanted a  special and deep partnership with our friends and allies in Europe .  Slideshow (8 Images)Merkel also expressed a desire for constructive talks with Britain, but made clear that the EU's priority now was its own future:  We will conduct these talks in a good spirit,  she said.  But the clear focus has to be on the future of the 27.  France's new president spoke of working with Germany to revive European integration and Macron did not refer at all to Britain during his remarks before talks got under way.      Not the Only Dreamer  Weakened by an election she did not need to call, May has watered down her government's program to try to get it through parliament and set a softer tone in her approach to Brexit. Yet her aims have held - she wants a clean break from the bloc, leaving the lucrative single market and customs union and so reducing immigration and ending EU courts' jurisdiction. On Thursday, her finance minister, Philip Hammond called for an early agreement on transitional arrangements to ease uncertainty that he said was hurting business.     Reflecting confusion on the continent about what kind of Brexit she will ask for, Tusk said ahead of a separate meeting with May:  We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal.  Some Britons had asked him if he could imagine Britain not leaving after all:  The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows?,  the former Polish prime minister said before quoting John Lennon's song  Imagine :  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I am not the only one.

A majority of the court said plea bargains, such as those made by dozens of executives at the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA and construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], could be evaluated by the full court and rejected if they rule that a state's witness lied or withheld information.     However, the court ruled that it did not have the right to change the benefits that prosecutors give a person who turns state's witness.  That move would have killed the entire plea bargain process, which has been a key tool in uncovering massive graft schemes in recent years, prosecutors told Reuters.  The full court cannot change the terms of a plea bargain if all its terms were met,  said Justice Luiz Fux.  Once the plea bargain has been approved by prosecutors, the only thing that can be analyzed is if there was full collaboration.  Three federal prosecutors directly involved in the biggest of the graft investigations told Reuters that their main fear was that the court might have ruled it could change the benefits given to state's witnesses.     That, one prosecutor said, would have been  a signal to those who may wish to strike an accord with prosecutors and turn over substantial amounts of proof of corruption that they may not really benefit from doing so.     While the court stopped short of that, investigators fear that involving all 11 top court justices in deciding whether or not a state's witness has fully collaborated could still spook some potential witnesses into not talking.    Eloisa Machado, a law professor at the elite FGV university in Sao Paulo, said Thursday's ruling was still positive, however, since it signaled the continuation of Brazil's various corruption investigations. That was especially true, according to Machado, of the  Operation Car Wash  probe that has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid by big firms like JBS and Odebrecht, money that was funneled to politicians and executives at state-run companies in return for lucrative contracts.       The anti-graft push has put Temer, four past presidents, and dozens of lawmakers under investigation and led to the conviction of over 90 powerful politicians and businessmen.  With the ruling, the Supreme Court guaranteed the integrity of Operation Car  Wash and the chance that other mega cases of corruption and organized crime will be discovered,  said Machado. Brazil only began allowing plea-bargain agreements in 2013.     Scores have been struck, notably that of 77 Odebrecht executives and seven businessmen from JBS. It was testimony in the JBS case that earlier prompted the Supreme Court to authorize an investigation into allegations that Temer took millions of dollars in bribes to help the meatpacker. The conservative leader, who replaced impeached President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago, has denied any wrongdoing and accused a leading witness against him of lying. Plea-bargain testimonies have shaken Brazil's political and business sectors to their core as they revealed the corrosive effects of graft on Latin America's biggest economy. Joesley and Wesley Batista, the brothers who control JBS, managed to avoid serving any jail time as part of their plea-bargain deal, though they had to pay a total of 225 million reais ($67.4 mln) in fines.     The Batistas and other JBS executives managed to stun a nation accustomed to the corruption revelations when they testified they had spent roughly 500 million reais in recent years to bribe nearly 1,900 politicians at all levels of government.

That move would have killed the entire plea bargain process, which has been a key tool in uncovering massive graft schemes in recent years, prosecutors told Reuters.  The full court cannot change the terms of a plea bargain if all its terms were met,  said Justice Luiz Fux.  Once the plea bargain has been approved by prosecutors, the only thing that can be analyzed is if there was full collaboration.  Three federal prosecutors directly involved in the biggest of the graft investigations told Reuters that their main fear was that the court might have ruled it could change the benefits given to state's witnesses.     That, one prosecutor said, would have been  a signal to those who may wish to strike an accord with prosecutors and turn over substantial amounts of proof of corruption that they may not really benefit from doing so.     While the court stopped short of that, investigators fear that involving all 11 top court justices in deciding whether or not a state's witness has fully collaborated could still spook some potential witnesses into not talking.    Eloisa Machado, a law professor at the elite FGV university in Sao Paulo, said Thursday's ruling was still positive, however, since it signaled the continuation of Brazil's various corruption investigations. That was especially true, according to Machado, of the  Operation Car Wash  probe that has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid by big firms like JBS and Odebrecht, money that was funneled to politicians and executives at state-run companies in return for lucrative contracts.       The anti-graft push has put Temer, four past presidents, and dozens of lawmakers under investigation and led to the conviction of over 90 powerful politicians and businessmen.  With the ruling, the Supreme Court guaranteed the integrity of Operation Car  Wash and the chance that other mega cases of corruption and organized crime will be discovered,  said Machado. Brazil only began allowing plea-bargain agreements in 2013.     Scores have been struck, notably that of 77 Odebrecht executives and seven businessmen from JBS. It was testimony in the JBS case that earlier prompted the Supreme Court to authorize an investigation into allegations that Temer took millions of dollars in bribes to help the meatpacker. The conservative leader, who replaced impeached President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago, has denied any wrongdoing and accused a leading witness against him of lying. Plea-bargain testimonies have shaken Brazil's political and business sectors to their core as they revealed the corrosive effects of graft on Latin America's biggest economy. Joesley and Wesley Batista, the brothers who control JBS, managed to avoid serving any jail time as part of their plea-bargain deal, though they had to pay a total of 225 million reais ($67.4 mln) in fines.     The Batistas and other JBS executives managed to stun a nation accustomed to the corruption revelations when they testified they had spent roughly 500 million reais in recent years to bribe nearly 1,900 politicians at all levels of government.

Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said a 3 percent rise in the currency since May was partly due to higher export prices and that a lower currency would help rebalance the growth outlook. Growth prospects were  positive  thanks to low interest rates and changes in the 2017 Budget that would boost family income and infrastructure spending. The central bank reiterated rates policy would be accommodative for a  considerable period,  with first quarter growth data reinforcing its view that it is too early to rein in growth. New Zealand has been among the best-performing advanced economies in recent years.  There (are) a few tweaks in the language in regards to the currency and acknowledging the budget, but, look, the broad message is unchanged – the Reserve Bank is cautious, it's watchful, but it's neutral,  said Philip Borkin, senior economist at ANZ.  It looks like the hurdle for them to shift from that neutral stance in either direction remains very high.  None of the 26 economists polled by Reuters expected the RBNZ to move this week, though four thought a hike was possible as early as the first quarter of 2018. The NZ dollar jumped towards four-month highs to $0.7280 from around $0.7211 before the statement. It retraced to around $0.7247 by 0148 GMT.  Potentially the market was looking for the Reserve Bank to do more to talk down the currency,  said Jane Turner, senior economist at ASB Bank. Language Rates would stay accommodative for a considerable period, while  numerous uncertainties  remained and policy may have to adjust accordingly, Wheeler said, sticking with the language used in central bank statements from February, March and May. However, he dropped a reference in May's release that developments since the last monetary policy statement had been neutral for policy, which some economists at the time considered to be an  aggressively neutral  stance. The Reserve Bank's neutral stance was the source of recent controversy between the RBNZ and the Bank of New Zealand, with Wheeler complaining in writing to BNZ that one of its research notes questioned the RBNZ's integrity.  There was a chance that the Reserve Bank could reassert the possibility of cuts as well as hikes. They didn't, so we've seen a little relief rally in the New Zealand dollar,  said Michael Gordon, acting chief economist at Westpac. For the text of the statement click on.

The Anglo-Dutch company is this week launching Persil Powergems, a brand new kind of detergent that is neither powder nor liquid, after spending 18 million euros ($20 million) on research, development and marketing.  It remains to be seen whether the premium-priced, lentil-shaped crystals will make their way beyond Britain, the launch market. Not all innovations are hits, as Unilever learned when its now-abandoned Persil Power was found to damage clothes in the 1990s. But if successful, Powergems could strengthen Unilever's No. 2 position behind Procter & Gamble (PG.N) in a global retail laundry market worth $74 billion and lift the company, which investors are closely watching to see if its new cost-savings promises will hurt long-term growth.       We're not holding back or saying we have to pause, that we can't do this this year or next year, no. We are going straight ahead, investing as much as is needed,  Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever's home care business, told Reuters. This project, code-named  Dazzle,  was well on its way at the Port Sunlight R&D; lab in northwestern England in February when Unilever fought off a surprise $143 billion bid from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) that forced changes designed to show it can improve performance as an independent company.  It would've been throwing money away to not launch this one, but the question is, will we see more of these going forward?  said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.  They need to keep doing this type of thing because driving innovation is the lifeblood of big, branded companies.    Evolving consumer tastes and an onslaught of new, upstart brands that can gain popularity quickly mean that traditional multinationals need to improve their portfolios faster to protect market share. Frugality Unilever's Persil Ultimate Powergems Bio Detergent is seen in a photo illustration shot June 22, 2017.Simon Newman/IllustrationParanjpe said Unilever's heightened frugality would not interfere with that, and said adopting the  zero-based budgeting  approach making waves across the sector does not automatically mean investments will be cut. For example, he said the company's R&D; budget, of about 1 billion euros a year, was not being cut. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB)is an accounting method whereby all expenses must be justified from scratch for each new period. The approach, responsible for the fat profit margins at Kraft Heinz, is spreading throughout the industry as growth slows. Slideshow (2 Images) Many people have given ZBB a bad name, only thinking of it in terms of indiscriminately cutting things to shore up the bottom line. We don't believe in that,  Paranjpe said, citing Unilever's promise to reinvest two-thirds of the 6 billion euros in savings it has targeted.  He said his 10 billion euros-a-year home care business was a little ahead of its cost-savings plans.  It has given us a pot that has enabled us to invest in initiatives,  he said, referring to the 18 million euro splashout on Powergems, which covered things like a new line at its Warrington factory and new technology that allows fragrance molecules to cling to fabric throughout the wash.     In addition, he said a recent restructuring has helped speed cooperation between groups, allowing for more quick, local projects, such as a Thai laundry soap for black clothes rolled out in only two months after the death of the king sparked a year-long period of mourning. Keith Rutherford, head of R&D; for Unilever's home care business, said creativity is often boosted by restrictive guidelines. He cited financial or environmental concerns, which are both common on his team, which designs lots of goods for developing and emerging markets where disposable incomes are limited.  The more I constrain and say 'I want you to innovate on less than two euro cents per unit, or without the use of water', everyone initially says it can't be done,  Rutherford said in Port Sunlight, built in the 19th century by William Lever to house his soap factory workers.  And then about two weeks later, someone says they can.   Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-persil-launch-idUSKBN19D2KL"},

A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago ruled 2-1 to uphold a federal judge's ruling last year that overturned Dassey's conviction for a 2005 murder. Magistrate Judge William Duffin had ruled in August that the conviction was based on a coerced confession that Dassey, now 27, gave as a 16-year-old with a learning disability. Duffin ordered Dassey freed in November, but his release was halted while Wisconsin authorities appealed the decision.  THIS JUST IN,  Dassey's attorney Steven Drizin tweeted on Thursday.   7th Circuit AFFIRMS Judge Duffin in 2-1 decision.  This round goes to Brendan Dassey 2-1.  The judges' three-sentence judgment ordered Dassey freed unless Wisconsin elected to retry him within 90 days or appealed the ruling. Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, said his office was evaluating the decision.  We anticipate seeking review by the entire 7th Circuit or the United States Supreme Court and hope that today’s erroneous decision will be reversed,  he said in an email. Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, were convicted in separate trials of killing freelance photographer Teresa Halbach at Avery's home and scrap yard. Her charred remains were found in an incineration barrel and a burn pit on Avery's property, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Milwaukee. A jury in 2007 found Dassey guilty of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse. Avery was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon. Both were sentenced to life in prison. The case was the subject of the 10-part documentary  Making a Murderer,  which questioned the handling of the investigation and the motives of Manitowoc County law enforcement officials. The documentary recounted how Avery was convicted of an earlier, unrelated rape and sent to prison in 1985, serving 18 years before DNA evidence exonerated him and he was released.  He filed a $36 million federal lawsuit against the county, its former sheriff and district attorney in 2004. A year later, he and Dassey were accused of killing Halbach. The Emmy-winning documentary suggested that authorities planted evidence against both defendants, a claim rejected by the current sheriff.

Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed's most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year's level.  This year's results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,  said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.  The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis.  We see today's...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,  said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent.  From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,  he said. Awaiting Part Two A combination file photo shows international banks Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch from Reuters archive.File photosThursday's results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed's methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks' capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed's. Under the Fed's worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. A J.P. Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.Stephanie KeithHowever, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks' aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed's approval. Under the Fed's examination, Citi's minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi's own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed's assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed's. Wells Fargo's metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed's, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan's analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed's. Bank of America's was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass.  If there is disappointment next week,  said Seiberg,  it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.

Meanwhile, it was an opportunity for the Philadelphia Phillies to get a break from the life of being the major league's worst team. Phillies starter Aaron Nola provided the reprieve for the struggling ballclub and put together one of his best pitching efforts of the season. He struck out a season-high eight batters and allowed just one run in 7 1/3 innings to help lift Philadelphia to a 5-1 win and snap the team's five-game losing streak. Thursday's performance gave Nola, the team's 2014 first-round pick out of LSU, some much-needed confidence in a career that has been marked by equal parts potential and inconsistency. The righty improved to 4-5 with a 4.32 ERA with the win, and he is 15-16 with a 4.39 ERA in his career.  I know what I'm capable of and I know what I can do,  Nola said,  and today was me. I felt confident in all my pitches today and commanding all my pitches when I wanted to. It was all good in those areas.  Nola tied his season high of seven strikeouts before the game reached the seventh inning and cruised through the first seven innings, allowing just three hits and one walk. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PhilliesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchAfter allowing a leadoff home run to Paul DeJong on a 2-2 pitch in the top of the eighth, Nola fanned pinch hitter Greg Garcia for his eighth strikeout. He left in favor of reliever Pat Neshek one batter later after walking Matt Carpenter. Neshek got the Phillies (23-48) out of any potential damage by getting Tommy Pham to ground into an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play. Luis Garcia pitched a scoreless ninth inning to close out the game. Phillies manager Pete Mackanin, whose team blew a five-run lead and eventually dropped a 7-6 extra-inning game to the Cardinals Wednesday night, was encouraged by what he saw of Nola.  He had a lot of success early when he first got here and went through a period where he was struggling to find himself in the last outing and this outing,  Mackanin said,  especially in this one. That looked like the old Nola that we saw, and that's great to see. I was ecstatic.  Said DeJong:  He was locating his fastball really well, hitting those corners and throwing breaking balls for strikes and off to kind of fool you.  DeJong, who was called up by the Cardinals back on May 28 and homered in his first career at bat, went 1-for-3 Thursday and is hitting .265 with four homers and 10 RBIs.  It's been up and down,  said DeJong, who also committed two errors in the game.  I think I can be more consistent and strive every day to be more consistent. That's just baseball. You're going to have the ups and downs. You have to try to be even keeled as much as you can.  Shortstop Freddy Galvis gave the Phillies an early 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning when he hit Carlos Martinez's first pitch of the at-bat five rows deep into the right-center field bleachers. Nola got more run support in the bottom of the fifth when first baseman Tommy Joseph led off with a line-drive home run to left field and second baseman Andres Blanco singled and later scored on an error by Cardinals shortstop Aledmys Diaz to make it a 3-0 ballgame. Joseph, who went 2-for-3 with three RBIs, pushed the Phillies out to a 5-1 lead in the bottom of the eighth with a two-run single that scored Odubel Herrera and Maikel Franco. Martinez (6-6) came into the game ranked third in the NL with a 2.86 ERA and among the top 10 in 11 different statistical categories. He left after six innings, allowing three runs (two earned), six hits and the two home runs while striking out four. He took the loss. The Cardinals, who had made a living off the NL East this season with a 13-2 record in 15 previous games against the division, dropped to 33-38 to wrap up a seven-day, six-game road trip. A win Thursday would have given St. Louis its first three-game series sweep in Philadelphia since April of 2006. NOTES: RHP Aaron Nola's 7 1/3 innings were a bit of a rarity for the Phillies, whose starting rotation had averaged a little more six innings per game. ... With a one-out single to right field on the top of the seventh inning, Cardinals C Yadier Molina extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... Thursday's win was Philadelphia's first since a June 15 victory against the Boston Red Sox. ... The Cardinals have hit at least one home run in a season-best 11 consecutive games, dating back to June 11.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED6MYZ54EN"},

A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago ruled 2-1 to uphold a federal judge's ruling last year that overturned Dassey's conviction for a 2005 murder. Magistrate Judge William Duffin had ruled in August that the conviction was based on a coerced confession that Dassey, now 27, gave as a 16-year-old with a learning disability. Duffin ordered Dassey freed in November, but his release was halted while Wisconsin authorities appealed the decision.  THIS JUST IN,  Dassey's attorney Steven Drizin tweeted on Thursday.   7th Circuit AFFIRMS Judge Duffin in 2-1 decision. This round goes to Brendan Dassey 2-1.  The judges' three-sentence judgment ordered Dassey freed unless Wisconsin elected to retry him within 90 days or appealed the ruling. Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, said his office was evaluating the decision.  We anticipate seeking review by the entire 7th Circuit or the United States Supreme Court and hope that today’s erroneous decision will be reversed,  he said in an email. Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, were convicted in separate trials of killing freelance photographer Teresa Halbach at Avery's home and scrap yard. Her charred remains were found in an incineration barrel and a burn pit on Avery's property, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Milwaukee. A jury in 2007 found Dassey guilty of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse. Avery was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon. Both were sentenced to life in prison. The case was the subject of the 10-part documentary  Making a Murderer,  which questioned the handling of the investigation and the motives of Manitowoc County law enforcement officials. The documentary recounted how Avery was convicted of an earlier, unrelated rape and sent to prison in 1985, serving 18 years before DNA evidence exonerated him and he was released. He filed a $36 million federal lawsuit against the county, its former sheriff and district attorney in 2004. A year later, he and Dassey were accused of killing Halbach. The Emmy-winning documentary suggested that authorities planted evidence against both defendants, a claim rejected by the current sheriff.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wisconsin-dassey-release-idUSL1N1JJ289"},

The first U.S. state representative to make an official visit to Communist-run Cuba since Trump's announcement on Friday, Smith said authorities there were worried about the setback to bilateral relations. Leading a bipartisan trade delegation from Minnesota, she said she was therefore glad to carry the message that there was still plenty of support for continuing to normalize relations.  There is no denying the actions Trump took last Friday are a real setback,  Smith, a Democrat, said in an interview in the gardens of Havana's iconic Hotel Nacional.  But the important thing to me is that there is bipartisan support at the federal level for normalizing and modernizing our relationship.  U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, in May led a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, to introduce legislation to lift the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. Minnesota is one of the largest U.S. farming states, and Smith's delegation included its agriculture commissioner and the head of its corn growers association. The delegation hopes to improve ties with and promote exports to Cuba. U.S. farm groups have been particularly critical of the decision by Trump, a Republican, to retreat from Democratic predecessor Barack Obama's opening toward Cuba, saying it could derail huge growth in agricultural exports that totaled $221 million last year.    Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith speaks during an interview at a Hotel in Havana, Cuba, June 22, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniU.S. law exempts food from a decades-old embargo on U.S. trade with Cuba, although cumbersome rules on executing transactions have made deals difficult and costly. While Trump's new Cuba policy does not directly target agriculture, it damages improved relations, the farm groups say. Trump ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the island's military, which manages much of the economy. Minnesota Lt. Governor Tina Smith waves to journalists at the end of a news conference in a Hotel in Havana, Cuba, June 22, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniThe Minnesota delegation met this week with officials of the Cuban ministries of foreign affairs and agriculture, while also visiting a cooperative and local food markets. But the tour did not include the usual trip to the Mariel port and special development zone, which Cuba hopes will attract foreign investment and become a major shipping hub in the Caribbean. It is controlled by a military-affiliated company.   In Minnesota we don't have a lot of cocoa or coffee or pineapples, but we do have a lot of corn and beans,  Smith said.  We need each others' products.   Cuba invited the Minnesota delegation to a trade show later in the year, Smith said, while Minnesota invited Cuban officials to visit.  I am very hopeful all of those things will lead us to a place where we can move forward.

The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments in North America as Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states. Separately, American Airlines Group Inc is already part of a push by U.S. carriers to squeeze Qatar out of their domestic market. Along with United Continental Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines, American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways. The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. In his letter, American CEO Doug Parker promised to continue American's  full court press ... to stand up to companies that are illegally subsidized by their governments.  He also said he found Qatar Airways' proposed investment  puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies that Qatar, Emirates and Etihad have all received over the years from their governments.  Qatar Airways responded on Twitter, saying:  We are glad to see American Airlines' CEO Doug Parker's perspective that he agrees with Qatar Airways' belief that American Airlines is a solid financial investment.  The potential investment is worth at least $808 million, American said in a regulatory filing on Thursday, and would put Qatar Airways' stake on par with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which holds a 10 percent stake in the airline. Shares of American Airlines rose more than 5 percent in pre-market trade after it disclosed the potential investment. The stock closed up 1.1 percent. Qatar Airways said in a statement that it sees a  strong investment opportunity  in American and that it  intends to build a passive position in the company with no involvement in management, operations or governance.   Qatar Airways plans to make an initial investment of up to 4.75 percent. Qatar Airways will not exceed 4.75 percent without prior consent of the American Airlines board. Qatar Airways will make all necessary regulatory filings at the appropriate time,  it said. American, in its filing, noted potential obstacles to Qatar's plan, as its rules prohibit  anyone from acquiring 4.75 percent or more of the company's outstanding stock without advance approval from the board.  It said it had received no request from Qatar for such approval. Further, American said,  there are foreign ownership laws that limit the total percentage of foreign voting interest to 24.9 percent.  American Shares Cheaper Than Rivals A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio. The Middle East's second biggest airline also owns 20 percent of British Airways-owner International Airlines Group and 10 percent of South America's LATAM. American Airlines shares are cheaper than Delta, United and JetBlue on a forward 12-month earnings per share basis, according to Thomson Reuters data, and are the cheapest among the top eight U.S. airlines. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker has said the investments were purely financial, though he has looked for opportunities to cut costs or expand service with the oneworld alliance airlines in which it owns a stake. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, IAG's British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM's base in Santiago, Chile.  The U.S. market is strategically important to Qatar Airways and this would strengthen their ability to feed at the U.S. end,  independent aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters.  However, if it does go ahead it would not give them automatic antitrust immunity. That would have to be negotiated separately.  Qatar Airways' desire to invest in American could be as much a political decision as financial, analysts said, as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, forcing it to cut flights to those countries and fly longer, more expensive, routes. Those countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this month, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies.  There's a good chance this investment plan by Qatar Airways may have more to do with demonstrating sovereign Qatar's continued commitment to the United States amid the latest Gulf States feud with Qatar,  Gimme Credit analyst Vicki Bryan wrote in a research note. Al-Baker, highly critical of the blocking of airspace, has said Qatar Airways would use the aircraft used to fly to those countries for fast-track expansion plans elsewhere.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/american-airline-stake-qatarairways-idUSL1N1JJ18A"},

Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed's most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year's level.  This year's results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,  said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.  The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the broader economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The 34 banks that now undergo the test have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations.  Positive for Efforts to Deregulate Banks  Wall Street analysts and trade groups cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis.  We see today's...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,  said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent.  From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,  he said. Thursday's results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed's methodology, using materials they submitted. A second portion of the test to be released on Wednesday will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks' capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed's. Under the Fed's worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks' aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed's approval. Under the Fed's examination, Citi's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Under results released by Citi, that ratio was 10 percent. Its shares were up 0.3 percent in after-hours trading at $63.80. The other five largest banks, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, showed common equity Tier 1 capital ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent in the Fed's most aggressive scenario. Ally Financial Inc and KeyCorp were the only two lenders to show common equity Tier 1 capital ratios below 7 percent.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the build-up of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by drinking alcohol. It's the most common cause of liver disease in the U.S., the study team writes in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.  The more severe form of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), tends to develop in people who are overweight or obese or who have diabetes, high cholesterol or high triglycerides, according to the American Liver Foundation.  With NAFLD, the liver may swell and develop scarring, known as fibrosis, or cirrhosis in its more advanced stages. NASH often leads to more serious liver diseases, including liver cancer. About a quarter of people with NASH have cirrhosis. Past research has suggested that NAFLD can run in families, but it wasn’t known if family members are also prone to developing fibrosis and more serious liver diseases.  “My goal is to change practice to develop screening guidelines for who are the patients who are at high risk for developing cirrhosis and should we be screening them,” said senior study author Dr. Rohit Loomba of the NAFLD Research Center at the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla. One reason family members’ risk was poorly understood is that a diagnosis of fibrosis required a biopsy, which is a painful medical procedure. But Loomba and colleagues devised a way to detect fat and scarring in the liver using MRI scanning.   For the current study, Loomba and colleagues enrolled 26 patients with NAFLD and cirrhosis, along with 39 of their parents or siblings, as well as 69 people without liver disease plus 69 of their first-degree relatives. The study team took medical histories, performed medical examinations and used MRI to evaluate the livers of all participants. They found that three quarters of the relatives of patients with NAFLD and cirrhosis also had NAFLD.  Seven of these people, 18 percent of family members, also had advanced liver fibrosis, compared to 1.4 percent of the relatives of controls. The family members of NAFLD-cirrhosis patients were 12.5 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than the healthy comparison families. “The data's very compelling. It reinforces smaller and less well-conducted studies that indicate a higher likelihood of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis among family members,” said Dr. Scott Friedman, a liver disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who wasn’t involved in the study. “So, it's important, because it may heighten our concern about the risk of undiagnosed liver disease in first-degree relatives of patients who've been diagnosed with NAFLD, particularly those who have more advanced fibrosis,” Friedman said in a phone interview. There has been a rising awareness and incidence of liver disease associated with so-called metabolic syndrome, which is a constellation of abnormalities usually including obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure and high blood fats, Friedman noted. “We're still trying to understand, certainly, what's the cause, what are the risk factors, who is at highest risk, how do we screen for those patients, and what do we do when we detect disease,” he said. It’s important to note that aside from genetic contributions, first-degree relatives often share the same lifestyle habits, he added.  Currently, there are no proven therapies except diet and weight loss, which is hard to sustain. “But, there is an intense effort in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to come up with new drugs to treat those conditions before it progresses to the cirrhotic state, where cancer and liver failure are real concerns,” Friedman said. Loomba said new therapies are emerging. “There are about five Phase 3 trials for the treatment of NASH and especially advanced fibrosis in NASH.”  Once a patient develops cirrhosis, there’s a risk of developing liver cancer and those individuals need to be screened for that, Loomba added. “We have a series of tests that need to be done on those individuals. And then, if the patient is obese for example and if they lose weight then you can even reverse fibrosis or progression of the disease.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2svhgCI The Journal of Clinical Investigation, online June 19, 2017.

Women said on Thursday, urging the global ad industry to turn into a weapon for good. Advertising has the power to create positive portrayals of women and eliminate stereotypes, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of the United Nations' agency on women, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Mlambo-Ngcuka spoke from France, where she is calling on advertising leaders who are attending the industry's annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity to eliminate stereotypes and commit to gender equality.  People are more likely to see adverts in their lives than read books,  she said.  It's a waste if we are not using this opportunity for good.  Stereotypes of women permeate the globe, she said, be it in nations such as Iceland with high gender equality or those with very little in the way of equal rights, like Yemen.  Of the many things that we've tried to do to obtain gender equality, we are not getting the kind of traction and success that we are looking for, because of the underlying stereotypes and social norms in existence in society,  she said.  Adverts create a role model that people look up to, even mimic and try to be like,  said the veteran South African politician.  If they see men in powerful positions most of the time and do not see women and people who look like them ... then they think this is not for them.  Research by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media illustrates the issue, said Philip Thomas, chief executive of the annual advertising event in Cannes, who also participated in the interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One in ten female characters in advertising is shown in sexually revealing clothing, six times the number of male characters, he said. Of characters portrayed as intelligent - such as doctors or scientists - men are 62 percent more likely than women to play those roles, he said. Women are 48 percent more likely to be shown in the kitchen, he said. Creative teams at advertising agencies are predominantly male, and just 11 percent of creative directors around the world are female, he said. The industry can make an effort to mentor women, employ and promote more female creative teams and reward work that promotes positive images, he said. Mlambo-Ngcuka said she welcomed efforts such as one in Berlin, where the city's ruling coalition has agreed on a ban on degrading or sexist advertising. An expert committee will examine and prevent discriminatory advertising on both privately and publicly owned advertising billboards and hoardings. Opposition parties in Berlin say such a ban infringes on free speech.  When it's so much that is against us, I think we are allowed sometimes to make some extreme measures even if there's a controversy,  she said.  Let's have the discussion.

In the first scientific study of Ebola victim burials, researchers found each unsafe burial had the potential to generate more than 2.5 secondary cases of Ebola infection.  The virus kills about 50 percent of those it infects on average, according to the World Health Organization.  People who treat and bury the bodies of the dead are especially at risk, as corpses are even more contagious than living Ebola patients. The Red Cross safe burial program potentially averted between 1,411 and 10,452 secondary cases of infection during the West African outbreak, limiting its scale by as much as a third, estimated the study published in the journal “PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases”.  Over 28,600 people were infected with the Ebola virus disease and more than 11,000 died in that epidemic, it added.  The Red Cross said the findings supported the “safe and dignified burial” practices conducted by its teams of trained local volunteers in virus-hit countries.    Those practices at times provoked furious reactions from some community members, as they went against traditional burial norms, which include touching and washing the body.  As a result, some volunteers conducting or even promoting safe burials were attacked, their vehicles vandalized and homes stoned. “To respond effectively, we had to change our entire approach to dealing with people who had died and their families,” said Elhadj As Sy, secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).   We talked to communities and did our best to understand their beliefs and priorities. Ultimately, we earned their trust, and this was critical to success,” he added in a statement. The study's findings have been used in the response to the most recent May Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Amanda McClelland, an IFRC officer for public health in emergencies, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The Red Cross now conducts an assessment of cultural beliefs “very early on” to work out how its operating procedures can be adapted to accommodate traditional burial methods, she added.  The aid agency aims to build trust with religious and other local leaders before outbreaks occur. “We are able to explain how we need to do specific tasks and have them support us in working with the community,” McClelland said. The Red Cross conducted about half of official safe burials in Sierra Leone and 100 percent in both Guinea and Liberia’s Montserrado County during the 2013-2016 epidemic. While the number of infections that can be prevented through safe burial practices is significant, “greater impact would be achieved by early hospitalization of the primary case during acute illness”, the study noted.

Zhai, one of China's richest women and president of the privately-owned HeungKong Group Ltd, said she never forgot her humble upbringing in Guangzhou in southern China where her father was an architect and her mother worked in a store. This made her determined to help others and she started donating to charity shortly after setting up the business with her husband in 1990. As their business grew, taking in real estate, financial investment and healthcare, Zhai broke new ground in 2005 by establishing China's first non-profit charity foundation. Since then the HeungKong Charitable Foundation has helped an estimated 2 million people, by funding 1,500 libraries, providing loans for women to start businesses, and funding  orphans, single mothers, handicapped children and the elderly.  I realized there were a lot of poor people in China and this drove me to earn more money so I could help them,  said Zhai, 53, who was one of nine philanthropists named on Thursday as winners of the 2017 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Zhai and her husband Liu Zhiqiang, whose HeungKong Group with 20,000 staff has made them worth about $1.4 billion according to Forbes magazine, are known for being leaders of the culture of philanthropy in China. Their foundation was listed as number 001 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Zhai said at the end of 2015 there were 3,300 registered non-profit charity foundations in China.  By setting up the foundation I wanted to encourage other people, other entrepreneurs, to also donate to charity,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Guangzhou translated by her daughter.  Now I want to make sure that the next generation continues this culture of philanthropy in China,  she added, with two of her four children taking an active role in her foundation.

Rights watchdogs consider Honduras one of the most hostile and dangerous countries for human rights defenders, saying violence and impunity for abuses are the norm.  Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez announced the new office during a speech in May for Honduran journalists. When asked by the Thomson Reuters Foundation for follow-up, senior government official Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro said:  Our work in the area is entering a new phase.  The new Honduran human rights minister will take a seat in the cabinet and will be responsible for new funding aimed at strengthening government protection of rights activists, said Alcerro, secretary general of government coordination. Honduras has been the subject of international scrutiny since the murder of activist Berta Caceres, a winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, in March 2016 over her opposition to a $50 million hydroelectric dam project. The Central American nation is the deadliest in the world for communities fighting to protect lands against development, with about 120 activists killed since 2010, according to British-based watchdog Global Witness. Rights organizations this week criticized the government's support for the U.S.-led Alliance for Prosperity, an initiative to stem U.S. immigration by funding infrastructure megaprojects and crackdowns on gangs in Central America. Civil society organizations fear the program will result in an erosion of land and workers rights to encourage investment. But Acerro countered their concerns, saying it will create new opportunities to bolster human rights.    One of our principal priorities under the Alliance for Prosperity has in fact been the strengthening of human rights protections and of the institutional frameworks that support these,  Alcerro said. The government has been working with the European Union, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and rights charity Freedom House to develop policies that protect human rights and their advocates, he said.  This encompasses not only indigenous rights defenders, but also LGBT, political activists, journalists, and all Hondurans that work to promote and protect human rights,  he added. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said U.S. funding across Central America for the alliance, including $750 million pledged by the previous administration, will contribute to human rights training for the army and police, and to upholding the rule of law. Alcerro said that Honduras cannot directly control how U.S. agencies spend aid and investment but pledged that the regime would urge the U.S. government to align its spending with Honduran policy priorities, including rights.  U.S. and Honduran rights organizations, including the religious charities Sisters of Mercy and the Jesuit Migrant Service for Central America (JSMCA), have criticized continued U.S. support for the regime of President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Hernandez came to power after a military coup in 2009 overthrew the government of President Manuel Zelaya. His government plans to improve the country's infrastructure and communications, mostly through concessions to private industry, which have resulted in displacement of indigenous communities and small scale farmers, Sisters of Mercy said.  With regards to indigenous land rights, the Hernandez administration has already made unprecedented actions to ensure many indigenous groups hold communal land titles in accordance to their own customs,  said Alcerro.  Last year, the government granted indigenous groups communal land titles covering 1.1 million hectares - 8 percent of the national territory,  he added.

The lawsuit is aimed at stopping Sanford Health, which has more than 40 hospitals and 250 clinics, from buying Mid Dakota Clinic, which has eight facilities primarily in Bismarck, North Dakota, the Federal Trade Commission said. The FTC, which sued along with the North Dakota attorney general's office, said that the merger would sharply reduce competition to provide a broad range of medical services in Bismarck and the surrounding area.

June        , which will expire on June 30, closed 0.875 cent per pound lower at 118.625 cents. Most actively-traded  August         finished 1.075 cents lower at 114.275 cents.     So far this week market-ready, or cash, cattle in the southern U.S. Plains sold from mostly $120 to $123 per cwt, down from $127 to $133 in the region last week, said feedlot sources.     Processors paid less for supplies as beef prices at wholesale decline seasonally, said traders and analysts.                  Packers are buying cattle without having to compete for them, which has significantly expanded their margins, a trader said.                  Thursday afternoon's U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) monthly cold storage report showed May total beef stocks at 412.87 million pounds, down from analysts' projected average of 438.6 million.                  Some investors might cover short positions before the weekend following the two-day futures slide, while others adjust positions before Friday's USDA monthly Cattle-On-Feed report.                  Live cattle futures losses and lower cash feeder cattle prices undercut CME feeder cattle contracts.     August feeders         ended 1.200 cents per pound lower at 143.450 cents.      HOGS PARE RECENT GAINS        CME lean hogs        settled in bearish territory for the first time in five sessions, pressured by technical selling and  Thursday's cash and wholesale pork price retreat, said traders.      July         ended 1.050 cents lower at 85.025 cents.  August         2.350 cents lower at 79.875 cents, and below the 10-day moving average of 80.595 cents.     Hog numbers may be rising counter seasonally as moderating temperatures in parts of the Midwest causes pigs to grow quicker, making them more available to processors, said traders and analsyts.                  They said wholesale pork prices tend to top out around late June, after retailers fill inventories for U.S. Fourth of July  holiday grilling advertisements.                   The U.S. government on Thursday put total pork in cold storage last month at 592.127 million pounds, up from the 572.0 million average forecast.

The Government of the Philippines has accepted an Australian offer of two Australian Defence Force AP-3C Orion aircraft to provide surveillance support to the Armed Forces of the Philippines,  said an emailed statement from Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne.  The regional threat from terrorism, in particular from Daesh and foreign fighters, is a direct threat to Australia and our interests,  she said in the statement, referring to Islamic State by one of its Arab acronyms. The seizure of Marawi five weeks ago by Islamist rebels and the security forces' dogged fight to regain control of it has claimed 369 lives already, according to official estimates. It has also alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear Islamic State -- on a backfoot in Iraq and Syria -- is trying to set up a stronghold in the Muslim south of the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines that could threaten the whole region. Indonesian and Malaysian warships launched joint counterinsurgency manoeuvres with Philippine vessels in waters nearby. The United States has deployed troops near the besieged city, although they are not fighting there, and also provided a P-3 surveillance plane to assist the Philippines in battle. Australia's statement condemned the attack on Marawi, but gave no details about where the aircraft would be deployed. This week Philippine forces made a renewed push to retake the city, aiming to clear it by the weekend Eid festival. On Thursday, a Philippine military official said about 100 armed militants remain there, confined to an area of about 1 square kilometre. That figures is less than the estimated 400 or 500 fighters who seized the city on May 23.

The legislation met a wall of opposition from Democrats and initial skepticism among some Republicans, leaving Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell a narrow path to passage. The bill would roll back an expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled over three years, cut its federal funding beginning in 2025, restructure Obamacare's tax credits for low-income Americans, and repeal several taxes. To pass the bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes. The Senate is comprised of 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats (In the event of a deadlocked vote, Republican Vice President can vote to break the tie.) Several Republicans on Thursday expressed reservations or opposition to the bill: Opposed Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah said in a joint statement:  We are not ready to vote for this bill. ... There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.  The four said they were open to negotiation, with Cruz saying in a separate statement that he wants to  get to yes.  Supportive Richard Burr of North Carolina said outside the Senate:  I'm supportive of it. I think it strikes a balance.  He added that the blueprint  can still be amended and probably will.  Three members of the Senate Republican leadership - John Cornyn of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota, and John Barrasso of Wyoming - all put out supportive statements, saying the bill would help improve the affordability of healthcare. Barrasso said the bill was not perfect, and  we will be working to improve on this draft.  Undecided - Leaning Yes Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania said he was  still studying it but it strikes me as a good first step in what will be an ongoing process of fulfilling a commitment we made to the American people.  Richard Shelby of Alabama:  We're looking at it. My plan is to support the thrust of the bill. If it’s a good bill overall, I'm going to support it.  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee listed a number of benefits for his constituents in the draft, including that it makes no change in Medicare benefits.  I'm going to stay focused on it next week as the bill goes to the Senate floor ... and my focus will be on how it affects Tennesseans.  Undecided Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia:  I will review the draft legislation released this morning ... to evaluate whether it provides access to affordable health care for West Virginians.  Bill Cassidy of Louisiana:  I'm undecided. I have to read the text.  Marco Rubio of Florida said he will  decide how to vote on health care on the basis of how it impacts Florida.  Dean Heller of Nevada said he had  serious concerns  about the bill's impact on Medicaid in his state. Susan Collins of Maine said it was  too soon  to judge the bill and she has some concerns about cuts to Medicaid after 2025 and defunding of Planned Parenthood. Rob Portman of Ohio said in a statement that he continued to have  real concerns  about the Medicaid policies in the bill, especially those that affect drug treatment. He said his decision will depend on what is in the final version of the bill. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said,  I'm going to read it.  James Risch of Idaho:  It’s a work in progress. Ask me again when we see the final product.  John McCain of Arizona said he is reading the bill.  It’s a big thing, we just found out about it. I am just waiting until I can absorb the entire bill.  Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a statement that any replacement plan must be a net improvement over Obamacare, and he would be  reviewing the draft legislation over the next several days.

They argue the Whole Foods acquisition will give Amazon an unfair advantage over traditional grocers and new players that might emerge in the market, potentially grounds for the deal to be blocked for antitrust reasons.  As a matter of policy, should this be blocked? ...There should be a challenge to this because there should be a strong presumption against growth by acquisition and in fact there is supposed to be such a presumption in our law. It's what Congress intended,  said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. Amazon declined comment. Sagers and other critics urge regulators to prevent dominant firms from buying a major foothold in an adjacent industry. Founded as a bookseller in 1994 and now the world's biggest online retailer that sells everything from paper towels to designer clothing, Amazon sent grocery stocks into a tailspin Friday when it announced it planned to buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Critics believe Amazon's strengths in logistics, its scale and leverage with suppliers could enable it to dominate groceries as it did with bookselling. Antitrust experts who represent deals being reviewed by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission said the transaction will be approved because Amazon sells few groceries and Whole Foods is a minnow in the grocery market with 444 U.S. stores compared with 4,692 for Wal-Mart. U.S. antitrust enforcement has generally looked favorably on deals that reduce consumer prices, and Amazon supporters contend the deal will be good for consumers. The drop in grocer share prices the day the deal was announced - No. 1 U.S. grocer Kroger fell more than 9 percent - demonstrates the threat investors feel Amazon poses to traditional grocery chains.  Competitors can be expected not to like a merger that puts more pressure on them. If their share price goes down, it's a sign they'll be under more competitive pressure,  said Alden Abbott, antitrust expert at the Heritage Foundation. Amazon was accused of crippling book retailers like Borders in part through price cutting. At $480 billion, Amazon's market value equals 90 percent of all the stocks in the S&P; 1500 food and staples index, which includes Walmart. Sagers argues, however, that it would be legal for Amazon to independently develop its grocery sales rather than leapfrog ahead through acquisition. A Republican former antitrust enforcer, who asked not to be named to protect business relationships, agreed.  The notion of leveraging your power in market A to enter into market B has a been around for a long time as a basis for enforcement,  the ex-enforcer said. Precedents in Microsoft, Comcast When the Justice Department sued Microsoft Corp in 1998 the lawsuit was aimed at stopping it from using its dominance of the operating system market to also dominate browser software. Similarly, when the government allowed Comcast Corp to buy NBC Universal Inc in 2011, it tried to ensure Comcast would not interfere with the development of cable's online competitors. Some deal experts warn the proposed transaction could hurt companies that supply a combined Amazon and Whole Foods with organic flour, milk and other goods. Excessive  buyer power  worried Darren Bush, a veteran of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division who teaches at the University of Houston's Law Center. Bush said Amazon's success in offering a massive array of products at low prices masks a business model that succeeds by pushing producer prices down. Food producers could soon face the sort of pressure that booksellers faced from Amazon, which for example removed the  buy  button in 2010 from books sold by a publisher it was embroiled in a dispute with. Historically, changes in the economy - say from horse and buggies to cars - has always led to anxiety as corporate giants fall into decline to be replaced by dynamic upstarts, said Herb Hovenkamp, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.

I fight hard,  John Dowd said in an interview.  I believe that's what I'm supposed to do. I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that.   Snowflake  is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some Trump supporters to mock liberals. Dowd, who spoke with Reuters on Wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. He has a no-holds-barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional Democrats and the media. The 76-year-old Washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to Trump's legal team. The team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, is tasked with responding to Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. In what Dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time. Rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said Dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence.  This is war, and I will defeat you,  Brodsky recalled Dowd declaring in one phone conversation. Dowd confirmed the sentiment on Wednesday.  It is a war,  he said of such cases. His tactics in the Rajaratnam case reflected that belief. Dowd aggressively challenged the prosecution's stance on what constituted insider trading. He also fought the government's wiretaps of his client's cell phone, claiming investigators  gamed the system.  Brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6-foot-4-inch-tall Dowd would be a  ferocious defender of the president.  In a manner similar to Trump, Dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Rajaratnam case, singling out then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in particular.  He sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs,  Dowd said.  It was the most atrocious thing I've ever seen.  Dowd also went after reporters. Bharara, who declined to comment on Wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter he accused of  whoring  for the prosecution. In another encounter with the press caught on camera, Dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a CNBC reporter. Like Trump, Dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. After the Rajaratnam verdict, Dowd argued  the defense is winning  because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading.  The score is 23-14,  he told reporters. In a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys, Dowd complained of McCarthyism when his client, former Justice Department official Monica Goodling, was criticized by Democrats for invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Dowd represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s  Keating Five  banking scandal and conducted the Major League Baseball investigation that led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd would not discuss legal strategy for Trump but said the team the president had assembled was great.  We're all fighters,  he said. Though his hiring was first reported Friday, a person familiar with the matter said Dowd has been working with the team for weeks. Dowd said he knew Kasowitz partner Michael Bowe, who is also representing Trump, and met with Kasowitz at the end of May. Jay Sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on Trump's behalf. Dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. He called Trump  a fighter for the people  and said the president had done nothing wrong. A onetime military lawyer with the U.S. Marine Corps, Dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize Mueller, a Marine platoon leader during the Vietnam War.  Bobby is doing what he has to do and he'll do a good job,  said Dowd.  He's a fellow Marine and he's a good man. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-lawyer-idUSL1N1JJ1S7"},

Shares of São Paulo-based JBS gained on the news, closing 0.2 percent higher at 6.34 reais. The Batista family's involvement in the scandal has driven shares of the world's No. 1 meatpacker down 33 percent since mid-May. Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot reached a plea deal with the family, which owns 42 percent of JBS, to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme.  The testimonies in the plea deal implicated President Michel Temer, whom Joesley accused of working to obstruct a major corruption probe. JBS and BNDESPar did not have an immediate comment.

The sale is the latest capital-raising exercise by a technology startup creating its own digital currency and selling tokens to the public, a practice that has no regulatory oversight. It will be one of the most eagerly expected token sales in recent months, analysts said. Blockchain, a distributed ledger that came to prominence as the underlying technology behind digital currency bitcoin, is gaining popularity for its potential to track assets across all industries.  U.S. startup Civic sold $33 million in digital currency tokens for its identity verification project in a public sale, Reuters reported on Thursday. Block.one calls the sale of EOS a  token distribution.  The company wants EOS to be used by large businesses, enabling corporations to automate processes, monitor assets, and create multiple applications. Brock Pierce, co-founder of block.one, told Reuters that EOS aims to be the foundation for business applications in the blockchain world. The token sale will take place over a one-year period on ethereum, another blockchain-based currency, and some 1 billion tokens would be sold over 341 days starting on June 26, Pierce said. According to block.one's distribution schedule, 20 percent of the EOS tokens will be sold during the first five days of the  book opening, while 70 percent will split evenly into 350 consecutive 23-hour periods of 2 million EOS tokens each, starting on July 1. The remaining 10 percent will be reserved for block.one and cannot be traded or transferred on the ethereum network. EOS will be priced based on market demand, said Brendan Blumer, chief executive of block.one in a statement. The last blockchain platform token that went on sale was Qtum in March, which raised $15.6 million.  Blockchain Capital's Pierce said EOS could raise more than the $150 million raised by Bancor a few weeks ago. Bancor so far has raised the largest amount of capital in a token sale. Bancor enables the creation of so-called  smart tokens,  which can hold one or more tokens or digital currencies in reserve.   The goal of the EOS token sale is to make it truly democratized and provide equal access to everyone,  said Pierce.

We will continue to advocate for passage of this legislation until it becomes law,  the city's Department of Transportation said in a statement. The state Senate ended its session late on Wednesday without voting on a bill that would have allowed the city to immediately start using the so-called  design-build  delivery method for eight big projects. One of the projects is the complicated $1.9 billion renovation of an old, triple-level expressway that passes through the borough of Brooklyn. When asked about the status of that project following the failure of the bill, a city transportation said in an email that  there is an urgency to getting approval in order to know how to proceed.  On Tuesday, the state Assembly, or lower house of the legislature, had passed the legislation by a vote of 121 to 21. While most major U.S. cities and states - including New York state - can use design-build to deliver infrastructure projects, the largest U.S. city cannot. Under current law, New York City relies on traditional design-bid-build contracts. Critics say this method is more time consuming and expensive because it involves more than one contract with parties who do not communicate with each other from the very beginning of the process. Not all assembly members supported the bill because it required project labor agreements, which are contracts with organized labor unions. Those agreements have prompted opposition from general contractors, said Assemblyman Andy Goodell, a Republican whose district lies in western New York and who voted against the bill. Minority-owned firms, which are mostly non-union shops, have also been largely excluded under such agreements, he said.  I'm very concerned that we inadvertently exclude all these potential bidders by this bill,  he said.

The offering will be closely watched by the advertising and broadcasting industries as the world's largest online retailer and cloud-computing company makes its first high-profile push into live sports. Amazon is paying $50 million to the NFL to stream this season's 10 Thursday night games, sources told Reuters in April. The games will be shown simultaneously on either CBS Corp or Comcast Corp's NBC, which are broadcasting five games each. Amazon takes over from Twitter Inc, which paid $10 million to stream Thursday night games last season.  The live-streamed games will only be available to subscribers to Amazon's $99-per-year Prime service, which includes fast shipping and free video.  Streaming NFL games - regularly the most-watched events on U.S. television - is the latest move by Amazon to get customers to its website, in the hope they will subscribe to Prime and spend more online. It is also a source of revenue in its own right, although it is unclear that the sale of ads will offset the cost of acquiring the rights to stream the games.   We are offering a range of options at various price points, depending on advertiser objectives,  Amazon representative Kristin Mariani told Reuters in an email, declining to discuss specific ad prices.

Mandatory Credit: Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY SportsFor each game, Amazon can sell 10 30-second spots, one of the sources said.  The spots run on the live-stream while local ads air on network TV. Under the terms Amazon is offering, buyers also get to run ads on Amazon.com throughout the football season, which runs from September to February. National spots run by network broadcasters will also be shown on the live-stream. The move by Amazon to offer live sports online is just one of the Seattle-based online retailer's recent moves into new markets. Last week it struck a deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion, its biggest deal to date. FILE PHOTO: Employees of Amazon India are seen behind a glass bearing the company's logo inside its office in Bengaluru, India, August 14, 2015.Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File PhotoAmazon's deal with the NFL is a potential challenge to rival Netflix Inc, the world's leading video streaming company, which has so far not ventured into live sports.  It is not clear if Amazon will be able to sell the ads at the intended price, or will be able to make a profit from them. Amazon has traditionally prioritized growth into new markets over profitability and has not shied away from pouring money into new ventures if only to learn about the area.  Its pricing appears to be lower than Twitter's, which charged advertisers $2 million to $8 million for packages of ads that included the games as well as spots on NFL highlights, according to media reports.   Amazon's ad packages are higher than the $550,000 to $590,000 that NBC and CBS typically charge for their on-air national ads, according to industry sources, although Amazon is also offering ads on its website as part of the deal.  How many viewers will watch the live-streamed games on Amazon is an open question. Amazon does not publicize its number of Prime subscribers, but analysts estimate more than 50 million.  By comparison, Twitter has more than 300 million monthly users, but only a small fraction of those watched its live-streamed games last season. NBC and CBS averaged about 17 million and 14.7 million viewers for Thursday night games last season, respectively.     Advertising is a small but growing part of Amazon's $136 billion in annual revenue last year. Although the company does not disclose figures, its sponsored listings advertising business took in $1.4 billion in revenue in 2016, up seven-fold in the past four years, according to Barclays analysts.

Knopf. The book, as yet untitled, is about  the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,  Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law,  integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.   It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,  Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects.  Preet Bharara's life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,  said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a  good meeting  and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.  He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received  unusual  phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call. Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara  addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.  Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bharara's firing  remains an open question,  Bogaards said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/people-bharara-idUSL1N1JJ1C3"},

The suspect, Amor Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada, has been charged in federal court with violence at an international airport for stabbing Jeff Neville, an officer at the Bishop International Airport in Flint, in the neck on Wednesday. Neville underwent surgery and is expected to recover.   It is a good news story that we have an individual who attempted to buy a gun in the United States and was unsuccessful,  David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told reporters.  Gelios declined to provide details on where Ftouhi  attempted to buy the gun or what type of gun he tried to purchase. The 12-inch, serrated knife Ftouhi used in the attack was bought in the United States, he said.  Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Ftouhi, originally from Tunisia and who holds dual Tunisian-Canadian citizenship, legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, Gelios said. Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but Gelios declined to say why Flint was chosen.  Fouthi, who was not on the radar of U.S. or Canadian authorities before the attack, was in Michigan as early as June 18, Gelios said. U.S. and Canadian investigators are probing his travel before the attack.  Police investigators walk into the residence of Amor Ftouhi, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June 21, 2017. Ftouhi has been identified as a suspect by the FBI in the stabbing of a police officer inside the main terminal of a small airport in Flint, Michigan.Christinne MuschiU.S. officials have conducted around 20 interviews and located Ftouhi's car in the Flint airport parking lot, Gelios said. According to the criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Neville on Wednesday. In Montreal, Ftouhi lived in a modest white-brick building in a working-class neighborhood popular with North African immigrants called the Petit Maghreb.  Ftouhi has lived in the building with his wife and three children for close to six years, his landlord, Luciano Piazza, told Reuters. He worked intermittently as a truck driver, according to U.S. court records. Piazza said he does not know the family well, but has never had any problems with them.  Asked by a CTV News reporter Thursday whether Ftouhi’s arrest could fuel anti-Muslim sentiment, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said the Muslim community bears some responsibility for preventing acts of violence committed by Muslims.   You cannot disconnect this type of event, terrorism, from Islam in general,  he said.

By James Saft June 22 (Reuters) - Due to the dog’s dinner that is Brexit, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and his chief economist, Andy Haldane, are both correct in their conflicting calls on interest rates. Carney is correct; now is not the time to raise rates, and so is Haldane; a hike will be needed lest the BOE be forced to jerk rates rapidly higher. Put succinctly; a weakening pound, potentially mounting current account difficulties and a slowing economy, all either due to or made worse by Brexit, mean that no monetary policy will allow the bank to meet its mandate of maintaining price stability while supporting growth and employment. Brexit has put the BOE in an impossible position. What’s more, due to uncertainty over the negotiations and the shambolic state of Conservative policy, there is high uncertainty over the type of Brexit the economy will face. Against this backdrop, the apparent contradictions between the governor and his chief economist melt, if not into insignificance, than into a something more recognizable: a tactical muddle. Thus we have the prospect of a 4-4 split vote next month at the BOE policy meeting between hikers and those who would stand pat. Carney would then have the deciding vote, a drink out of the proverbial bitter cup. Carney in his Mansion House speech before financial leaders on Tuesday both poked fun at Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s line that Brexit would result in “having our cake and eating it” while at the same time laying out his argument for keeping rates at 0.25 percent. “From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment,” Carney said. More sobering was the list he then laid out of factors that might rescue the economy. “In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations.” None of those will be of much help. Investment will be further delayed by Brexit negotiations. Wages are unlikely to firm despite increased inflation. The economy will react to Brexit negotiations, and tighter financial conditions, with distress. Haldane’S Version Haldane, speaking a day later, looks at the same data and comes to a seemingly different conclusion. “If policy tightened 'too late,' this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later, contrary to the MPC’s collective expectation that Bank Rate would increase ‘at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,’” Haldane said. He added that he saw withdrawing last year’s 25 bps point cut “relatively soon.” The big risk here is a rapid sterling weakening driven by a deteriorating current account situation combined with a sudden lack of confidence as Brexit negotiations show up the UK’s true vulnerabilities. Haldane may be worrying not just about inflation expectations shifting upward as inflation, already at a four-year high of 2.9 percent, pushes higher, but something more sudden and harder to control. Carney spent much of the guts of his speech discussing the UK current account deficit, a section punctuated with the following warning: “From the Lawson boom to the Tequila and Global Financial Crises, a common lesson is that large current account deficits are one of the most trenchant early warning signs of financial instability,“ Carney said. “The UK relies on the kindness of strangers at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased.” Carl Weinberg, of High Frequency Economics, also notes the relationship between investment into the UK, funding the current account gap, much of which comes from the Middle East and Russia, and the price of oil. The latest downturn in energy prices, coming as Brexit negotiations begin, is badly timed and may cause an important source of capital to dry up at a very difficult time. Haldane and Carney are thus both right, though not necessarily in agreement. A rate rise now would be destructive at a time of a consumer slowdown. We may well be discussing recession in Britain in several months. At the same time, and this is especially true if Conservatives forge ahead with a “hard” Brexit, the BOE may want to begin raising rates soon, painful as that will be, to shore up the pound. That may well not work, but that is the position, and not one the BOE made. At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

Five or six years ago, funds weren't specifically targeting renewable investment; today it's a key component of infrastructure investment,  said David Giordano, managing director and head of North American, Latin American and Asia Pacific investments at BlackRock, on the sidelines of the Renewable Energy Finance Forum in New York.  Giordano, who is also a board member of the American Council on Renewable Energy, which put on the forum, said renewable energy was no longer considered a niche.  BlackRock's renewable infrastructure investment platform, launched in 2012 by Giordano's team, now manages more than $4 billion in client assets, mostly in wind and solar projects. Strong interest in green energy comes as Trump is championing fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers. Trump’s administration, however, has made no moves to target federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects, which have helped make the technologies more competitive with traditional fuels like coal and natural gas, thanks mainly to bipartisan support in Congress.  Even without federal government involvement, executives noted that U.S. cities, states and corporations appear committed to renewable energy, as do most other countries. This should help projects attract capital in an era of low interest rates.  We have seen considerable interest from a wide range of investor classes, including infrastructure funds, insurance companies, pension funds, money managers and corporations,  said Raymond Wood, managing director and global head of power and renewables at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N). Major U.S. corporations such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) have become some of America’s biggest buyers of renewable energy in recent years, according to industry figures reviewed by Reuters.

President Donald Trump has called for eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, where the loans of borrowers working for government, non-profits or the military are wiped out after 10 years of consistent payments. The program started in 2007, making this the first year of forgiveness for many loans. The report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found cases where servicers did not provide information or gave wrong or confusing information, leading borrowers to believe they would receive forgiveness when in truth they were not eligible. Some borrowers were not told their loans were not part of the program, their repayment plans were wrong, or their employers were not considered a public service, according to the CFPB.  Also, some servicers under-recorded qualifying payments or did not tell borrowers that loan consolidations wipe out payment histories, pushing forgiveness farther into the future. The Education Department, which contracts servicers, did not respond to a request for comment. CFBP Student Loan Ombudsman Seth Frotman said agency examiners are asking servicers about issues that the report identified to help prevent future problems. Once deemed eligible, the loans transfer to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) for servicing. Many students encounter glitches and delays from their previous servicer then, CFPB found. PHEAA referred reporters to the Education Department.  The program allows borrowers to move out from under the shadows of debt, said Frotman, adding that many plan to save for homes or their children's education after their loans end.   More than 430,000 people are enrolled in the program and nearly 30 percent owe more than $100,000, data shows. The CFPB said that around two-thirds of those at least wanting to enroll earn less than $50,000 a year. Seeking to make college affordable, then-President Barack Obama moved the country's $1.4 trillion student loans from banks to the government. He also expanded the public-sector program so that graduates would not be discouraged by large loan payments from taking often low-paying jobs that serve the community. Critics say the program is too broad and generous, keeping taxpayers from recouping millions of loaned dollars. Trump and fellow Republicans frequently say government should  get out of the business of student loans.

Opposition legislators this month publicly chided Nomura for participating along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a $2.9 billion bond operation that helped the government of President Nicolas Maduro bolster the country's flagging foreign currency reserves.  The talks revolve around $710 million in securities known as credit-linked notes that were issued by Nomura to Venezuela in 2008, according to the finance industry source, as a way for the then-prosperous OPEC member country to invest its plentiful oil revenue. Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, is willing to sell the notes back to Nomura at a discount before the notes mature.  Nomura is buying back notes that are held by the central bank,  opposition legislator Angel Alvarado, who is part of a broad effort to pressure global banks not to provide financing to Venezuela, told Reuters.  The government is continuing with its desperate strategy of selling off assets because its cash-flow limitations.  Nomura declined to comment. Venezuela's Central Bank Governor Ricardo Sanguino said it was not in negotiations with Nomura.  That is false, we are not doing it,  Sanguino told Reuters after a news conference.  No central bank reveals its strategies.  Venezuela has recently negotiated such deals through intermediaries. One of the notes has a face value of $390 million and matures at the end of 2018 while the other, with a face value of $320 million, matures in 2023, according to the finance industry source, who asked not to be identified.  The deal could be closed as early as next week,  said the source, who asked not to be identified. The notes form part of a central bank portfolio of securities that have a combined total of $2.5 billion that Venezuela hopes to use to raise funds through operations with Wall Street, the source said. Opposition Seeks Investigations Nomura in May bought $100 million in bonds issued by state oil company PDVSA at a discount of almost 70 percent, while Goldman Sachs acquired another $2.8 billion on similar terms. The bonds were issued in 2014 but remained on the central bank's books without being sold until May. Alvarado on Thursday published letters by Congress chief Julio Borges to U.S. regulatory agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asking for a probe into Nomura and Goldman for the May bond operation. The letter says that two intermediaries were involved in the operation - Commonwealth Bank of the Caribbean island of Dominica and London-based brokerage Dinosaur.  The pricing and spread paid by each institution to Dinosaur suggest price fixing and above-market commissions,  read the letters.  We believe there is enough evidence to open an investigation against Goldman Sachs and Nomura.  Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the calls for an investigation. Nomura and the SEC declined to comment on the probe. Following the uproar over its purchase of PDVSA bonds in May, Goldman issued a statement that cited the presence of an intermediary in the operation, noting that it therefore did not directly do business with the Venezuelan government. Borges' letters describes this argument as  subterfuge  because neither institution has the financial resources for such an operation. Venezuela's debt burden has taken a heavy toll on the population as foreign currency needed to import food medicine and raw material for factories is being set aside to pay bondholders. The country's yields are among the highest in the world due to investor concern about default.

As his chief of staff read out the names for vacant portfolios including defense, justice and European affairs, the reaction of many French was: who? It was unusual in a country where politics has long been perceived as the preserve of an old boys network, where political careers begin at an elite school for civil servants and last decades. And it pointed to Macron's inclination to run government more like a business. Among the picks were Nicole Belloubet, a 62-year-old public law expert and member of the Constitutional Court, as justice minister. Florence Parly, who spent the last 15 years working among the senior ranks of Air France and the SNCF state-owned rail company, became defense minister. Neither are household names.  You have a president and a prime minister who both have corporate backgrounds, and who want to ensure that people are appointed on the basis of their competences,  said a Macron adviser. Macron spent four years at Rothschild bank before entering politics, while his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, a lawyer, worked for nuclear giant Areva. The adviser said Macron also wanted to avoid competition between ministers and their junior secretaries of state - something he experienced himself as economy minister under Socialist President Francois Hollande - which is why he had not given precise portfolios to many of them.

Slideshow (12 Images)Heavyweight names from the Socialists and conservatives swirled, but in the end Macron largely picked relative unknowns, technocrats or private sector figures with either little or distant political experience.  Daily newspaper Le Monde described the reshuffle as  a good way for the head of state to give himself even more freedom to act . Macron won a commanding majority in Sunday's parliamentary election with which to push through the deep-reaching social and economic reforms that he promises to revive France's regulation-laden economy. Philippe told TF1 his new government is one that  brings together , a reference to the inclusion of members from the left, the right and the center. On Thursday Philippe's government spokesman fended off questions over the suitability of businesswoman Parly - who served as junior budget minister under socialist Lionel Jospin from 2000-2002 - to head the defense ministry. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters that what counted was her managerial background.  She's a manager who has proven herself,  he said.  To have someone with that quality is a strength.

Opposition legislators this month publicly chided Nomura for participating along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a $2.9 billion bond operation that helped the government of President Nicolas Maduro bolster the country's flagging foreign currency reserves.  The talks revolve around $710 million in securities known as credit-linked notes that were issued by Nomura to Venezuela in 2008, according to the finance industry source, as a way for the then-prosperous OPEC member country to invest its plentiful oil revenue. Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, is willing to sell the notes back to Nomura at a discount before the notes mature.  Nomura is buying back notes that are held by the central bank,  opposition legislator Angel Alvarado, who is part of a broad effort to pressure global banks not to provide financing to Venezuela, told Reuters.  The government is continuing with its desperate strategy of selling off assets because its cash-flow limitations.  Nomura declined to comment. Venezuela's Central Bank Governor Ricardo Sanguino said it was not in negotiations with Nomura.  That is false, we are not doing it,  Sanguino told Reuters after a news conference.  No central bank reveals its strategies.  Venezuela has recently negotiated such deals through intermediaries. One of the notes has a face value of $390 million and matures at the end of 2018 while the other, with a face value of $320 million, matures in 2023, according to the finance industry source, who asked not to be identified.  The deal could be closed as early as next week,  said the source, who asked not to be identified. The notes form part of a central bank portfolio of securities that have a combined total of $2.5 billion that Venezuela hopes to use to raise funds through operations with Wall Street, the source said. Opposition Seeks Investigations Nomura in May bought $100 million in bonds issued by state oil company PDVSA at a discount of almost 70 percent, while Goldman Sachs acquired another $2.8 billion on similar terms. The bonds were issued in 2014 but remained on the central bank's books without being sold until May. Alvarado on Thursday published letters by Congress chief Julio Borges to U.S. regulatory agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asking for a probe into Nomura and Goldman for the May bond operation. The letter says that two intermediaries were involved in the operation - Commonwealth Bank of the Caribbean island of Dominica and London-based brokerage Dinosaur.  The pricing and spread paid by each institution to Dinosaur suggest price fixing and above-market commissions,  read the letters.  We believe there is enough evidence to open an investigation against Goldman Sachs and Nomura.  Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the calls for an investigation. Nomura and the SEC declined to comment on the probe. Following the uproar over its purchase of PDVSA bonds in May, Goldman issued a statement that cited the presence of an intermediary in the operation, noting that it therefore did not directly do business with the Venezuelan government. Borges' letters describes this argument as  subterfuge  because neither institution has the financial resources for such an operation. Venezuela's debt burden has taken a heavy toll on the population as foreign currency needed to import food medicine and raw material for factories is being set aside to pay bondholders. The country's yields are among the highest in the world due to investor concern about default. Maduro says default concerns are the product of a smear campaign by adversaries and insists the country will honor its obligations.

Dropping federal protection of Yellowstone's grizzlies, formally proposed in March 2016 under the Obama administration, was based on the agency's findings that the bears' numbers have rebounded sufficiently in recent decades. The estimated tally of grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone region, encompassing parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, has grown to roughly 700 today, up from as few as 136 bears in 1975 when they were formally listed as a threatened species through the lower 48 states. At that time, the grizzly had been hunted, trapped and poisoned to near extinction. Its current population well exceeds the government's minimum recovery goal of 500 animals in the region. Lifting the bears' protected status will open them to trophy hunting outside the boundaries of Yellowstone park as grizzly oversight is turned over to state wildlife managers in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Ranchers, who make up a powerful political constituency in Western states, have strongly advocated delisting grizzlies,  arguing the bears' growing numbers pose a threat to humans and livestock. Agitation for state management of grizzlies has also come from hunters, who highly prize them as trophy animals. Environmentalists say that while grizzlies have made a comeback, their recovery could falter without federal safeguards. They point to the fact that a key food source for the bears, whitebark pine nuts, may be on the decline from climate change.  The grizzly fight is on. We'll stop any attempt to delist Yellowstone's grizzlies,  the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center said in a Twitter post.  We anticipate going to court to challenge this premature, deeply concerning decision,  said Bethany Cotton, wildlife program director for the conservation group WildEarth Guardians. FILE PHOTO - A grizzly bear and her two cubs approach the carcass of a bison in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, U.S. on July 6, 2015.Jim Urquhart/File PhotoNative American tribes, which revere the grizzly, also have opposed stripping the bear of federal protection. Zinke, a former Montana congressman, said the final delisting rule by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be published  in coming days  and go into effect 30 days later. He hailed the move as marking  one of America's great conservation successes.  Population studies show grizzly bears have more than doubled their range since the mid-1970s, occupying more than 22,500 square miles (58,275 sq km) of the Yellowstone ecosystem, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. That area is larger than the land mass of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, combined, the agency said. Despite those gains, the grizzly is found in only about 2 percent of its original range in the lower 48 states. For the Yellowstone region, the scope and quality of bear habitat, regulatory mechanisms developed over the years and the existing balance of male and female bears should allow the states to maintain a viable, long-term grizzly population number in the high-600s to low-700s, agency officials said in March when delisting was proposed. Yelowstone's grizzlies were briefly removed from protected status in 2007 but were re-listed after environmentalists sued, asserting the government had failed to account for such factors as climate change. A joint federal-state committee of wildlife manager recommended de-listing again in 2012. The rule will not affect four other smaller federally protected grizzly populations in parts of Montana, Idaho and Washington state. A much larger population in Alaska remains unlisted.

Shares in Home Capital (HGC.TO) closed up 27 percent on Thursday.  Shares in other Canadian alternative lenders also rose on Thursday. Equitable Group Inc (EQB.TO) closed up 12.5 percent. Street Capital Group (SCB.TO) closed up 8.3 percent. Shares in mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada Inc (MIC.TO) were up 11.5 percent. The deal may bring to a close a two-month effort by Home Capital's board, and advisers RBC Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets, to replace a costly credit facility with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) and shore up the lender's balance sheet.  The credit facility was arranged earlier to provide   funding for Canada's largest non-bank lender which had suffered from the withdrawal of 95 percent of its high interest deposits in the past two months. Alan Hibben, a former Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) executive who was recruited to the Home Capital board last month, said over 70 parties had expressed interest in investing in the lender. In an interview, Hibben said Home Capital was drawn to Berkshire Hathaway because of Buffet's credibility with both investors and depositors.  The board decided it would be nice for a sponsor to give us a view where somebody could say 'wow, if that smart person thinks the Home Capital business model and portfolios are good, I'm going to think that',  he said. Hibben said Buffett had become involved  later in the process  with Home Capital approaching Berkshire Hathaway rather than the other way round. Home Capital has played an important role in Canada's mortgage market, lending to new immigrants and self-employed workers who may not be able to get loans from the country's biggest banks.  Related Coverage'Bailout' Buffett burnishes 'lender of last resort' imageBut home prices in Toronto and Vancouver have fallen after the government introduced measures to cool overheating prices with household debt in Canada has reaching record levels. Investors are wondering whether the deal will be as successful as Buffett's decidedly bigger deal to buy Goldman Sachs (GS.N) preferred shares during the global financial crisis in 2008. “Home Capital’s strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,” said Berkshire's chairman Warren Buffett, in a statement on the deal released by Home Capital on Thursday.  Short Seller Not Convinced Short sellers are continuing to take positions in Home Capital though, aiming to profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.  Combined short interest in the company's Canadian and U.S.-listed shares (HMCBF.PK) stands at about $183 million, up $62 million this month, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Marc Cohodes, a short seller who has been betting against Home Capital for two years, said on Thursday he continued to do so.   If it wasn't Warren Buffett's name, the stock would be way, way way, down today,  he said in an interview.  Home Capital was forced to raise new capital after depositors rushed to withdraw funds from its high-interest savings accounts. They pulled 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high-interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Officer Martin Reid. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada's biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital reached a settlement with the commission last week and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about mortgage underwriting problems.  The 'endorsement' from Warren Buffet may prove to rehabilitate depositor confidence, thus turning deposit flow positive,  said National Bank of Canada analyst Jaeme Gloyn. The Berkshire credit agreement comes with an interest rate of 9.0 percent, with a standby fee on funds not drawn down of 1.0 percent, compared with 2.5 percent previously.  The facility will be in place for a year after which Hibben said the company will assess if it still needs a facility of that size.  That's an awfully big number for a small bank like ours, particularly as we're going to hold likely a billion dollars of cash,  he said. Home Capital on Tuesday said it would sell a commercial mortgage book, raising close to C$1.2 billion in a deal expected to complete in the third quarter.  Berkshire Hathaway will also take a 38.4 percent stake in the company after buying $400 million worth of Home Capital stock.  It will make an initial investment of C$153 million to buy a 20 percent stake. The price is a 15 percent discount to the average share price prior to Berkshire's final proposal on June 13 and a 33 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price. The rest of the shares will be acquired at C$10.30 in a deal that still needs shareholder approval. Buffett has not been especially active in Canada in recent years. He was a shareholder in oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) but sold the stake in 2016.

Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO) said it intends to switch its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains in the United States and Canada to chicken raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine by the end of 2018.  The company, which bought Popeyes Louisiana Chicken this year, said it intends to apply the new policy to all brands over time. It did not share additional details about the new antibiotic rules. Human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23,000 Americans each year, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many infection-related deaths are going uncounted. Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Medical researchers have concerns that overuse of those drugs on farms may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. As You Sow, a non-profit shareholder advocacy group, withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for reduced antibiotic use in Restaurant Brands' meat supply following its commitment on chicken.

The suspect, Amor Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada, has been charged in federal court with violence at an international airport for stabbing Jeff Neville, an officer at the Bishop International Airport in Flint, in the neck on Wednesday. Neville underwent surgery and is expected to recover.   It is a good news story that we have an individual who attempted to buy a gun in the United States and was unsuccessful,  David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told reporters.  Gelios declined to provide details on where Ftouhi  attempted to buy the gun or what type of gun he tried to purchase. The 12-inch, serrated knife Ftouhi used in the attack was bought in the United States, he said.  Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Ftouhi, originally from Tunisia and who holds dual Tunisian-Canadian citizenship, legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, Gelios said. Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but Gelios declined to say why Flint was chosen.  Fouthi, who was not on the radar of U.S. or Canadian authorities before the attack, was in Michigan as early as June 18, Gelios said. U.S. and Canadian investigators are probing his travel before the attack.  Police investigators walk into the residence of Amor Ftouhi, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, June 21, 2017. Ftouhi has been identified as a suspect by the FBI in the stabbing of a police officer inside the main terminal of a small airport in Flint, Michigan.Christinne MuschiU.S. officials have conducted around 20 interviews and located Ftouhi's car in the Flint airport parking lot, Gelios said. According to the criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Neville on Wednesday. In Montreal, Ftouhi lived in a modest white-brick building in a working-class neighborhood popular with North African immigrants called the Petit Maghreb.  Ftouhi has lived in the building with his wife and three children for close to six years, his landlord, Luciano Piazza, told Reuters. He worked intermittently as a truck driver, according to U.S. court records. Piazza said he does not know the family well, but has never had any problems with them.  Asked by a CTV News reporter Thursday whether Ftouhi’s arrest could fuel anti-Muslim sentiment, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said the Muslim community bears some responsibility for preventing acts of violence committed by Muslims.

Antonio Israel Ibarra, the secretary of the National Drugs Commission, gave no specific figures for comparison but said Cuba had seized triple the amount of drugs from traffickers so far in 2017 compared with the same period last year. He said the Communist-run country would not be joining countries in the region that have legalized cannabis for medicinal or recreational purposes.  Cuba is facing a very difficult situation at the moment with regards to drug trafficking,  Ibarra said at a news conference.  Firstly because in Latin America and the Caribbean, there is a group of countries trying to legalize, or that has legalized, the use of marijuana.  We have not legalized it, nor will we.  Cuba Drugs National Commission Secretary Antonio Ibarra speaks during a news conference in Havana, Cuba, June 22, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniIbarra said another reason for the higher seizure rate of drugs was that criminal bands that used to smuggle people were reorganizing themselves to traffic drugs, now that the United States no longer offers Cubans special immigration treatment. The United States in January ended its longstanding policy of admitting Cubans who set foot on U.S. soil. Cuba had said that policy encouraged its citizens to undertake dangerous voyages on the high seas and put their lives in the hands of traffickers. Ibarra said the United States and Cuba continued to cooperate on drug trafficking issues, within the framework agreed upon last year and despite a fresh chill in U.S.-Cuban relations under President Donald Trump. He said there had been no high-level meetings on the matter since Trump took office in late January. Trump last week announced a partial rollback in the U.S.-Cuban detente initiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.  This agreement foresees two high-level meetings per year,  Ibarra said.  Since Trump's government took office, the first meeting corresponding to the first half of the year has not taken place.  We hope, for the good of both countries, that the United States will not renounce collaboration.

Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO) said it intends to switch its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains in the United States and Canada to chicken raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine by the end of 2018.  The company, which bought Popeyes Louisiana Chicken this year, said it intends to apply the new policy to all brands over time. It did not share additional details about the new antibiotic rules. Human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23,000 Americans each year, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many infection-related deaths are going uncounted. Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Medical researchers have concerns that overuse of those drugs on farms may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. As You Sow, a non-profit shareholder advocacy group, withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for reduced antibiotic use in Restaurant Brands' meat supply following its commitment on chicken.

McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Wendy's Co (WEN.O), KFC (YUM.N) and Chick-fil-A are among the companies that have made commitments to reduce the use of antibiotics in the poultry they buy. Activists on Thursday also stepped up pressure on Sanderson Farms Inc (SAFM.O), the only major supplier that has not committed to limit use of medically important antibiotics in its chicken production.  The Organic Consumers Association and other groups sued Sanderson in federal court in Northern California over its  claim that its chicken products are  100 percent natural.   The lawsuit alleged that government tests of finished Sanderson products found residues of drugs such as ketamine, an animal anesthetic dubbed  Special K  by recreational drug users, and human antibiotics including chloramphenicol, which is not approved for use in animals raised to become food.   Mike Cockrell, Sanderson's chief financial officer, said the company does not use the antibiotics or other drugs and chemicals mentioned in the lawsuit and that it will launch a  vigorous  defense.

The request came in a resolution adopted with 94 votes in favor, 15 against and 65 abstentions. The Hague-based court is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Britain has overseen the region since 1814 and in 1965 detached the Chagos islands from Mauritius, a colony that gained independence three years later, to create the British Indian Ocean Territory. It leased the archipelago's biggest island, Diego Garcia, to the United States in 1966, paving the way for construction of an airbase that required the forced removal of some 2,000 people.  Diego Garcia became an important U.S. base during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, acting as a launch pad for long-range bombers. The U.S. lease lasts until 2036. The United States joined Britain in voting against the resolution. The General Assembly resolution requested the International Court of Justice to advise on whether the process of decolonizing Mauritius was lawfully completed, following the separation of the islands. It also asked the court to advise on the  consequences under international law ... arising from the continued administration by (Britain) of the Chagos Archipelago, including with respect to the inability of Mauritius to implement a program for the resettlement on the Chagos Archipelago of its nationals, in particular those of Chagossian origin.  Mauritius Minister Mentor Anerood Jugnauth told the General Assembly that  Mauritius, prior to its independence in 1968, had no legal competence, as a state, to give any consent to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago from its territory.  At the time of the separation, Britain paid Mauritius $3.8 million and pledged to cede the islands when they were no longer needed for defense purposes.  British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the issue should be discussed bilaterally and there was no need for an International Court of Justice opinion. He said Britain and Mauritius had held three rounds of talks since September.  The Mauritian focus throughout the talks has not been the Chagossians, but Mauritius' claim for sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago,  he said.  The islanders who were moved were taken to Mauritius and the Seychelles and many eventually settled in southern England. The British Foreign Office said in November the government had decided against a resettlement in Chagos.

I will tell you that we are investigating this incident today that happened at about 9:45 this morning as an act of terrorism,  David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the FBI, told reporters outside Bishop International Airport.  The U.S. Department of Justice identified the suspect as Amor M. Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada. Ftouhi legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, Gelios said.  According to a criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic   Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Lieutenant Jeff Neville of the airport's Department of Public Safety.  Neville was in satisfactory condition after undergoing surgery and expected to fully recover, police said.  When the subject went up to the officer and stabbed him, he continued to exclaim 'Allah' and made a statement, something to the effect of 'You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are all going to die,  Gelios said.  Ftouhi has been charged with violence at an international airport, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Gelios said other charges could be lodged against Ftouhi. U.S. officials, who have questioned Ftouhi, currently believe he acted alone and was not part of a larger plot, Gelios said.   Suffice it to say, he has a hatred for the United States,  Gelios said of Ftouhi.  Gelios described the weapon as a 12-inch knife with an 8-inch serrated blade. Ftouhi was a  lone wolf attacker,  he said.  Amor Ftouhi, arrested in connection with the stabbing of a police officer at Bishop International Airport in Flint, Michigan, is shown in this photo released by the FBI in Flint, Michigan, U.S., June 22, 2017. FBI/Handout via REUTERSIt took four people to subdue Ftouhi, including the officer he stabbed and a nearby maintenance worker, said Chris Miller, the airport's director of public safety. Miller and another officer also assisted. According to the criminal complaint, after he was subdued  Ftouhi asked why he had not been killed. The airport was evacuated and there were no other injuries. It reopened on Wednesday evening. A small regional airport, it has, on average, 16 commercial flights arriving or departing each day, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Slideshow (7 Images)Officials in the United States and Canada condemned the attack and said that agencies in both countries would work together to investigate the incident.   Any attack on someone who serves and protects our citizens will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, adding that he had spoken with FBI officials about the attack. Canada's Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the attack  heinous and cowardly.    We will do everything we possibly can to assist in this matter,  Goodale told reporters. Police in Montreal went to an apartment building in the city’s Saint Michel area on Wednesday in connection with the stabbing, according to Radio-Canada, the French-language arm of Canada’s public broadcaster.  Radio-Canada reported that police questioned three people but did not search the apartment.  Police were guarding the entrance and rear doorway of the four-story building in Saint Michel, a lower income neighborhood with a large immigrant population, according to a Reuters eyewitness. A small crowd had gathered across the street.  Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not immediately return Reuters requests for comment.

Beijing has promised to draw up new policies and set up a dedicated fund to deal with large stretches of polluted soil caused by overmining, industrial wastewater runoffs or excessive pesticide and fertiliser use.  But it said in an action plan published last year that it would aim to  stabilize  worsening soil pollution by the end of this decade and only start to make improvements by 2030.       Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday, Qiu Qiwen, head of the soil environment department of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), said the cost of cleaning up one mu (0.066 hectares) of polluted farmland in China could reach as much as 20,000 yuan ($2,928.86). According to the last nationwide survey published in 2013, about 50 million mu (3.33 million hectares) of China's farmland - an area the size of Belgium - was too polluted to grow crops. That would put total clean-up costs at 1 trillion yuan.       Soil pollution does not form overnight and the problem cannot be solved overnight,  said Qiu, adding that China  must have patience to fight the long war ahead . Workers row boats as they remove green algae in Qingdao, Shandong province, China June 21, 2017.StringerAnalysts say China's soil clean-up will provide lucrative business opportunities for a growing number of specialist environmental firms, but it is still unclear who will foot the bill, especially in the countryside. Qiu said Beijing has already allocated a budget of 14.6 billion yuan to cover nationwide soil remediation projects from last year until the end of the first half of 2017.  One firm already benefiting from that fund is Beijing Geoenviron Engineering & Technology, which said last month that a 121.9 million yuan project in southwest China to remediate soil contaminated by heavy metals would be financed by the government.     Treating and recovering polluted soil is very difficult and costly, and requires a long cycle,  Qiu said.  He said China would publish the results of its latest survey on soil pollution after 2020. It will also identify polluted farmland and assess its impact on the quality of agricultural products by the end of next year.  Some of the measures being considered to clean up China's soil include rotating crops and turning farmland into forest, Qiu said.

The legislation met a wall of opposition from Democrats and initial skepticism among some Republicans, leaving Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell a narrow path to passage. The bill would roll back an expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled over three years, cut its federal funding beginning in 2025, restructure Obamacare's tax credits for low-income Americans, and repeal several taxes. To pass the bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes. The Senate is comprised of 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats (In the event of a deadlocked vote, Republican Vice President can vote to break the tie.) Several Republicans on Thursday expressed reservations or opposition to the bill: Opposed Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah said in a joint statement:  We are not ready to vote for this bill. ... There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.  The four said they were open to negotiation, with Cruz saying in a separate statement that he wants to  get to yes.  Supportive Richard Burr of North Carolina said outside the Senate:  I'm supportive of it. I think it strikes a balance.  He added that the blueprint  can still be amended and probably will.  Three members of the Senate Republican leadership - John Cornyn of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota, and John Barrasso of Wyoming - all put out supportive statements, saying the bill would help improve the affordability of healthcare. Barrasso said the bill was not perfect, and  we will be working to improve on this draft.  Undecided - Leaning Yes Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania said he was  still studying it but it strikes me as a good first step in what will be an ongoing process of fulfilling a commitment we made to the American people.  Richard Shelby of Alabama:  We're looking at it. My plan is to support the thrust of the bill. If it’s a good bill overall, I'm going to support it.  Lamar Alexander of Tennessee listed a number of benefits for his constituents in the draft, including that it makes no change in Medicare benefits.  I'm going to stay focused on it next week as the bill goes to the Senate floor ... and my focus will be on how it affects Tennesseans.  Undecided Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia:  I will review the draft legislation released this morning ... to evaluate whether it provides access to affordable health care for West Virginians.  Bill Cassidy of Louisiana:  I'm undecided. I have to read the text.  Marco Rubio of Florida said he will  decide how to vote on health care on the basis of how it impacts Florida.  Dean Heller of Nevada said he had  serious concerns  about the bill's impact on Medicaid in his state. Susan Collins of Maine said it was  too soon  to judge the bill and she has some concerns about cuts to Medicaid after 2025 and defunding of Planned Parenthood. Rob Portman of Ohio said in a statement that he continued to have  real concerns  about the Medicaid policies in the bill, especially those that affect drug treatment. He said his decision will depend on what is in the final version of the bill. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said,  I'm going to read it.  James Risch of Idaho:  It’s a work in progress. Ask me again when we see the final product.  John McCain of Arizona said he is reading the bill.  It’s a big thing, we just found out about it. I am just waiting until I can absorb the entire bill.  Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a statement that any replacement plan must be a net improvement over Obamacare, and he would be  reviewing the draft legislation over the next several days.  No Comment Tom Cotton of Arkansas said,  no comment.

They argue the Whole Foods acquisition will give Amazon an unfair advantage over traditional grocers and new players that might emerge in the market, potentially grounds for the deal to be blocked for antitrust reasons.   As a matter of policy, should this be blocked? ...There should be a challenge to this because there should be a strong presumption against growth by acquisition and in fact there is supposed to be such a presumption in our law. It's what Congress intended,  said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. Amazon declined comment. Sagers and other critics urge regulators to prevent dominant firms from buying a major foothold in an adjacent industry. Founded as a bookseller in 1994 and now the world's biggest online retailer that sells everything from paper towels to designer clothing, Amazon sent grocery stocks into a tailspin Friday when it announced it planned to buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Critics believe Amazon's strengths in logistics, its scale and leverage with suppliers could enable it to dominate groceries as it did with bookselling.     Antitrust experts who represent deals being reviewed by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission said the  transaction will be approved because Amazon sells few groceries and Whole Foods is a minnow in the grocery market with 444 U.S. stores compared with 4,692 for Wal-Mart (WMT.N).  U.S. antitrust enforcement has generally looked favorably on deals that reduce consumer prices, and Amazon supporters contend the deal will be good for consumers.    The drop in grocer share prices the day the deal was announced - No. 1 U.S. grocer Kroger fell more than 9 percent - demonstrates the threat investors feel Amazon poses to traditional grocery chains.  Competitors can be expected not to like a merger that puts more pressure on them. If their share price goes down, it's a sign they'll be under more competitive pressure,  said Alden Abbott, antitrust expert at the Heritage Foundation. Amazon was accused of crippling book retailers like Borders in part through price cutting. At $480 billion, Amazon's market value equals 90 percent of all the stocks in the S&P; 1500 food and staples index, which includes Walmart. Sagers argues, however, that it would be legal for Amazon to independently develop its grocery sales rather than leapfrog ahead through acquisition.    A Republican former antitrust enforcer, who asked not to be named to protect business relationships, agreed.  The notion of leveraging your power in market A to enter into market B has a been around for a long time as a basis for enforcement,  the ex-enforcer said.   Precedents in Microsoft, Comcast   When the Justice Department sued Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in 1998 the lawsuit was aimed at stopping it from using its dominance of the operating system market to also dominate browser software. Similarly, when the government allowed Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to buy NBC Universal Inc in 2011, it tried to ensure Comcast would not interfere with the development of cable's online competitors. Some deal experts warn the proposed transaction could hurt companies that supply a combined Amazon and Whole Foods with organic flour, milk and other goods. Excessive  buyer power  worried Darren Bush, a veteran of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division who teaches at the University of Houston's Law Center.  Bush said Amazon's success in offering a massive array of products at low prices masks a business model that succeeds by pushing producer prices down. Food producers could soon face the sort of pressure that booksellers faced from Amazon, which for example removed the  buy  button in 2010 from books sold by a publisher it was embroiled in a dispute with. Historically, changes in the economy - say from horse and buggies to cars - has always led to anxiety as corporate giants fall into decline to be replaced by dynamic upstarts, said Herb Hovenkamp, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.  I always take the long view of these things. Over time, we have always had these big firms that somebody said, 'We have to do something about these guys,'  said Hovenkamp.  Businesses cycle in and cycle out. There's no question in my mind that this will happen to Amazon.

President Donald Trump has called for eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, where the loans of borrowers working for government, non-profits or the military are wiped out after 10 years of consistent payments. The program started in 2007, making this the first year of forgiveness for many loans. The report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found cases where servicers did not provide information or gave wrong or confusing information, leading borrowers to believe they would receive forgiveness when in truth they were not eligible. Some borrowers were not told their loans were not part of the program, their repayment plans were wrong, or their employers were not considered a public service, according to the CFPB.  Also, some servicers under-recorded qualifying payments or did not tell borrowers that loan consolidations wipe out payment histories, pushing forgiveness farther into the future. The Education Department, which contracts servicers, did not respond to a request for comment. CFBP Student Loan Ombudsman Seth Frotman said agency examiners are asking servicers about issues that the report identified to help prevent future problems. Once deemed eligible, the loans transfer to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) for servicing. Many students encounter glitches and delays from their previous servicer then, CFPB found. PHEAA referred reporters to the Education Department.  The program allows borrowers to move out from under the shadows of debt, said Frotman, adding that many plan to save for homes or their children's education after their loans end.   More than 430,000 people are enrolled in the program and nearly 30 percent owe more than $100,000, data shows. The CFPB said that around two-thirds of those at least wanting to enroll earn less than $50,000 a year. Seeking to make college affordable, then-President Barack Obama moved the country's $1.4 trillion student loans from banks to the government. He also expanded the public-sector program so that graduates would not be discouraged by large loan payments from taking often low-paying jobs that serve the community. Critics say the program is too broad and generous, keeping taxpayers from recouping millions of loaned dollars. Trump and fellow Republicans frequently say government should  get out of the business of student loans.

Edgar Welch, 29, pleaded guilty in March to charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition in relation to the Dec. 4 incident at the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in northwest Washington. Welch, of Salisbury, North Carolina, told authorities he had been trying to investigate an online conspiracy theory, known as  Pizzagate,  that claimed the eatery was a front for a pedophile ring led by then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,  Welch said in a defense sentencing memo in which he asked for an 18-month sentence. An evidence photo shows a handgun in the trial of Edgar Welch, 29, of Salisbury, North Carolina, who wielded an assault rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria after a fake online    Pizzagate  report that it was a cover for a child abuse ring in Washington, D.C., U.S. on December 4, 2016, in this image released on June 22, 2017. Courtesy U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia/Handout via REUTERSJudge Ketanji Brown Jackson said during the sentencing that it had been  sheer luck  no one was hurt and that the extent of the recklessness in the case was  breathtaking,  according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Welch was armed with an AR-15 rifle loaded with 29 rounds of ammunition, as well as a loaded revolver, when he marched into the restaurant and pointed a weapon at an employee and then fired multiple rounds into a door, prosecutors said. Slideshow (2 Images)Customers and employees fled the scene and no one was hurt. Welsh was arrested outside the restaurant, and a shotgun and more ammunition were found in his car, prosecutors said. The attack was widely seen at the time as an example of how fake news reports that proliferated on the internet during the 2016 election could have a real-world impact on people's lives.  According to court documents, Welch had binge-watched YouTube videos about the alleged child-trafficking ring on Dec. 1 before deciding on his plan to invade the pizzeria.

The administration of President Donald Trump said last month it was vastly expanding the scope of a policy blocking U.S. assistance to foreign groups that perform or provide information about abortions. U.S. First Secretary to the U.N. in Geneva Jason Mack said, after a resolution from Canada on eliminating violence against women was adopted by consensus, that the U.S.  must dissociate from the consensus  specifically on access to safe abortions.  We do not recognize abortion as a method of family planning, nor do we support abortion in our reproductive health assistance,  he said in a statement read to the Council. Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., gave formal notice this month that the Trump administration is reviewing its participation in the forum and called for reforms to eliminate what she called its  chronic anti-Israel bias . The Council said women and girls are at higher risk of sexual violence in wars and post-conflict situations and require access to health care, psychosocial support and legal aid. It said all women should have access to  comprehensive sexual and health-care services  including modern contraception, prevention programmes for adolescent pregnancy, and  safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law . Despite rejecting that call, the U.S. delegation said that the United States  strongly supports the spirit of this resolution and joins other members of this Council in condemning all acts of violence against women and girls .

The 'Grand Tours' consist of the the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.  The move to reduce the size of teams has been on the agenda for some time to make races less predictable and too easy for leading teams to control and also for safety reasons.  The size of teams taking part in the three Grand Tours will be reduced from the current nine to eight, thereby reducing the peloton size to a maximum of 176 and assisting in efforts to ensure the safety of the peloton and the rest of the race convoy,  a UCI statement said.  It is intended that the maximum peloton size for other races in the UCI WorldTour and the UCI Continental Circuits will also be reduced to 176, with the regulations to put this into effect being submitted for approval in due course.  These changes will be effective from the 2018 season.  Next year's Tour de France will start on July 7, meaning it will only overlap with the World Cup in Russia by a week.

Rowling. Many of Haiti's orphanages use deception to recruit children from unknowing and impoverished parents - a form of trafficking - and use those children to attract donations, said the report released on Thursday by the London-based charity Lumos. Donors, mostly from the United States and faith-based organizations, give $70 million a year to one-third of Haiti's 750 orphanages, it said. About 30,000 children live in orphanages in Haiti, even though four in five of those children have at least one living parent, Lumos said. Most orphanages are privately funded. Impoverished families are frequently duped into giving up their children by orphanage directors who hire so-called child-finders and local pastors who also seek out children, it said. In some cases, families had been paid $75 to give their children away, the report said.  Many parents are deceived into giving up their children, purely so that unscrupulous individuals can make a profit,  said Lumos Chief Executive Georgette Mulheir in a statement.  Well-intended donors give vast sums to orphanages. But 80 percent of children living there are not orphans,  she said. Taking children from their parents through deception, coercion or purchase is a form of human trafficking going largely unchecked, said the report released at Haiti's first anti-trafficking conference this week in Port-au-Prince. In a country where one in four people lives on $1.23 a day, extreme poverty drives families to sell or give their children to orphanages on false promises they will receive an education, food or care, Lumos said. Lumos interviewed 44 children who had been raised in orphanages as well as former orphanage volunteers, health care workers and government officials. Some children reported beatings and cold water being dumped on toddlers who were forced to sleep on an orphanage floor. One 19-year-old man with a physical disability told Lumos he was regularly beaten at an orphanage that he left in 2015.  They would use a stick or an electric cord to hit you, wherever on your body,  he said.  Sometimes they would hit you and you'd bleed.  Lumos said it found evidence in the past two years that sexual abuse in orphanages occurs, saying such cases  rarely come to light.  Even if such cases are reported and investigated, they rarely result in justice for victims, it said. The charity urged donors to redirect funds away from Haiti's orphanages. It suggested spending money instead on improving foster care and local adoption programs and helping families look after their children by funding schooling and housing projects. Lumos founder Rowling is author of the hugely popular Harry Potter fantasy book series.

I’m very happy,  Salah told the Liverpool website. “I will give 100 percent and give everything for the club. I really want to win something for this club.  The 25-year-old flourished in Serie A, rediscovering the form that marked him out as one of Europe's emerging talents at Basel and persuading Chelsea to pay 11 million pounds ($14 million) for him in 2014. After a six-month stay at Fiorentina, during which he scored six goals in his first seven games, Salah proved a major force in Roma's improved form. He will hope to join a list of former Chelsea players, including Manchester United's Juan Mata, Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne and Everton's Romelu Lukaku, who have prospered after leaving Stamford Bridge. Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp has been keen to add depth and quality to a squad that will face a Champions League campaign in 2017-18.

While the Senate has had periods when it took a more activist approach, it has been decades since the body forced a showdown with the House of Commons, whose elected members include Trudeau, his cabinet ministers and opposition leaders. The Senate became a major irritant to Trudeau in the past few weeks, offering amendments to high-profile bills on assisted dying, terrorism, the budget and other issues, at a time when he hoped to head into the parliament's summer recess on a high note to counter a refreshed Conservative opposition.  What you've seen in the last year is sort of a natural evolution. The Senate is playing more of an activist role,  said Senator Andre Pratte, an independent who pushed for changes to the budget bill. Trudeau himself may be partly responsible for the Senate's sudden independence. In 2014, while in opposition, Trudeau expelled all 32 Liberal senators from the party's caucus amid a Senate expenses scandal in a bid to curb partisanship. They remained members of the Senate but are no longer subject to party discipline. Since taking office in 2015, Trudeau has appointed a range of non-partisan community leaders to the upper house, giving him less leverage to pressure them to support his agenda.  More senators are now independent of political parties, so we feel freer to suggest amendments than in the past,  said Pratte, who was appointed by Trudeau in 2015. Few senators are prominent public figures, except a few former hockey players and journalists or those made infamous through scandals. While the new independents have been largely loyal to Trudeau, his old Liberal colleagues are less predictable.  There is a strong sense in which the Senate Liberals are holding onto a bit of a grievance from ... (when) Trudeau kicked them out of caucus,  said Emmett Macfarlane, a University of Waterloo political scientist who advised Trudeau on the Senate reform. But he said the prime minister need not fear the Senate given its lack of public support. Nearly a third of Canadians believe the Senate should be abolished, according to an April Angus Reid poll, but attempts to do so have proven constitutionally difficult.  It is the Senate that needs to tread a little carefully here,  Macfarlane said.  If it becomes obstructionist, it does that at its own peril, because it doesn't have the political capital to spend on a big fight with the House of Commons.  The prime minister's office declined to say whether it expected more battles when parliament resumes in the fall. Spokeswoman Andree-Lyne Halle said the office hoped to  continue to work productively with the Senate  to pass legislation. But Campbell Sharman, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia, said he hopes the genie is out of the bottle and the Senate independence will continue.  We are in this kind of transitory interesting phase,  Sharman said.  Of course the government hates it - they always hate strong upper houses.

Rowling. Many of Haiti's orphanages use deception to recruit children from unknowing and impoverished parents - a form of trafficking - and use those children to attract donations, said the report released on Thursday by the London-based charity Lumos. Donors, mostly from the United States and faith-based organizations, give $70 million a year to one-third of Haiti's 750 orphanages, it said. About 30,000 children live in orphanages in Haiti, even though four in five of those children have at least one living parent, Lumos said. Most orphanages are privately funded. Impoverished families are frequently duped into giving up their children by orphanage directors who hire so-called child-finders and local pastors who also seek out children, it said. In some cases, families had been paid $75 to give their children away, the report said.  Many parents are deceived into giving up their children, purely so that unscrupulous individuals can make a profit,  said Lumos Chief Executive Georgette Mulheir in a statement.  Well-intended donors give vast sums to orphanages. But 80 percent of children living there are not orphans,  she said. Taking children from their parents through deception, coercion or purchase is a form of human trafficking going largely unchecked, said the report released at Haiti's first anti-trafficking conference this week in Port-au-Prince. In a country where one in four people lives on $1.23 a day, extreme poverty drives families to sell or give their children to orphanages on false promises they will receive an education, food or care, Lumos said. Lumos interviewed 44 children who had been raised in orphanages as well as former orphanage volunteers, health care workers and government officials. Some children reported beatings and cold water being dumped on toddlers who were forced to sleep on an orphanage floor. One 19-year-old man with a physical disability told Lumos he was regularly beaten at an orphanage that he left in 2015.  They would use a stick or an electric cord to hit you, wherever on your body,  he said.  Sometimes they would hit you and you'd bleed.  Lumos said it found evidence in the past two years that sexual abuse in orphanages occurs, saying such cases  rarely come to light.  Even if such cases are reported and investigated, they rarely result in justice for victims, it said. The charity urged donors to redirect funds away from Haiti's orphanages. It suggested spending money instead on improving foster care and local adoption programs and helping families look after their children by funding schooling and housing projects. Lumos founder Rowling is author of the hugely popular Harry Potter fantasy book series.

Shares of Home Capital, which nearly collapsed in April, soared 23 percent to C$18.38 after it said billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire would provide a C$2 billion ($1.51 billion) loan to its Home Trust Co unit.

The United States is driving an effort that aims to raise worldwide  routine aviation security to a much higher level,  Homeland Secretary John Kelly said at a Capitol Hill forum. He added that the United States has a  step by step  plan that can be implemented in stages over time.   The bar will be raised much, much higher than it is today,  he said. Kelly has said that if airlines and airports meet stricter security standards, they may avoid the ban.  The threat is very real,  he said. A European aviation industry official said the United States presented a revised 10-point security enhancement list at a meeting last week in Malta.  The restrictions on laptops, announced in March, applied to flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. They came amid fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. The U.S. restrictions cover about 350 flights a week originating from 10 airports, primarily in the Middle East. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group. Earlier this month, Kelly said the U.S. government might expand a ban on larger electronics to flights originating from as many as 71 airports in Europe. Extending the ban to all European airports that directly serve U.S. airports would affect nearly 400 flights a day and cover 30 million travelers, posing major logistical challenges, airlines and security officials say. Kelly said U.S. authorities want to take the 10 airports off the restrictions list  by simply doing the kind of things that we're talking about here in terms of raising aviation security.

A lawyer for 33 women who have accused former star of the 1980s TV hit  The Cosby Show  of sexual assault criticized the move as an apparent attempt to interfere with his expected retrial on charges of sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home in the Philadelphia in 2004.  I received hundreds of calls from civic organizations and churches requesting for Mr. Cosby to speak to young men and women about the judicial system,  Andrew Wyatt, Cosby's spokesman, said in an email Thursday. Pennsylvania prosecutors plan to re-try the 79-year-old Cosby on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand, after the jury in the first trial failed to reach a verdict. The case is the only criminal prosecution to emerge from dozens of similar allegations against Cosby, dating as far back as the 1960s, with the other cases too old to prosecute. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (C) waves as he departs after a judge declared a mistrial in his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 17, 2017.Charles MostollerThe talks could make it harder to pick an unbiased jury for his retrial, said attorney Gloria Allred, who represents the 33 women.  Mr. Cosby's so-called workshops appear to be a transparent and slick effort to attempt to influence the jury pool from which jurors will be selected for his second criminal trial,  Allred said in an email.  Mr. Cosby should understand, however, that this is not about optics. It is about evidence.  In a Wednesday interview on Birmingham, Alabama's WBRC-TV news, Wyatt offered more detail about the seminars.  This issue can affect any young person, especially young athletes of today,  Wyatt said.  They need to know what they are facing when they are hanging out and partying when they are doing things they shouldn't be doing. And it also affects married men.  Cosby has long denied sexually assaulting anyone, saying that any sexual contact he had with Constand or anyone else was consensual. Since the judge in the case on Wednesday unsealed the names of the jurors, two have given anonymous interviews to U.S. media outlets, providing conflicting accounts of the deliberations. One told ABC News that two holdouts prevented a conviction, while another told Pittsburgh's WPXI-TV that the 12-member panel was divided by five to seven.

Saddam Mohamed Raishani, 30, was arrested at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after trying to board a flight to Istanbul via Lisbon, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said.    Raishani is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. He appeared in Manhattan federal court Thursday afternoon and is being held without bail. One of his attorneys, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment on the charges. In January, Raishani told a person who was working as an informant for law enforcement officials that he had previously helped a friend leave New York to join Islamic State, according to a criminal complaint. He said he helped his friend buy supplies, and drove him to the airport, according to prosecutors. Raishani later told the informant that he regretted not going himself, prosecutors said. At one point, Raishani told the informant that he had asked his wife whether she would come with him to join Islamic State, but that based on her reaction he decided not to raise the subject again because he feared she might report him to law enforcement, according to the complaint. He later said that while it was difficult leaving his wife and child behind in the United States, he believed it was the right decision, the complaint said. The informant put Raishani in contact with an undercover New York City Police Department detective posing as a person who wanted to travel abroad and fight for Islamic State, according to prosecutors. Raishani then began making plans for the two to travel together, telling the undercover officer that he could pose as a refugee aid worker while Raishani, a home health aid, could pose as a nurse, according to the complaint. In May, prosecutors said, the informant put Raishani in contact with another person who the informant said would help arrange Raishani's travel. That other person was actually an undercover FBI employee.

When Macron, 39, took office just over a month ago, he was widely expected to put the emphasis on continuity in foreign policy, an area in which he is a newcomer. Following a policy based largely on ideological interests, France has in recent years been quick to intervene militarily in conflicts such as those in Libya, Mali and Central African Republic. That appears to be about to change under Macron. This week he dropped demands for President Bashar al-Assad to depart as a condition for any peace settlement in Syria and held out an olive branch to Russian President Vladimir Putin at talks in Versailles on May 29. Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with the U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia, which he considers a long-term partner rather than a direct threat to Europe. Diplomats and officials say he is also seeking to shift policy by making clear his immediate aims are to weaken Islamist militants who threaten France from the Middle East and embark only on diplomatic initiatives that can bring concrete results.   With me it will be the end of this sort of neo-conservatism that has been imported to France over the last 10 years,  Macron told eight  European newspapers this week.  We need to rediscover the coherence and strength of an international policy that restores credit and to have an unrelenting security policy ... to fight terrorism.  Focus on Areas Where Rewards Possible  French interventions in Middle East conflicts and its rigorous secularism have exposed it to attack by Islamist militants. Gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in and around Paris in November 2015 and over 100 were killed in other Islamist attacks in France in the past two-and-a-half years. Some veteran French diplomats and officials say the policies of Macron's predecessors, Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, kept the country on the front line while others, such as the United States and Britain, pulled back from foreign adventures. France also joined sanctions against Russia after it seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.  Under Macron, France's focus appears likely to shift to areas where Washington sees little added value, such as Africa, or to climate change, on which Washington and Paris disagree.   You can bet that the Middle East peace initiative we promoted for the last few years is dead and buried,  said a French diplomat of international efforts to improve ties between  Israel and the Palestinians.   By contrast, under Macron France has a rough plan for peace between rival factions in Libya, and has for the first time openly called for a united national army that includes eastern militia commander Khalifa Haftar to battle Islamist militants.  Macron wants his team to focus on areas where there can be solutions and rewards for France. I think he has realized that France is limited in what it can do and what its influence can bring,  said a Paris-based Middle Eastern diplomat.  I think he sees things in terms of what are his red lines and beyond that, everything is negotiable.  Nowhere is this more apparent than over the conflict in Syria. Since 2011, French policy on Assad had centered on openly calling for his eventual departure from power, backing his opponents, and pushing for a U.N-brokered transition. With the U.S. increasingly disengaged on Syria, that stance put France in conflict with Russia, Assad's main international backer. Francois Hollande, who preceded Macron as president, at times described Russia's action in Syria as war crimes, and under Hollande France pushed for resolutions at the U.N. Security Council aimed at punishing Assad's government.  Macron and his foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, have dropped such public criticisms and the red line Macron has set in Syria aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump's: both say the use of chemical weapons would result in a military response.  Macron has also said the humanitarian situation must improve -- a stance Paris feels can help secure concessions from Moscow.  They want to do everything to make sure the dialogue with Russia works so they can find a place back at the negotiating table,  said a humanitarian official with knowledge of the new presidency Proxy Forces Le Drian, a defense minister under Hollande, has long had a security-focused outlook on foreign policy and led France's response to Islamist militants in Mali, Libya and Syria. Keeping Le Drian in his cabinet is also widely seen as a sign that Macron wants to nurture Le Drian's close relationship with several powerful leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi or Chad's president, Idriss Deby. The aim of this is to help develop proxy forces in areas where France no longer wants to intervene but needs local forces on the ground. A French push at the United Nations to create a new regional counter-terrorism force in West Africa, alongside France's 4,000 troops, is one example. Another is France's quiet support for Haftar in Libya to oppose Islamist militants. Macron's approach has, however, caused unease among some French diplomats who call it one-dimensional, leaving France exposed to the whims of both the Russians and Americans.  It's an overly military vision of things,  said a senior French diplomat.  Security has always been a core axis of our diplomacy, but you can't do diplomacy by only focusing on security.

The financing round, the largest for a financial technology company since Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union, was led by the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Lakestar, Blockchain said on Thursday.  Nokota Management and Digital Currency Group also participated in the financing round, which boosted Blockchain's total funding to more than $70 million Tom Hulme, general partner at Alphabet's venture firm GV, said the firm invested because  the pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched.  Founded in 2011, Blockchain makes software that allows consumers and businesses to make transactions using digital currencies such as bitcoin. The firm is named after the internet platform that records and validates transactions between two parties without relying on an intermediary such as a bank. Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Smith said that, as of March, the company was completing the equivalent of $2.5 billion in transactions on a monthly basis through its consumer virtual wallet product.  Anybody with a reasonable ability to use a smartphone can use it,  Smith said.  My grandmother uses our product today.  The growing acceptance and adoption of digital financial products has helped startups like Blockchain attract investor attention.  Last week, American International Group Inc (AIG.N) announced a blockchain-based insurance product. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and other banks have invested in blockchain startups, and many will roll out commercial blockchain products this year. In the first quarter, blockchain startups raised a total of $141 million from investors, a 57 percent increase over the fourth quarter but an 18 percent drop from the first quarter of 2016, according to data provider CB Insights. Some skeptics say blockchain will never be adopted broadly or pose a threat to traditional banks, while others point to the volatility of bitcoin, the digital currency based on the technology. While far from mainstream, digital currency has enjoyed growing popularity that Smith attributes to the instability of traditional currencies in places such as Brazil, and political uncertainty in Britain and the United States.  The day after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Smith said, Blockchain had the second-highest number of new users sign up in a single day.  In you're in an environment of rapidly deteriorating geopolitical stability,  Smith said,  you are open to new ideas and new products.

{"news_time":"2017-06-22 16:38:00","news_title":"Transparency elusive in Canadian financial enforcement","keywords":"Canada,Jamey Hubbs,BC,FINREG,TRANSPARENCY,CANADA","sector":"Subjects","content":"TORONTO (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Efforts by Canadian regulators to deter financial misconduct through enforcement actions are coming up short. The manner in which regulators have conducted several recent misconduct investigations of financial institutions raises questions over whether their enforcement efforts achieve credible deterrence in the Canadian financial marketplace.  CREDIBLE DETERRENCE: A REGULATORY EMPHASIS ON TRANSPARENCY, LEGAL CERTAINTY The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published in 2015 a report (PDF) on  credible deterrence  which has since become foundational guidance for financial regulators in many jurisdictions around the world.  IOSCO asserts in the report that in order for securities regulations to effectively protect investors and maintain public confidence in financial markets, regulatory enforcement efforts must credibly deter future misconduct. Deterrence is considered credible when organizations and individuals perceive the risks of engaging in misconduct to outweigh rewards and are thereby deterred from such misconduct. As a part of credible deterrence, enforcement efforts should also send clear messages that discourage non-compliant attitudes and conduct. The IOSCO report outlines seven factors that it considers essential to credible deterrence. Transparency, specifically, the need for financial regulators to send a consistent message regarding investigating, prosecuting and sanctioning misconduct features prominently in IOSCO's guidance.  Transparency is a theme in several of IOSCO's essential factors, particularly those that pertain to legal certainty of enforcement actions, investigation and prosecution of misconduct and public communication of enforcement proceedings and outcomes. Factor 1 outlines the importance of consistency and certainty in enforcement actions, meaning that similar offenses should incur consistently similar penalties and sanctions. IOSCO emphasizes that transparency throughout enforcement proceedings and in the issuance of decisions is crucial to consistency and certainty.  Factors 4 and 5 pertain to the prosecution of misconduct and the application of sanctions. IOSCO asserts that in addition to delivering sanctions as soon as possible after the misconduct, transparency in how regulators reach decisions on sanctioning misconduct is crucial to credible deterrence.  Factor 6 concerns how regulators communicate with the public. Arguably, transparency and open communication from regulators to the public can serve to strengthen confidence in a regulator's ability to enforce securities laws and protect investors from harm caused by financial misconduct.  Transparency Lacking in Recent Enforcement Activity Recent enforcement actions undertaken by different financial regulators in Canada have drawn sharp criticism for a lack of transparency, as well as questions over whether the regulators' actions achieve credible deterrence.  In April 2016, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTtRAC), which has a mandate to deter money laundering and terrorist financing, fined Manulife Bank(here) for failing to comply with provisions of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA). Departing from an established practice of disclosing the identities of individuals or organizations in violation notices, FINTRAC omitted Manulife in the notice. It subsequently said(here) that it had granted anonymity to swiftly resolve the investigation and deliver public notice of the fine, which it viewed as a form of deterrence.  While giving targets incentives to settle an investigation can help financial regulators resolve and publicize investigation results in a timely fashion, withholding the identity of a respondent creates the appearance of a lack of transparency, even secrecy, in how FINTRAC handles enforcement actions. As a result, efforts by the regulator to achieve credible deterrence through swift resolution of its investigation of Manulife Bank were hindered by the opacity concerning the prosecution of the misconduct. FINTRAC's handling of the enforcement action brings into question whether the sanctions applied were consistent or proportionate to the misconduct. Without transparency around the certainty and consistency of FINTRAC's efforts, the regulator cannot say that it has achieved credible deterrence through its enforcement action against Manulife Bank. Similarly the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) also withheld the identity of the non-compliant firm in a recent action. On May 15, 2017, the commissioner of the FCAC published its first decision (here) concerning non-compliance with the Code of Conduct for the Credit Card and Debit Card Industry in Canada(here). The Code of Conduct, which was last updated in 2015, sets out rules governing credit card and debit card transactions between merchants and payment card network operators.  As outlined in the decision notice, the unnamed payment card network operator received a notice of non-compliance from the FCAC in March 2016, informing the firm that it had made incorrect disclosures to merchants for certain transactions, in breach of its obligations under the Code of Conduct. The unnamed firm did not dispute that the disclosures breached of the Code of Conduct; however, the firm asserted that the incorrect disclosure had been made by third-party payment processors and that the firm itself had taken reasonable measures to comply. The firm asserted that since it had implemented some internal controls to comply with the Code of Conduct, it should not be responsible for violations committed by third parties.  The Code of Conduct requires payment card network operators to undertake a number of compliance measures in disclosures made to merchants, including controls designed to ensure compliance by third-party participants such as payment processors and issuers.  While the commissioner clearly stated in the decision that payment card network operators have a  front and centre  compliance role, including mitigating risks posed by third parties, the regulator ultimately decided that no further action against the unnamed firm was necessary.  The FCAC's decision leaves little for firms to ponder in terms of practical compliance guidance. In addition to withholding the identity of the firm, the scant details on specific information pertaining to the nature of the violation fail to form any kind of concrete precedent for financial institutions to consider. Instead, the FCAC simply claims that as a first case of non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, which has been in effect for some time,  a certain degree of latitude  should be allowed. Compliance Considerations It may be tempting for Canadian firms to conclude that they may be afforded some privacy if they were to become subjects of investigation in enforcement actions undertaken by FINTRAC and the FCAC.  However, things seem set to change. Some Canadian regulators are reexamining their approach to enforcement, with the view of fostering stronger deterrence. In recent public remarks(here), Jamey Hubbs, the Assistant Superintendent of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), indicated that as a part of its mandate to maintain public confidence in financial markets, OSFI intends to intervene promptly to address issues that could jeopardize financial stability. While OSFI's regulatory scope predominantly covers prudential matters, the regulator has the authority to address financial misconduct as well, if such misconduct poses systemic risks. Earlier this year, FINTRAC announced(here) that it would conduct a full legislative review of its penalty program, largely in response to public outrage over its decision to withhold the identity of Manulife Bank in its 2016 action. As a direct nod to the importance of transparency in deterring violations and supporting its own credibility as a regulator, FINTRAC has pledged to revise its policies with the need for transparency in mind. Given the amount of public attention that FINTRAC's enforcement notice against Manulife Bank as attracted, Canadian firms should expect similar scrutiny the next time over future FINTRAC enforcement activity.  Separately, while the FCAC declined to set concrete precedent in its first decision concerning non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, payment card network operators should not assume that they will be afforded anonymity and leniency in financial consumer protection matters. Given that investors and other members of the public in Canada are demanding more transparency in regulatory enforcement actions, as evidenced by the sustained outcry over FINTRAC's enforcement decision against Manulife Bank, other regulators such as the FCAC could be pressured to change their practices as well. --IOSCO  Credible Deterrence  report:here (Helen Chan is a regulatory intelligence and e-learning expert in the Enterprise Risk Management division of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Gregory Scarpa Jr, 65, did not deserve to be rewarded for leading investigators to Terry Nichols' home, reflecting his prior track record as an informant and what prosecutors called his  history  of obstructing justice. Thursday's 3-0 decision against Scarpa, a self-professed member of the Colombo crime family serving time in a racketeering case, reversed a January 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in Brooklyn, New York. Georgia Hinde, a lawyer for Scarpa, declined to comment. Scarpa learned in 2005 of the explosives from Nichols, serving 161 consecutive life terms for the Oklahoma City bombing, after befriending him when both were housed at the maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado. The FBI at first ignored the tip and said Scarpa failed a lie detector test. It was only after private investigators also contacted by Scarpa reached out to members of Congress that FBI agents searched Nichols' home. Korman rejected prosecutors' claims that Scarpa did not deserve credit because he perjured himself at his own trial, embellished Nichols' tip, and provided  sham  cooperation in a case involving Ramzi Yousef, who helped mastermind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The judge said the government had a compelling interest in finding  bombs hidden by domestic terrorists on American soil,  and no interest in arbitrarily failing to credit Scarpa's tip. In Thursday's decision, Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse agreed that Scarpa provided  substantial assistance  in locating the explosives. But she said Korman went too far by cutting Scarpa's term after prosecutors refused to recommend a reduction, which it often does after receiving help from defendants. Kearse said Scarpa's prior perjury, conduct in the Yousef case, and submission in other cases of affidavits that judges refused to credit justified restoring the 40-year sentence.  Fraudulent cries of 'Wolf' not only cause the misallocation of government resources, but they also make less likely an appropriate government response if the man who cried 'Wolf' subsequently sounds an alarm that is genuine,  she wrote. Scarpa is now housed at a facility in Kansas City, Kansas, federal prison records show. Nichols, 62, remains in the Florence prison.

The seven sites, operated out of Europe, purport to sell items including fabric, DVD cases, maps, gift wrap, mechanical tape, pin badges and flags. In fact, they are fake outlets, part of a multinational system to disguise payments for the $40 billion global online gambling industry, which is illegal in many countries and some U.S. states.  The findings raise questions about how e-commerce is policed worldwide. They also underline a strategy which fraud specialists say regulators, card issuers and banks have yet to tackle head-on.   MORE FROM REUTERS: Google pushes framework for law enforcement access to overseas data Honda halts Japan car plant after WannaCry virus hits computer network Full coverage of cyber risk That strategy is  transaction laundering  - when one online merchant processes payment card transactions on behalf of another, which can help disguise the true nature of payments.  Credit card companies including Visa and Mastercard require all online purchases to be coded so they can see what type of purchase is being processed and block it if it is illegal in a particular country. The codes are known as Merchant Category Codes. Gambling transactions, for example, are given the code of 7995 and subject to extra scrutiny.  The scheme found by Reuters involved websites which accepted payments for household items from a reporter but did not deliver any products. Instead, staff who answered helpdesk numbers on the sites said the outlets did not sell the product advertised, but that they were used to help process gambling payments, mostly for Americans.  Categorising a gambling transaction as a purchase of something else is against the rules of card issuers including Visa and Mastercard, the card companies said in response to Reuters' findings.   Transaction laundering is serious misconduct - often criminal,  said Dan Frechtling, head of product at G2 Web Services, a financial compliance company which works with leading banks and card issuers.  It violates the merchant's agreement with its acquirer, allows prohibited goods and services to enter the payment system, and may flout anti-money laundering laws.   Three other fraud experts consulted by Reuters said transaction laundering helps online merchants trade in areas that credit card issuers and banks may otherwise bar as  high risk,  such as gaming, pornography or drugs. Some of them say thousands of online merchants may be using similar techniques to move billions of dollars that card companies would otherwise block.   It is the digital evolution of money laundering,  said Ron Teicher, CEO of Evercompliant, a cyber-intelligence firm that works with banks to identify suspect sites.  The only thing is it is much easier to do, and much harder to get caught.   Gateway for Gamblers  The dummy stores came to Reuters' attention in late 2016, when an anonymous document posted on the internet pointed to three online outlets that advertised products but did not actually deliver any. In December, a reporter placed an order for a yard of burlap cloth on one of the sites, myfabricfactory.com, a website run by a UK company called Sarphone Ltd. The fabric, advertised in U.S. dollars at $6.48 per yard, has  many uses including lightweight drapes,  the website says. Sarphone did not respond to requests for comment.  This order went unmet. After a few weeks an email from My Fabric Factory arrived saying the product was out of stock. The payment was refunded.  When a reporter called the helpline number given on the site, the call was answered by someone who gave her name as Anna Richardson. She said she was employed by Agora Online Services, a payment services provider. Payment services providers (PSPs) verify, process and code card transactions.  Richardson said Agora processes payments for poker and works with  hundreds  of online gambling sites. Asked which references on the reporter's card statement would be for online gambling, Richardson said,  If you have been using a betting site of any sort ... they are normally processed by us.   It was not possible to verify Richardson's identity. The My Fabric Factory email came from Agora's email address, info@agrsupport.net. Agora, headquartered in Iceland and linked to companies from the UK to Germany, is owned by a Mauritius-based company, DueXX Ltd, according to Orbis, a company database. Andrej Brandt, one of two directors of Agora and listed as the sole point of contact on DueXX's website, declined to comment.   Thank you very much for your interest but I don't like to share my views and insights,  he said via text message after Reuters presented its findings.  I presume you understand.   The other director of Agora, Joerg Henning, could not be reached.  Reuters placed orders for household products on six other websites, all owned by companies in the UK. All the orders went unfilled and payment was refunded without comment. The sites used the same mail server as one of Agora's web addresses, agrsupport.net, according to domain name records.  A screen grab of the home page of website www.myfabricfactory.com taken June 20, 2017.  www.myfabricfactory.com via ReutersThe site helplines were answered by three individuals who all said they worked for Agora, a company that specialized in processing gambling payments. One was the woman who identified herself as Anna Richardson. Another gave her name as Lucy, and the third, who did not give his name, told the reporter,  Most of the people who gamble and end up having our charges on their accounts are Americans. Gambling is illegal in America.  The staff said they were based in Germany.  When Reuters made payments on the seven sites, in each case the reporter's credit details were processed by Deutsche Payment, a payment processor headquartered in Berlin. Its website says it is certified by the PCI Security Standards Council, a global payment card security body. It was included in Visa Europe's May 2017 list of approved agents. Deutsche Payment did not respond to requests for comment.  The PCI Security Standards Council said it was up to the card companies to regulate payment processors.  Presented with Reuters' findings, a spokesperson for Visa said,  We require all gaming sites to be processed under the relevant Merchant Category Code. Our rules are always subject to local law and we do not tolerate criminal activity.   A spokesperson for Mastercard said:  When we are alerted to activities that may be against our rules or against the law, we work with the merchant's bank to confirm or investigate the allegation.    After Reuters approached the payment processing companies, all seven online stores stopped accepting payments, although they remain visible online.  Ecosystem  Illicit gaming is hard to detect, partly because those involved cooperate to hide what they are doing, said Scott Talbot, head of government relations at the ‎Electronic Transactions Association, a trade organization for the payment processing industry that counts some of the world's largest banks as members.  Slideshow (2 Images)Also, sites like those found by Reuters are small cogs in a complex global infrastructure.   Illicit finance is incredibly creative,  said Gregory Lisa, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells who has worked for the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuting money-laundering and fraud cases.  It is a very difficult arms race between the government and illicit actors and their financiers.   Fraud specialists say dummy stores like those found by Reuters are not meant to be visited by the normal public. They are designed to be hard to spot, and their role is simply as a shop front to back up the bogus description.  Gambling sites that operate in countries where online gaming is illegal will take payment through their own sites, but then simply program the sites to give a reference to sites like the dummy stores in payment records, the consultancy Evercompliant says.  As far as the gambler is concerned, their payment has gone to the gambling site. Only when they see their card statement do they find a reference to the bogus store. If they visit the store and call the helpline number, the people who answer explain that the transaction actually corresponds to gambling – as Agora staff told the Reuters reporter.  Evercompliant, which has developed proprietary technology to help large banks and finance firms check sites they deal with, analyzed the seven dummy stores at Reuters' request.  It found they were part of what it called an  ecosystem  of nearly 50 interlinked websites, owned by companies in countries ranging from Georgia to Latvia. It analyzed these sites and said if it had found such a network in a bank's portfolio of customers, it would suspect transaction laundering, CEO Teicher said.  Loopholes  Such sites get around checks by credit card companies by using loopholes in the system, according to Frechtling at G2.  Some banks rely on payment processors to vet online merchants. While most PSP firms are legitimate, their due diligence can be perfunctory, he said.   Some PSPs will make a basic anti-money laundering check - for example, using sanctions lists,  he said.  But they may not do a full vetting of you until you start transacting. That is a weak link.   Transaction laundering directly through a bank doing thorough due diligence would be relatively difficult, but at a PSP that is sponsored by a bank it is often easier.   It was not possible for Reuters to determine which bank or banks work with Deutsche Payment or Agora.  The UK firms that own the seven dummy online stores were set up by Simon Dowson, whose company formation agency closed down in 2015 after businesses it set up were involved in global scams including money-laundering. Reuters revealed last year how Dowson used residents of the English town of Consett as part of the scheme.  Dowson's wife, Tanaporn Thompson, also known as Tanaporn Dowson, was named as director of Sarphone Ltd, the owner of My Fabric Factory, for a week in January 2017. She could not be reached.  The person named in the UK company register as having ultimate control of Sarphone is another Consett resident, Emma Chambers. Chambers and Dowson did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Canadian retail sales rose 0.8 percent in April on higher gasoline prices and increased demand for home appliances and garden supplies, exceeding forecasts for a 0.2 percent gain.                  The data shows a  stronger starting off point than people had assumed for Q2 consumption,  said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed-income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.         Chances of a BoC rate hike as early as next month rose to 34 percent from less than one in four before the retail sales report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed. Traders have already priced in a rate hike for 2017           .     The Bank of Canada's top two officials last week said that looser monetary policies put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates must remain at near-record lows.                  Interest rate expectations have become a more important driver for the currency than the direction of oil prices, Chandler said.         Oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged up from multimonth lows, but prices remained under pressure from a supply glut. U.S. crude oil futures        settled 21 cents higher at $42.74 a barrel.           At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3235 to the greenback, or 75.56 U.S. cents, up 0.8 percent.     The currency traded in a range between C$1.3208 and C$1.3338. In the previous session, the loonie touched its weakest in nine days at C$1.3348.     Gains for the Canadian dollar came as Home Capital Group Inc         , which nearly collapsed in April, said Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc          would provide a new C$2 billion line of credit to its Home Trust Co unit.                  Bearish bets on the Canadian dollar had set a fresh record high in May as investors worried that the alternative lender's troubles could hurt the country's red-hot housing market.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across much of a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 4 Canadian cents to yield 0.933 percent and the 10-year             falling 9 Canadian cents to yield 1.5 percent.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3 basis points to a spread of -41.1 basis points, its smallest since Feb. 24.      Canadian inflation data for May is due on Friday         .   (Reporting by Fergal Smith, editing by G Crosse)     ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-forex-idUSL1N1JJ1MQ"},

Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed's most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year's level.  This year's results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,  said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.  The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Under the Fed's worst-case stress test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. However, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks' aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 capital ratio assessed last year. The results released on Thursday are the first of a two-part exam. This part determines whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed's methodology, using materials they submitted. Banks are still subject to a second portion of the test in which the Fed approves or denies their capital plans. The Fed is expected to release that component next week. The results are the first since Republican President Donald Trump took office and called for a relaxation of capital regulations to encourage banks to lend more. Bank executives and many investors hope the Fed will allow lenders to put a lot more capital toward stock buybacks and dividends. Stock analysts and investors expected banks to hold up well in this year's test because they have accumulated a lot more capital since the financial crisis abated and the economy rebounded. Of the 34 banks that were required to undergo the most recent stress tests, Ally Financial Inc and KeyCorp were the only two lenders to show common equity Tier 1 capital ratios below 7 percent. Citigroup Inc fared the best among big Wall Street banks, with a ratio of 9.7 percent. Its results are being watched especially closely by shareholders who have been wanting management to buy back more of its common stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. The other five largest banks, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, showed common equity Tier 1 capital ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent in the Fed's most aggressive scenario. The Fed has changed the emphasis in stress scenarios from year-to-year to keep banks from managing their portfolios to the test. The Fed has also seen the tactic as a way to poke around bank balance sheets for weak assets. This year a spotlight was turned on commercial real estate came after some regulators feared the sector was overheating on easy credit from the banks.

The United States is driving an effort that aims to raise worldwide  routine aviation security to a much higher level,  Homeland Secretary John Kelly said at a Capitol Hill forum. He added that the United States has a  step by step  plan that can be implemented in stages over time.   The bar will be raised much, much higher than it is today,  he said. Kelly has said that if airlines and airports meet stricter security standards, they may avoid the ban.  The threat is very real,  he said. A European aviation industry official said the United States presented a revised 10-point security enhancement list at a meeting last week in Malta.  The restrictions on laptops, announced in March, applied to flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. They came amid fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. The U.S. restrictions cover about 350 flights a week originating from 10 airports, primarily in the Middle East. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. Any expansion of the ban could impact U.S. carriers such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group. Earlier this month, Kelly said the U.S. government might expand a ban on larger electronics to flights originating from as many as 71 airports in Europe. Extending the ban to all European airports that directly serve U.S. airports would affect nearly 400 flights a day and cover 30 million travelers, posing major logistical challenges, airlines and security officials say. Kelly said U.S. authorities want to take the 10 airports off the restrictions list  by simply doing the kind of things that we're talking about here in terms of raising aviation security.

Summer is typically when gasoline demand peaks in the world's biggest oil consuming country as motorists hit the road for vacation, and keeping their gas tanks full strains the capacity of U.S. refiners and pipelines. This year, so much fuel is stored in tanks in the Northeast that Colonial Pipeline Co [COLPI.UL] said in a notice to customers that demand from refiners and fuel traders to bring gasoline through its pipeline to the region from refining hubs in the South was the worst in six years. For the first time since 2011, demand for the pipeline was below capacity for a five-day period starting early next week, Colonial said on Thursday. The news pushed down gasoline prices in the Gulf region, where the pipeline begins. Benchmark U.S. gasoline prices led the energy complex higher and were up about 2.1 percent shortly after midday, partly boosted by expectations that fewer barrels flowing into the East Coast would alleviate a glut.  Typically, demand exceeds the pipeline's space, forcing refiners and traders to supplement delivery with tanker shipments or imports.  The only reason they wouldn't be full is clearly that inventory levels are high enough that there is no incentive to move product to New York,  said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research, Morningstar in Austin, Texas. Even when inventories are high, shippers typically keep pumping full volumes just to ensure they keep their rights to the line space for when they really need it, said Fielden.      The situation is quite unusual,  he said. The firms using the line have been losing money on pumping barrels through it for months, because of high inventories and low prices for gasoline in the northeast. With no sign of those inventories easing much, refiners and shippers have decided to cut volumes.  It's purely economic - why ship into a negative arb(itrage) for that long,  one trader said.  Linespace, a spot market created to trade capacity on the congested pipeline, turns negative when it becomes unprofitable to ship barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Linespace on the line has only been positive for six days so far this year, according to pricing information from S&P; Global Platts.  While consumption in the driving season is below the record volume of 2016, demand in two of the past five weeks has hit all-time highs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But demand has not had much impact on inventories, because U.S. refiners are also pumping out a record volume of motor fuel for the second straight year. Gasoline inventories in the region are just shy of the five-year high for this time of year, after falling last week by 1.3 million barrels last week to 67.6 million barrels, according to the government data. [EIA/S] Global oil prices have languished despite efforts by the world's top producers to limit output. U.S. crude futures plunged to a 10-month low on Wednesday. [O/R] Colonial Pipeline's main gasoline line, Line 1, which runs to Greensboro, North Carolina, from Houston, carries about 1.3 million barrels of fuel every day.  Colonial did not detail in its notice to shippers how far below capacity demand was for the pipeline. A terminal operator in New York Harbor said tanks were full and barges that typically move products out of the U.S. gasoline hub were sitting empty.  We are typically short barges, but we are long now,  the operator said.  People are just not moving product.  Colonial connects Gulf Coast refineries with markets across the southern and eastern United States through more than 5,500 miles (8,850 km) of pipelines, delivering gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products. Colonial indicated it did not expect demand to exceed capacity for the next five-day cycle through the line, and informed shippers it would therefore not follow the typical process for rationing space. Gulf Coast gasoline grades weakened on Thursday. Conventional motor fuel fell as much 2 cents to trade 5 cents per gallon under benchmark gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before bouncing back to around -3.25 cents. That was still down from the discount of 3 cents on Wednesday.

Brent edged up from November lows hit in the prior session, when U.S. crude hit its lowest intraday level since August 2016, but sentiment remained negative as a supply glut has persisted despite OPEC-led cuts to output. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 0.5 percent at $42.47 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled up 0.9 percent at $45.22 on the day.  I would not be surprised if it breaks down, considering momentum is still in that direction as well as supply concerns that didn’t really change overnight,  said Andres Garcia-Amaya, CEO at Zoe Financial in New York.  It could carry lower and I wouldn’t be surprised if it breaks $40, but to go down below where it was before there would have to be much stronger downward pressure than just supply.   With the gains, the energy sector in Europe .SXEP remained under pressure, down 0.3 percent, but managed to close well off earlier lows. The index is down nearly 2 percent on the week and is on track for its fifth straight weekly drop.  Those declines weighed on European shares and U.S. energy shares .SPNY gave up earlier gains to close 0.1 percent lower.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 12.74 points, or 0.06 percent, to 21,397.29, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 1.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,434.5 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 2.73 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,236.69. Traders work in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, June 20, 2017.Staff/RemoteHealthcare .SPXHC was up 1.1 percent as the best performing group on Wall Street after Senate Republicans unveiled a draft bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.05 percent to snap a two-session skid and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.11 percent. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year after the initial OPEC-led production cut. Oil's decline has hurt energy stocks and curbed investor expectations for higher inflation that would enable major central banks to pursue tighter monetary policies. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have led to a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds US5US30=TWEB on Wednesday narrowed to 94.9 basis points, holding near its smallest since December 2007. The curve steepened slightly to 95.7 basis points on Thursday, suggesting the flattening of the yield curve this week was stalling. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator. It shows concern about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.1494 percent, from 2.155 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.02 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.15 percent to $1.1149.

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) was tasked with selecting a new rate at the behest of regulators including the Federal Reserve who worried that a decline in short-term bank lending since the 2008 financial crisis undermined faith in Libor, and posed risks to the trillions of dollars of derivatives backed by the rate. The repo rate was selected over the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR), an unsecured bank lending rate based on transactions in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets. The ARRC said that the repo was considered the most appropriate rate after considering the depth and robustness of the market as well as other factors including regulatory principles. “I am confident the new reference rate chosen today by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee is based on a deep and actively traded market and will be highly robust,  Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell said in a statement.  With this choice, the ARRC has taken another step in addressing the risks involved with LIBOR,” Powell said. Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations, along with allegations of Libor manipulation before and during the crisis, has resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced funds' demand for bank debt, so Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions. Selecting repo ”is keeping with a rate that should be broadly reflective of actual transactions,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. An advantage of repo is that the market is large and liquid, with over $600 billion in trades estimated to be made overnight. That compares with around $300 billion trades in the markets backing the OBFR. Trading contracts based on the new rate is expected to begin next year on a voluntary basis, though it will likely take several years to build strong liquidity in the product. “This is the first step in a very long progression away from Libor,” Goldberg said. Over time, the new benchmark may be adopted for broad use as a reference rate for corporate loans, residential mortgages and credit cards as Libor has been. The growth of interest rate derivatives since the 1980s made it easier to hedge Libor-based loans, helping spread the use of the rate to a wide range of institutional and consumer loans.

I fight hard,  John Dowd said in an interview.  I believe that's what I'm supposed to do. I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that.   Snowflake  is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some Trump supporters to mock liberals. Dowd, who spoke with Reuters on Wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. He has a no-holds-barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional Democrats and the media. The 76-year-old Washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to Trump's legal team.  The team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, is tasked with responding to Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. In what Dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended  billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time.  Rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said Dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence.  This is war, and I will defeat you,  Brodsky recalled Dowd declaring in one phone conversation. Dowd confirmed the sentiment on Wednesday.  It is a war,  he said of such cases. His tactics in the Rajaratnam case reflected that belief. Dowd aggressively challenged the prosecution's stance on what constituted insider trading. He also fought the government's wiretaps of his client's cell phone, claiming investigators  gamed the system.    Brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6-foot-4-inch-tall Dowd would be a  ferocious defender of the president.   In a manner similar to Trump, Dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Rajaratnam case, singling out then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in particular.   He sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs,  Dowd said.  It was the most atrocious thing I've ever seen.  Dowd also went after reporters. Bharara, who declined to comment on Wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter he accused of  whoring  for the prosecution. In another encounter with the press caught on camera, Dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a CNBC reporter.    Like Trump, Dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. After the Rajaratnam verdict, Dowd argued  the defense is winning  because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading.  The score is 23-14,  he told reporters. In a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys, Dowd complained of McCarthyism when his client, former Justice Department official Monica Goodling, was criticized by Democrats for invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Dowd represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s  Keating Five  banking scandal and conducted the Major League Baseball investigation that led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Dowd would not discuss legal strategy for Trump but said the team the president had assembled was great.  We're all fighters,  he said.  Though his hiring was first reported Friday, a person familiar with the matter said Dowd has been working with the team for weeks. Dowd said he knew Kasowitz partner Michael Bowe, who is also representing Trump, and met with Kasowitz at the end of May. Jay Sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on Trump's behalf. Dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. He called Trump  a fighter for the people  and said the president had done nothing wrong. A onetime military lawyer with the U.S. Marine Corps, Dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize Mueller, a Marine platoon leader during the Vietnam War.  Bobby is doing what he has to do and he'll do a good job,  said Dowd.  He's a fellow Marine and he's a good man.

Knopf.  The book, as yet untitled, is about  the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,  Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law,  integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.   It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,  Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.  During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects.  Preet Bharara's life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,  said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a  good meeting  and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.  He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received  unusual  phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara  addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.  Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bharara's firing  remains an open question,  Bogaards said.

The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) was tasked with selecting a new rate at the behest of regulators including the Federal Reserve who worried that a decline in short-term bank lending since the 2008 financial crisis undermined faith in Libor, and posed risks to the trillions of dollars of derivatives backed by the rate. The repo rate was selected over the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR), an unsecured bank lending rate based on transactions in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets. The ARRC said that the repo was considered the most appropriate rate after considering the depth and robustness of the market as well as other factors including regulatory principles. “I am confident the new reference rate chosen today by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee is based on a deep and actively traded market and will be highly robust,  Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell said in a statement.  With this choice, the ARRC has taken another step in addressing the risks involved with LIBOR,” Powell said. Reforms to banking and money market fund regulations, along with allegations of Libor manipulation before and during the crisis, has resulted in fewer interbank short-term loans and reduced funds' demand for bank debt, so Libor rates are sometimes estimated rather than based on actual transactions. Selecting repo ”is keeping with a rate that should be broadly reflective of actual transactions,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. An advantage of repo is that the market is large and liquid, with over $600 billion in trades estimated to be made overnight. That compares with around $300 billion trades in the markets backing the OBFR. Trading contracts based on the new rate is expected to begin next year on a voluntary basis, though it will likely take several years to build strong liquidity in the product. “This is the first step in a very long progression away from Libor,” Goldberg said. Over time, the new benchmark may be adopted for broad use as a reference rate for corporate loans, residential mortgages and credit cards as Libor has been. The growth of interest rate derivatives since the 1980s made it easier to hedge Libor-based loans, helping spread the use of the rate to a wide range of institutional and consumer loans.

Knopf.  The book, as yet untitled, is about  the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general,  Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law,  integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning.   It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice,  Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.  During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects.  Preet Bharara's life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book,  said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a  good meeting  and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor.  He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received  unusual  phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara  addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal.  Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bharara's firing  remains an open question,  Bogaards said.

Brent edged up from November lows hit in the prior session, when U.S. crude hit its lowest intraday level since August 2016, but sentiment remained negative as a supply glut has persisted despite OPEC-led cuts to output. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 0.5 percent at $42.47 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled up 0.9 percent at $45.22 on the day.  I would not be surprised if it breaks down, considering momentum is still in that direction as well as supply concerns that didn’t really change overnight,  said Andres Garcia-Amaya, CEO at Zoe Financial in New York.

Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year after the initial OPEC-led production cut. Oil's decline has hurt energy stocks and curbed investor expectations for higher inflation that would enable major central banks to pursue tighter monetary policies. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have led to a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds US5US30=TWEB on Wednesday narrowed to 94.9 basis points, holding near its smallest since December 2007. The curve steepened slightly to 95.7 basis points on Thursday, suggesting the flattening of the yield curve this week was stalling. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator. It shows concern about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs.

In a report, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) analysts led by Javier Martínez de Olcoz Cerdán said Kroton's planned takeover of Estácio has approximately a 75 percent chance of being rejected, based on a selloff of both stocks on Monday and Tuesday. Investors drove shares of Kroton (KROT3.SA) and Estácio (ESTC3.SA) down 7 percent and 14 percent, respectively. However, Martínez sees a 60 percent chance the deal will be approved on the condition that the companies sell assets accounting for 15 percent of the combined entity's revenue. The rout in the shares of both companies came after two Brazilian newspapers said antitrust watchdog Cade is considering vetoing Kroton's takeover of Estácio at a meeting scheduled for June 28. According to the report, only one of the agency's five directors, Cristiane Alkmin, has given signs that the deal could be approved. Scrutiny of the Kroton-Estácio tie-up comes as rivals and consumer groups air concerns about creating a juggernaut with 10 times as many students as its closest rival in Brazil. Reuters reported on June 5 that Cade has demanded asset sales larger than initially expected by Kroton as a condition to approve the deal. In February, a preliminary report by the watchdog's economic analysis division said the deal could hamper competition and lead to higher costs for consumers. Cade, Kroton and Estácio declined to comment. Martínez interviewed more than 80 local and foreign investors between June 13 and June 19 to understand their views about the Kroton-Estácio deal.  His conclusion that shares are pricing in a no-deal scenario stems from expectations by those investors that Kroton and Estácio would be down 9 percent and 13 percent if Cade rejected the combination.

Cladding, added during a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, may have played a part in the June 14 disaster when flames sped through the 24-storey residential building, trapping people inside, residents have said.  The blaze in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Britain's worst since World War Two, has heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, already fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election.  The Grenfell tragedy has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts. There have been accusations of criminal negligence and, if more buildings are deemed unsafe, the government faces the task of rehoming people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched.  The estimate provided to us by councils is that there are approximately 600 high-rise buildings with similar cladding,  May's spokeswoman told reporters. Government had no estimates yet for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, she said. Cladding panels are often added to the exterior of buildings to insulate them and, particularly in the case of ageing tower blocks, to improve their external appearance. The panels vary in terms of their fire resistance depending on their intended use.   In terms of the people who are living in those buildings, we will do a further test to make sure the buildings are safe - obviously nobody will be living in buildings that are unsafe,  May's spokeswoman said, adding that people would be rehoused if necessary.    A spokesman for the communities and local government department, the office in charge of testing the buildings, later said that the 600 figure was an estimate of how many had any form of cladding and not an indication of how many would eventually be found to be dangerous. Earlier May announced that cladding used on some buildings had been found to be combustible with her local government minister saying eleven had so far tested as combustible.   (We) should of course be careful on speculating what caused this fire, but as a precaution the government has arranged to test cladding on all relevant tower blocks,  May told parliament. A panel of cladding is missing on a tower block on the Chalcots estate are seen in Camden after the local council announced they would be removing alumium cladding in light of the fire at the Grenfell Tower, in London, Britain, June 22, 2017.Hannah McKay I was informed that a number of these tests have come back as combustible.  She said local authorities and fire services were taking steps to make affected buildings safe and to inform residents.  May has launched a public inquiry into the fire and police have announced a criminal investigation. Tests on the cladding of Grenfell Tower would be made public in the next 48 hours, she said. Slideshow (13 Images)Removal Works Leaders of the council in another London borough, Camden, said it would remove external cladding panels from five tower blocks on a local estate after finding they were not to the standard it had commissioned.

It said that until the panels had all been removed, there would be round-the-clock fire safety patrols on the estate.

Residents of tower blocks all over the country are concerned, worried and frightened for their own safety. What we need is a step change in our attitude towards housing in this country.  After apologizing for a slow state response to the fire, May said it was right that Nicholas Holgate, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council, had resigned.

Most of the 55 percent of teens who have had sex by 18 used some type of protection, typically a condom, the study of more than 4,000 teenagers by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics showed. Some 80 percent of teenagers employed a contraceptive method during their first sexual encounters, according to the study. The study measured sexual activity, defined as vaginal intercourse between a female and a male, by teens aged 15 to 19 from 2011 to 2015. The greater use of protection helped lower the rate of births by teenagers to 22 per 1,000 females in 2015 from 62 per 1,000 in 1991.  Teen pregnancy rates peaked in 1990 and have since fallen more than 50 percent, said Joyce Abma, researcher at the National Center for Health Statistics, who co-authored the report with Gladys Martinez. In a phone interview, Abma said the level of sexual activity among teenagers fell sharply until about 2002 and had since gradually declined, while the use of contraceptives had steadily increased. The study found that among males aged 15 to 19, about 44 percent have had sex, down from 60 percent in 1988. For females, that rate was 42 percent in the recent study compared with 51 percent in 1988.  Teenagers are generally more responsible than most parents think when it comes to when and if to have sex, said Bill Albert, spokesman for the nonprofit National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.  Adults, when they think of teen sexual culture, they see little more than a blur of bare midriffs,  Albert said. Among the teen females who have had sex, 74 percent had intercourse for the first time with someone with whom they were  going steady,  compared with 51 percent of the males, the study found. Twenty percent of the females and nearly 40 percent of the males said their first experiences were with someone they considered  just friends  or  going out (with) every once in a while.  About 2 percent of females and 7 percent of males said they had sex for the first time with someone they just met, the study showed.

Burling, who at 26 has been the youngest helmsman in the 35th America's Cup, is the epitome of understatement and outwardly unruffled by going 3-0 up against the U.S. holders in the first phase of the first-to-seven final last weekend. Thin and gangly, Burling says little while calmly steering Emirates Team New Zealand's 50-foot foiling catamaran at speeds approaching 50 knots (92.6 km per hour). He does not waste words when dealing with questions from the media onshore, always responding but giving little away. The contrast with Spithill, known affectionately by some as the 'pitbull', could not be starker. The straight-talking 37-year-old Australian sailor chats constantly with his Oracle Team USA crew while racing on Bermuda's Great Sound. Spithill started sailing young and at the age of 20 was named skipper of Young Australia for the 2000 America's Cup, becoming the youngest helmsman in the history of the event, which is the oldest trophy in international sport. With years of experience behind him and a confidence which has seen him win the  Auld Mug  twice, Spithill is not afraid of getting into a war of words off the water, with a reputation for making pointed jibes at his opponents. Pressure Rising  Both teams were out practicing on the water on Thursday, preparing for racing to restart on Saturday. The pressure is on comeback specialist Spithill to repeat the magic he conjured up in San Francisco in 2013 when his team staged a spectacular recovery from 8-1 down to win 9-8. Now, with five rest days to tweak their high-tech flying machines, which lift up on their foils and skim across the water at breakneck speeds, the teams have been working round the clock in their bases and out on the Great Sound to find extra speed. While the America's Cup is as much a design as a sailing race, with tens of millions of dollars invested in the racing boats, psychological games are also crucial. The charismatic Spithill has more expertise in match racing, the sailing equivalent of a boxing contest, and the benefit of nearly two decades of America's Cup experience. But none of this seems to have rattled the low-key Burling, despite a capsize in a semi-final race which nearly ended the Kiwi dream of avenging the 2013 defeat that still haunts New Zealand. Before he and the crew went out for their shake-down on Thursday, Burling sat casually with his feet dangling over the edge of the dock pulling his shoes on.  The New Zealander's face was covered as usual with a ghostly mask of sun screen, eyes hidden behind dark wrap around glasses. With huge home interest and support behind them, the Kiwis' every move is scrutinized by the New Zealand media as well as Oracle Team USA, who are watching closely to see what they can learn from their opponent's set-up.

In a report, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) analysts led by Javier Martínez de Olcoz Cerdán said Kroton's planned takeover of Estácio has approximately a 75 percent chance of being rejected, based on a selloff of both stocks on Monday and Tuesday. Investors drove shares of Kroton (KROT3.SA) and Estácio (ESTC3.SA) down 7 percent and 14 percent, respectively. However, Martínez sees a 60 percent chance the deal will be approved on the condition that the companies sell assets accounting for 15 percent of the combined entity's revenue. The rout in the shares of both companies came after two Brazilian newspapers said antitrust watchdog Cade is considering vetoing Kroton's takeover of Estácio at a meeting scheduled for June 28. According to the report, only one of the agency's five directors, Cristiane Alkmin, has given signs that the deal could be approved. Scrutiny of the Kroton-Estácio tie-up comes as rivals and consumer groups air concerns about creating a juggernaut with 10 times as many students as its closest rival in Brazil. Reuters reported on June 5 that Cade has demanded asset sales larger than initially expected by Kroton as a condition to approve the deal. In February, a preliminary report by the watchdog's economic analysis division said the deal could hamper competition and lead to higher costs for consumers. Cade, Kroton and Estácio declined to comment. Martínez interviewed more than 80 local and foreign investors between June 13 and June 19 to understand their views about the Kroton-Estácio deal.  His conclusion that shares are pricing in a no-deal scenario stems from expectations by those investors that Kroton and Estácio would be down 9 percent and 13 percent if Cade rejected the combination.

Opponents said they would likely seek to overturn the decision, arguing that the measure allowed for sweeping discrimination against the LGBT community. A three-judge panel at the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a lower court ruling that blocked the 2016 law, known as House Bill 1523 and backed by Christian groups, from taking effect. The panel said the plaintiffs, who included ordained ministers who have married same-sex couples and same-sex couples seeking to marry, did not have standing to bring the lawsuit.  None of these plaintiffs has clearly shown an injury-in-fact,  said the panel, which did not rule on the merits of the law. The Mississippi measure was one of a series of bills proposed in socially conservative, Republican-dominated states that critics saw as an attempt to erode the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide. FILE PHOTO: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant listens to Cuba's Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Rodrigo Malmierca (not pictured) in Havana, Cuba, on April 19, 2017.Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo This law is among the very worst in the nation,  said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights legal aid group, in a telephone interview. Sommer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they would likely seek further judicial review, either before the full Fifth Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge blocked the Mississippi law in July 2016, saying it unconstitutionally allowed  arbitrary discrimination  against the LGBT community and unmarried people.  The law cleared the way for employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access.  Under the measure, religious organizations would be protected when they make decisions regarding employment, housing, the placement of children in foster or adoptive homes, or the solemnization of a marriage based on their beliefs, the appeals court wrote. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican who signed HB 1523 into law in April 2016, applauded Thursday's ruling. The state has defended the measure as a reasonable accommodation intended to protect businesses and individuals seeking to exercise their religious views.   As I have said all along, the legislation is not meant to discriminate against anyone, but simply prevents government interference with the constitutional right to exercise sincerely held religious beliefs,  Bryant said in a statement.

Forbes - whose three-year term on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee ends next week - has voted since March to raise British interest rates from their record-low 0.25 percent. In her final speech as an MPC member, she expanded on research she published last week which argued that sterling weakness had a longer-term effect on inflation than the BoE typically assumed.  'Lift-off' of UK interest rates should not be delayed any longer,  she said in a speech at the London Business School.  Sterling's depreciation has fundamentally shifted underlying inflation dynamics in a way that makes it more pressing to begin this voyage soon.  Forbes's remarks come after a turbulent seven days which have seen a big split emerge on the MPC at a time when inflation is picking up but growth prospects are unclear as the country prepares to leave the European Union. Two other policymakers unexpectedly joined Forbes last week in voting for higher rates, and the BoE's chief economist has said he is likely to do so later this year once the  dust cloud  around Britain's political outlook has cleared. One major bank, Nomura, said earlier on Thursday that it expected the BoE to raise rates at its next meeting in August - far earlier than the 2019 date given by most economists in a Reuters poll at the start of the month. Related CoveragePound hits session highs after BoE's Forbes rate-hike remarksBut BoE Governor Mark Carney has poured cold water on the chances of a rate hike, highlighting  anemic  wage growth which is likely to drag down on inflation once the effect of currency weakness fades. Britain's economy slowed in the first quarter of this year after an unexpectedly robust performance in 2016, though the BoE expects reasonable growth overall this year and next.  The UK economy appears to be solid enough on key economic criteria, and even 'overstimulated' by others, such that a moderate reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus ... makes sense,  Forbes said. Weak wage growth - a factor cited by both Carney and policymaker Andrew Haldane - was not a good enough reason to hold off from raising rates, given Britain's low productivity and other price pressures.  A key lesson from monetary history is that a tightening cycle should start before wages accelerate to reach their level consistent with sustainable 2 percent inflation,  Forbes added. Forbes said that a potential weakening in consumer spending, and the effect of a rate rise on sterling, were concerns for those of her colleagues who did not want to raise rates yet. But she said the fact that the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates should reduce the impact on sterling of a BoE rate rise, as should markets' current focus on Brexit talks rather than the monetary policy outlook. The United States' experience also suggested that household saving rates could fall further to support consumer spending if needed, she added. Reluctance Forbes said both the BoE and the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared less willing to raise interest rates than in the past. Possible reasons for this included greater accountability and public scrutiny than in earlier decades, which could make policymakers unwilling to take measures that were unpopular in the short-run. Another factor for the BoE could be its new responsibilities for financial stability, which gave senior BoE staff on the MPC less time to look in-depth at emerging inflation threats and challenge any internal consensus. Tighter BoE mortgage rules in 2014 were one factor that Forbes said had made her pause for thought over raising rates.  These institutional changes may provide substantial benefits for the central bank as a whole and overall economy, but these changes may also have played a role in making it more difficult to increase interest rates,  Forbes said.

Cladding, added during a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, may have played a part in the June 14 disaster when flames sped through the 24-storey residential building, trapping people inside, residents have said.  The blaze in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Britain's worst since World War Two, has heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, already fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election.  The Grenfell tragedy has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts. There have been accusations of criminal negligence and, if more buildings are deemed unsafe, the government faces the task of rehoming people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched.  The estimate provided to us by councils is that there are approximately 600 high-rise buildings with similar cladding,  May's spokeswoman told reporters. Government had no estimates yet for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, she said. Cladding panels are often added to the exterior of buildings to insulate them and, particularly in the case of ageing tower blocks, to improve their external appearance. The panels vary in terms of their fire resistance depending on their intended use.   In terms of the people who are living in those buildings, we will do a further test to make sure the buildings are safe - obviously nobody will be living in buildings that are unsafe,  May's spokeswoman said, adding that people would be rehoused if necessary.    A spokesman for the communities and local government department, the office in charge of testing the buildings, later said that the 600 figure was an estimate of how many had any form of cladding and not an indication of how many would eventually be found to be dangerous. Earlier May announced that cladding used on some buildings had been found to be combustible with her local government minister saying eleven had so far tested as combustible.   (We) should of course be careful on speculating what caused this fire, but as a precaution the government has arranged to test cladding on all relevant tower blocks,  May told parliament. A panel of cladding is missing on a tower block on the Chalcots estate are seen in Camden after the local council announced they would be removing alumium cladding in light of the fire at the Grenfell Tower, in London, Britain, June 22, 2017.Hannah McKay I was informed that a number of these tests have come back as combustible.  She said local authorities and fire services were taking steps to make affected buildings safe and to inform residents.  May has launched a public inquiry into the fire and police have announced a criminal investigation. Tests on the cladding of Grenfell Tower would be made public in the next 48 hours, she said. Slideshow (13 Images)Removal Works Leaders of the council in another London borough, Camden, said it would remove external cladding panels from five tower blocks on a local estate after finding they were not to the standard it had commissioned. The council said it was informing the contractor which installed the cladding, made up of aluminum panels with a polyethylene core, that it was taking urgent legal advice. It said that until the panels had all been removed, there would be round-the-clock fire safety patrols on the estate.  This has been a wake-up call for the whole country,  said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party.  Residents of tower blocks all over the country are concerned, worried and frightened for their own safety. What we need is a step change in our attitude towards housing in this country.  After apologizing for a slow state response to the fire, May said it was right that Nicholas Holgate, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council, had resigned. He said he was forced out by the government.

One major bank, Nomura, said earlier on Thursday that it expected the BoE to raise rates at its next meeting in August - far earlier than the 2019 date given by most economists in a Reuters poll at the start of the month. Related CoveragePound hits session highs after BoE's Forbes rate-hike remarksBut BoE Governor Mark Carney has poured cold water on the chances of a rate hike, highlighting  anemic  wage growth which is likely to drag down on inflation once the effect of currency weakness fades. Britain's economy slowed in the first quarter of this year after an unexpectedly robust performance in 2016, though the BoE expects reasonable growth overall this year and next.  The UK economy appears to be solid enough on key economic criteria, and even 'overstimulated' by others, such that a moderate reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus ... makes sense,  Forbes said. Weak wage growth - a factor cited by both Carney and policymaker Andrew Haldane - was not a good enough reason to hold off from raising rates, given Britain's low productivity and other price pressures.  A key lesson from monetary history is that a tightening cycle should start before wages accelerate to reach their level consistent with sustainable 2 percent inflation,  Forbes added. Forbes said that a potential weakening in consumer spending, and the effect of a rate rise on sterling, were concerns for those of her colleagues who did not want to raise rates yet. But she said the fact that the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates should reduce the impact on sterling of a BoE rate rise, as should markets' current focus on Brexit talks rather than the monetary policy outlook. The United States' experience also suggested that household saving rates could fall further to support consumer spending if needed, she added. Reluctance Forbes said both the BoE and the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared less willing to raise interest rates than in the past. Possible reasons for this included greater accountability and public scrutiny than in earlier decades, which could make policymakers unwilling to take measures that were unpopular in the short-run. Another factor for the BoE could be its new responsibilities for financial stability, which gave senior BoE staff on the MPC less time to look in-depth at emerging inflation threats and challenge any internal consensus. Tighter BoE mortgage rules in 2014 were one factor that Forbes said had made her pause for thought over raising rates.  These institutional changes may provide substantial benefits for the central bank as a whole and overall economy, but these changes may also have played a role in making it more difficult to increase interest rates,  Forbes said.

Burling, who at 26 has been the youngest helmsman in the 35th America's Cup, is the epitome of understatement and outwardly unruffled by going 3-0 up against the U.S. holders in the first phase of the first-to-seven final last weekend. Thin and gangly, Burling says little while calmly steering Emirates Team New Zealand's 50-foot foiling catamaran at speeds approaching 50 knots (92.6 km per hour). He does not waste words when dealing with questions from the media onshore, always responding but giving little away. The contrast with Spithill, known affectionately by some as the 'pitbull', could not be starker. The straight-talking 37-year-old Australian sailor chats constantly with his Oracle Team USA crew while racing on Bermuda's Great Sound. Spithill started sailing young and at the age of 20 was named skipper of Young Australia for the 2000 America's Cup, becoming the youngest helmsman in the history of the event, which is the oldest trophy in international sport. With years of experience behind him and a confidence which has seen him win the  Auld Mug  twice, Spithill is not afraid of getting into a war of words off the water, with a reputation for making pointed jibes at his opponents. Pressure Rising  Both teams were out practicing on the water on Thursday, preparing for racing to restart on Saturday. The pressure is on comeback specialist Spithill to repeat the magic he conjured up in San Francisco in 2013 when his team staged a spectacular recovery from 8-1 down to win 9-8. Now, with five rest days to tweak their high-tech flying machines, which lift up on their foils and skim across the water at breakneck speeds, the teams have been working round the clock in their bases and out on the Great Sound to find extra speed. While the America's Cup is as much a design as a sailing race, with tens of millions of dollars invested in the racing boats, psychological games are also crucial. The charismatic Spithill has more expertise in match racing, the sailing equivalent of a boxing contest, and the benefit of nearly two decades of America's Cup experience. But none of this seems to have rattled the low-key Burling, despite a capsize in a semi-final race which nearly ended the Kiwi dream of avenging the 2013 defeat that still haunts New Zealand. Before he and the crew went out for their shake-down on Thursday, Burling sat casually with his feet dangling over the edge of the dock pulling his shoes on.  The New Zealander's face was covered as usual with a ghostly mask of sun screen, eyes hidden behind dark wrap around glasses. With huge home interest and support behind them, the Kiwis' every move is scrutinized by the New Zealand media as well as Oracle Team USA, who are watching closely to see what they can learn from their opponent's set-up.

At home they spend weeks without a visiting an ATM or a bank. They use mobile wallets to pay for meals, bills and cabs, or even donate to beggars; they invest their unused balance in money-market funds, still using their smartphone. But when they cross the border into the special administrative region, they leave such conveniences behind.     Cabs accept only cash. Not all small shopkeepers take cards, and they often charge extra if they do. Outside of big chains, mobile-payment penetration is shallow. Even as the People's Republic charges into e-commerce, mobile payment, and online peer-to-peer lending, Hong Kong still shops on foot and pays with paper and coins. The latter accumulates in pockets so heavily that special government trucks drive around buying up spare change.      A Hong Kong Monetary Authority study shows the former British colony is oddly cash-intense. The average person held nearly $6,000 in 2014 - second only to Switzerland.      To be fair, there's been no wholesale rejection of electronic money. Cards are used heavily and internet banking is ubiquitous. Even so, the financial centre, consistently found near the top of global competitiveness rankings, lags when it comes to innovation in financial technology.      The irony is that officials are eager to bag flotations of mainland companies like Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial and Lufax. But they have been slow to allow those companies to roll out systems. The first licenses for mobile-wallet apps were granted to Apple, Android Pay, Tencent and others in 2016. Alibaba's Alipay launched its localised app in May, more than a decade after starting on the mainland. Twenty years after Hong Kong's reunification with the mainland, in consumer-facing fintech at least, the city looks a decade behind. Institutional Conservatism     And it's not just the consumer side. A recent survey by PwC showed local financial institutions invest far less in fintech than counterparts in mainland China. The city risks stagnating as money pours into areas like blockchain technology and transaction security.      To be sure, culture plays a part. Cash has always had symbolic value in Chinese society. And some explanations for the imbalance are to Hong Kong's credit. Many of the problems China is busy leapfrogging via fintech - rickety traditional banking services, difficulty obtaining credit cards, and horrid retail experiences - aren't pressing issues for Hong Kongers.     They live in a compact city saturated with air-conditioned malls, so consumer demand for e-commerce and electronic payments is less urgent. In addition, for 15 years Hong Kongers have relied on a simple rechargeable card system, Octopus, for public transit and small purchases. Recharging Octopus is clunky, and it's hardly accepted everywhere, but its low-tech handiness may have bred complacency.     Moreover, much of the demand for physical dollars comes from mainlanders, who have trouble using their mobile apps and UnionPay cards. Capital flight into the Hong Kong dollar - which is pegged to the U.S. dollar - is another driver.      Image Problem     There are less benign obstacles. The PwC survey showed executives saw  regulatory uncertainty  as the top challenge for fintech in Hong Kong. Institutions, be they cab companies, banks, or mall developers, don’t want to be disintermediated. They have little to gain from a China-style financial revolution, and they can lobby effectively.      That the city's cabbies were able to fend off Uber is uninspiring to entrepreneurs. The banks earn plenty from deposits, credit-card issuance, and ATM fees. Mall owners look at China and see a nightmare: e-commerce killing rents. Their resistance, however, has created an embarrassing image problem for a city that is fighting for dominance among Asian financial hubs.     A wider problem with creativity is slowing development. Hong Kong has slid in the Global Innovation Index for four years, and now ranks far behind Singapore. Official support for entrepreneurs is lukewarm, and they struggle to find talent: the need to pay stratospheric rents drives most smart young people into the arms of giant institutions.      The HKMA is belatedly snapping into action. Last year it established a Fintech Facilitation Office to develop a local ecosystem. Octopus is upgrading itself. Now if only the cabbies would get on board, the city could stop running the coin-collection trucks.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hong-kong-fintech-breakingviews-idUSKBN19D0KD"},

Opponents said they would likely seek to overturn the decision, arguing that the measure allowed for sweeping discrimination against the LGBT community. A three-judge panel at the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a lower court ruling that blocked the 2016 law, known as House Bill 1523 and backed by Christian groups, from taking effect. The panel said the plaintiffs, who included ordained ministers who have married same-sex couples and same-sex couples seeking to marry, did not have standing to bring the lawsuit.  None of these plaintiffs has clearly shown an injury-in-fact,  said the panel, which did not rule on the merits of the law. The Mississippi measure was one of a series of bills proposed in socially conservative, Republican-dominated states that critics saw as an attempt to erode the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide. FILE PHOTO: Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant listens to Cuba's Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Rodrigo Malmierca (not pictured) in Havana, Cuba, on April 19, 2017.Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo This law is among the very worst in the nation,  said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights legal aid group, in a telephone interview. Sommer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they would likely seek further judicial review, either before the full Fifth Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge blocked the Mississippi law in July 2016, saying it unconstitutionally allowed  arbitrary discrimination  against the LGBT community and unmarried people.  The law cleared the way for employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access.  Under the measure, religious organizations would be protected when they make decisions regarding employment, housing, the placement of children in foster or adoptive homes, or the solemnization of a marriage based on their beliefs, the appeals court wrote. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican who signed HB 1523 into law in April 2016, applauded Thursday's ruling. The state has defended the measure as a reasonable accommodation intended to protect businesses and individuals seeking to exercise their religious views.   As I have said all along, the legislation is not meant to discriminate against anyone, but simply prevents government interference with the constitutional right to exercise sincerely held religious beliefs,  Bryant said in a statement.

The 31-year-old favored son of King Salman was already in effect the day-to-day ruler, with sweeping powers over defense, energy and the economy, even though his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, occupied the more senior job as crown prince. For two years the meteoric rise of Mohammed bin Salman stirred talk of strains and competition between the two princes, both known by their initials as MbS and MbN. That all ended on Wednesday when the Al Saud family publicly closed ranks around MbS following his sudden elevation by royal decree. MbN, stripped both of his rank as heir and his position as the veteran head of Saudi Arabia's internal security forces, was among the first to pledge allegiance to his newly elevated younger cousin. And yet questions remain over how the youthful MbS will consolidate his own network of power and patronage. Any jostling for power among the hereditary lines of state founder King Abdulaziz al-Saud is carefully hidden behind the ornate doors of royal palaces. Princes are keen to avoid a full-blown internal struggle of the kind that brought down two previous Saudi dynasties in the 18th and 19th centuries.  We know there's grumbling, we know there is unhappiness but so far everybody's lined up,  said Gregory Gause, Gulf expert at Texas A&M; University. He added that he did see not any evidence yet of a family  crisis . Abdulaziz, who founded the Saudi state in 1932 after conquering most of the Arabian peninsula, had at least 45 sons, of whom 36 survived into adulthood. Since he died in 1953, the country has been ruled successively by six of them. The next king will be the first from the next generation, and there are no formal rules for how to pick a successor from among Abdulaziz's scores of grandsons. The reshuffle has sparked speculation of late that the octogenarian King Salman could abdicate in favor of his son to ensure the first generational succession in 64 years takes place without a fight.  There is a very high probability that the king wants to oversee the transition while he is still alive. A big plan of transition is being put in place,  said Mamoun Fandy, a London-based analyst of Arab politics. Few Challengers Moving MbN out of the line of succession sidelines the most powerful member of one of the most powerful lines: the sons of King Salman's older brother Nayef, who ran Saudi Arabia's internal security forces for decades as interior minister, and was crown prince when he died in 2012. MbN's successor as interior minister is a 33-year-old grandson of Nayef, keeping the internal security forces in the hands of the Nayef line. But with little government experience and few personal networks to call on, the new minister will probably remain beholden to the king and crown prince, analysts say. Other princes that might once have been seen as contenders include Miteb bin Abdullah, a son of the last king; Khalid bin Sultan, a son of a former crown prince; or Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, the youngest surviving prince of Salman's own generation, deposed as crown prince in 2015.

Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout/File Photo via REUTERSBut any rival's path to bid for the throne is more difficult now that MbN has accepted MbS's ascension.  The game is lost because MbN is the one who could have resisted. But since he accepted, it would make no sense for Khalid bin Sultan or Miteb bin Abdullah to object,  a Saudi observer said on condition of anonymity while discussing the taboo subject.  The Al Saud will not resort to force to settle their differences. It would never happen.  As King Salman has sidelined potential rivals to his son by bringing in technocrats to replace senior princes in the cabinet, Prince Miteb has become the last senior royal in government not closely connected with the king or his son. Miteb commands the 100,000-strong National Guard, but a former senior Western diplomat said MbS would probably incorporate the National Guard into the Ministry of Defence, effectively sidelining him. There is no way to know what sort of horsetrading may have gone on behind the scenes leading up to Wednesday's decision inside the Allegiance Council, the family committee charged with formalizing the succession process.  The council, made up of representatives of each line of the family born to Abdulaziz, endorsed Mohammed bin Salman's ascension by a vote of 31 to 3. Most of the powerful lines of the Al Saud family appear to have been rewarded with senior positions.  No one said yes and left the room empty handed,  said the Saudi observer. In addition to the Nayef line keeping the interior ministry, princes from the lines of former kings Faisal and Fahd became advisors to the royal court. Discord To keep control, say analysts, MbS must deliver on domestic reform promises aimed at weaning Saudi Arabia off oil and also straighten out the kingdom's foreign policy, which includes a costly war in Yemen, heightened tensions with arch-rival Iran and most recently a move to isolate neighbor Qatar.  If he's perceived as doing a good job, it'll be much harder to mobilize popular opinion against him,  said Gause, the Gulf expert. He must also maintain popularity among the populace and key interest groups. While he appears to retain the confidence of many young people, the forward-looking prince has irked ultra-conservative clerics and tribal leaders while unsettling some businessmen. Over the decades when the kings were selected from the small pool of sons of Abdulaziz, discord within the family became visible to outsiders only occasionally. A group of princes in 1964 deposed King Saud in favor of his brother King Faisal, partly out of concern he was trying to establish a vertical line of succession through his sons rather than a horizontal one to his brothers. Faisal was assassinated by the son of another brother in 1975. Now, however, the power of other princes has been whittled away, diluted over the decades as Abdulaziz's sons produced scores of children and hundreds of grandchildren, making it harder to mount a challenge from within.  Saudi Arabia of the past used to be ruled by a politburo of elders, of brothers who shared responsibility and one of them stands out as a king,  said the Saudi observer.  Now MbS is the sole leader and everyone in the cabinet is at his service. These are all his servants.

A psychological phenomenon called anchoring - the tendency to make judgments relative to the first piece of information presented - is familiar to marketers, the research team writes in JAMA Dermatology. A $500 item marked down to $100 seems like a better deal than an item simply priced at $100, for example. And doctors might be able to use this trick to help patients get over an aversion to medications called biologicals that require self-injection. “Biologic medications are highly effective drugs. However, drugs don’t work in patients who don’t take them,” said lead study author Elias Oussedik of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  The researchers divided 100 adult psoriasis patients into two groups. Half answered a questionnaire that asked, among other questions, about their willingness to take a daily injectable medication and later asked if they would use a monthly injectable drug. Participants rated their willingness on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing “not willing” and 10 “very willing.” The other half of patients answered a similar questionnaire that only asked them to rate their willingness to take a once-monthly injectable drug. On average, people in the first group rated their willingness to take a monthly injectable drug at 7.5, while the second group averaged a rating of 2 on the same question. “We were surprised to see how unwilling patients were to consider a once-a-month injectable medication for their psoriasis,” he told Reuters Health by email. “After all, these drugs are some of the best treatment options for psoriasis and are, for the most part, hassle-free.” Patients who haven’t taken an injection for psoriasis may compare the possibility of taking one to not taking one, rather than how frequently to take one, the study team writes. Resetting that anchor could help patients overcome a fear of shots, they note. “Perceptions are malleable and these psychological tools widely used in commerce can be put to use in medical decision making, too,” Oussedik said. “We are hoping to repeat this study with a larger sample size to see if different cultures or groups of people respond differently to anchoring interventions,” Oussedik added. “We’re also looking at other behavioral economic principles and how they can be applied to the medical decision-making process.” At the same time, this behavioral economics approach, which offers a “bargain” for patients, poses some ethical concerns, the study authors acknowledge. Anchoring may be seen as manipulating patients’ perceptions, and shouldn’t be misused, they write.  “My first thought is that I do not think this is ethical,” Dr. Arthur Kavanaugh of the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “If there were two medications - one that was really injected daily and one that was really injected monthly and they were similar in terms of safety and efficacy - and I offered them both to the patient but first offered the daily one (perhaps because it was cheaper) and then the monthly one, that would seem to be fine,” said Kavanaugh. But this study seems to suggest consciously tricking the patient to encourage them to take an injectable medicine, he added. “To me, it would be similar to offering a fake drug with all sorts of horrible side effects and then offering an actual drug with actual side effects,” Kavanaugh said. “The patient would likely not worry as much about the side effects of the actual drug, so it would work, but I’m not sure it’s ethical.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s0xz78 JAMA Dermatology, online June 14, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-psychology-injectables-idUSKBN19D2LG"},

The justices ruled 9-0 that a naturalized American citizen cannot be stripped of citizenship if a lie or omission on immigration forms was irrelevant to the government's original decision to grant entry into the United States. They rejected the Trump administration's stance that the government should be able to revoke citizenship of people for even minor misstatements in the citizenship application process. The court sided with Divna Maslenjak, who had her citizenship revoked and was deported to Serbia after being convicted of breaking immigration law by falsely stating her husband had not served in the Bosnian Serb army in the 1990s. She entered the United States as a refugee. President Donald Trump has sought to restrict immigration and deport people who have entered the United States illegally.  This decision will ensure that lawful permanent residents who take the next step by becoming U.S. citizens do not have to live in fear that their rights may be revoked at any time,  said Arturo Vargas, executive director of National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. The ruling set a higher bar for the government to convict naturalized citizens for making false statements in the application process.  We hold that the government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in her acquisition of citizenship,  Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court.  We have never read a statute to strip citizenship from someone who met the legal criteria for acquiring it. We will not start now,  Kagan added. The legal question was whether Maslenjak's false statements had a material effect on the U.S. decision to grant her refugee status. The Trump administration argued it only mattered that she made a false statement, not whether it had any impact on its decision to grant refugee status. Srebrenica Massacre The justices threw out a lower court ruling in favor of the government and sent the matter back to that court for further consideration. The Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, when it again takes up the case, could still find that Maslenjak's conviction and loss of citizenship were valid because her statements were in fact material to her bid to gain entry. Maslenjak entered the United States with her husband and two children in 2000 and settled in Ohio, having been granted refugee status over a claimed fear of ethnic persecution in Bosnia at the hands of Muslims. She became an American citizen in 2007. At issue in the case was her concealment of her husband Ratko's service in a Bosnian Serb Army brigade that participated in the notorious 1995 massacre of about 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. After taking over the case this year, Trump's administration took the same stance toward Maslenjak that the administration of former President Barack Obama had taken. At a 2009 hearing to help her husband avoid deportation after he was convicted of making a false statement by concealing his military service, she admitted that when she had applied to be a refugee she had not revealed that from 1992 to 1997 the family lived in Bosnia and her husband served in the military. She was later convicted of lying on her citizenship application. During the April 26 oral argument in the case, Chief Justice John Roberts said the Trump administration's position could make it too easy for the government to strip people of citizenship for lying about minor infractions. Roberts seemed particularly concerned that the government was asserting it could revoke citizenship through criminal prosecution for trivial lies or omissions. Maslenjak and her husband were deported to Serbia last October.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-citizenship-idUSL1N1JJ0T5"},

Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,  has indicated he wants to get moving on this quickly, and we want to honor that,  Ryan said at his weekly news conference. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, a vote that looked like it might complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow. The measure must pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law or veto. The House parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a  blue slip  violation. Democrats said they were skeptical about the explanation, noting that previous  blue slip  issues had been resolved in a matter of minutes. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters he had sent the Senate a solution clearing the way for it to take the bill back, change it and move it forward. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters the change did not appear to substantively alter the legislation and that staff was reviewing it to determine how to move ahead. Senior Senate Democratic aides said any bill involving sanctions or fines could be interpreted as affecting U.S. revenues. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a larger majority in the House than in the Senate. Some lawmakers and congressional aides said the White House was concerned about a provision that would require Trump to obtain Congress' approval before easing any sanctions on Russia. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Congress last week to ensure that any sanctions package would give Trump the flexibility to adjust sanctions. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would not take a position before the bill advanced through the House. However, he acknowledged the White House needed to work with Congress on some areas of the measure. Ryan said he did not yet know if it would go through the formal markup debate and amendment process. Democrats have said that process could delay the bill for months. Asked if he supported the policy in the bill, Ryan said he supported sanctions.

On June 22, 2007, at what turned out to be a market peak, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson took their private-equity firm public in a ballyhooed transaction that inspired rivals to do the same. A decade on, the firm's units are trading only just above the $31 price where they sold ahead of their New York Stock Exchange debut. A better result over the next 10 years could require Blackstone to financially re-engineer itself. Even including dividends, assumed reinvested to derive a total return, Blackstone's performance has been just ordinary. At about 7 percent a year since the initial public offering, its stock has fared no better than the S&P; 500 Index, and at a much higher risk. The roughly $360 billion the firm has to deploy into buyouts, real estate and credit on behalf of pension and sovereign wealth funds historically has generated at least twice as much return for the investors in the funds Blackstone runs.  And while Blackstone units have outperformed the 1.2 percent total return delivered by shares of Wall Street blue chip Goldman Sachs, they've badly lagged some best-of-breed money managers, including BlackRock, the mutual and exchange-traded fund behemoth, and Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett's conglomerate makes for an apt comparison in that it's an investment akin to owning a slice of both Blackstone's publicly traded units and a piece of each of the companies held by its funds. (Breakingviews graphic: Blackstone total returns since IPO: tmsnrt.rs/2sZzjBZ) Public Good? Inside 32-year-old Blackstone, the stock performance isn't the main measure of the IPO's success. Simply going public conferred a certain brand status, particularly overseas. Selling a big slug of the new units to China Investment Corp also paid off. The early investor gritted its teeth through a share-price decline of nearly 90 percent at one stage and helped Blackstone forge relationships with other pools of capital in the People's Republic. Over the years, the firm has sold more than $30 billion of its holdings, including stakes in Hilton Worldwide and European warehouse owner Logicor, to Chinese buyers. And Schwarzman established a unique scholarship program at Tsinghua University.  The units also provided a currency to reward employees and to grow the firm. For example, less than a year after the listing, Blackstone used units to help fund the acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, which significantly enlarged its credit-investment arm. Since going public, Blackstone has quadrupled its assets under management while growing its workforce by less than three times, to about 2,100. That's a measure of the economies of scale Schwarzman and his right-hand man, Tony James, have produced, with the right people to help them. They're not alone, though. Over the same span, Larry Fink's far larger BlackRock has nearly quintupled the amount it oversees, to some $5.1 trillion, with two-and-a-half times the staff, now numbering 13,000. Opening its books to public scrutiny also may have made it easier for Blackstone to get a credit rating. That in turn has allowed it to borrow, but also to encourage incoming fund investors with an extra demonstration of its financial robustness. Stephen Schwarzman, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Blackstone, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 2, 2017.Lucy NicholsonMisunderstood Nevertheless, it is the stock-market perceptions of Blackstone that perplex Schwarzman, who routinely gripes about them. Merely putting its profit on the broad average price-to-earnings multiple would make it a roughly $50 stock, he recently argued. If instead of its recent dividend yield of about 8 percent the units were priced on the S&P; 500 average payout of a little over 2 percent, they'd fetch over $100 apiece, he claimed. With Blackstone's current market capitalization at about $40 billion, that would represent a huge markup for investors. Despite years of attempting to educate outside investors, and the subsequent IPOs of rivals such as Apollo, Carlyle and KKR, portfolio managers are reticent to ascribe much value to private equity's secret sauce, which is generating profit on investments and collecting a cut. Instead, it is steady management fees of 1 percent to 2 percent on assets that are coveted. This attitude favors investment managers who worry more about gathering assets than making money for those who invest in them. Blackstone did say from the start that its main goal would be making money for limited partners in its funds, a group which includes its own senior people, rather than for investors in the firm's publicly traded units. The trouble is that when the profit does flow through to unit holders, they don't value it as highly as they might. A New Decade Such an unchanging mindset suggests that if Blackstone is genuinely keen to see its stock rise more strongly in the next decade, it may take more than Schwarzman thumping the table. One option could be to pay a fixed annual dividend rather than a variable one based on performance. It's a solution that could perversely mean giving back less to unit holders than the firm has of late, but it might help assuage investor fears about the lumpiness of returns. Any excess funds stockpiled also could be used to buy back units, thus enabling Blackstone, in theory at least, to goose their price. One case study is not encouraging so far, though. KKR unveiled such a plan in October 2015 and has not benefited much in terms of its stock price. An even bigger Blackstone makeover might have a greater effect. Converting the firm from a partnership to a more conventional sort of corporation would garner considerable attention. For one thing, it would make its stock eligible for entry into indexes, thus attracting many forced, index-following buyers. Investors who are currently put off by the firm's complex partnership structure and paperwork might consider putting their money into a simpler Blackstone that has shares, not units, and pays regular corporate taxes rather than passing untaxed income through to unit holders. Such a radical restructuring, though, could require a reduction in U.S. business tax rates to make it financially worthwhile. In one of his other roles, Schwarzman is serving as a consigliere to President Donald Trump, who says he is eager to cut taxes. The association may provide a modest advantage. More likely, though, is that Blackstone and its leadership team will have to find one for themselves.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The 67-year-old New Yorker, who has overseen the sale of more than 10,000 aircraft worth $1 trillion since 1994, has said he plans to retire by end-year. But he went a step further on Thursday as he ruled out going to the Dubai Airshow in November. He pledged to ensure a smooth transition to his designated internal successor, Kiran Rao.  We want to have a smooth transition with Kiran and the team. We don't want people sitting around the canteen trying to figure out 'what does this mean for me'?  After suffering a rare air show defeat at the hands of Boeing in brutal heat at the Paris Airshow this week, Leahy talked about the pros and cons of a stage he has made his own. It turns out the man who has reigned supreme over air shows for more than 20 years was never particularly fond of them.  After I retire I will not come back to an air show. I don't see any reason to do that. Air shows are hot and sometimes very wet, they can be cold and windy, they are crowded, you never have enough time for people,  he said.  The only useful thing about an air show is that it is a deadline, a point in time. You talk to people when negotiations have been going on for months...and you say 'this is my best and final (offer); it can be announced at the air show and we have got a deal,' and they say 'no I want more',  he said.

The 67-year-old New Yorker, who has overseen the sale of more than 10,000 aircraft worth $1 trillion since 1994, has said he plans to retire by end-year. But he went a step further on Thursday as he ruled out going to the Dubai Airshow in November. He pledged to ensure a smooth transition to his designated internal successor, Kiran Rao.  We want to have a smooth transition with Kiran and the team. We don't want people sitting around the canteen trying to figure out 'what does this mean for me'?  After suffering a rare air show defeat at the hands of Boeing in brutal heat at the Paris Airshow this week, Leahy talked about the pros and cons of a stage he has made his own. It turns out the man who has reigned supreme over air shows for more than 20 years was never particularly fond of them.  After I retire I will not come back to an air show. I don't see any reason to do that. Air shows are hot and sometimes very wet, they can be cold and windy, they are crowded, you never have enough time for people,  he said.  The only useful thing about an air show is that it is a deadline, a point in time. You talk to people when negotiations have been going on for months...and you say 'this is my best and final (offer); it can be announced at the air show and we have got a deal,' and they say 'no I want more',  he said.

Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,  has indicated he wants to get moving on this quickly, and we want to honor that,  Ryan said at his weekly news conference. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, a vote that looked like it might complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow. The measure must pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law or veto. The House parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill affecting government revenues must originate in the House, something known as a  blue slip  violation. Democrats said they were skeptical about the explanation, noting that previous  blue slip  issues had been resolved in a matter of minutes. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters he had sent the Senate a solution clearing the way for it to take the bill back, change it and move it forward. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters the change did not appear to substantively alter the legislation and that staff was reviewing it to determine how to move ahead. Senior Senate Democratic aides said any bill involving sanctions or fines could be interpreted as affecting U.S. revenues. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a larger majority in the House than in the Senate. Some lawmakers and congressional aides said the White House was concerned about a provision that would require Trump to obtain Congress' approval before easing any sanctions on Russia. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Congress last week to ensure that any sanctions package would give Trump the flexibility to adjust sanctions. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would not take a position before the bill advanced through the House. However, he acknowledged the White House needed to work with Congress on some areas of the measure. Ryan said he did not yet know if it would go through the formal markup debate and amendment process. Democrats have said that process could delay the bill for months. Asked if he supported the policy in the bill, Ryan said he supported sanctions.

BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a speech on Tuesday it was not the right time to raise interest rates, while the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, separately said he expected to vote for a rate rise later this year. That split came barely a week after three members of the central bank's eight-strong rate-setting committee voted to hike record low interest rates, fuelling differing views among investors over when the Bank would make the first UK interest rate hike in a decade. Sterling weakened almost 1 percent after Carney's comments, but was bumped higher after Haldane spoke on Wednesday, recovering to as much as $1.2704.  It hovered between $1.2654 and $1.2688 for most of the day, last trading flat at $1.2666 by 1440 GMT. GBP=D3 Against the euro, it was 0.1 percent higher at 88.10 pence. EURGBP=D3 Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist with CIBC World Markets said sterling's bump higher on Haldane's speech looked overdone.  The market has become a little over-excited about the prospect of monetary tightening in the UK...Haldane's growth assumptions I think are too elevated and accordingly if those are revised lower he will not be too hawkish and sterling support will prove to diminish.  An English ten Pound note is seen in an illustration taken March 16, 2016.Phil Noble/Illustration/File PhotoStrategists at Nomura took a different view, saying they expected the BoE to undo its Brexit-induced rate cut at its next meeting on Aug. 3.  With the Bank growing increasingly intolerant of above-target inflation, it has begun to feel that weaker data would now be needed to prove the case for keeping policy on hold, rather than stronger data being required to justify higher rates,  they wrote in a note. Potentially adding to arguments for a rate hike from the BoE was a monthly survey which showed British factory orders hit their highest level in nearly 30 years in June. The same survey showed export order growth at its strongest in 22 years, helped by the fall in sterling's value that was triggered by Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union.  Outgoing MPC member Kristin Forbes, long an anti-inflation hawk on the BoE committee, is due to speak at London Business School later in the day. Investors were also following political developments, with Prime Minister Theresa May presenting to EU leaders her approach to giving guarantees to EU citizens over their rights in Britain. After a snap election eroded her Conservative Party's majority in parliament, May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to form a minority government. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said he was confident May would strike a deal with the DUP to gain support for her minority government, and DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a  very good  chance of a deal by next Thursday.  Sterling has had its Haldane-inspired lift, and probably has little further upside with the main focus on politics,  Kit Juckes, currency strategist with Societe Generale wrote in a note.

The Anglo-Dutch company is this week launching Persil Powergems, a brand new kind of detergent that is neither powder nor liquid, after spending 18 million euros ($20 million) on research, development and marketing.  It remains to be seen whether the premium-priced, lentil-shaped crystals will make their way beyond Britain, the launch market. Not all innovations are hits, as Unilever learned when its now-abandoned Persil Power was found to damage clothes in the 1990s. But if successful, Powergems could strengthen Unilever's No. 2 position behind Procter & Gamble (PG.N) in a global retail laundry market worth $74 billion and lift the company, which investors are closely watching to see if its new cost-savings promises will hurt long-term growth.       We're not holding back or saying we have to pause, that we can't do this this year or next year, no. We are going straight ahead, investing as much as is needed,  Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever's home care business, told Reuters. This project, code-named  Dazzle,  was well on its way at the Port Sunlight R&D; lab in northwestern England in February when Unilever fought off a surprise $143 billion bid from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) that forced changes designed to show it can improve performance as an independent company.  It would've been throwing money away to not launch this one, but the question is, will we see more of these going forward?  said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.  They need to keep doing this type of thing because driving innovation is the lifeblood of big, branded companies.    Evolving consumer tastes and an onslaught of new, upstart brands that can gain popularity quickly mean that traditional multinationals need to improve their portfolios faster to protect market share. Frugality Unilever's Persil Ultimate Powergems Bio Detergent is seen in a photo illustration shot June 22, 2017.Simon Newman/IllustrationParanjpe said Unilever's heightened frugality would not interfere with that, and said adopting the  zero-based budgeting  approach making waves across the sector does not automatically mean investments will be cut. For example, he said the company's R&D; budget, of about 1 billion euros a year, was not being cut. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB)is an accounting method whereby all expenses must be justified from scratch for each new period. The approach, responsible for the fat profit margins at Kraft Heinz, is spreading throughout the industry as growth slows. Slideshow (2 Images) Many people have given ZBB a bad name, only thinking of it in terms of indiscriminately cutting things to shore up the bottom line. We don't believe in that,  Paranjpe said, citing Unilever's promise to reinvest two-thirds of the 6 billion euros in savings it has targeted.  He said his 10 billion euros-a-year home care business was a little ahead of its cost-savings plans.  It has given us a pot that has enabled us to invest in initiatives,  he said, referring to the 18 million euro splashout on Powergems, which covered things like a new line at its Warrington factory and new technology that allows fragrance molecules to cling to fabric throughout the wash.     In addition, he said a recent restructuring has helped speed cooperation between groups, allowing for more quick, local projects, such as a Thai laundry soap for black clothes rolled out in only two months after the death of the king sparked a year-long period of mourning. Keith Rutherford, head of R&D; for Unilever's home care business, said creativity is often boosted by restrictive guidelines. He cited financial or environmental concerns, which are both common on his team, which designs lots of goods for developing and emerging markets where disposable incomes are limited.  The more I constrain and say 'I want you to innovate on less than two euro cents per unit, or without the use of water', everyone initially says it can't be done,  Rutherford said in Port Sunlight, built in the 19th century by William Lever to house his soap factory workers.  And then about two weeks later, someone says they can.   Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/unilever-persil-launch-idUSL1N1JI012"},

Its departure threatened to leave some counties in some states, such as Tennessee, with no individual insurance choices in 2018. Other insurers, including Aetna Inc., also pulled out of the exchanges for 2018, while Anthem Inc has mostly pulled out of 3 states and remained in 11 others for next year. Other insurers, like Medicaid specialist Centene Corp and small insurer Oscar Health have said they will expand. After Aetna Broussard, speaking to Reuters in one of his first interviews since the deal to be bought by Aetna was terminated earlier this year due to antitrust concerns, declined to comment on recent Wall Street analyst research notes raising the company as a takeover target for rival Cigna Corp. Cigna CEO David Cordani said on Tuesday in an interview that it was interested in growing its Medicare Advantage business, but declined to comment on the specific possibility of buying Humana. Broussard said that if the company were to look at any deals, it would be doing it with the expectation that the Justice Department would use the same parameters it did under the Obama administration. Some Wall Street analysts have speculated that the Trump administration might be friendlier to an insurance deal.  If we were to evaluate a transaction, we would do so under the old environment, because we know that,  he said. Humana shares were up 1.2 percent at $238.95 and Cigna shares were up 0.8 percent at $171.57 in afternoon trading.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/humana-ceo-interview-idUSL1N1JJ1RA"},

Outlining the five main principles of her  fair and serious offer , May told other EU leaders at a summit in Brussels that she wanted to offer certainty to EU citizens about their future in Britain, again using a softer tone in her approach to Brexit. But while her five principles go some way to ease concerns of the roughly 3 million EU nationals in Britain, their leaders will no doubt want to see more detail and may query the lack of a firm cut-off date for any changes to immigration rules - the EU is insisting on no changes until Britain leaves in 2019. And her reduced stature, after losing her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election, among leaders who have made clear that they are more concerned about the future of the European Union than Britain's departure, could see her on the back foot.  The prime minister tonight set out details of the rights and status EU citizens in the UK will enjoy after Brexit - vowing to give them reassurance, and to make them a priority in negotiations,  a senior British government source said.  The PM said the UK's position represented a fair and serious offer – and one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK, building careers and lives, and contributing so much to our society.  It was her first foray into the Brexit talks, one which was timed to coincide with coffee at the end of dinner by EU leaders who have warned the British prime minister not to use Council summits as a negotiating chamber for Britain's departure. May outlined the plan many in her party who campaigned for Brexit hope will reduce the flow of migrants to Britain, then she left. The others went on to discuss Britain's departure from the European Union without her. Certainty May told leaders she wanted to offer certainty by saying no EU citizens in Britain lawfully would be asked to leave at the time of Brexit, and that all EU citizens lawfully in the country at the point of Brexit would be able to regularise their status. She would also offer any EU citizen resident for five years - at some cut-off date - the opportunity to get settled status, a new category which would treat them as if they were British citizens for healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Those who by then had less than five years residency would be allowed to build up to five years to obtain that status. The government will also offer a grace period of most likely up to two years to allow people to regularise their status so that  no one will face a cliff edge , she said. The 85-page residency form, which many struggled to fill in after Britain voted to leave the European Union a year ago on Friday, will be replaced by a more streamlined system,  using digital tools to register people in a light-touch way . In a nod to the million or more Britons living on the continent, she said that:  Reciprocity was, of course, vital.  But, even with the softer tone and expressed eagerness to sort out one of the relatively easy problems that the Brexit talks will have to unpick, there were bound to be sticking points. EU leaders argue that while Britain is in the bloc it must adhere to its rules. May offered a window in which to set the cut-off which can be debated with Brussels - no earlier than her confirmation of withdrawal three months ago and no later than Brexit, due on March 30, 2019, two years after it was triggered. There would be no changes until the latter date:  All EU citizens currently (in Britain) will have their rights protected under EU law until the date we leave the EU,  the source said. Other non-negotiables were the role of the European Court of Justice - May has repeatedly said that  we're taking back control of our own rules  and, the source said, EU citizens could rely on the protection of  our highly respected courts . The EU wants their citizens' rights after Brexit enforceable in their European court in Luxembourg. May's aides declined to add detail, saying the government would present a paper to parliament on Monday that would explore the implications of the changes for family members from non-EU states and marriages of people of different nationality. The EU has insisted that sweeping political guarantees are worth little without detailed legal agreements which tackle the complex diversity of people's family situations.  Both sides should seek to agree terms and give certainty as early as possible in the talks,  May said.

The S&P; 500 healthcare sector was up 1.2 percent, hitting a record high during the session. The sector easily topped other major groups on Thursday and has gained about 4 percent this week. Shares of hospitals and health insurers, the main focus of investors during Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, were higher after the release of the proposed legislation in the Republican-controlled Senate.  The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,  said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Favorable elements in the bill, according to analysts, included the elimination of taxes on industry and provisions to stabilize the insurance exchanges set up under former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.  A delayed rollback of the expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income Americans, also was seen as a positive move. A version of the bill passed the House of Representatives, where Republicans also have a majority, last month. Hospitals, in particular, have benefited from Obamacare's coverage expansion. HCA Healthcare Inc rose 3 percent, while Tenet Healthcare Corp surged 7 percent. Among large insurers, Aetna rose 0.7 percent and UnitedHealth Group gained 0.9 percent. Insurers that specialize in Medicaid also gained, with Centene up 3 percent and Molina Healthcare rising 2.6 percent.  We see the draft version of the Senate bill as better than expected and driving the out-performance particularly in our facilities coverage and also for our managed care names,  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note. Biotech stocks continued to fuel the sector. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index rose 1.1 percent on Thursday for a gain of more than 9 percent for the week. Biotech appeared to be benefiting from recent reports suggesting efforts by the Trump administration to rein in drug prices would be not be as harsh on the industry as feared.  There was very little that directly threatened the industry price structure,  said John Schroer, U.S. healthcare sector head for Allianz Global Investors in San Francisco.  I think that gave investors also a bit of comfort that we would not see something draconian.  For 2017, the healthcare sector has climbed 17 percent, against a 9 percent gain for the S&P; 500, trailing only technology's 19 percent rise among major groups.  After the initial strong start to the year that healthcare experienced, it has generally lagged other areas of the market,  Schroer said.   Now healthcare is taking on more of a leadership role.

The self-replicating worm infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, showing the potential harm fast-moving attacks can inflict and fueling new calls from regulators for firms to manage cyber risk. The WannaCry attack set off predictable alarms from technology firms and cyber security experts. But it was more than hype and the incident was seen as one of the largest in recent history. Risk professionals at financial firms should not dismiss the chance it offers to assess the state of the art in cyber space’s dark side.  With a month’s hindsight, it’s clear that the WannaCry attack was not a particularly innovative network exploit, known as a “worm,” and it did not approach the kind of damage past cyber attacks have wreaked on computer networks. Still it generated new insights on how regulatory changes, social media and digital currencies used in ransomware -- which lets hackers take over a computer until they are paid -- are posing new threats that risk professionals need to understand.  The malicious software behind the attack was a permutation of the decades-old  worms,  standalone software that can replicate itself and spread through computer networks.  Worm Was Blast from the Past “This was very much a blast from the past,” said Nicholas Weaver, who heads network security research at University of California’s International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. “It was the first widespread worm in a while, and it had a motive behind it — ransomware. It was fully self-propagating and moved quickly without any human intervention from system to system.” The global reach and the speed of the malware attack alone make it worth a full assessment and showed the need for rapid responses to attacks. In its aftermath, regulators are looking at firms' network security plans to see if they are designed to act quickly in containing and reporting similar incidents.  Most financial firms were well prepared, in part because they are the most regulated of businesses linked to the Internet, say computer security experts. In rankings of sectors that have been most harmed by cyber criminals, financial firms have been in the middle of the pack, or about average. Most U.S. financial firms had updated versions of Microsoft Windows that are frequently patched and had already been immunized against WannaCry.  New Times, New Threats But computer security consultants see risk rising for financial firms as hackers change techniques and look for new victims and exploits for which patches have not yet been installed — and the finance industry is seen as the juiciest target for a new wave of cyber criminals.  In the past, hacking has often been done for sport, and the prize has been disabling networks and winning respect among notoriety-seeking “black hat  hackers whose aim was to expose vulnerabilities, not to generate profit. The shift in recent years has been toward economic crime made possible by anonymous digital currencies that can hide the identities of hackers in ransom schemes.  The  black hat  malicious hackers can buy or swap malware on the so-called dark web, made up of secretive peer-to-peer sites that are not searchable by Google and other engines and are layered behind passwords and sometimes require special software to navigate.  “Ransomware overall is only going to get worse,” said Weaver.  Ransomware is the biggest threat people face going forward. It’s a big concern for me.” Three Lessons from Wannacry The first big lesson from last month’s incident is that WannaCry was avoidable. Firms that applied up-to-date virus patches were protected, and quick action by firms in reporting and dismantling the malicious code helped halt its spread so it lost momentum in just a day. The second is to back up data in case the malicious code defies the existing patches.  You have to apply the patches and you also have to back up data,  said Weaver. With no firewall or anti-virus software entirely fool-proof, every important piece of data should be backed up and stored securely somewhere away from the network, he added. The third lesson is that the participation of firms was critical in halting the spread of WannaCry, a point not lost on regulators. Regulators want to make certain firms are taking all of those steps, and reporting incidents is becoming increasingly important so that malware can be identified and disabled. New York Leads Cyber Regulation Since the WannaCry outbreak, regulators stepped up their reviews of firms’ response programs and issued warnings that they will begin penalizing laggards. The New York Department of Financial Services, which issued one of the nation’s first comprehensive rule books on cyber protection, requires firms to report attacks  as soon as possible but in no event later than 72 hours.  NYDFS said its new cyber protection regulation rules were  designed to help prevent and mitigate the issues triggered by WannaCry.   The NYDFS rules, which became effective in March(here), mandate bi-annual vulnerability assessments and  systematic scans  to review their systems' ability to withstand threats. Firms regulated by NYDFS, which oversees a wide swath of the financial services industry, are required to identify and document material deficiencies and institute remediation where needed to meet annual certifications of regulatory compliance. The new rules include requirements for computer virus stress tests and verification from cyber security experts on the soundness of the cyber programs.  Other Moves to Regulate Cyber Space  U.S. legislators within days of the WannaCry attack, proposed a new law, The Patch Act, or Protecting our Ability to Counter Hacking Act of 2017(here), introduced by Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. The law would create a permanent review board of government agencies and private firms to use a federal clearing house that tracks malicious code. The plan has generated bipartisan support and the tech industry has been largely supportive, since it has addressed privacy concerns for firms that share data on network intrusions. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also stepped up its cyber program since the WannaCry attack. The new co-chief enforcement, Steven Peikin, last week launched an initiative to crack down on cyber crime, starting with a review of cyber protection in the securities industry. He said in an interview with Reuters that  the greatest threat to our markets right now is the cyber threat.”  Compliance teams whose systems were unscathed by WannaCry should take note of the response by regulators, who clearly took the worm attack as a call to action. While U.S. risk professionals may be winning plaudits for shielding their firms, U.S. regulators show no signs of complacency. Tracking Wannacry The attack was mild compared with some previous incidents, but luck played a part in halting a larger outbreak in the U.S. time zone. WannaCry appeared first in Asia on May 12. Authorities suspect North Korea as the source of the malware, which spread quickly to Europe and the United States. Like many other recent attacks, the WannaCry attackers, whose identity remains unknown, were believed to have acquired malware on one of the markets that traffic in the malicious code used by hackers. The attacks were launched in multiple locations and timed to launch simultaneously.  The so-called “code execution bug” was designed to disable computers by a preset time unless a ransom of $300 to $500 was paid. The hackers left messages that they would initiate the code remotely, demanded payment in bitcoin.  Kill Switch  Saved u.s. From Wannacry Those who kept up to date on their Windows virus patches were protected. Still, there were millions of unprotected computers on networks around the world. But U.S. systems managed to avoid the serious problems seen elsewhere. The virus caused major disruptions in the UK starting May 12, but computer security experts were credited with quickly discovering the “kill switch” that disabled the virus in many locations before it could spread in the United States. That kind of luck can't be counted on, said computer security experts. Since each viral outbreak has its own unique code, there is no guarantee the next attack will be decoded quite so quickly. The only fail-safe is to back data up in case of an attack that hits networked data.  You need to build your own infrastructure so your computer can catch on fire and you still have all your data,” said Weaver.  You have to be in a position where if your computer and the attached disks catch fire you should be able to recover your data,  said Weaver. Losses Harder to Assess, Cyber Crime Becomes Economic For years, hackers presented a widespread nuisance factor for computer users. Digital vandalism sometimes led to inconvenient computer outages and lost files. In a typical “denial of service attack” computers sent millions of messages at favored targets such as government agencies or tech firms. The result was mostly embarrassment for the victims. The more serious attacks in the past have involved hackers working in isolation to steal personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers. Those attacks were more than mere mischief, and involved losses of money or identity theft. But such intrusions were relatively contained to clients and usually could be remediated by reaching out to customers in relatively low-cost settlements.  Cyber Crime Becomes Economic The rise of bitcoin has transformed the once-annoying hacker attacks to a new level that has led to potential losses that are harder to assess, although industry estimates already place it in the billions of dollars annually. Criminal networks are often loosely connected over networks like now-defunct Silk Road or the still active Shadow Brokers, and scores of dark Web sites have become gathering points for spreading malicious code.  For compliance and risk teams, the solution to an intrusion is no longer as simple as extracting the virus and going ahead with business as usual. Regulators require incident reports as soon as the event happens. The non-compliant firm risks enforcement actions and civil lawsuits if they fail to participate in quelling the attack. There are no innocent bystanders.  When computers are compromised and used to make an attack on another victim, the liability could be with your system,  said John Carlin, former U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, who chairs Morrison & Foerster’s global risk and crisis management team.  It might not seem like a big problem. But sometimes it turns out to be worse than first thought and if you don't report it to regulators from their perspective you kept it secret.  Cyber Insurance at a Premium Unlike break-ins aimed at stealing specific data sets, malware attacks are open ended, as the WannaCry attack demonstrated. Cyber insurers have been wary of the potentially vast liability posed by a widespread malware attack launched from an insured clients’ computers. It has made lining up insurance difficult, and expensive. The rising number of attacks has led to a sharp rise in cyber security insurance, said Aviram Jenik, chief executive officer and founder of Beyond Security. The cyber threat is,  not hopeless, but an urgent situation,  he added. Regulators are nudging firms to insure their risk, he said, and insurers are starting to offer rates more closely calibrated to risk than in the past.  The industry is maturing from the previous state of 'OMG hackers will come and destroy us all' panic to a more level-headed view that cyber security is a business problem,  said Jenik.  And just like any other business problems, it has to be dealt with appropriately.  With more tools to assess  cyber security readiness,  insurers can more easily know  where an organization stands, in terms of their security readiness and level, thus allowing insurers to offer a more tailored policy, and with better pricing.  Since cyber crime is now decades old, more is known about the workings of cyber crime networks.  But there are vastly more cyber hacker rings carrying out illegal operations, and there is now an anonymous payment system, with bitcoin. For insurers, risk modeling is beginning to resemble other industries where the economics of the market are becoming paramount, as opposed to unknown technology exploits. Insurers Finding Cyber Sector Comfort Zone  While the technology itself has not seen breakthroughs, compliance teams are facing the challenge of training and monitoring the people on cyber awareness, especially in the use of social media. The danger of social media exploits was shown this week as chiefs of numerous banking firms were hit by one or more email pranksters who fooled bosses at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays and the Bank of England.  Those breaches did not lead to revelations of sensitive information, but they did raise questions about potential vulnerabilities in email and engaging with clients, employees and counter-parties via social media.  It is, in many ways, an ongoing game. Software developers continually produce new and improved operating systems and do their best to minimize the risks of security exposures - but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to produce fully bulletproof software,  said John Verver, strategic advisor to ACL  So hackers continually look for weaknesses they can exploit, while security specialists continually test and check to see if they can find any weaknesses the developers missed or never thought about.   The moral of the story is really to be ever-vigilant. Many organizations - particularly in sectors such as banking and finance - are doing a good job in their anti-hacking efforts. But inevitably some organizations are not as careful and not as stringent.  Those firms may be the most likely to be hit by hackers, unless regulators get there first. --NYDFS rules:here (Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)

Welch, of Salisbury, North Carolina, told authorities he had been trying to investigate an online conspiracy theory, known as  Pizzagate,  that claimed the eatery was a front for a pedophile ring led by then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,  Welch said in a defense sentencing memo in which he asked for an 18-month sentence.

The attack was widely seen at the time as an example of how fake news reports that proliferated on the internet during the 2016 election could have a real-world impact on people's lives.  According to court documents, Welch had binge-watched YouTube videos about the alleged child-trafficking ring on Dec. 1 before deciding on his plan to invade the pizzeria.

The S&P; 500 healthcare sector was up 1.2 percent, hitting a record high during the session. The sector easily topped other major groups on Thursday and has gained about 4 percent this week. Shares of hospitals and health insurers, the main focus of investors during Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, were higher after the release of the proposed legislation in the Republican-controlled Senate.  The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,  said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Favorable elements in the bill, according to analysts, included the elimination of taxes on industry and provisions to stabilize the insurance exchanges set up under former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.  A delayed rollback of the expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income Americans, also was seen as a positive move. A version of the bill passed the House of Representatives, where Republicans also have a majority, last month. Hospitals, in particular, have benefited from Obamacare's coverage expansion. HCA Healthcare Inc rose 3 percent, while Tenet Healthcare Corp surged 7 percent. Among large insurers, Aetna rose 0.7 percent and UnitedHealth Group gained 0.9 percent. Insurers that specialize in Medicaid also gained, with Centene up 3 percent and Molina Healthcare rising 2.6 percent.  We see the draft version of the Senate bill as better than expected and driving the out-performance particularly in our facilities coverage and also for our managed care names,  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note. Biotech stocks continued to fuel the sector. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index rose 1.1 percent on Thursday for a gain of more than 9 percent for the week. Biotech appeared to be benefiting from recent reports suggesting efforts by the Trump administration to rein in drug prices would be not be as harsh on the industry as feared.  There was very little that directly threatened the industry price structure,  said John Schroer, U.S. healthcare sector head for Allianz Global Investors in San Francisco.  I think that gave investors also a bit of comfort that we would not see something draconian.  For 2017, the healthcare sector has climbed 17 percent, against a 9 percent gain for the S&P; 500, trailing only technology's 19 percent rise among major groups.  After the initial strong start to the year that healthcare experienced, it has generally lagged other areas of the market,  Schroer said.   Now healthcare is taking on more of a leadership role.

Spot gold        was up 0.3 percent at $1,249.17 an ounce by 3:04 p.m EDT (1904 GMT). It had added 0.3 percent in the previous session after touching a five-week low of $1,240.75.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled up 0.3 percent at $1,249.40.       Today is strictly a bounce day. You can't say this is anything more than a consolidation in gold,  said Bill O'Neill, co-founder of LOGIC Advisors, adding that a rise above $1,260 could attract technical buying and higher prices.     World stock markets edged higher, buoyed by a modest rebound in oil prices after the commodity hit 10-month lows, while the U.S. yield curve managed to stall its recent flattening.                  The uncontrolled oil price spill in the futures markets may have seen some traders pushing the risk aversion button and buying gold,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.      The primary driver appears to be the flattening of the longer-dated U.S. Treasury curve,  he said.      The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to almost 10-year lows on Wednesday as investors evaluated the impact of hawkish Federal Reserve policy on the economy even as inflation measures are deteriorating.                       Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates and yields, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.      The U.S. is on a solid growth path and on cruising speed, which justifies higher interest rates and also a stronger U.S dollar. This is something we believe will cause some headwinds for gold,  Julius Baer's Menke said.     In technicals, Mitsubishi analyst John Butler said any significant break on either side of $1,250 would be important for the price.       We have been testing the uptrend that prevailed at the end of last year at $1,240 and we have bounced off that level yesterday,  Butler said.     The U.S. dollar index       , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was little changed.     Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.04 percent to 853.98 tonnes on Wednesday.                  Among other precious metals, silver        gained 0.9 percent to $16.57 per ounce. Platinum        touched its highest in a week during the session and was up 0.1 percent at $924.40, while palladium        eased 0.4 percent at $884.60.

{"news_time":"2017-06-22 15:28:00","news_title":"House Judiciary Committee to hold hearing on mass torts advertising","keywords":"United States,Bob Goodlatte,Elizabeth Tippett,Ilana Kutinsky,Linda Klein,Lynda Shely,Shawn Fleming,US,OTC,ADVERTISING","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - The U.S. House Judiciary Committee is intensifying its scrutiny of advertising by personal injury lawyers looking for clients injured by pharmaceuticals. On Friday, the committee will hear about the consequences of legal advertising from four witnesses – two doctors who say in written statements that they’ve seen patients die because lawyers’ ads scared them off of their medications; a legal ethics expert who argues there’s no need for additional regulation of legal advertising; and a scholar of legal advertising who said in a fascinating and fact-packed overview that no widescale study has established a link between lawyers’ ads and patient decisions.  Advertising by personal injury lawyers has become a corporate bugaboo, especially for pharmaceutical companies facing mass tort litigation over supposedly defective products. Defendants can’t wipe the often lurid ads off televisions and the Internet because the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed lawyers’ First Amendment right to advertise for clients in 1972’s Bates v. State Bar of Arizona. So recently, the business lobby has put out the message that legal ads are spreading misinformation about safe, effective drugs.  On Thursday, for instance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent out news of a new poll conducted for its Institute of Legal Reform just in time for the House hearing. The poll found that 84 percent of those who responded said they would be concerned if they saw a lawyer’s ad for a drug they were taking. Twenty-five percent said they would stop taking the medication without consulting their doctor.  House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte has already tipped his hand on the questions the committee’s witnesses will address at Friday’s hearing, which is entitled “Examining Ethical Responsibilities Regarding Attorney Advertising.” In March, the Virginia Republican sent letters to state bar groups and the American Bar Association, urging them to require legal advertisements to carry a disclaimer advising patients to consult doctors before discontinuing use of their medication. Citing a resolution of the American Medical Association that said patient care is jeopardized by personal injury lawyer advertising, Goodlatte said the legal profession, “which prides itself on the ability to self-regulate, should consider immediately adopting common sense reforms.”  ABA president Linda Klein responded that every state already prohibits false and misleading ads and polices lawyers for dishonesty or fraudulent conduct. Those regulations, she suggested, are sufficient, given lawyers’ First Amendment rights and the importance of alerting the public about harmful products.  State supreme courts (and, therefore, the ABA Model Rules) would need to find a compelling interest to regulate such advertising beyond a concern that some members of the public might misunderstand an advertising message that is not misleading,” Klein wrote.  Written testimony from one of the witnesses scheduled to testify Friday at the Judiciary Committee hearing more or less echoes Klein’s letter. Ethics lawyer Lynda Shely of the Shely Firm argued that imposing more rules on ads “will not prevent misunderstanding by a few members of the public about advertisements that are neither false nor misleading,” her statement said. “The existing rules regulating lawyer advertising are sufficient to protect the public.” If doctors are worried about their patients dropping medication, Shely said, then those doctors should bear the responsibility of advising patients.  Two physicians said in written statements that the proliferation of ads by lawyers trolling for clients supposedly injured by the blood-thinner Xarelto has impaired medical care. North Carolina vascular surgeon Shawn Fleming said in written testimony that Xarelto ads have made patients “concerned, confused and even hostile.” The doctor said one patient with a pulmonary embolism flat-out refused to take life-saving blood-thinning medication because of such ads. That patient, Fleming said, later died from the embolism.  Michigan physician Ilana Kutinsky said in a written statement that one of her patients died of a stroke when she stopped taking Xarelto after receiving a lawyer’s flyer about its risks. “I strongly believe in freedom of speech but not when it recklessly places the public at risk,” Kutinsky’s statement said. “Making generalized, sweeping claims regarding medical treatments with no medical training is negligent and can have dangerous consequences.”  Kutinsky cited a Medwatch review of 31 patients who said they stopped taking Xarelto, without consulting their doctors, in response to advertisements by lawyers. Twenty-three patients experienced a stroke, according to the study, and two died.  Neither Kutinsky nor the U.S. Chamber, which also cited the Medwatch review, mentioned that the Medwatch study was conducted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Xarelto. I got that information from the written statement of House Judiciary Committee witness Elizabeth Tippett, a law professor at the University of Oregon. Unlike the other witness statements, Tippett’s testimony includes empirical evidence and actual scholarship. Perhaps not surprisingly, she concludes that the impact of legal advertising is more nuanced than hard-liners might like.  Tippett put a hard number on the market for legal ads. According to national advertising data she collected, national cable and broadcast networks ran 53,526 drug injury advertisements between July 2015 and July 2016. The cost of the ads – which tend to peak in connection with FDA actions - was an estimated $114 million, Tippett said.  Many of the ads are framed as “medical alerts” or “patient warnings,” apparently to grab viewers’ attention, Tippett said. When ads look like public service announcements or government warnings, she said, viewers may not recognize them as attorney advertising, particularly because ad sponsors don’t always identify themselves.  “Without knowing the intent of the advertisement, or who is sponsoring it, consumers will have trouble critically analyzing the advertising message,” Tippett wrote. “Consumers are actually pretty sophisticated at processing marketing messages but they need to be provided enough cues to trigger their preexisting knowledge.”  Tippett said the rise of advertising firms that specialize in generating mass torts client leads can complicate state bar regulation of ads because regulators don’t know whom to hold accountable. Her research, for instance, has concluded that legal ads masquerading as public service warnings are misleading, but apparently no state bar association or federal agency has sought to discipline any lawyer in connection with advertising to attract pharma plaintiffs.  According to Tippett, there’s still not solid evidence that legal ads cause patients to stop taking their medications. “Little is known about how consumers respond to the medical information in these ads, and whether they influence consumer decision-making,” she said. One of her previous studies found no association between increased drug injury advertising volume and Medicare prescription rates. But in research for an upcoming paper, she said, she and a co-researcher found some evidence that lawyer ads may be distorting patients’ perceptions of the drugs they’ve been prescribed.  Tippett is calling for the ABA to lead an effort to collect data on how lawyers’ ads shape consumer perceptions. She also believes that deregulating attorneys’ referral fees will ultimately benefit consumers by enhancing the transparency of the legal advertising business. Finally, she wants a rating system for legal ads that would call out deceptive advertisers.  The Judiciary Committee’s hearing starts at nine on Friday morning.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-advertising-idUSKBN19D2JK"},

The move comes as Facebook faces pressure from smaller rivals such as Nextdoor and Meetup, whose online networks bring together neighbors and people in the same area with shared interests.  Zuckerberg said on his Facebook page that his company's new mission is to  give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.   The previous mission was  to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.  Facebook's pursuit of that mission has been criticized in the past 12 months after the network became one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Zuckerberg said in February he wanted to boost the number of Facebook users who are members of what they called  very meaningful  groups. Only about 5 percent were members of such groups, he said then. The head of Facebook, with 1.9 billion users and $27.6 billion in revenue last year, was in Chicago on Thursday to meet people who run group pages on Facebook.  If what you're trying to do is run a group that has thousands of people, you need tools to help manage that,  he told CNN in an interview. Facebook wants to build those tools, he said.  Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google also hosts community groups, as do Nextdoor and Meetup. Nextdoor, a site for neighbors to meet one another and share news and advice, said on Monday it was expanding into Germany after rapid growth elsewhere. Zuckerberg told CNN that supporting organizations built around neighbors, churches, pets and the like has a larger purpose.   Once people are coming together in these smaller groups, that actually grows and it ends up with much bigger changes in the world,  he said.

Banco de Mexico raised its benchmark rate MXCBIR=ECI by a quarter percentage point to 7.00 percent, as expected by all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters last week. One member voted to hold rates, the bank said in a statement. The central bank has now raised its main interest rate in the last seven meetings. The rate has reached the highest level since early 2009, with inflation at more than an eight-year high. Policymakers said in their statement that with Thursday's hike  the reference rate has reached a level that is consistent with the process of efficient convergence of inflation to the 3 percent target,  though they said they would be vigilant.  I think they are saying they are done with the hikes,  said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura in New York.  That is very clear.  Even if the U.S. Federal Reserve were to hike interest rates later this year, as many in the market expect, Banco de Mexico might be able to leave its benchmark rate on hold, governor Agustin Carstens said in an interview with U.S. news agency Bloomberg. The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard Garrido Certainly it is possible, it depends on the context,  Carstens said.  We believe that where we are now will lead us to the 3 percent (inflation target) level at some point. We are ready to make the statement that up to today we think it is sufficient but we will be very vigilant.  Yields on short-term interest rate swaps MXNIRS fell sharply after the decision as investors cut bets on any more interest rate hikes. In a poll from last week, analysts had projected one more rate hike before the end of the year, taking it to 7.25 percent.  The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard GarridoThe board said the majority of members voted to hike in order to anchor inflation expectations and also to take into account last week's move by the Fed to hike borrowing costs. Analysts expected Mexico would match the Fed's quarter-point rate hike last week in a bid to maintain the appeal of peso-denominated debt to yield-hungry investors. Policymakers said in their statement the risks to growth were tilted downwards, but had improved on the margin. They said the risks to inflation were neutral given  the current stance of monetary policy.   Data earlier on Thursday showed that the annual inflation rate in early June rose more than expected to 6.30 percent, its highest since January 2009. But policymakers said in their statement that the inflation rate would peak in the coming months. The inflation rate has risen because of weakness in the peso, but the currency has rallied back from a record low it hit in January as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose big tariffs on imports from Mexico.

The Venezuelan state-run company is this time requesting 600,000 barrels of gasoline blendstock RON 91 and 95, up to 900,000 barrels of ULSD and 600,000 barrels of catalytic naphtha for delivery July 1-20 at any of its ports. It is also seeking up to seven 500,000-barrel cargoes of VGO and 720,000 barrels of MTBE (Methyl Tert Butyl Ether) from July through December. Some cargoes are to be paid 35 days after discharge. For other cargoes the company is willing to arrange oil swaps under a mechanism known as  offset.  Venezuela is a prominent oil producer, but its crude output has declined in recent years. Its 1.3 million-barrel-per-day refining network needs maintenance and a larger volume of light oil that the South American country does not produce. The Cardon refinery's catalytic cracker resumed normal work this week after reduced functioning. But PDVSA's largest refinery, Amuay, and the smaller Puerto la Cruz refinery are working partially. As of the end of last week, about 18 tankers carrying crude and fuels for PDVSA were waiting around its ports to be paid to authorize discharge, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.

For the second year in 2016, annual P/C insurer statutory financial statements include the Cybersecurity and Identity Theft Insurance Coverage Supplement, which provides helpful insights on cyber underwriting activity and performance for insurers. Fitch notes that the $1.35 billion figure likely underestimates the industry's cyber premium exposure as there are inherent challenges to breaking out cyber related premium from other coverages in multi-line coverage products.  Take-up rates for cyber insurance are increasing with frequent reports of computer hacking incidents, including: network intrusions and data theft, as well as high-profile ransomware attacks that are leading corporations to search for broader insurance protection against cyber threats,  said Jim Auden, Managing Director, Fitch Ratings. The industry statutory direct loss ratio for stand-alone cyber insurance improved in 2016 to 45% from 50% a year earlier. However, the ultimate profitability of the P/C industry's cyber insurance efforts will take some time to assess as the market matures and future cyber-related loss events emerge.  Future growth in cyber premiums will likely come from more consistent polity terms and conditions as insurers gain better understanding of loss potential and coverage, better cyber underwriting models, as well as efforts to comply with increased cyber regulatory standards across numerous industries, particularly financial institutions,  added Auden. The largest cyber insurance writers are American International Group, Inc., XL Group Ltd, and Chubb Limited.  These companies had a combined market share of approximately 40% at year-end 2016. The top 15 writers of cyber held approximately 83% of the market in 2016. However, over 130 distinct insurance organizations reported writing cyber premiums for the year.

The yen garnered some safe-haven demand on early weakness on Wall Street and European stock markets.  The Norwegian crown and the New Zealand dollar were the notable gainers in a quiet trading session after their countries' central banks showed confidence in their economic outlook. Among emerging currencies, the Mexican peso MXN=D2 jumped 1 percent after policy-makers raised rates by a quarter point to 7 percent following the Fed's rate hike last week. The dollar had strengthened as several Fed officials since last week have supported the notion of possibly another rate increase by year-end despite a recent softening of inflation. The bounce faded as doubts crept in as to whether the modest current economic expansion warrants further rate increases.  The market has not bought into the Fed's hawkish rhetoric,  said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.  The market is dubious about U.S. growth in the second half of the year.  The U.S. bond market has reflected traders' doubts as the yield curve on Wednesday flattened to levels not seen in nearly a decade.

The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                briefly flattened to 94.9 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007, as 30-year Treasury yields hit more than a seven-month low of 2.713 percent.     Later in the session, however, a recovery in U.S. crude prices from Wednesday's 10-month lows suggested greater inflationary pressures and pushed yields on long-dated bonds slightly higher.      At least today the long-end rally is taking a pause,  said Stanley Sun, interest rate strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York.     The five-year, 30-year yield curve                was last 96 basis points.     Yields on U.S. 30-year U.S. Treasuries have fallen since data last week showed the so-called core Consumer Price Index rose the least since May 2015.                  Demand for a $5 billion sale of 30-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) on Thursday was nonetheless strong, resulting in a yield of 0.880 percent, lower than what traders had expected.     The ratio of bids to the amount of 30-year TIPS offered              was 2.83, or the highest in a year. The ratio was 2.25 at the prior 30-year TIPS auction in February.                  Analysts said yields on short-dated Treasuries, which are most sensitive to Federal Reserve policy, remained stable to slightly lower on skepticism that the U.S. central bank will  raise interest rates again this year.      The timing for the next rate hike is definitely getting pushed out,  said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.  The market's not pricing in aggressive rate hikes.      Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are all due to speak on Friday.     The Treasury said on Thursday it will sell $88 billion in notes next week, including $26 billion in two-year notes on Monday, $34 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday and $28 billion in seven-year notes.

Smaller eastern and southern European economies that are dependent on Chinese investment have rejected any steps against Beijing, even going as far as to block EU statements criticizing China's human rights record. But Macron, at his first EU summit, said being an attractive destination for investment did not mean exposing Europe to what he termed  the disorder of globalisation , as he seeks to make good on a campaign pledge with a so-called protective Europe.  Things are changing because we see the disorder of globalisation and the consequences in your own country. I want to build an alliance around this idea,  Macron told a news conference during the summit of EU leaders.  I am for free trade ... but I am not for naivety.  State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, Beijing's biggest overseas sale to date, has deepened concerns in Europe that the bloc is ceding control of its advanced technology, EU diplomats said. Related CoveragePoland, Hungary scold Macron after his warning on valuesMacron, who defeated the anti-Europe, far-right leader Marine Le Pen last month, said that he had always been a defender of globalisation and free trade during his time as minister but that leaders should hear from workers hit by globalisation. The issues of globalisation and  social dumping  took center-stage in France's campaign after Le Pen used the relocation of a Whirlpool factory in northern France to Poland to paint Macron as a globalist who did not care about workers.  A free-trade advocate, Macron let several national corporate champions be taken over by foreign firms as a minister. But since his election he has sought to drum up support in Europe for what he calls a  protection agenda . He has found some support from Germany and Italy. EU leaders will agree on Friday to allow the European Commission to explore ways to limit foreign takeovers in areas such as energy, banking and technology, where China seeks Europe's know-how. In a statement, leaders will ask the Commission  to examine the need and ways to screen investments from third countries in strategic sectors, while fully respecting members states' competences,  a reference to national sovereignty on the issue. Berlin, Paris and Rome are upset that the Commission, the bloc's competition regulator, approved ChemChina's purchase of Syngenta while China maintains restrictions on EU investment. Chinese direct investment in the European Union jumped by 77 percent last year to more than 35 billion euros ($38 billion), compared with 2015, while EU acquisitions in China fell for the second consecutive year, according to the Rhodium Group. But free-trade advocates such as Sweden want to avoid any measures that might contradict the bloc's rejection of the protectionism promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Frits Bolkestein, a former Dutch European Commissioner, poured scorn on Macron's ideas on Thursday.  This Colbertist instinct — that French wealth should serve the French state — runs deep among its elite,  he said in a column in Politico, referring to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, French king Louis XIV's minister of finance and industry.

Macron made the remarks in an interview with European newspapers ahead of his first EU summit since becoming president last month, saying countries that don't respect EU rules should face the consequences. His comments come amid an escalating row between the European Commission and the right-wing governments in Warsaw and Budapest, which have introduced curbs on judges and the media that the EU executive says undermines the rule of law and democratic norms.  The French president is very young. He is coming here for the first time,  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told reporters at the summit.  His start has not been very promising. He thought yesterday that he could kick the central European countries. This is not how it works here.  Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo accused Macron of showing off his antipathy toward central European states in the media.  It's good to talk about facts, not use stereotypes,  she said. But Macron, who is due to meet with Orban, Szydlo and the leaders of Slovakia and the Czech Republic on Friday morning, received strong backing from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who usually steers clear of openly criticizing eastern states.   I believe it was important that Emmanuel Macron said this again. Germany and France are completely on the same page,  said Merkel, when asked about Macron's remarks. The European Commission has opened several legal cases against Warsaw and Budapest. Some EU states want to reduce EU funds for the eastern countries as punishment for their government's actions. Macron and the eastern states are at odds on a number of major issues currently under discussion in the EU. The French president has criticized them for not accepting refugees and is a vocal opponent of so-called  social dumping , in which companies employ cheaper labor, often from eastern countries, or move production to lower-wage countries.

The review will focus in part on accusations from some current and former employees that bribes were involved, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP, which is in the early stages of the probe, was hired by the ride service after employees gave contradictory accounts of how Uber obtained the medical records, one of the people said.  The firm is also exploring whether former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knew how Uber came into possession of the records, the person added. Kalanick through a spokesman declined to comment. Uber also declined to comment, and O'Melveny & Myers did not respond to a request for comment.      Members of Uber's board were briefed about the investigation in recent days, shortly before five major Uber investors sent a letter to Kalanick to demand his resignation, said the person. The probe was likely one reason the board turned against Kalanick, who stepped down on Tuesday, the first person said. The investigation is ongoing and has not reached any conclusions on whether Uber improperly obtained the records. Reuters has no evidence that bribery occurred.  The rape victim sued Uber last week, accusing the ride service operator of improperly obtaining and sharing her medical records. The suit said that shortly after the rape occurred, former Uber Asia chief Eric Alexander  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.  Alexander, through spokeswoman Heather Wilson, denied paying any bribes and said that the files containing the victim's records had been obtained through appropriate, legal methods. An employee walks inside the office of ride-hailing service Uber in Gurugram, previously known as Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, April 19, 2016.Anindito MukherjeeA Delhi police spokesman did not answer multiple phone calls from Reuters to seek comment. The rapist was convicted in 2015. According to a person familiar with conversations between Kalanick and Alexander, the two executives had discussed obtaining the victim's records because they suspected the rape might have been fabricated by an Uber rival to damage the company.  Another person said Alexander showed the medical files to colleagues in New Delhi more than once. Wilson denied that Alexander had discussed or shared the records with colleagues. She said that Alexander believed the victim was raped and never expressed the view that it was a set up. Uber fired Alexander earlier this month. Kalanick, 40, announced late on Tuesday that he was resigning as chief executive, though he would remain on the board of Uber. He said he had accepted  the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.  Privately held Uber has grown from startup to a global ride  service valued at $68 billion in less than a decade, driven by Kalanick, who set the tone of a company that challenged laws and norms to succeed.  Confidence in Kalanick had been strained this year by claims of sexual harassment in the company and a lawsuit accusing Uber of benefiting from trade secrets stolen from self-driving car technology from Alphabet Inc's Waymo.

The S&P; healthcare index was up 1.2 percent after hitting its fourth record high in a row following the release of the bill, which is aimed at curbing Medicaid funding and reshaping subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. The index has risen 4 percent in five sessions. The Nasdaq biotechnology index rose 1 percent giving it an 9 percent jump for the week so far. Johnson & Johnson and Gilead were among the biggest boosts for the S&P; 500 with 1 percent and 4.3 percent gains. The rebound in the oil futures market pushed the S&P; energy index up 0.22 percent after 3.5 percent of losses in the previous three sessions.  Oil's had a tough run in the last handful of weeks. I wouldn't say oil being up today gives anybody a high degree of confidence we've seen a floor in oil yet,  Michael Scanlon, managing director, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. Gains were muted on Thursday and investors looked forward to earnings, according to Scanlon.

Some investors were worried about the impact of low oil prices on inflation, which remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target even as it raises interest rates.  Right now the bond market seems to be convinced that inflation is going to remain much lower than what the Fed thinks,  Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The S&P; bank index was down 0.6 percent ahead of the release of the sector's annual stress test results after the market close on Thursday. Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last week increased by 3,000 to 241,000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market. Oracle, up 8.8 percent, provided the biggest boost to the S&P; after the company forecast an upbeat current-quarter profit. Among stocks, Accenture was off 4.5 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider trimmed its annual revenue forecast. Tesla was up 2.2 percent at $384.56 after the company said it was in exploratory talks with the Shanghai municipal government to establish an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in China.

The rule should focus only on banks that do a lot of trading, said Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  We believe we have the authority to draw a line between those with the big trading books (and other banks),  he told the Senate Banking Committee.  We could have that group regulated one way and have everyone else regulated less, a lot less.  Powell was one of five regulators testifying before the committee, days after the U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a plan to revamp or undo many rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wall Street banks have fought Volcker vigorously, saying it is overly complicated and hurts market liquidity. The Treasury plan is part of a broader effort by Republican President Donald Trump to cut regulations that he says are holding back economic growth. Democrats and consumer advocates largely oppose the plan, saying it would lead to more reckless behavior by the banking industry. At the hearing, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street, described the Treasury’s recommendations as  basically cut-and-paste  from bank lobbyists. But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota, indicated clear support for re-examining Volcker.  What I’m hearing today,  she said,  is no one wants to go back, but everybody wants to tailor a rule or find a rule that can in fact accomplish the goal without overly burdening all banks.  Powell was joined by Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller of the currency, in calling for changes. Even Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin Gruenberg, the sole holdover from Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, said he was open to some small revisions.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-regulation-idUSL1N1JJ1MR"},

The court's ruling by no means guarantees a secret ballot will be held, however. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said whether a secret ballot actually takes places is up to the Speaker of parliament. But it ended any question about whether a secret ballot on Zuma could take place.  Zuma's critics want the no-confidence vote to be anonymous hoping it will embolden lawmakers from his African National Congress (ANC) party to support his ouster by shielding them from pressure. His administration has been beset by scandals and criticized for failing to address serious economic problems.  I think it is not fair because you are trying to increase the majority you don't have,  Zuma told parliament after the court decision. Zuma has survived four no-confidence votes during his eight years in power thanks to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority. But opposition parties believe a recent cabinet reshuffle that led to the dismissal of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan and a slew of credit rating downgrades have angered ANC MPs sufficiently to desert Zuma. Speaker Baleka Mbete, a top ANC official who now must decide the issue, had said secret ballots were not allowed under parliamentary rules. She was non-committal after the ruling, simply noting that she now had the right to decide. In handing down a unanimous ruling by the full bench, Mogoeng, the chief justice, said a vote in parliament should not be  a fear or money-inspired sham  and the Speaker should consider the interests of the country, rather than party, when deciding the nature of the vote.  Crass dishonesty in the form of bribe-taking or other illegitimate methods of gaining undeserved majorities must not be discounted from the Speaker's decision process,  he said.     When that happens in a motion of no-confidence, the outcome could betray the people's interests. .  The ANC -- once all-powerful as heir of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle -- has lost popularity under Zuma, underscored by its worst electoral showing in over two decades of power in local elections last year. South Africa's Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng (Top, C) looks on with other judges before making a ruling at the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, South Africa ,June 22,2017.Siphiwe SibekoSouth Africa has sunk into recession and had its credit rating downgraded to junk by two of the top three credit rating agencies. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7 percent.  I'm fit and I'm doing it (the job of president) very well,  Zuma said in response to a call by a lawmaker that he stand down as president. He said the economy would come out of recession  quicker than we believe . Secret Ballot? Slideshow (3 Images)One ANC lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in a secret ballot they would vote for Zuma's removal.  I would vote for him to go. He is ruining the country,  the legislator told Reuters. A member of the South African Communist Party (SACP), one of the ANC's allies in power, told Reuters he  would be guided by what the Communist Party has said about the president . The SACP, which has 17 lawmakers, said in April Zuma should resign. The party said in a statement on Thursday that  the Court went further in reminding MPs, all MPs regardless of their political party, that their oath of office is to the people of South Africa and not to a political party .  The main opposition Democratic Alliance party said Mbete, the Speaker, now would have little choice but to call for a secret ballot.  I think it's a great day for democracy for South Africa. I think the Speaker will be very hard pressed indeed to deny a secret ballot in this particular case,  said the party's Federal Executive Chairperson James Selfe.      The ANC rallied behind Zuma, however, saying it will vote against the motion to remove the 75-year old leader. A successful vote of no-confidence would trigger the collapse of Zuma's government.  We have unqualified and unequivocal confidence in the ANC caucus not to vote in support of a motion to remove the president,  ANC's parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu said. Zuma has suffered a string of judicial setbacks, but has held on to power with the backing of his party.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc's commitment of a C$2 billion (US$1.51 billion) credit facility to Home Capital Group Inc, Canada's largest nonbank lender, marks the billionaire's latest effort to shore up a company in dire need of cash.  It's a traditional, opportunistic Berkshire transaction,  said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research equity analyst, in an interview.  For Home Capital, the assumption is that Berkshire did its due diligence, and came to a conclusion that there was presumably a franchise and business model worth saving. It implies a seal of approval.  Home Capital shares soared as much as 18 percent, but was still more than two-thirds below the 2014 peak. The investment in Home Capital, which has acknowledged responsibility for mortgage fraud, also lets Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire deploy a small piece of its recent $96.5 billion hoard of cash, equivalents and Treasury bills.  Today's announcement is a modest positive,  wrote Meyer Shields, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst.  But it also reflects how difficult it is for Berkshire to meaningfully use its cash.  Berkshire also agreed through its Columbia Insurance unit to buy up to C$400 million (US$302 million) of Home Capital shares for a 38.4 percent stake, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. The credit line carries an interest rate of at least 9 percent, and Berkshire could collect C$180 million if fully tapped. Buffett came to be seen as a lender of last resort during the global financial crisis. From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire spent more than $25 billion to buy high-yielding stocks and bonds in such companies as Bank of America Corp, Dow Chemical Co, General Electric Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Harley-Davidson Inc. With those investments having passed, the 86-year-old Buffett has been struggling to generate income in a persistently low interest rate environment.  Home Capital's strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,  Buffett said in a statement. Berkshire did not respond to a request for further comment. Housing, Reputation Risks Home Capital has suffered a deposit exodus resembling a bank run since mid-April, when the Ontario Securities Commission accused it of deceiving investors. Last week, the company reached separate settlements with the regulator and investors over making misleading statements about its mortgage underwriting. Berkshire's investment reflects its willingness to commit to companies whose practices have drawn criticism. These include Wells Fargo & Co, now embroiled in scandal for creating unauthorized customer accounts, and Coca-Cola Co, often faulted for its sugary drinks.  Reputational risk is why he's getting 9 percent interest  at Home Capital, said Seifert. The investment comes after Berkshire withdrew a U.S. regulatory application in April to boost its Wells Fargo stake above 10 percent, citing limits on its business ties to the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Berkshire has more than 90 units, including manufactured home company Clayton Homes, ice cream chain Dairy Queen and HomeServices of America, the second largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage. Its foray into Canada comes amid uncertainty about that country's housing sector. The government has levied a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers to cool a frothy Toronto-area real estate market. Buffett is  not going to stop the credit cycle up there,  said Marc Cohodes, a short seller betting against Home Capital.  But it's a bailout by the most renowned investor on the planet.

The company did not disclose the vote totals for the directors. Investors agitating against Mylan's board had a steep threshold to cross as more than two-thirds of the shares voted, as well as more than half of Mylan's outstanding shares, were needed for the directors to lose.  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city's pensions and is one of the leaders of the campaign against the drugmaker's board, said the failure to disclose the vote totals suggests that the directors face strong opposition.  This company massively hiked prices on life-saving drugs, allegedly overcharged the government for its products, allowed excessive executive pay to go unchecked — all ultimately fundamental failures of board oversight,  Stringer said. Mylan said in response that it has always reported the vote totals in a filing with regulators after its meeting. The failed measure to approve the company's executive compensation was a non-binding advisory vote. Mylan has said it will take into account the outcome of this vote when considering future compensation arrangements.  BlackRock, Mylan's third-largest shareholder with more than 5 percent of the company's shares, said it had voted against four of the drugmaker's directors as well as its executive pay.  We continue to have concerns about excessive pay relative to peers and performance, leadership structure, succession planning, and board responsiveness to shareholder feedback on other issues,  the asset manager said. The shareholder campaign against Mylan's board, led by New York City and State pension funds as well as the California teachers pension fund, picked up steam after Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package was disclosed earlier this year. The annual meeting was held in Amsterdam, where the company has been headquartered since 2015. It was sparsely attended, with around the same number of attendees from the company as those in the audience. The only shareholder to speak was Quirijn Bongaerts of the Dutch small shareholders association VEB. He challenged Coury on executive pay, ethics and the appointment of board members. The New York City and State pension funds and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, as well as influential proxy advisory firm ISS, had urged shareholders to vote against the directors to voice their dissatisfaction.  ISS said earlier this month that shareholder value had eroded as the board mismanaged the EpiPen issue. Sharp price increases for the life-saving treatment spurred congressional, Justice Department and other government investigations of Medicaid overcharging. Mylan shares were up 74 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $39.01 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

It comes as tensions with Moscow and an inward turn in Washington have pushed Europe's governments to confront years of division over military cooperation. New French President Emmanuel Macron, who threw his weight behind a common European defense during his election campaign, called the steps  historic  and said leaders were meeting Europe's security challenges.  The conclusions that were adopted a few moments ago in defense are up to the job. We must consider the historic nature of this,  Macron told a news conference during an EU summit. Modest by U.S. standards, the measures could nevertheless revitalize Europe's inefficient defense industry, allow the EU to send more peacekeepers to flashpoints and send a message to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that the bloc wants to pay for its own security. Although the leaders' statement did not detail the size of the defense fund, the European Commission has said it would put forward at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) a year from the bloc's budget for the research and purchase of assets. It is expected to help develop and pay for helicopters, drones and an array of weaponry. The fund could generate some 5.5 billion euros a year after 2020 if enough governments come forward with funds, EU officials said, stressing that national governments would remain the owners of all equipment. Nearly two decades after France and Britain, the EU's main military powers, helped form a common European foreign policy, the continent faces a growing range of security threats, from Islamic State militants to a more assertive, hostile Russia that has seized territory in Ukraine. While the threats have increased, defense research spending in the EU has fallen by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006. Britain has long-blocked more ambitious steps, fearing the creation of an EU army. But with its decision to leave the European Union, Germany is emerging as France's biggest partner and both want to see reforms across the bloc's defense industry, which many EU officials say wastes money. While the European Union spends about half as much as the United States on researching and manufacturing tanks, ships, planes and weapons, it only has about 15 percent of the assets that Washington can deploy on the battle field.   Three-Month Deadline Trump's repeated criticism of NATO allies, 22 of whom are EU members, for being too reliant on the United States' military, has also unnerved European leaders, who say they must do more together and see defense as a unifying force after Brexit.  Europe should be doing more for its own security,  Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told reporters.  It's time to make fighting against terrorism efficient,  she said. France and Germany must still agree on how they want the European Union to be more agile in overseas missions and how to pay for them. While the bloc has 15 military and training missions abroad, it does not match its economic might with the same military reach. Leaders in Brussels gave their governments three months to say whether they would be willing to join a coalition of EU members to launch missions in the future and under what terms.  We have set ourselves an ambitious timeline. Three months is not a long time,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.  This is a real added value, because it allows us to conduct missions ... we will see who joins this structure,  she said, giving Africa as a place for more EU operations.

He did not specify whether or when the talks with the management will resume but added the unions would look into options to intensify the strike that has hit production at the biggest private employer in Slovakia. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees joined the protest that started on Tuesday at the plant that exports virtually all of its output. The first strike at a major Slovak plant since the 1989 end of communist rule comes as economies across Central Europe outpace Western Europe, leading to a labor shortage that many companies worry will limit growth. After seven hours of talks on Wednesday and four hours on Thursday, the unions reduced their original demand of a 16-percent boost over two years to 13.9 percent, refusing the management's offer of 9 percent raise plus bonuses. The unions are also asking for better work conditions such as longer lunch breaks. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the action on Monday, saying Volkswagen's Slovak workers deserve the same pay as workers in western Europe for doing the same work. VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a bigger pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016. It makes Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii, Skoda Citigo, and bodies for the Porsche Cayenne. The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average.  We will strike tomorrow, on Saturday, Sunday, maybe for a week, (they) will suffer,  Smolinsky told hundreds of workers gathered in front of the factory as they erupted into chants and whistles. Slovakia's Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, produces more than 1 million vehicles a year, making it the biggest per-capita auto producer in the world.

The unions are also asking for better work conditions such as longer lunch breaks. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the action on Monday, saying Volkswagen's Slovak workers deserve the same pay as workers in western Europe for doing the same work. VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a bigger pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016. It makes Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii, Skoda Citigo, and bodies for the Porsche Cayenne. The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros a month including bonuses, double the national average.  We will strike tomorrow, on Saturday, Sunday, maybe for a week, (they) will suffer,  Smolinsky told hundreds of workers gathered in front of the factory as they erupted into chants and whistles. Slovakia's Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, produces more than 1 million vehicles a year, making it the biggest per-capita auto producer in the world. Besides VW, Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) and Peugeot (PEUP.PA) have plants in Slovakia. Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL]  is building a plant due to open next year. Peugeot and Kia have raised wages at their Slovak plants by 6.3 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively.

Indigo Partners has already carved out a niche in ultra-low-cost airlines and owns Mexican low-cost carrier Volaris and part of Denver-based Frontier Airlines. Indigo is known for unbundled, or a la carte, fares that carry cheap base prices but charge additional fees for extras, such as carry-on bags too big to fit under the seat and advance seat assignments. In February, Indigo announced that JetSmart would operate three Airbus A320s in Chile in 2017, and another six in 2018. While the company will focus on domestic routes, it will eye opportunities for regional expansion once established in Chile, Indigo managing partner Bill Franke said at the time. Chile's airline market is dominated by LATAM Airlines, Latin America's largest carrier, with a smaller share taken by established low-cost carrier Sky. LATAM, which has been facing increasing pressure from low-cost airlines throughout the region, is rolling out a partial low-cost model this year.  Low-cost carrier Viva Air launched in Peru in May, low-cost airline Flybondi is set to launch later this year in Argentina, and Norwegian Air is set to launch long-haul, low-cost routes from Europe to Buenos Aires early next year.

It comes as tensions with Moscow and an inward turn in Washington have pushed Europe's governments to confront years of division over military cooperation. New French President Emmanuel Macron, who threw his weight behind a common European defense during his election campaign, called the steps  historic  and said leaders were meeting Europe's security challenges.  The conclusions that were adopted a few moments ago in defense are up to the job. We must consider the historic nature of this,  Macron told a news conference during an EU summit. Modest by U.S. standards, the measures could nevertheless revitalize Europe's inefficient defense industry, allow the EU to send more peacekeepers to flashpoints and send a message to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that the bloc wants to pay for its own security. Although the leaders' statement did not detail the size of the defense fund, the European Commission has said it would put forward at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion) a year from the bloc's budget for the research and purchase of assets. It is expected to help develop and pay for helicopters, drones and an array of weaponry. The fund could generate some 5.5 billion euros a year after 2020 if enough governments come forward with funds, EU officials said, stressing that national governments would remain the owners of all equipment. Nearly two decades after France and Britain, the EU's main military powers, helped form a common European foreign policy, the continent faces a growing range of security threats, from Islamic State militants to a more assertive, hostile Russia that has seized territory in Ukraine. While the threats have increased, defense research spending in the EU has fallen by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006. Britain has long-blocked more ambitious steps, fearing the creation of an EU army. But with its decision to leave the European Union, Germany is emerging as France's biggest partner and both want to see reforms across the bloc's defense industry, which many EU officials say wastes money. While the European Union spends about half as much as the United States on researching and manufacturing tanks, ships, planes and weapons, it only has about 15 percent of the assets that Washington can deploy on the battle field.   Three-Month Deadline Trump's repeated criticism of NATO allies, 22 of whom are EU members, for being too reliant on the United States' military, has also unnerved European leaders, who say they must do more together and see defense as a unifying force after Brexit.  Europe should be doing more for its own security,  Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told reporters.  It's time to make fighting against terrorism efficient,  she said. France and Germany must still agree on how they want the European Union to be more agile in overseas missions and how to pay for them. While the bloc has 15 military and training missions abroad, it does not match its economic might with the same military reach. Leaders in Brussels gave their governments three months to say whether they would be willing to join a coalition of EU members to launch missions in the future and under what terms.  We have set ourselves an ambitious timeline. Three months is not a long time,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.  This is a real added value, because it allows us to conduct missions ... we will see who joins this structure,  she said, giving Africa as a place for more EU operations.

The company did not disclose the vote totals for the directors. Investors agitating against Mylan's board had a steep threshold to cross as more than two-thirds of the shares voted, as well as more than half of Mylan's outstanding shares, were needed for the directors to lose.  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city's pensions and is one of the leaders of the campaign against the drugmaker's board, said the failure to disclose the vote totals suggests that the directors face strong opposition.  This company massively hiked prices on life-saving drugs, allegedly overcharged the government for its products, allowed excessive executive pay to go unchecked — all ultimately fundamental failures of board oversight,  Stringer said. Mylan said in response that it has always reported the vote totals in a filing with regulators after its meeting. The failed measure to approve the company's executive compensation was a non-binding advisory vote. Mylan has said it will take into account the outcome of this vote when considering future compensation arrangements.  BlackRock, Mylan's third-largest shareholder with more than 5 percent of the company's shares, said it had voted against four of the drugmaker's directors as well as its executive pay.  We continue to have concerns about excessive pay relative to peers and performance, leadership structure, succession planning, and board responsiveness to shareholder feedback on other issues,  the asset manager said. The shareholder campaign against Mylan's board, led by New York City and State pension funds as well as the California teachers pension fund, picked up steam after Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package was disclosed earlier this year. The annual meeting was held in Amsterdam, where the company has been headquartered since 2015. It was sparsely attended, with around the same number of attendees from the company as those in the audience. The only shareholder to speak was Quirijn Bongaerts of the Dutch small shareholders association VEB. He challenged Coury on executive pay, ethics and the appointment of board members. The New York City and State pension funds and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, as well as influential proxy advisory firm ISS, had urged shareholders to vote against the directors to voice their dissatisfaction.  ISS said earlier this month that shareholder value had eroded as the board mismanaged the EpiPen issue. Sharp price increases for the life-saving treatment spurred congressional, Justice Department and other government investigations of Medicaid overcharging. Mylan shares were up 74 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $39.01 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

As his chief of staff read out the names for vacant portfolios including defense, justice and European affairs, the reaction of many French was: who? It was unusual in a country where politics has long been perceived as the preserve of an old boys network, where political careers begin at an elite school for civil servants and last decades. And it pointed to Macron's inclination to run government more like a business. Among the picks were Nicole Belloubet, a 62-year-old public law expert and member of the Constitutional Court, as justice minister. Florence Parly, who spent the last 15 years working among the senior ranks of Air France and the SNCF state-owned rail company, became defense minister. Neither are household names.  You have a president and a prime minister who both have corporate backgrounds, and who want to ensure that people are appointed on the basis of their competences,  said a Macron adviser. Macron spent four years at Rothschild bank before entering politics, while his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, a lawyer, worked for nuclear giant Areva. The adviser said Macron also wanted to avoid competition between ministers and their junior secretaries of state - something he experienced himself as economy minister under Socialist President Francois Hollande - which is why he had not given precise portfolios to many of them.

On Thursday Philippe's government spokesman fended off questions over the suitability of businesswoman Parly - who served as junior budget minister under socialist Lionel Jospin from 2000-2002 - to head the defense ministry. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters that what counted was her managerial background.  She's a manager who has proven herself,  he said.

The rule should focus only on banks that do a lot of trading, said Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  We believe we have the authority to draw a line between those with the big trading books (and other banks),  he told the Senate Banking Committee.  We could have that group regulated one way and have everyone else regulated less, a lot less.  Powell was one of five regulators testifying before the committee, days after the U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a plan to revamp or undo many rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wall Street banks have fought Volcker vigorously, saying it is overly complicated and hurts market liquidity. The Treasury plan is part of a broader effort by Republican President Donald Trump to cut regulations that he says are holding back economic growth. Democrats and consumer advocates largely oppose the plan, saying it would lead to more reckless behavior by the banking industry. At the hearing, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street, described the Treasury’s recommendations as  basically cut-and-paste  from bank lobbyists. But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota, indicated clear support for re-examining Volcker.  What I’m hearing today,  she said,  is no one wants to go back, but everybody wants to tailor a rule or find a rule that can in fact accomplish the goal without overly burdening all banks.   Powell was joined by Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller of the currency, in calling for changes. Even Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin Gruenberg, the sole holdover from Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, said he was open to some small revisions.

Given the floor for 10 minutes at the end of a Brussels summit dinner, her first since she launched the two-year withdrawal process in March, May outlined five principles, notably that no EU citizen resident in Britain at a cut-off date would be deported. There are roughly 3 million living there now. That was, she told them,  a fair and serious offer , a British official said. It was  aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the UK, building careers and lives, and contributing so much to our society . Promising details on Monday, May also said those EU citizens who had lived in Britain for five years could stay for life. Those there for less would be allowed to stay until they reach the five-year threshold for  settled status . Red tape for permanent residency would be cut there would be a two-year grace period to avoid  cliff edge  misfortunes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who earlier said she wanted  far-reaching guarantees , described giving full rights to those in Britain for five years as  a good start  but said many questions remained.

There is a long, long way to go for negotiations.  Other leaders offered few details on their reservations. Related CoverageWith 'Eurovision' vote, EU agencies to leave LondonMerkel says May's offer on expats 'good start' but many questions remainMay's push to set the cut-off date as early as March 29 this year, is unlikely to wash with many in the European Union, whose position is that nothing must change until Britain leaves -- scheduled for March 30, 2019. And there was much missing from an outline offer which the British previously called  generous . No Discussion Another sticking point could be May's rejection of another EU demand that expats be able to enforce their rights in the EU court. The source said they would have to accept British judges.  Brussels has been dismissive of May's call for sweeping and quick guarantees for expats, including over a million Britons on the continent, and says only detailed legal texts can reassure and take account of complex, multinational family situations. British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 22, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesLeaders had agreed with summit chair Donald Tusk not to open discussions with May and she left immediately afterwards, leaving the other 27 to discuss other Brexit issues without her. They were briefed by Michel Barnier, who launched the Brexit negotiations for them on Monday, and discussed the move of two EU agencies from London after Britain quits. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, among others, had made clear that they did not want to be drawn into Brexit talks and wanted to focus on the future of the EU minus Britain. May seemed keen to calm the mood with the continentals after weeks of sniping during her election campaign, stressing that London wanted a  special and deep partnership with our friends and allies in Europe .  Slideshow (8 Images)Merkel also expressed a desire for constructive talks with Britain, but made clear that the EU's priority now was its own future:  We will conduct these talks in a good spirit,  she said.  But the clear focus has to be on the future of the 27.  France's new president spoke of working with Germany to revive European integration and Macron did not refer at all to Britain during his remarks before talks got under way.      Not the Only Dreamer  Weakened by an election she did not need to call, May has watered down her government's program to try to get it through parliament and set a softer tone in her approach to Brexit. Yet her aims have held - she wants a clean break from the bloc, leaving the lucrative single market and customs union and so reducing immigration and ending EU courts' jurisdiction. On Thursday, her finance minister, Philip Hammond called for an early agreement on transitional arrangements to ease uncertainty that he said was hurting business.     Reflecting confusion on the continent about what kind of Brexit she will ask for, Tusk said ahead of a separate meeting with May:  We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal.  Some Britons had asked him if he could imagine Britain not leaving after all:  The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve. So, who knows?,  the former Polish prime minister said before quoting John Lennon's song  Imagine :  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I am not the only one.

From this afternoon on, the quality of natural gas that enters the gas transportation system of Poland corresponds to that foreseen in the contract,  Gazprom's export division, Gazprom Export, said in a statement. Poland consumes some 16 billion cubic meters of gas a year but most of it comes from Russia as Poland's biggest gas firm PGNiG has a long-term gas supply contract with Gazprom - the so-called Yamal contract - that runs until 2022. Poland has stopped receiving the deliveries until 0400 GMT on Friday. PGNiG Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak told Polish state broadcaster TVP that Poland will then evaluate the quality of the gas.

The rule should focus only on banks that do a lot of trading, said Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  We believe we have the authority to draw a line between those with the big trading books (and other banks),  he told the Senate Banking Committee.  We could have that group regulated one way and have everyone else regulated less, a lot less.  Powell was one of five regulators testifying before the committee, days after the U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a plan to revamp or undo many rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wall Street banks have fought Volcker vigorously, saying it is overly complicated and hurts market liquidity. The Treasury plan is part of a broader effort by Republican President Donald Trump to cut regulations that he says are holding back economic growth. Democrats and consumer advocates largely oppose the plan, saying it would lead to more reckless behavior by the banking industry. At the hearing, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street, described the Treasury’s recommendations as  basically cut-and-paste  from bank lobbyists. But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota, indicated clear support for re-examining Volcker.  What I’m hearing today,  she said,  is no one wants to go back, but everybody wants to tailor a rule or find a rule that can in fact accomplish the goal without overly burdening all banks.   Powell was joined by Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller of the currency, in calling for changes. Even Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin Gruenberg, the sole holdover from Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, said he was open to some small revisions.

In a rare appearance at a U.S. government hearing by a Chinese official, Li Xie, director of China's export division at China's commerce ministry, called on the Trump administration to refrain from imposing curbs on Chinese aluminum imports. He spoke at a hearing by the U.S. Commerce Department on the Trump administration's Section 232 investigation into whether foreign aluminum imports pose a threat to U.S. national security. The administration is also conducting a separate investigation into steel. The administration is widely expected to impose tariffs or quotas on foreign aluminum and steel imports.  Aluminum products imported from China are general products with civilian uses such as packing, roofing, road signs and consumer durables. None of these products implicate national security,  said Li. He noted that Chinese firms had not been invited to the hearing and said unilateral sanctions by the United States were not an answer to a global issue.  Global overcapacity is the result of manufacturers, including weakness in global economic growth and sluggish demand. The solution to these challenges entail global joint efforts.  China had undertaken measures to eliminate excess domestic aluminum capacity, said Li. When asked by the panel what those measures were, he said he would submit a written report. Testimony to the committee by American manufacturers and labor unions said the domestic aluminum industry had been brought to its knees by market-distorting policies in China. Robert Scott, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said foreign aluminum imports threatened the entire U.S. industry which was hanging on  only by a thread  after a prolonged and steady decline in aluminum prices.  The threat was driven by growth of excess capacity and overproduction in China, which had increased by nearly 1,500 percent between 2000 and 2017, he said.  Official data shows that just 6 percent of America's aluminum exports come directly from China, but producers here argue the capacity expansion there has prompted a global price crash.  Michael Bless, president and chief executive for Century Aluminum Company, a large U.S. producer of primary aluminum, said the U.S. aluminum industry was  in danger of completely disappearing  because of global overcapacity.  The domestic industry is in danger of completely disappearing,  he said, adding that out of five aluminum smelters only two were operating at full capacity. In the last four years, employment and production have fallen nearly 60 percent, he added.  China has no natural comparative advantage. Its smelters are among the highest cost producers in the world, they lose money, yet continue to expand,  he added. Gerd Gotz, director general of the 80-member European aluminum industry, said European manufacturers should be spared from any crack down as a result of the investigation.  The vast majority of European imports have little to no link to U.S. national security but are largely used in commercial applications,  he said.

The move comes as Facebook faces pressure from smaller rivals such as Nextdoor and Meetup, whose online networks bring together neighbors and people in the same area with shared interests.  Zuckerberg said on his Facebook page that his company's new mission is to  give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.   The previous mission was  to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.  Facebook's pursuit of that mission has been criticized in the past 12 months after the network became one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Zuckerberg said in February he wanted to boost the number of Facebook users who are members of what they called  very meaningful  groups. Only about 5 percent were members of such groups, he said then. The head of Facebook, with 1.9 billion users and $27.6 billion in revenue last year, was in Chicago on Thursday to meet people who run group pages on Facebook.  If what you're trying to do is run a group that has thousands of people, you need tools to help manage that,  he told CNN in an interview. Facebook wants to build those tools, he said.  Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google also hosts community groups, as do Nextdoor and Meetup. Nextdoor, a site for neighbors to meet one another and share news and advice, said on Monday it was expanding into Germany after rapid growth elsewhere. Zuckerberg told CNN that supporting organizations built around neighbors, churches, pets and the like has a larger purpose.   Once people are coming together in these smaller groups, that actually grows and it ends up with much bigger changes in the world,  he said.

The stamp duty, which will take effect immediately, will rise to 1.5 pounds in the second year and 1.75 in the third. The Finance Ministry said in March it aimed to raise revenues of 1 to 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($55 million-$82 million) in the first year of the new stamp duty. Sisi also approved extending a freeze on capital gains tax for three years. The country originally imposed a 10 percent tax on capital gains in July 2014 as part of efforts to replenish depleted state coffers. But it suspended the tax a year later under pressure from investors for a period of two years. Thursday's decree extends that freeze for another three years. Investors had said the capital gains tax discouraged business at a time when Egypt was struggling to recover from the 2011 uprising and subsequent political upheaval.

Oil edged up from November lows hit in the prior session, when U.S. crude hit its lowest intraday level since August 2016, sentiment remained negative from a supply glut that has persisted despite OPEC-led efforts to balance the market. U.S. crude rose 0.75 percent to $42.85 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.32, up 1.12 percent on the day.  Oil's had a tough run in the last handful of weeks,  said Michael Scanlon, managing director, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  I wouldn't say oil being up today gives anybody a high degree of confidence we've seen a floor in oil yet,  he said. With the gains, the energy sector in Europe remained under pressure, down 0.3 percent, but managed to close well off earlier lows. The index is down nearly 2 percent on the week and is on track for its fifth straight weekly drop. Those declines weighed on European shares but the picture was reversed on Wall Street, with energy up 0.1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.03 points, or 0.13 percent, to 21,438.06, the S&P; 500 gained 4.62 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,440.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,252.46. Healthcare was up 1.4 percent to pace the advance on Wall Street as Senate Republicans unveiled a draft bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.05 percent to snap a two-session skid and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year after the initial OPEC-led production cut. Oil's decline has hurt energy stocks and curbed investor expectations for higher inflation that would enable major central banks to pursue tighter monetary policies. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have led to a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds on Wednesday narrowed to 94.9 basis points, holding near its smallest since December 2007. The curve steepened slightly to 96.5 basis points on Thursday, suggesting the flattening of the yield curve this week was stalling. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator. It shows concern about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. Benchmark 10-year notes were unchanged in price to yield 2.1546 percent. The dollar index rose 0.06 percent, with the euro down 0.22 percent to $1.1141.

Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp (7011.T) brought its MRJ regional jet to Europe for the first time during the air show. China and Russia carried out maiden flights of new narrow-body aircraft last month in their bids to enter the $100 billion-plus annual aerospace market.  The two countries have also set up a joint venture to build wide-body jets to challenge incumbents. Consultants Alix Partners estimates that of the current order backlog of around 13,000 planes, about 7-8 percent are for planes from new entrants, among them Russia, China and Japan. Delegates at the show said mounting a proper challenge will take Russia and China at least a decade. The newcomers face headwinds including proving their technology, and gaining customer confidence by deploying and maintaining a quality aircraft maintenance and support network.  Overall, there are big steps not only on the product side but on the support and services side for the airlines to feel confident that they can go in and order those aircraft,  Pascal Fabre, managing director at Alix Partners in Paris, said.   However, China and Russia are large enough markets that orders from their home countries alone could propel the respective airliner ventures. Among COMAC's first customers for its C919 was China Eastern, which has ordered up to 20 planes from the Chinese manufacturer, while Aeroflot is due to take the Russian MS21. COMAC said this week total orders for the C919 stood at 600 from 24 customers. Giorgio Callegari, strategy and alliances director at Russian carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM), said people he met at the air show showed great interest in the MS21 and the Russian-China wide-body cooperation. Aeroflot is set to lease 50 MS21 planes from state defense conglomerate Rostec.   If maybe in the past, Russian airplanes were discarded as a non-factor, they are now taken much more seriously and people can see that they are potentially a serious competitor,  he told Reuters. A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolThe chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, said he would not have a problem buying jets from Chinese or Russian manufacturers, provided they met operational and performance requirements. Battle for Third Spot  Some executives at the airshow said the marketplace would eventually settle on three major manufacturers and placed their bets on China's COMAC to win that third spot.  Twenty years from now, I think there'll be the big three manufacturers of Airbus, Boeing and China,  said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. However, Leahy said it would be hard for countries to make billions of dollars of investments over decades to get the product line and support network up to scratch. Cedric Goubet, vice president of commercial engines at Safran (SAF.PA), said he too is betting on the Chinese.   My feeling is that it will be the Chinese. They have the resources, the skills, the national ambitions and a huge domestic market,  he said, while adding that it was also crucial to get export orders.  Dang Thiehong, deputy head of marketing at China's COMAC, told Reuters the aircraft market was big enough to share.  We hope to provide our services and products to the market no matter in which part of the world,  he said.  China is crucial to the growth prospects of all the major airliner manufacturers.  Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing and sales at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, cautioned against the dangers of underestimating new rivals,  Never sell your competition short.  Japan's Mitsubishi has set its sights on the regional jet market instead of going head to head with the larger planes sold by Airbus and Boeing or rising Chinese and Russian rivals.     Yugo Fukuhara, vice president sales and marketing at Mitsubishi, told Reuters,  Our vision of this business is to become one of two major regional plane makers. We don't compete with China and Russia.

With Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov having already progressed, three former champions are among the last eight at the prestigious pre-Wimbledon grasscourt event at Queen's Club. Fourth seed Cilic, winner in 2012, overpowered American teenager Stefan Kozlov 6-0 6-4 while Querrey, who triumphed seven years ago at the west London club, got the better of Australian Jordan Thompson, winning 7-6(3) 3-6 6-3. Russian Daniil Medvedev beat fellow 21-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis who failed to match the heights he reached when beating third seed Milos Raonic in round one, losing 6-2 6-2.

After the stifling temperatures of the first three days, fresher conditions returned to the west London club -- as well as a sense of tranquillity after the shocks which saw Murray, Stan Wawrinka, Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga all bale out early. Organizers will at least be pleased that some genuine quality still remains. Cilic now looks favorite for the title, especially after the clinical way he dispatched 19-year-old Kozlov with his serve and forehand almost unplayable at times.

Kozlov showed some tidy grasscourt skills of his own but never hinted at breaking the Croatian's serve, which offered up only seven points to the American during the 65-minute contest. Cilic, who beat John Isner in round one, will now take aim at his third American in a row in the quarter-finals when he takes on unseeded Donald Young. Slideshow (6 Images) Consistency-wise, maybe I'm feeling my best ever,  Cilic, who reached the French Open quarter-finals, said.  I served extremely good today. Controlled most of the rallies.  Big-serving American Querrey cut short a dream week for Thompson, the man who beat world number one and five-times champion Andy Murray in the first round having scraped into the draw as a lucky loser after falling in qualifying. Querrey, who caused the big shock at Wimbledon last year when he knocked out defending champion Novak Djokovic, failed to take any of the six break points that came his way in the first set against Thompson but edged the opener in a tiebreak. Thompson struck back to level the match but Querrey recovered to break decisively in the fourth game of the decider and had enough firepower to claim victory.  That was a long match for grass,  Querrey, who fired down 15 aces, said on court.  It's tricky out here, it was windy and Jordan had come off beating Andy so he was confident.

The stamp duty, which will take effect immediately, will rise to 1.5 pounds in the second year and 1.75 in the third. The Finance Ministry said in March it aimed to raise revenues of 1 to 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($55 million-$82 million) in the first year of the new stamp duty. Sisi also approved extending a freeze on capital gains tax for three years. The country originally imposed a 10 percent tax on capital gains in July 2014 as part of efforts to replenish depleted state coffers. But it suspended the tax a year later under pressure from investors for a period of two years. Thursday's decree extends that freeze for another three years. Investors had said the capital gains tax discouraged business at a time when Egypt was struggling to recover from the 2011 uprising and subsequent political upheaval. Sisi on June 1 ratified a long-delayed investment law aimed at making business easier and creating incentives to lure back investors after years of turmoil.

Northern Ireland politics has been in crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of government in January, prompting an election in March and a series of missed deadlines to restore the compulsory coalition between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists. Talks were paused until after Britain's national election on June 8 but have since been sidelined by May's courting of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, to back her minority government in London. May's Conservative Party has until next Thursday to secure the DUP's support, the same date her outgoing government set for the DUP and Sinn Fein to reach a deal to return to devolved government together in Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly.     Given the lack of progress in the Stormont Talks and the lack of knowledge about the impact of any Tory/DUP deal on our public services, on agreements and on the political institutions, Sinn Fein is concerned that time is running out,  Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said.  The British government is content to go through the motions at Stormont but their main focus is elsewhere.  Some analysts say a deal between May and the DUP that hands the British province additional funding but does not damage Irish nationalist interests or undermine peace could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to return to government. However it will need to examine the details first. A senior lawmaker for the DUP said there was  a very good chance  it could reach a deal with May by next Thursday. If the June 29 Northern Ireland deadline is missed, it would be the fourth such deadline set by the British government to pass without agreement since the March 2 regional election. Northern Ireland risks reverting to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade if power-sharing cannot be restored, limiting the province's say in Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union.

Women said on Thursday, urging the global ad industry to turn into a weapon for good. Advertising has the power to create positive portrayals of women and eliminate stereotypes, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of the United Nations' agency on women, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Mlambo-Ngcuka spoke from France, where she is calling on advertising leaders who are attending the industry's annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity to eliminate stereotypes and commit to gender equality.  People are more likely to see adverts in their lives than read books,  she said.  It's a waste if we are not using this opportunity for good.  Stereotypes of women permeate the globe, she said, be it in nations such as Iceland with high gender equality or those with very little in the way of equal rights, like Yemen.  Of the many things that we've tried to do to obtain gender equality, we are not getting the kind of traction and success that we are looking for, because of the underlying stereotypes and social norms in existence in society,  she said.  Adverts create a role model that people look up to, even mimic and try to be like,  said the veteran South African politician.  If they see men in powerful positions most of the time and do not see women and people who look like them ... then they think this is not for them.  Research by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media illustrates the issue, said Philip Thomas, chief executive of the annual advertising event in Cannes, who also participated in the interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One in ten female characters in advertising is shown in sexually revealing clothing, six times the number of male characters, he said. Of characters portrayed as intelligent - such as doctors or scientists - men are 62 percent more likely than women to play those roles, he said. Women are 48 percent more likely to be shown in the kitchen, he said. Creative teams at advertising agencies are predominantly male, and just 11 percent of creative directors around the world are female, he said. The industry can make an effort to mentor women, employ and promote more female creative teams and reward work that promotes positive images, he said. Mlambo-Ngcuka said she welcomed efforts such as one in Berlin, where the city's ruling coalition has agreed on a ban on degrading or sexist advertising. An expert committee will examine and prevent discriminatory advertising on both privately and publicly owned advertising billboards and hoardings. Opposition parties in Berlin say such a ban infringes on free speech.  When it's so much that is against us, I think we are allowed sometimes to make some extreme measures even if there's a controversy,  she said.  Let's have the discussion.

Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp (7011.T) brought its MRJ regional jet to Europe for the first time during the air show. China and Russia carried out maiden flights of new narrow-body aircraft last month in their bids to enter the $100 billion-plus annual aerospace market.  The two countries have also set up a joint venture to build wide-body jets to challenge incumbents. Consultants Alix Partners estimates that of the current order backlog of around 13,000 planes, about 7-8 percent are for planes from new entrants, among them Russia, China and Japan. Delegates at the show said mounting a proper challenge will take Russia and China at least a decade. The newcomers face headwinds including proving their technology, and gaining customer confidence by deploying and maintaining a quality aircraft maintenance and support network.  Overall, there are big steps not only on the product side but on the support and services side for the airlines to feel confident that they can go in and order those aircraft,  Pascal Fabre, managing director at Alix Partners in Paris, said.   However, China and Russia are large enough markets that orders from their home countries alone could propel the respective airliner ventures. Among COMAC's first customers for its C919 was China Eastern, which has ordered up to 20 planes from the Chinese manufacturer, while Aeroflot is due to take the Russian MS21. COMAC said this week total orders for the C919 stood at 600 from 24 customers. Giorgio Callegari, strategy and alliances director at Russian carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM), said people he met at the air show showed great interest in the MS21 and the Russian-China wide-body cooperation. Aeroflot is set to lease 50 MS21 planes from state defense conglomerate Rostec.   If maybe in the past, Russian airplanes were discarded as a non-factor, they are now taken much more seriously and people can see that they are potentially a serious competitor,  he told Reuters. A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolThe chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, said he would not have a problem buying jets from Chinese or Russian manufacturers, provided they met operational and performance requirements. Battle for Third Spot  Some executives at the airshow said the marketplace would eventually settle on three major manufacturers and placed their bets on China's COMAC to win that third spot.  Twenty years from now, I think there'll be the big three manufacturers of Airbus, Boeing and China,  said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. However, Leahy said it would be hard for countries to make billions of dollars of investments over decades to get the product line and support network up to scratch. Cedric Goubet, vice president of commercial engines at Safran (SAF.PA), said he too is betting on the Chinese.   My feeling is that it will be the Chinese. They have the resources, the skills, the national ambitions and a huge domestic market,  he said, while adding that it was also crucial to get export orders.  Dang Thiehong, deputy head of marketing at China's COMAC, told Reuters the aircraft market was big enough to share.  We hope to provide our services and products to the market no matter in which part of the world,  he said.  China is crucial to the growth prospects of all the major airliner manufacturers.  Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing and sales at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, cautioned against the dangers of underestimating new rivals,  Never sell your competition short.  Japan's Mitsubishi has set its sights on the regional jet market instead of going head to head with the larger planes sold by Airbus and Boeing or rising Chinese and Russian rivals.     Yugo Fukuhara, vice president sales and marketing at Mitsubishi, told Reuters,  Our vision of this business is to become one of two major regional plane makers. We don't compete with China and Russia.

Forbes's three-year term on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee ends this month, and since March she has voted to raise British interest rates from their record-low 0.25 percent. In her final speech as an MPC member, she expanded on a research paper she published last week which argued that sterling weakness had a longer-term effect on inflation than the BoE typically assumed.  'Lift-off' of UK interest rates should not be delayed any longer,  she said in a speech to be given at the London Business School.  Sterling's depreciation has fundamentally shifted underlying inflation dynamics in a way that makes it more pressing to begin this voyage soon.  Forbes's remarks come after a turbulent seven days which have seen a big split emerge on the MPC at a time when inflation is picking up but growth prospects are unclear as the country prepares to leave the European Union. Two other policymakers unexpectedly joined Forbes last week in voting for higher rates, and the BoE's chief economist has said he is likely to do so later this year once the  dust cloud  around Britain's political outlook has cleared. Related CoveragePolitics, not rate outlook, is main driver for sterling - BoE's ForbesOne major bank, Nomura, said earlier on Thursday that it expected the BoE to raise rates at its next meeting in August - far earlier than the 2019 date given by most economists in a Reuters poll at the start of the month. But BoE Governor Mark Carney has poured cold water on the chances of a rate hike, highlighting  anaemic  wage growth which is likely to drag down on inflation once the effect of currency weakness fades. Britain's economy slowed in the first quarter of this year after an unexpectedly robust performance in 2016, though the BoE expects reasonable growth overall this year and next.  The UK economy appears to be solid enough on key economic criteria, and even 'overstimulated' by others, such that a moderate reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus ... makes sense,  Forbes said. Weak wage growth - a factor cited by both Carney and policymaker Andrew Haldane - was not a good enough reason to hold off from raising rates, given Britain's low productivity and other price pressures.  A key lesson from monetary history is that a tightening cycle should start before wages accelerate to reach their level consistent with sustainable 2 percent inflation,  Forbes added. Reluctancy Forbes said both the BoE and the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared more reluctant to raise interest rates than in the past.  Possible reasons for this included greater accountability and public scrutiny than in earlier decades, which could make policymakers unwilling to take measures that were unpopular in the short-run. Forbes said she was not aware of BoE policymakers coming under pressure from government ministers to keep rates low. Another factor for the BoE could be its new responsibilities for financial stability, which gave senior BoE staff on the MPC less time to look in-depth at emerging inflation threats and challenge any internal consensus.  These institutional changes may provide substantial benefits for the central bank as a whole and overall economy, but these changes may also have played a role in making it more difficult to increase interest rates,  Forbes said.

In the first scientific study of Ebola victim burials, researchers found each unsafe burial had the potential to generate more than 2.5 secondary cases of Ebola infection.  The virus kills about 50 percent of those it infects on average, according to the World Health Organization.  People who treat and bury the bodies of the dead are especially at risk, as corpses are even more contagious than living Ebola patients. The Red Cross safe burial program potentially averted between 1,411 and 10,452 secondary cases of infection during the West African outbreak, limiting its scale by as much as a third, estimated the study published in the journal “PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases”.  Over 28,600 people were infected with the Ebola virus disease and more than 11,000 died in that epidemic, it added.  The Red Cross said the findings supported the “safe and dignified burial” practices conducted by its teams of trained local volunteers in virus-hit countries.    Those practices at times provoked furious reactions from some community members, as they went against traditional burial norms, which include touching and washing the body.  As a result, some volunteers conducting or even promoting safe burials were attacked, their vehicles vandalized and homes stoned. “To respond effectively, we had to change our entire approach to dealing with people who had died and their families,” said Elhadj As Sy, secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).   We talked to communities and did our best to understand their beliefs and priorities. Ultimately, we earned their trust, and this was critical to success,” he added in a statement. The study's findings have been used in the response to the most recent May Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Amanda McClelland, an IFRC officer for public health in emergencies, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The Red Cross now conducts an assessment of cultural beliefs “very early on” to work out how its operating procedures can be adapted to accommodate traditional burial methods, she added.  The aid agency aims to build trust with religious and other local leaders before outbreaks occur. “We are able to explain how we need to do specific tasks and have them support us in working with the community,” McClelland said. The Red Cross conducted about half of official safe burials in Sierra Leone and 100 percent in both Guinea and Liberia’s Montserrado County during the 2013-2016 epidemic. While the number of infections that can be prevented through safe burial practices is significant, “greater impact would be achieved by early hospitalization of the primary case during acute illness”, the study noted.

Zhai, one of China's richest women and president of the privately-owned HeungKong Group Ltd, said she never forgot her humble upbringing in Guangzhou in southern China where her father was an architect and her mother worked in a store. This made her determined to help others and she started donating to charity shortly after setting up the business with her husband in 1990. As their business grew, taking in real estate, financial investment and healthcare, Zhai broke new ground in 2005 by establishing China's first non-profit charity foundation. Since then the HeungKong Charitable Foundation has helped an estimated 2 million people, by funding 1,500 libraries, providing loans for women to start businesses, and funding  orphans, single mothers, handicapped children and the elderly.  I realized there were a lot of poor people in China and this drove me to earn more money so I could help them,  said Zhai, 53, who was one of nine philanthropists named on Thursday as winners of the 2017 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Zhai and her husband Liu Zhiqiang, whose HeungKong Group with 20,000 staff has made them worth about $1.4 billion according to Forbes magazine, are known for being leaders of the culture of philanthropy in China. Their foundation was listed as number 001 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Zhai said at the end of 2015 there were 3,300 registered non-profit charity foundations in China.  By setting up the foundation I wanted to encourage other people, other entrepreneurs, to also donate to charity,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Guangzhou translated by her daughter.  Now I want to make sure that the next generation continues this culture of philanthropy in China,  she added, with two of her four children taking an active role in her foundation. The other philanthropists to win the Carnegie Medal - that was established in 2001 and is awarded every two years - came from across the globe. The list included India's education-focused Azim Premji, Canadian-born social enterprise pioneer Jeff Skoll and American- Australian lawyer and former World Bank Group president James Wolfensohn.

The C$2 billion loan facility, expected to be effective on June 29, will replace the existing one for a similar amount between Home Trust Company and a major institutional investor. On Tuesday, the company said it would sell a portfolio of commercial mortgage assets valued at C$1.2 billion to bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in April.  Last week, Home Capital reached a C$30.5 million settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, settled a class action lawsuit and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said.

Republicans in the U.S. Senate released a draft of their bill to undo Obamacare, officially called the Affordable Care Act, which reshapes the individual insurance market and the Medicaid program for the poor and reduces taxes.  This is just not a business that we will be good at,  Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said in an interview, emphasizing that the company, the No. 4 U.S. health insurer, does best managing Medicare Advantage healthcare for older people and the disabled, its specialty.  No matter what they do in Washington, we are not going to go back in. And we've had a lot of people ask us from Washington D.C. if we would go back in and we've said no, it's not there,  he said. Humana in February announced that it was leaving the individual market, where earlier this year it said it had more than 100,000 customers in Obamacare plans in 11 states. Its departure threatened to leave some counties in some states, such as Tennessee, with no individual insurance choices in 2018. Other insurers, including Aetna Inc., also pulled out of the exchanges for 2018, while Anthem Inc has mostly pulled out of 3 states and remained in 11 others for next year. Other insurers, like Medicaid specialist Centene Corp and small insurer Oscar Health have said they will expand. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard poses for a portrait in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 22, 2017.Carlo AllegriAfter Aetna   Broussard, speaking to Reuters in one of his first interviews since the deal to be bought by Aetna was terminated earlier this year due to antitrust concerns, declined to comment on recent Wall Street analyst research notes raising the company as a takeover target for rival Cigna Corp.  Cigna CEO David Cordani said on Tuesday in an interview that it was interested in growing its Medicare Advantage business, but declined to comment on the specific possibility of buying Humana. Broussard said that if the company were to look at any deals, it would be doing it with the expectation that the Justice Department would use the same parameters it did under the Obama administration. Some Wall Street analysts have speculated that the Trump administration might be friendlier to an insurance deal.   If we were to evaluate a transaction, we would do so under the old environment, because we know that,  he said.

Prosecutor Francois Molins did not explain how the assailant he named as Adam D. managed for years to obtain gun permits and renew them, even after his name was put on a secret service list of potentially radicalized individuals. It is a question that remains unanswered as investigators probe the latest of a string of attacks by Islamist assailants who have killed more than 230 people in France since early 2015.  Molins said the attacker on the Champs Elysees on Monday appeared to have died of a cardiac arrest and inhalation of toxic fumes. TV footage showed clouds of orange smoke spewing out of his vehicle after he drove it into the police van. In the car police found a copy of a letter the attacker had sent the same day to several people, in which he swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State militant group and said he had joined a gun club years ago, not for the sport but to prepare for jihadi combat. He had a Sig Sauer pistol strapped to his body and the car was laden with two gas tanks, rifles, knives and thousands of rounds of ammunition.   The scale of the arsenal found in the vehicle shows the size of the planned terrorist attack and the dramatic human cost it could have inflicted,  Molins said. Married to a Tunisian woman and father of two children, Molins said the assailant had traveled frequently to Turkey, one of the main transit points foreign jihadists use to get to Islamic State bases across the border in Syria. He was stopped several times, on occasion with his family, and explained each time that he was a gem dealer. Once he was stopped in possession of a bar of gold and said it was part of his business, Molins said. A raid this week on his home unearthed a vast stash of other weapons and materials that could be used to make a bomb. On April 20 an Islamist shot dead a policeman in a police vehicle parked on the Champs Elysees. The attacker was then killed in a shootout with police.

Total exports for all fields in Iraq, those of Baghdad and  the Kurdish region in the north, have averaged 3.8 million bpd so far in June, he told Reuters in the southern oil city of Basra. The country as a whole is producing about 4.315 million bpd, he said. Kurdish exports are running at about 520,000 to 530,000 bpd so far this month, he said. Iraq is in  quiet negotiations  with foreign oil companies operating in Iraq to amend their services contract, he said, declining to give more details. The country wants to change the terms of the contracts it deems no longer in its favor after oil prices collapsed three years ago, when they were in excess of $100 per barrel, to about $45 per barrel now. Oil prices should start recovering by the end of July, to reach $54 to $56 a barrel by the end of the year, Luaibi said. Iraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. The group in May rolled over an agreement to cut oil production with other exporting nations, until March, in order to support oil prices.  Iraq supports the agreement that we reached; if developments happen contrary to OPEC's interests, the (OPEC) ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting,  he said.

After a decade of editing this blog and 40 years of reporting for Reuters, I am retiring from daily journalism and moving to a less hectic work schedule. Reuters will continue to report on religion when it plays a role in the news, but not with the same focus as we did during the life of this blog. When FaithWorld started, we wrote posts for the blog discussing the background to religion stories and moderated an active comments box. As I wrote in our initial post on October 15, 2007,  Reuters covers news around the world. Religion is in the news almost anywhere we look – sometimes as a story purely about religion, sometimes as a story that mixes faith with politics, diplomacy, lifestyle or terrorism. So our correspondents are increasingly covering religious leaders, following trends and examining the role of faith in public life. They have also widened their scope to deal with other areas connected to people’s deepest beliefs, such as divisive social issues, bioethical challenges, even brain research into why and how we think.  That is what we started out to do. After about two years, Reuters shut the comments boxes on its blogs. While there was some interesting discussion, far too many comments were aggressive and polemical, often based on a misunderstanding of the religion involved, or even of faith itself. Our job was reporting, not running debates, so we stepped back from that line of work. Several years later, I examined this problem in an essay for the blog The Immanent Frame (here). We also found that writing for an active blog was so time-consuming that it diverted attention from writing for our news wire, which was after all the main outlet for our work. So we shifted focus to using the blog to aggregate our religion stories from around the world. There was no other place to easily find our output on religion in the news.  This had to be a selective process. Not all Reuters stories concerning religion could be posted on FaithWorld. So the ones that did make it were considered to be the most important, or the most interesting, or the most likely to be overlooked in the rush of other news that day.  It could never have been complete. Our reporting bureaus around the world had to focus on the main political and economic news first. A religion story had to be a strong one if it was going to win their time and attention. Some correspondents had a personal familiarity with the religion they were reporting on, but many didn't. And in some parts of the globe, hard-working staff simply did not have the time to provide regular coverage of the issue. Still, FaithWorld tried as best we could to shine a light on issues concerning religion around the world, in the hope that this -- like our other reporting -- might better inform discussions about the way the world works.  This blog, still available for posts since November 2016 here (www.reuters.com/faithworld/) and earlier posts going back to 2007 here (blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/), will not be updated. The Twitter account @RTRFaithWorld will also be discontinued. I will continue to write about religion for other publications in Britain and the United States.

Slideshow (3 Images)The Taliban, on one of its Twitter accounts, claimed responsibility for the blast, which it said had killed 73 members of the security forces and wounded 44. Security is worsening across Afghanistan almost three years after international troops ended their main combat mission, prompting a rethink in Washington which is expected to send another 3,000-5,000 troops to join a 8,400-strong U.S. force already in the country. Emergency workers and passers-by tried to help the injured, who were strewn among the dead. Ambulances and private cars ferried the victims to hospitals. The blast, which also damaged nearby shops, came as Afghans were preparing to celebrate next week's Eid al-Fitr festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. While high-profile attacks in the capital, Kabul, have made headlines, dozens of similar incidents in provincial centers over recent months have steadily undermined confidence in President Ashraf Ghani's divided government. Helmand, one of the world's major opium growing centers and a traditional heartland of the Taliban, has been under particularly heavy pressure with large parts of the province in the hands of the insurgents.

The offering consists of $100 million of unsecured notes due 2024 that will bear interest at 3.75%.  The transaction is anticipated to close on or around July 14, 2017. As part of the use of proceeds, the company intends to redeem all of its 7.75% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock on July 19, 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings take into account TRNO's portfolio concentration in strong markets, transparent industrial property-focused business model, experienced management, and credit metrics that are moderately strong for the rating. The potential for greater cash flow volatility stemming from market, asset and tenant concentration risk and possible missteps surrounding the company's value-added acquisition-led growth strategy balance these credit positives. Also, the company has a less developed and shorter track record as an unsecured borrower. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that TRNO will maintain credit metrics that are consistent with the 'BBB-' rating over the two-year Outlook horizon, as well as Fitch's view of near- to medium-term industrial property fundamentals. Portfolio Concentrated in Strong Markets: Fitch expects TRNO's portfolio market fundamentals to outperform the U.S. average over the near- to medium-term, based on its superior demographics and barriers to new supply. The company's portfolio is located in six of the strongest U.S. industrial markets, characterized by vibrant and growing local and regional economies, favorable population and income demographics and meaningful barriers to new supply. The above-average occupancies and rents in Terreno's markets highlight these strong fundamentals relative to the total U.S. industrial property base. Institutional investor and lender interest in TRNO's assets is likely above its peer average given the desirable market locations, thus supporting the company's contingent liquidity position. Transparent Operating Strategy: Terreno's transparent, well-defined operating strategy is a credit positive. The company targets 100% fee simple ownership of industrial assets in six key logistics markets that include Northern NJ/NY (23.7% of annualized base rent), D.C./Baltimore (23.2%), Los Angeles (14.4%), Miami (13.9%), San Francisco (13.5%) and Seattle (11.3%). TRNO's strategy does not contemplate investments in ground-up development or unconsolidated joint venture partnerships (JVs). The absence of these items helps simplify the company's business model, improve financial reporting transparency and reduce potential contingent liquidity claims. Fitch's ratings for TRNO include some flexibility for selective ground-up development at existing owned in-fill properties, as well as a limited amount of JVs if, for example, only a partial interest in an attractive industrial portfolio in its markets was available for purchase. Appropriate Credit Metrics: Fitch expects TRNO's leverage to sustain within a range of 6.0x-6.5x through 2019, on an adjusted basis that includes a full-year's contribution from external investment activity. TRNO's leverage was 5.2x for the TTM ending March 31, 2017, which is appropriate for the 'BBB-' rating. The company's leverage was 5.6x including 50% equity credit for its perpetual preferred stock in total debt. Fitch expects the company's fixed-charge coverage (FCC) to improve moderately over the Rating Outlook horizon as the company stabilizes value-add acquisitions and achieves better leverage of its fixed costs as total assets grow. Fitch expects the company's FCC will be in the mid-3.0x range through 2019. The company has publicly committed to financial policies through the cycle that are consistent to moderately strong for a 'BBB-' rated REIT with TRNO's asset profile. These include maintaining leverage below 6.5x and FCC above 2.0x. The company's dividend policy is to pay 100% of its taxable net income to its equity holders. Fitch expects TRNO's dividend payout ratio of AFFO to range between the mid-80% to mid-90% level over the rating horizon, excluding stabilization capex related to value-add acquisitions. Experienced Management: TRNO has a strong management team with extensive industrial real estate and capital markets experience. Many of the company's key executives previously held high-level executive positions at AMB Property prior to its merger with ProLogis. Portfolio Market and Tenant Concentration: Fitch expects the portfolio's asset and tenant granularity to improve as TRNO executes on its value-add acquisition-led growth strategy. However, we do not expect the company to expand beyond its six major markets. TRNO's concentrated portfolio strategy exposes it to idiosyncratic market and asset risks and could result in above-average property income volatility. Examples could include a regional economic downturn or loss of a significant tenant. The company's small size and concentration in markets with higher per square foot industrial values relative to its peers has contributed to its below-average asset granularity. However, the multiple-building nature of many of its larger assets as well as their infill locations helps to offset the asset concentration risk. Two markets - Northern NJ/NY and D.C./Baltimore - comprised 46.9% of the company's ABR as of March 31, 2017. Moreover, its 10 largest properties (at cost) accounted for roughly 35% of its total investment in real estate. TRNO's top-20 tenants comprised 37.8% of ABR at March 31, 2017, which is more concentrated than the industrial REIT peer median of slightly more than 20%. Moreover, the company's largest tenant (FedEx Corp.) was 5.7% of its ABR versus a comparable peer median top tenant exposure of approximately 2%. Fitch views the company's portfolio tenant concentration as a credit risk that could lead to greater cash flow volatility. However, the generally strong credit quality of its largest tenants and multiple leases with several of these tenants help balance the concentration risk. Execution Risk in Value-Add Acquisitions: TRNO's external growth strategy centers on the acquisition and stabilization of industrial assets, primarily through some combination of lease-up and property redevelopment. Fitch generally views the value-add strategy as being in between  core  investments and ground-up development in risk/return space. Value-add acquisitions can entail additional risk given less familiarity with an asset compared to the repositioning of existing owned assets. However, Fitch views TRNO management's extensive industrial property experience and the small dollar value and homogeneity of industrial assets as risk mitigants. The company has improved its portfolio occupancy to 97.4% at 1Q17 from 90.7% at 1Q16, demonstrating its ability to successfully stabilize value-add acquisitions. Improving Unsecured Capital Access: Fitch continues to view TRNO as a less established unsecured bond issuer.  However, this transaction improves TRNO's demonstration of its added financial flexibility; it has now raised $250 million of private placement unsecured notes since September 2015. This repeated, ongoing access to private placement unsecured notes is an important milestone in the company's transition to a predominantly unsecured borrowing strategy. Preferred Stock Notching: The two-notch differential between TRNO's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and preferred stock rating is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with a 'BBB-' IDR. These preferred securities are deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. Upon the expected closing of the notes offering on July 14, 2017, the company intends to redeem all of its 7.75% Series A preferred stock on July 19, 2017, at which point the company will not have any preferred stock outstanding DERIVATION SUMMARY TRNO's ratings reflect the issuer's strong portfolio of industrial real estate in the top U.S. markets with a solid management team and leverage that is relatively low for the rating category. The company should experience outsized growth in the next few years and has a rather simple business model with minimal exposure to development risk.  These strengths are partially offset by lower FCC and higher dividend payout ratio than its peers as well as a smaller size and scale, which provides less overall granularity and diversification in comparison to the other larger industrial REITs. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for TRNO include: --GAAP SSNOI growth in the 4% to 5% range through the 2018 projection period; --Net acquisitions of roughly $200 million to $300 million through 2018; --Annual unsecured issuance of between $50 million and $150 million; --Equity issuance of $100 million to $150 million per annum; --The company unencumbers assets as mortgages mature with the proceeds from new unsecured debt and equity raises. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on the ratings and/or Rating Outlook: --TRNO's demonstrated adherence to its financial policies during through the cycle given its value-add acquisition strategy, which could result in greater relative cash flow volatility; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining in the low 6.0x range (leverage was 5.2x for the TTM ended March 31, 2017); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3.0x; --Increased asset and tenant level diversification within the company's concentrated, six-market portfolio; --Further demonstrated access to the unsecured bond market. The following factors may have a negative impact on the ratings and/or Rating Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7.0x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.0x. LIQUIDITY TRNO's sources of capital cover its uses by 1.9x for the April 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2018 period under Fitch's base case liquidity analysis after adjusting for events subsequent to quarter-end, including $100 million of private placement unsecured notes, $46 million of preferred stock redemption and $25.3 million of contracted dispositions, which was offset by $51.3 million of completed acquisitions. This includes $16 million drawn on the company's $200 million revolver, cash on hand, and a modest amount of retained cash flow after dividends as the company's primary sources of liquidity. Although near-term maturities are modest, the company's debt ladder has elevated maturities in the 2020s, consisting of term loans and unsecured borrowings. Fitch expects the company to refinance the 2021 term loan ahead of its stated maturity, most likely with proceeds from new unsecured private placement notes. TRNO's longer-dated maturities should decline as a percentage of total debt as the company executes its value-add acquisition growth strategy. TRNO's unencumbered assets cover its unsecured debt (UA/UD) by 2.4x using a direct capitalization approach of TRNO's annualized 1Q17 unencumbered net operating income (NOI) that assumes a stressed 8.75% through-the-cycle cap rate. Fitch expects the company's UA/UD to moderate to the low- to mid-2x range as it progresses in its unsecured borrowing strategy, which would remain appropriate for the 'BBB-' rating. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates TRNO as follows: Terreno Realty Corporation --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-'; --Preferred Stock 'BB'. Terreno Realty LLC --IDR 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured revolving line of credit 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured private placement notes 'BBB-'.

Rights watchdogs consider Honduras one of the most hostile and dangerous countries for human rights defenders, saying violence and impunity for abuses are the norm.  Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez announced the new office during a speech in May for Honduran journalists. When asked by the Thomson Reuters Foundation for follow-up, senior government official Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro said:  Our work in the area is entering a new phase.  The new Honduran human rights minister will take a seat in the cabinet and will be responsible for new funding aimed at strengthening government protection of rights activists, said Alcerro, secretary general of government coordination. Honduras has been the subject of international scrutiny since the murder of activist Berta Caceres, a winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, in March 2016 over her opposition to a $50 million hydroelectric dam project. The Central American nation is the deadliest in the world for communities fighting to protect lands against development, with about 120 activists killed since 2010, according to British-based watchdog Global Witness. Rights organizations this week criticized the government's support for the U.S.-led Alliance for Prosperity, an initiative to stem U.S. immigration by funding infrastructure megaprojects and crackdowns on gangs in Central America. Civil society organizations fear the program will result in an erosion of land and workers rights to encourage investment. But Acerro countered their concerns, saying it will create new opportunities to bolster human rights.    One of our principal priorities under the Alliance for Prosperity has in fact been the strengthening of human rights protections and of the institutional frameworks that support these,  Alcerro said. The government has been working with the European Union, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and rights charity Freedom House to develop policies that protect human rights and their advocates, he said.  This encompasses not only indigenous rights defenders, but also LGBT, political activists, journalists, and all Hondurans that work to promote and protect human rights,  he added. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said U.S. funding across Central America for the alliance, including $750 million pledged by the previous administration, will contribute to human rights training for the army and police, and to upholding the rule of law. Alcerro said that Honduras cannot directly control how U.S. agencies spend aid and investment but pledged that the regime would urge the U.S. government to align its spending with Honduran policy priorities, including rights.  U.S. and Honduran rights organizations, including the religious charities Sisters of Mercy and the Jesuit Migrant Service for Central America (JSMCA), have criticized continued U.S. support for the regime of President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Hernandez came to power after a military coup in 2009 overthrew the government of President Manuel Zelaya. His government plans to improve the country's infrastructure and communications, mostly through concessions to private industry, which have resulted in displacement of indigenous communities and small scale farmers, Sisters of Mercy said.  With regards to indigenous land rights, the Hernandez administration has already made unprecedented actions to ensure many indigenous groups hold communal land titles in accordance to their own customs,  said Alcerro.  Last year, the government granted indigenous groups communal land titles covering 1.1 million hectares - 8 percent of the national territory,  he added.

The 63.9-million share offering raised $1.9 billion after being priced at $30 per share, within the expected range of $27 to $31.  That makes it the second-largest U.S. initial public offering this year behind messaging app Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) $3.9 billion offering in March.   Altice USA's IPO is viewed as a means for its founder, Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can use as currency for new acquisitions. The company, which Netherlands-based Altice NV (ATCA.AS)  put together by acquiring Cablevision Systems and Suddenlink Communications, is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider. Shares touched a high of $32.17 before paring gains to $32.00 in midday trading. One hurdle Altice could face is that there are few U.S. cable assets out there to buy. Altice USA's Chief Executive Officer Dexter Goei said in an interview on Thursday that there were no specific targets on his radar.   It's really about being ready for tomorrow,  he said.  We're not the type of people to be kicking down doors. There needs to be a confluence of minds if something is going to happen.  Some analysts have said that Altice could harbor ambitions to one day take on large targets such as privately held Cox Communications, which has long said it does not want to sell.  Hopefully, they will consider us as partners if they choose to do it,  Goei said.  But it's not going to be the driver of the success of our business.   A Cox spokesman said the company has been clear it is not for sale and that it is aggressively investing in its own network, products and strategic partnerships.  Following the IPO, 75.2 percent of the company's shares will be held by its parent, Altice NV, which translates to 98.5 percent of the voting power. Altice USA, which reported a net loss of $76.2 million for the three months ended March 31, expects to use proceeds from the offering to pay down debt of nearly $21 billion. It is the second U.S. cable operator to go public in the last five years. WideOpenWest Inc (WOW.N) raised about $310 million in its IPO last month, which was priced below the expected range.

Total exports for all fields in Iraq, those of Baghdad and  the Kurdish region in the north, have averaged 3.8 million bpd so far in June, he told Reuters in the southern oil city of Basra. The country as a whole is producing about 4.315 million bpd, he said. Kurdish exports are running at about 520,000 to 530,000 bpd so far this month, he said. Iraq is in  quiet negotiations  with foreign oil companies operating in Iraq to amend their services contract, he said, declining to give more details. The country wants to change the terms of the contracts it deems no longer in its favor after oil prices collapsed three years ago, when they were in excess of $100 per barrel, to about $45 per barrel now. Oil prices should start recovering by the end of July, to reach $54 to $56 a barrel by the end of the year, Luaibi said. Iraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. The group in May rolled over an agreement to cut oil production with other exporting nations, until March, in order to support oil prices.  Iraq supports the agreement that we reached; if developments happen contrary to OPEC's interests, the (OPEC) ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting,  he said. Iraq will continue developing its production capacity and will start executing a sea water injection project in its oilfields at the end of the year, even without an agreement with Exxon (XOM.N), he said.  We are now in talks with Exxon Mobil, if we don't reach an  agreement, we have other options,  he said.

The MAX stole the show,  Ihssane Mounir, vice president of sales and marketing at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, told journalists.  This is probably one of our busiest air shows.   A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolAsked if Airbus had lost momentum after years in which it often trounced Boeing at annual industry gatherings, sales chief John Leahy said the slowdown in orders had been expected.   Is this a slower show than previous years? Yes, it is. Are we conceding that Boeing sold a few more airplanes than we did? Yes,  he told a news conference.  In a late flurry on Thursday morning, Airbus signed deals for almost 100 aircraft, with AirAsia and privately-owned Iranian carriers Zagros Airlines and Iran Airtour.  Slideshow (7 Images)Boeing topped up its tally by announcing a firm order for 125 737 MAX 8 airplanes with an undisclosed customer and another deal with lessor AerCap (AER.N) to convert 15 of its MAX 8 orders into the larger MAX 10. It also added a memorandum of understanding from Chinese domestic Riuli Airlines for 20 737 MAX 8 aircraft.  Analyst Richard Aboulafia, of Virginia-based Teal Group, said commercial activity had been better than expected and was reminiscent of shows in 2009 and 2011, when the aircraft industry had bucked a retreating world economy.   This time we've got instability and uncertainty in many regions of the world, but airline traffic is strong, and as we've seen at this show, airlines want jets and the finance people are certainly happy to help.   Leahy said he had expected the new Boeing plane to make more of a splash.  We had expected they would have had a bigger launch on the 737 MAX 10, not quite as many conversions, more incremental orders.   While he did not expect the MAX 10 to be a viable competitor to the A321, Leahy said the Boeing plane's launch could result in price pressure.  They're clearly going to come after us on price.   The A321 is larger than any previous member of the 737 family, a gap that the MAX 10 is intended to close.

Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto (BAJA.NS) and several buyout funds are also preparing bids for Ducati, which is being put up for sale by German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). A deal with Harley-Davidson would bring together the maker of touring bikes like the Electra Glide that are symbolic of America with a leading European maker whose high-performance bikes have a distinguished racing heritage. Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the deal, one source familiar with the matter said, adding tentative bids were expected in July. Volkswagen, whose Audi division controls Ducati – maker of the iconic Monster motorbike – is working with investment boutique Evercore on the sale which will help it fund a strategic overhaul following its emissions scandal. Based in the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati was on the wish list of private equity funds KKR (KKR.N), Bain Capital and Permira, which are all working on the deal, said the sources who declined to be identified as the process is private. Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its Bologna factory remained open in World War Two despite being the target of several bombings.  Ducati racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders. Harley-Davidson, which commands about half the U.S. big-bike market, was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the start of the last century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the great depression. Demand for Harley's motorcycles continues to be slow as its loyal baby boomer demographic ages and rivals such as the Indian brand bike maker Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N) and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) offer discounts. Volkswagen's powerful labor unions, which control half the seats on the carmaker's 20-strong supervisory board, repeated their opposition to selling the Italian motorcycle maker.  Ducati is a jewel, the sale of which is not supported by the labor representatives on Volkswagen's supervisory board,  a spokesman for VW group's works council said in an email.  Harley-Davidson is miles behind Ducati in technology terms,  he added. Bidding Field Evercore has sent out information packages to a number of potential suitors including Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Harley-Davidson bike is displayed in their head office in Singapore October 13, 2016.Edgar SuInvestindustrial bought a stake in Ducati before the financial crisis, subsequently taking control of the business before selling it to Audi in 2012. It is now looking to compete with heavyweight private equity firms and large industry players to regain control.  Volkswagen, Audi, Harley-Davidson, KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment. Bajaj, Investindustrial and Permira were not immediately available. Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements. A successful deal for Ducati, which last year reported revenues of 593 million euros, would show Volkswagen boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing his predecessor's quest for size. The logo of Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati is seen at a motocycle dealer in Dietlikon, Switzerland October 11, 2016.Arnd WiegmannVolkswagen said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that  non-core  businesses could be put up for sale. Volkswagen hopes to raise between 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion euros from the sale of Ducati, valuing it at 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 100 million euros, the sources said. The German car maker wants a valuation that reflects trading multiples of similar trophy assets in the automotive industry, such as Italian car maker Ferrari (RACE.MI) which trades at almost 30 times its forward earnings. Yet it may need to compromise on price as some of the bidders would struggle to pay as much as 1.5 billion euros for Ducati, several sources said. Price expectations have already proved challenging for some industry players who recently decided against bidding. Indian motorcycle firm Hero MotoCorp (HROM.NS) and its rival TVS Motor Company (TVSM.NS) initially expressed interest in Ducati but were put off by its price tag and decided to walk away, the sources said. German car marker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Japanese motorcycle makers Honda (7267.T) and Suzuki (7269.T) have also decided against bidding for Ducati, sources close to the companies told Reuters. A BMW spokesman confirmed the German firm was not interested in Ducati, while Hero and TVS were not immediately available for comment.

Otto Warmbier, 22, was arrested in the reclusive communist country while visiting as a tourist. He was brought back to the United States last week with brain damage, in what doctors described as state of  unresponsive wakefulness,  and died on Monday. Some 2,500 mourners attended a Thursday morning memorial at Wyoming High School. Warmbier graduated from the school in the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming as salutatorian in 2013.  A hearse carried Warmbier's casket from the school to a burial service at a local cemetery. Blue and white ribbons, the colors of Wyoming High School, were tied to the fence there.  The exact cause of Warmbier's death is unclear. Officials at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was treated, declined to provide details, and his family asked the Hamilton County Coroner on Tuesday not to perform an autopsy. Warmbier's brother and sister spoke at Thursday's memorial, as did a number of his friends, said attendee Fred Koss.   I had to come out to support the family, and also just to show, in my opinion, the North Korean government that we are a dignified country, unlike them,  said Koss a 70-year-old Wyoming resident.   A program for the memorial carried a quote from Andy Bernard, a character on the television show  The Office :  I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.   The casket of Otto Wambire is carried to the hearse followed by his family and friends after a funeral service for Warmbier, who died after his release from North Korea, at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2017.John Sommers II - RTS187QWarmbier was scheduled to graduate this year from the University of Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce.   He was able to connect with grownups and children, and he was one of those people that made you feel like you were his best friend, even though you had just met him,  said his college counselor, Cynthia Meis, who attended the service.  Slideshow (11 Images) He was genuine and authentic, and so smart.   Warmbier was traveling in North Korea with a tour group. He was arrested at Pyongyang airport as he was about to leave. He was sentenced two months later to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel, North Korea state media said. Warmbier's treatment was  appalling,  U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio told reporters outside the memorial. North Korean officials told U.S. envoys that Warmbier contracted botulism after his trial and lapsed into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. The family disbelieves that account. Warmbier's death has heightened tensions aggravated by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since last year.

With per capita consumption at nearly 58 kilograms (128 lbs) per year, barbecue-loving Argentines are among the most carnivorous people in the world.  Despite the high consumption level, the number of heavy cattle - the type most demanded by international markets - sent to slaughter houses is relatively low.   I prefer small animals, not the big ones because their meat is harder,  said Rosa Dimonica, a customer at a butcher shop in the old-fashioned San Telmo Market in Buenos Aires.  That attitude is typical of Argentine consumers, who tend to prefer veal even though it can cost more, said Miguel Schiaritti, president of the Meat Industry and Commerce Chamber.  More than 65 percent of bulls sent to slaughter in Argentina are young and light. Cows graze in a flooded farm near Victoria, Argentina, June 16, 2017.Marcos Brindicci They are well-accepted by the internal market, but they have no chance of being exported,  said Victor Tonelli, an agricultural consultant.  The average weight of a slaughtered animal in Argentina in 2016 was 226 kg (498 lbs) per animal, compared with 280 kg (617 lbs) and 360 kg (794 lbs) in competitors Australia and the United States, respectively, Tonelli added. Slideshow (7 Images)Once a top five global beef exporter, Argentina is currently eleventh, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.  High financing costs and inflation in Latin America's No. 3 economy discourage the investment necessary to produce the steers demanded by the global market and prompt the early slaughter of cattle for local consumption, said Adrian Bifaretti, head of the Beef Promotion Institute.  A stronger-than-expected peso versus the U.S. dollar also discourages the production of meat for export, leading producers to avoid heavy cattle with little demand in the domestic market, Bifaretti said.   An animal's age is not the only factor affecting how tender its beef is, said Schiaritti, noting that the amount of time a carcass spends in a refrigerator before being shipped to market also has an impact.

The S&P; healthcare index rose 1.58 percent to hit a record high as investors cheered the bill, which is aimed at curbing Medicaid funding and reshaping subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. United Health, Johnson and Johnson and Gilead rose between 1 percent and 5.3 percent, and were among the biggest boosts on the three major indexes. The Nasdaq biotechnology index rose 1.96 percent and is now up more than 9 percent for the week. A slight rebound in oil prices also relieved some pressure. U.S. crude was up 1.4 percent at $43.16 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was 1.76 percent higher at $45.62. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, skidding into bear market territory, despite OPEC-led efforts to stabilize the market. The S&P; energy index is the worst performing sector so far this year, having lost about 15 percent. The broader S&P; 500 index rose about 9 percent in the same period.

The Nasdaq Composite index was up 20.76 points, or 0.33 percent, at 6,254.72. Investors are also concerned that the drop in oil prices could affect inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, even as the central bank adopts a hawkish tone regarding future rate hikes.  Right now the bond market seems to be convinced that inflation is going to remain much lower than what the Fed thinks,  Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last week increased by 3,000 to 241,000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market. Among stocks, Accenture was off 3.9 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider trimmed its annual revenue forecast. Oracle, up 8.5 percent, provided the biggest boost to the S&P; after the company forecast an upbeat current-quarter profit. Tesla was up 1.9 percent at $383.35 after the company said it was in exploratory talks with the Shanghai municipal government to establish an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in China.

The 63.9-million share offering raised $1.9 billion after being priced at $30 per share, within the expected range of $27 to $31.  That makes it the second-largest U.S. initial public offering this year behind messaging app Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) $3.9 billion offering in March.   Altice USA's IPO is viewed as a means for its founder, Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can use as currency for new acquisitions. The company, which Netherlands-based Altice NV (ATCA.AS)  put together by acquiring Cablevision Systems and Suddenlink Communications, is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider. Shares touched a high of $32.17 before paring gains to $32.00 in midday trading. One hurdle Altice could face is that there are few U.S. cable assets out there to buy. Altice USA's Chief Executive Officer Dexter Goei said in an interview on Thursday that there were no specific targets on his radar.   It's really about being ready for tomorrow,  he said.  We're not the type of people to be kicking down doors. There needs to be a confluence of minds if something is going to happen.  Some analysts have said that Altice could harbor ambitions to one day take on large targets such as privately held Cox Communications, which has long said it does not want to sell.  Hopefully, they will consider us as partners if they choose to do it,  Goei said.  But it's not going to be the driver of the success of our business.   A Cox spokesman said the company has been clear it is not for sale and that it is aggressively investing in its own network, products and strategic partnerships.  Following the IPO, 75.2 percent of the company's shares will be held by its parent, Altice NV, which translates to 98.5 percent of the voting power. Altice USA, which reported a net loss of $76.2 million for the three months ended March 31, expects to use proceeds from the offering to pay down debt of nearly $21 billion. It is the second U.S. cable operator to go public in the last five years. WideOpenWest Inc (WOW.N) raised about $310 million in its IPO last month, which was priced below the expected range.

The Banco de Mexico is seen raising its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.00 percent, according to all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters. Analysts say that move, which would match the Fed's quarter-point rate hike last week, would help maintain the appeal of peso-denominated debt to yield-hungry investors. The central bank has raised its main interest rate in its previous six meetings to the highest level since early 2009 as inflation rose to a more than eight-year high. However, a rally in the peso has pushed the market to bet Thursday's action could be the end of the cycle of rate hikes.

Consumer prices have risen because of weakness in the peso, which has pushed up the cost of imported goods, and a big increase in gasoline prices by the government in January as the country moves from regulated prices to a free market for fuel.  But the peso has rallied from a record low in January as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose big tariffs on imports from Mexico and toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In her home country she had been forced to hide the fact that she was a lesbian from her family, her friends and, most importantly, from the authorities as same-sex relationships are illegal in Tunisia and punishable by three years imprisonment. When her disapproving brother found out she was gay she was forced to flee.   It's something prohibited, forbidden and unforgivable, and going back I can get attacked by my brother,  Afef told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at a meeting for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) asylum seekers in Dublin.  That's my past and it's not a good past. Here you have total freedom.  Afef, a slight woman aged in her mid 20s, is one of a rising number of LGBT people in Ireland seeking asylum due to fears of being persecuted for their sexuality in their home countries. Ireland made history in 2015 as the first country to legalize gay marriage by a popular vote, with 62 percent voting in a referendum in favor of gay marriage in the Irish Republic that was once dominated by the Catholic Church. Ireland this month formally elected its first openly gay prime minister, Leo Varadkar. But the asylum seekers find their bids to build new lives in Ireland keep hitting obstacles, getting bogged down in a slow, laborious system that has been criticized both domestically and internationally with proposed changes slow to take effect. Complex System Asylum seekers applying for refugee status in Ireland are provided with accommodation and food at hostels known as direct provision centers and given a weekly stipend of about 20 Euros  ($22) but they are cannot work or access further education. Afef, who did not want to use her full name for fear of reprisals, said this made it difficult to settle and become financially stable as the process could take years and the lack of transparency in the system was a massive frustration.  If they say within two years, you get your answer and finish the whole process it's fine. But some people can spend 10 years and some people can spend one. Basically you know nothing,  she said at a meeting of the Identity LGBT Refugee Support group at the Irish Refugee Council. Hailing from Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Gambia and Tunisia, all of the 35 regular members of the group are claiming asylum in Ireland based on their LGBT status. They only get together about once a month as many live outside Dublin and struggle with the cost to travel to meetings but they do stay in touch on social networks and WhatsApp. For while many of the group viewed Ireland as a safe haven,  being LGBT in the asylum system has its own difficulties as many face threats and intimidation from other asylum seekers in the centers, said Brian Collins from the Irish Refugee Council. Afef said one man in her center harassed her constantly.

Lgbt and Stuck in the System There are no statistics on the number of LGBT people seeking asylum in Ireland but there are almost 5,000 in the system overall, housed in about 32 centers around Ireland, according to recent figures from the Reception and Integration Agency set up in 2001 to coordinate services to asylum seekers and refugees.  It's a system that has come under fire from human rights watchdogs in Ireland as well as internationally with reports of people languishing in a system for up to 15 years. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission described the system as a  severe violation of human rights  in 2015 because of the time it took to process applications. Slideshow (3 Images)While Amnesty International has urged Ireland to expedite reforms of its direct provision accommodation, a system set up as a temporary emergency measure in 2000, as this was regarded as unsuitable for long-stay residence, especially for families children and victims of torture.  With calls for change mounting, Ireland's International Protections Office has committed to speed up decisions for asylum seekers while the Irish Supreme Court in May 2017 ruled denying asylum seekers the right to work was unconstitutional. Activists welcomed the proposed changes around employment. But Katrin Hugendubel, advocacy director for the European unit of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), cautioned fast-tracking applications could end up hurting the most vulnerable groups of asylum seekers – including LGBT individuals.  If you look at the accelerated procedures, that leaves people with very little time to prove their sexual orientation,  she said because LGBT asylum seekers need to provide evidence to back up their claim of LGBT persecution to get asylum. New Freedoms, New Problems The Identity group, set up in 2016, is supported by an asylum seekers' theater group, Change of Address, and the Irish Refugee Council. Theater director and co-founder of Identity, Oonagh Murphy, said they used crowdfunding to bring a group of LGBT asylum seekers in Ireland to attend the Dublin Gay Pride March in 2015 and it grew from there into a support group.  You come to Ireland, a tiny island at the edge of Europe, the last thing you expect is to be put back into close living arrangements from that culture,  Murphy said. Maverick from Zimbabwe arrived in Ireland in May 2015 and is awaiting a decision on his asylum application.  I was a bit nervous before I met the LGBT group, but it's getting a little bit better now,  said the 27-year-old motor mechanic who faced jail if found to be gay in Zimbabwe.  Last year I really had fun. We danced on the street,  he said.  Of course back home, you get killed for that.

The program is modeled on one set up last year by the neighboring Archdiocese of New York, which encompasses the city's boroughs of Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. Both programs were created in part to give victims who were abused a long time ago, beyond statutes of limitations, a chance for compensation.  I am well aware that no amount of money will ever heal the scars of abuse, but this program is a concrete expression of our contrition and our desire to make amends,  Nicholas DiMarzio, the Bishop of Brooklyn, said in a video statement. He said he had met more than 50 victims of sexual abuse by clergy. The Roman Catholic Church, which has more than 1.2 billion adherents, has grappled in recent years with the damage done to its role as a moral authority as more than a thousand people around the world have said they were abused by clergy, typically when they were children.  Across the United States, Catholic districts and religious orders have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits brought by victims. In the Brooklyn diocese, independent administrators will evaluate claims and determine compensation, the diocese said. The diocese itself will not be able to appeal or dispute the administrators' findings. Once the amount to be paid out in compensation becomes clearer, likely to be tens of millions of dollars, the diocese will secure a loan, it said. The Brooklyn diocese says it serves some 1.5 million Catholics in Brooklyn and the neighboring borough of Queens. The program will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg, a Washington lawyer, and Camille Biros, a manager at his firm. Both administer the New York archdiocese's program and oversaw the compensation of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Feinberg and Biros have already contacted about 235 people who have made allegations of abuse against the Brooklyn diocese's clergy to inform them of the possibility of compensation, Carolyn Erstad, a diocese spokeswoman, said. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), an international support group, said it welcomed the new program. Barbara Dorris, a director at SNAP, criticized aspects of both New York programs, however, for not covering Catholic clergy in the city who belong to religious orders, such as Jesuits.

This was clearly the best deal they had,  Cohodes said in a telephone interview.  If it wasn't Warren Buffett's name, the stock would be way, way, way down today.  Home Capital shares soared as much as 18 percent to its highest since April after Berkshire Hathaway agreed to provide a new C$2 billion loan facility.

Cohodes said:  The $1 million question here is now with 100-some odd million shares out, no ones know what this business model business looks like going forward, in terms of what they can make. You can't borrow at 9.5 percent and profitably lend out 4.5 percent. That just doesn't work.

I'm frustrated by it. Because you know, the free markets aren't exactly working here.  “I still think, with everything I got, that this company is worthless, I really do.

SS Jean Segura, out since June 1 with a right high ankle sprain, was activated from the disabled list and batted leadoff Wednesday. He went 1-for-3 and scored twice.  He came out of the (rehab start Tuesday night at Triple-A Tacoma) really well and came in today and said, 'I'm ready to play,'  Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Segura, who led the American League with a .341 batting average when he was hurt.  I don't think he's quite 100 percent yet, but he feels good physically.  RHP Tyler Cloyd was designated for assignment by Seattle. Cloyd made one appearance for the Mariners, his first in the majors since 2013, getting the victory June 9 against Toronto with a scoreless inning of relief. Cloyd signed a minor league contract with Seattle on May 12 after pitching in the independent Atlantic League. RHP Christian Bergman (4-4, 5.14 ERA) was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma to make room for RHP Andrew Moore, one of the organization's top prospects. Moore was called up to start Thursday against Detroit. Bergman made eight starts for Seattle, twice pitching seven shutout innings. On June 13 at Minnesota, Bergman allowed nine runs on 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings. He rebounded to get a 7-3 victory Sunday at Texas, giving up two runs on four hits in 5 2/3 innings. RHP Yovani Gallardo (3-7, 6.30 ERA) was scratched from Thursday's start and sent to the bullpen when the Mariners called up RHP Andrew Moore, one of their top prospects.  I talked with Gallardo. He understands where we're at right now,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  If you look at his raw stuff, I think it's ticked up some from last year, but he hasn't been able to stay away from the big innings.  In his last start, a 7-3 loss Saturday at Texas, Gallardo allowed five earned runs in five innings, with all of the damage occurring in the first.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6MYKLP8D"},

Obesity has long been tied to an increased risk of pregnancy complications for mothers and their infants. The current study examined data on 1.2 million births in Sweden and found that the odds of problems like heart defects, nervous system malformations and limb deformities rises along with the severity of mothers' obesity at the start of the pregnancy.  For normal-weight women, the risk of serious birth defects was 3.4 percent, the study found. For obese mothers, the risk ranged from 3.8 percent to 4.7 percent, increasing as women carried more excess weight based on their body mass index (BMI), researchers report in The BMJ.    The sensitive period of fetal organ development is the first eight weeks of pregnancy and it is in particular during this time BMI may have a negative impact,  said lead study author Dr. Martina Persson of the Karolinska Institute and Sachsska Children’s Hospital in Stockholm.  This means that it is important to try to obtain a body weight as close to normal as possible before conception,  Persson said by email. To assess the relationship between degrees of maternal obesity and the odds of birth defects, researchers examined records for singleton births across Sweden between 2001 and 2014.  They grouped women based on their BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, at the time of their first prenatal visit. Underweight women had a BMI of less than 18.5, normal-weight mothers had a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, and overweight people had a BMI of 25 to 29.9.  Women with the least severe obesity, known as  class I  had a BMI of 30 to 34.9, followed by class II with a BMI of 35 to 39.9, and the most severe obesity, class III, with a BMI of 40 or more.  Overall, 43,550 babies, or 3.5 percent, had major congenital malformations. Heart defects were the most common, followed by defects of the genital organs, limbs, urinary system, digestive system and nervous system. The overall risk of serious birth defects was 4.1 percent for boys and 2.8 percent for girls.  After accounting for other factors that can influence the odds of birth defects such as mothers' age, marital status, education, country of birth and smoking status, researchers found the most severely obese women in the study were 37 percent more likely to have babies with birth defects than normal weight mothers. Although the largest number of malformations involved the heart, the greatest rise in risk linked to obesity was for nervous system problems. Compared to normal-weight mothers, the risk of nervous system malformations rose by 44 percent to 88 percent with increasing severity of obesity.  While the study didn't show why more severe obesity carried a higher risk of birth defects, it's possible that health problems related to excess weight such as increased inflammation, abnormal metabolism, increased sensitivity to the hormone insulin and impaired vascular function all might play a role, Persson said. The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove that more severe obesity directly causes higher odds of birth defects. Another limitation of the study is that it only included live births. Miscarriages, still births and induced abortions are more common when babies have serious defects, the authors note.  Even so, it confirms previous research linking obesity to birth defects and offers fresh insight into the potential for the magnitude of mothers' excess weight to influence babies' odds of these problems, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.  This is important because it suggests that even if a woman can't reduce her pre-pregnancy weight down to normal, even reducing one weight class can reduce the risk of complications,  Caughey, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. Ideally, all women would start pregnancy at healthy weight, Caughey added.  That may not be entirely possible for many women, but even then a healthy diet and regular exercise is really important,  Caughey said.

Manal al-Sharif hit world headlines in 2011 when she filmed a video of herself driving in Saudi Arabia, the only country in the world to ban women from getting behind the wheel, and posted it on Youtube where it went viral. Two days later she was arrested and imprisoned for about a week, in the process becoming the face of the women's driving  movement much to the chagrin of the country's hardline clerics. Now based in Australia, al-Sharif welcomed King Salman's announcement on Wednesday that his son Mohammed bin Salman, 31, is to be next in line to the throne, replacing his cousin, as the kingdom seeks to overhaul its oil-dependent economy. She said she was hopeful the prince's young age and his work on the country's Vision 2030, that has a target to lift women in the workforce to 30 percent by 2030 from 22 percent, would open more doors for women.  I do have big expectations ... all the things his predecessors couldn't do, he will have the power to overturn the unjust laws that hinder women from reaching their full potential,  al-Sharif told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Los Angeles. Many younger Saudi Arabians regard Prince Mohammed's ascent as evidence that their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old and blocked women's progress. Al-Sharif, 38, said there has been some forward steps for women in recent years such as being allowed to work in certain retail and hospitality jobs. Women are now also allowed to vote and stand in municipal elections. But she said there is one major advancement that's missing. The male guardianship system, which requires women to get permission from a male relative before traveling overseas, getting married, or seeking medical care, gives Saudi women a legal status that resembles that of a minor. In some cases, the male relative with responsibility over a Saudi woman may be her own teenage son.  Calling a woman legally (an) adult. That will change the whole spectrum when it comes to women's rights in Saudi Arabia,  said al-Sharif, who this month released a memoir called  Daring to Drive: A Saudi Woman's Awakening .  Then she doesn't need permission from anyone to work, or to leave the country ... or to go to court and file a lawsuit.  Al-Sharif said declaring a woman an adult at 18 should be the first change that should happen for women in the gender-segregated nation under Prince Mohammed.  As for driving, she doesn't know exactly women will get behind the wheel in her country.  I hope before the self-driving car takes over,  she quipped, encouraging more Saudi women to start driving.  This very simple act of civil disobedience will make society accept women drivers in my country ... accept women to be independent ... I will never stop campaigning until the first drivers license is issued to a Saudi woman.

Founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, Imagination has been rocked by Apple's announcement in April that it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years time. Apple's decision, which analysts said posed an existential threat to the company, sent Imagination's shares plummeting 70 percent on April 3 and they have barely recovered since. The stock jumped as much as 21 percent on Thursday, however, after the sale announcement to 149.5 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of 425 million pounds ($538 million).  Analysts said potential buyers could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various entities from China, while Apple itself could be interested.  Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group,  the company said.   The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.  Imagination has said it doubted Apple, which accounts for about half of its sales, could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents. Analysts said legal battles were likely and Imagination started a dispute resolution procedure in May with the U.S. giant, which is valued at $761 billion. The British company initially responded to Apple's decision to walk away by putting two of its main divisions up for sale.  That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer,  said Neil Wilson, Senior Market Analyst, ETX Capital.  Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.  The headquarters of technology company Imagination Technologies is seen on the outskirts of London, Britain, June 22, 2017.Hannah McKayApple Reliance Imagination has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed, prompting Apple and Intel to buy stakes and the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012. Apple owns 8 percent of the shares. Imagination struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Slideshow (6 Images)Imagination downplayed fears it could lose Apple contract for years. Facing reports that Apple was building a graphics operation and hiring Imagination staff, the British firm told investors that Apple was just improving its customization of the technology Imagination sold, rather than replacing it.     Analysts at Stifel said they thought interested parties could include those groups that want to develop their own processing technology across platforms such as mobile, wearable tech, vehicles and the so-called Internet of Things.  This could include a coordinated Chinese bid, a hyper-scale vendor from the cloud or some other IP player,  they said.  Imagination said on Thursday it had received indicative proposals for its embedded MIPS technology - processors used in vehicles and home appliances - and its mobile connectivity division Ensigma, the two businesses put up for sale in the wake of the slide in its shares. While Imagination has other clients for its technology, UBS analysts estimated in April that its non-Apple business was worth just 81 million pounds and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013, was worth 77 million pounds. UBS said the company could be worth 110 pence per share on a sum of the parts basis. In May, Jefferies said the wind up value was about 96 pence a share while Morgan Stanley said the company could be worth as little as 106 million pounds, or just 30 pence per share, though its base case was 95 pence. The U.S. investment bank said Imagination's headquarters was worth 40 million pounds.

Lighthizer, who was appearing before a panel of U.S. senators, did not give details on the factors that could trigger action from the administration of President Donald Trump or what sort of action it might take. But he made clear he was not enthused about Ford Motor Co's announcement earlier this week that it will move some production of its Focus small car to China and import the vehicles to the United States.  I find that very troubling,  Lighthizer said.  It doesn't necessarily make sense to me.   Ford's plan suggests China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source.  The Ford logo is seen on a car in a park lot in Sao Paulo, Brazil June 2, 2017.Paulo Whitaker This is a business decision to improve profitability and deliver even better small cars to customers in a way that makes business sense,  said Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker. Felker said no U.S. hourly workers would lose their jobs as a result of Ford's decision.        Trump campaigned with promises to win better terms for U.S. workers in international trade, and has accused both China and Mexico of unfairly competing with U.S. industries. Automaker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said separately on Thursday it was exploring the possibility of establishing a Chinese manufacturing plant. Ford has said the production shift from Mexico to China, slated for mid-2019, is a purely financial move that will save the company $500 million in reduced tooling costs.  Lighthizer said he wanted to know more about the incentives for the move.  If it happened for reasons that are non-economic reasons, then I think the administration should take action,  he said.

Eighty-three percent also favor barring gun purchases by those on federal no-fly or watch lists, the survey found. But gun owners were far less supportive than non-owners of creating a federal database to track gun sales or to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The survey of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April, provided a snapshot of American views on guns and gun policies as the nation grapples with gun violence. On June 14, an Illinois man opened fire on Republican members of Congress with legally purchased guns during a baseball practice near Washington, wounding Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise.  A few hours later, a UPS driver opened fire with a handgun inside a United Parcel Service Inc delivery center in San Francisco, killing three co-workers before fatally shooting himself. Some advocates called for a renewed push for gun control measures, as the Republican-controlled Congress has sought to relax existing gun laws. The National Rifle Association has opposed expanded background checks and argued the government was already being notified when someone on a no-fly list attempts to buy a gun. Pew's survey respondents often diverged based on whether they were gun owners or non-owners, Republicans or Democrats and urban or rural residents.  Overall, 52 percent of Americans say gun laws should be stricter than they are today,  according to Washington-based Pew. Forty-four 44 percent of adults surveyed said they personally knew someone who was shot, accidentally or on purpose, and 83 percent believed gun violence was a very big or moderately big U.S. problem. As for violence in their local communities, 49 percent of black respondents said it was a very big problem, compared with 11 percent of whites.  A large majority said easy access to illegal guns contributed to gun violence, but just as many thought expanding gun ownership would boost crime as reduce it. Among all adults, 89 percent favored policies preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns, and 84 percent favored background checks in private sales and at gun shows.  Tracking gun sales was favored by 71 percent overall, banning assault weapons by 68 percent, and banning high-capacity magazines by 65 percent, with gun-owners showing less approval than non-owners.

The assignment of the final rating on the bond is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received and details regarding the amount, coupon rate and maturity. KEY RATING DRIVERS The bond is rated in line with REC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and the bond will be used for financing existing renewable energy projects, including re-financing and new eligible green projects. On 10 February 2017, Fitch assigned REC a final rating of 'BBB-' to its USD1 billion medium-term note (MTN). The programme rating is aligned with REC?s IDR on the basis that the notes issued under the programme will constitute REC's direct, unconditional and unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with all the company's other present and future outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. REC's ratings are equalised with those of Government of India (GoI, BBB-/Stable). This reflects REC's strong strategic importance, GoI's indirect support of the electricity sector in India and control through the state's majority stake. These factors underpin a strong likelihood of REC receiving extraordinary state support, if needed. Therefore, Fitch classifies it as a credit-linked public-sector entity according to the agency's Public-Sector Entity Rating Criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating actions on REC would be mirrored on the bond. REC's ratings are credit-linked to those of the sovereign, which means rating actions on the sovereign would result in similar rating actions on REC. A weakening of the links with the state, as manifested in reduced strategic importance, would prompt a downgrade.

With a deal expected within days, critics are concerned that Rome is exploiting loopholes to bend EU rules designed to prevent state bailouts. One European official privately admitted to  exasperation , after the European Central Bank and European Commission have tussled with Rome for years over how to solve its banks' problems within EU law. On Wednesday, Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo laid down tough conditions to buy the healthy parts of the two Veneto banks for just 1 euro, a move that would force the state to foot the bulk of the bill. Intesa said it would only take the banks if they were stripped of bad loans and risks, prompting criticism from those who designed the EU regime to stop the state from having to shoulder losses in bank crises, passing them on to investors instead. That solution also contrasts starkly with Santander's recent overnight rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and will raise billions to clean it up. Rome is taking advantage of a flexibility in European rules that permits routine insolvency proceedings for banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the state rather than EU authorities. One EU official said state aid in this case might be technically possible given that banks' shareholders and junior bondholders are also going to take a hit. But critics said Italy was being allowed to cut corners.  The Italians do not respect the rules. The ECB and the Commission are too weak to enforce them,  said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament.  This is destroying trust.  Italy is the last country in the euro zone to get to grips with the problems of its banking sector, meaning it faces stricter 'bail-in' rules - written by Giegold and others and introduced last year - that impose losses chiefly on bondholders and investors. With elections due next year and much of its banks' debt in the hands of ordinary Italians, Rome wants to avoid this step.  The signals from Italy are very negative,  said Volker Wieland, one of the German government's economic advisors. Wieland accused Italy of  looking for exceptions  to the rules, warning that such an approach would discourage Germany from supporting any common European protection of deposits, a proposal made to underpin confidence in the region's lenders. The ECB, which supervises Italian banks, and the EU Commission, which rules on whether state support can be allowed, have declined to comment on the Italian proposal, saying they await a formal announcement from Rome. No Hiding Place At home too the tactics in Rome - after more than six years of procrastination through the country's banking crisis - are raising questions. The government had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most demurred, having already spent billions propping up ailing banks, including through the government-sponsored Atlante fund that pumped 3.4 billion euros into the Veneto banks and is now set to be wiped out. Others had problems of their own, such as Monte dei Paschi, which is being bailed out by the state using another exception to the EU rules. Most banks said the government should stop asking them to chip in, and use instead the 20 billion euros it set aside for bank rescues, negotiating terms with Brussels. Opposition politicians have been critical.  Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays,  said Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, estimating the cost for the Italian state could be 5-6 billion euros.  Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?  Carla Ruocco, a prominent lawmaker of the 5-Star movement, echoed this view:  By wasting years, the government put itself in a bind.

Summer is typically when gasoline demand peaks in the world's biggest oil consuming country as motorists hit the road for vacation, and keeping their gas tanks full strains the capacity of U.S. refiners and pipelines. This year, so much fuel is stored in tanks in the Northeast that Colonial Pipeline Co [COLPI.UL] said in a notice to customers that demand from refiners and fuel traders to bring gasoline through its pipeline to the region from refining hubs in the South was the worst in six years. For the first time since 2011, demand for the pipeline was below capacity for a five-day period starting early next week, Colonial said on Thursday. The news pushed down gasoline prices in the Gulf region, where the pipeline begins. Benchmark U.S. gasoline prices led the energy complex higher and were up about 2.1 percent shortly after midday, partly boosted by expectations that fewer barrels flowing into the East Coast would alleviate a glut.  Typically, demand exceeds the pipeline's space, forcing refiners and traders to supplement delivery with tanker shipments or imports.  The only reason they wouldn't be full is clearly that inventory levels are high enough that there is no incentive to move product to New York,  said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research, Morningstar in Austin, Texas. Even when inventories are high, shippers typically keep pumping full volumes just to ensure they keep their rights to the line space for when they really need it, said Fielden.      The situation is quite unusual,  he said. The firms using the line have been losing money on pumping barrels through it for months, because of high inventories and low prices for gasoline in the northeast. With no sign of those inventories easing much, refiners and shippers have decided to cut volumes.  It's purely economic - why ship into a negative arb(itrage) for that long,  one trader said.  Linespace, a spot market created to trade capacity on the congested pipeline, turns negative when it becomes unprofitable to ship barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Linespace on the line has only been positive for six days so far this year, according to pricing information from S&P; Global Platts.  While consumption in the driving season is below the record volume of 2016, demand in two of the past five weeks has hit all-time highs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But demand has not had much impact on inventories, because U.S. refiners are also pumping out a record volume of motor fuel for the second straight year. Gasoline inventories in the region are just shy of the five-year high for this time of year, after falling last week by 1.3 million barrels last week to 67.6 million barrels, according to the government data. [EIA/S] Global oil prices have languished despite efforts by the world's top producers to limit output. U.S. crude futures plunged to a 10-month low on Wednesday. [O/R] Colonial Pipeline's main gasoline line, Line 1, which runs to Greensboro, North Carolina, from Houston, carries about 1.3 million barrels of fuel every day.  Colonial did not detail in its notice to shippers how far below capacity demand was for the pipeline. A terminal operator in New York Harbor said tanks were full and barges that typically move products out of the U.S. gasoline hub were sitting empty.  We are typically short barges, but we are long now,  the operator said.  People are just not moving product.  Colonial connects Gulf Coast refineries with markets across the southern and eastern United States through more than 5,500 miles (8,850 km) of pipelines, delivering gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products. Colonial indicated it did not expect demand to exceed capacity for the next five-day cycle through the line, and informed shippers it would therefore not follow the typical process for rationing space. Gulf Coast gasoline grades weakened on Thursday. Conventional motor fuel fell as much 2 cents to trade 5 cents per gallon under benchmark gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before bouncing back to around -3.25 cents. That was still down from the discount of 3 cents on Wednesday.

The justices, in a 6-2 ruling, said the evidence withheld by the prosecution at the time of the trial, which the men claimed would have cast doubt on their guilt in the murder of Catherine Fuller, was not material to the eventual jury verdict.  The case has stayed the public eye not only because of the grisly nature of the murder that occurred during a period of high crime in the U.S. capital city in the 1980s but also because of the Supreme Court's decision to scrutinize the process that led to the convictions.  Fuller, a 48-year-old mother of six, had gone shopping on Oct. 1, 1984, but was found dead a few blocks from her home in a filthy alleyway garage, about a mile (1.6 km) from the Capitol. She had been beaten, shattering her bones and damaging her liver, and then sodomized with a pipe-like object.  A jury convicted the seven men, who were in their teens to early-20s at the time, along with another man who subsequently died in prison.  Starting in 2010, the men pursued an effort to overturn their convictions, arguing that prosecutors had withheld crucial evidence, including the identity of a man seen running into the alley after the murder. That man was known for committing robberies in the neighborhood, and years later committed a similar murder just three blocks from the scene of this crime, according to court papers. The convicted men have maintained their innocence. They said the withheld evidence violated their right under the U.S. Constitution to due process of the law. The Supreme Court ruled in 1963 that withheld evidence must be material to a defendant's guilt or punishment to be unconstitutional.  Writing for the court on Monday, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the evidence in this case did not meet that standard because it was  too little, too weak or too distant  from the main evidence and would not have changed the jury verdict.  Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, saying the theory of an alternative perpetrator potentially could have swayed even one juror.  With the undisclosed evidence, the whole tenor of the trial would have changed,  Kagan wrote.  Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after arguments were heard in the case, did not participate in the decision.

Flooding is an annual problem that's worsening with climate change and poor maintenance of the channels that carry out the excess water. Only 17 percent of households have piped water, and half of people use water tainted with sewage, leading to cholera and other disease deaths. But the worst challenge facing the fast-growing city – which records everything from crocodile attack to sexual assault as regular problems – is that there's no real city government.  Instead, the community operates under the authority of an outdated rural council that is  lacking in transparency and unable to cope with the complex nature of Karonga urban life,  according to a report by Urban Africa Risk Knowledge, a British aid-funded program focused on helping fast-urbanizing sub-Saharan Africa reduce its growing risks.  There are no systems present in small centers  like Karonga, said Mtafu Manda, a researcher with Malawi's Mzuzu University and the lead author of the report.   Or if they exist, it is only on paper.  Disaster risks are arguably rising faster in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else, said Arabella Fraser, a risk and resilience researcher at the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI). That's in part the result of surging urban populations, a quickening pace of climate-related problems - such as flooding and drought - and an inability to beat back those risks because of poverty, poor data, lack of training and badly run government, she said at a discussion held at ODI on Thursday. But plenty of ideas are emerging about how growing African cities can cut their risks.  Among them: organize slum dwellers to improve the infrastructure or simply sort out which risks are the key ones, and focus on those first, experts at the discussion said. These days,  one of the most difficult jobs in the world is being an African mayor,  said Meggan Spires of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), which is based in Cape Town.  The challenges are vast, complex and immediate, and many are day to day,  said Spires, who formerly worked on climate change issues for the South African city of Durban.  Finding time to deal with demands to be proactive and work toward greater sustainability, in line with international agreements like the Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on climate change, is a heavy burden, she said. One thing that can help, she said, is ensuring that efforts to build urban resilience are not just short-term, donor-funded projects but are based on community demand and then built into city plans, often with innovative funding. Donors aiming to improve resilience in Africa need to  be humble and recognize that Africans know their cities best. We should listen to them rather than imposing solutions on them.  Turning to the Slums One way to get effective change underway is to harness organizations of slum dwellers, who make up large parts of the population in many African cities, said David Satterthwaite, an urban specialist with the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development. About 18 slum dweller federations have formed in Africa, with about 15 of them collecting data door to door on everything from healthcare to schools, drainage to eviction threats.  Satterthwaite called it  an information base that provides a new possibility for local governments...to form, drive and implement new risk-reduction efforts.  One thing that's clear from data already collected in cities such as Tanzania's Dar es Salaam, for instance, is that health threats kill many more people each year than floods, even though residents see those as the biggest risk, he said. That means investments in things like sanitation systems and clean water may have the biggest payoff - though getting funding can be tough when donors focus on climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction efforts, Satterthwaite said. Manda, of Malawi, said keeping politics in mind is also key to making progress in Africa's cities - and small cities have the toughest challenges of all, he said. Political leaders  don't think about the small towns, partially because they don't live there but also because they want to benefit from the chaos,  he said.  When there is a disaster, when they go there as some kind of savior, they are seen to be very good,  he said.  And because of that, the risks in these small towns will escalate.

Bob Quinn, AT&T;'s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said in a C-SPAN interview this week that the telecommunications company was unclear what final conditions the Justice Department may seek as part of any approval.  That conversation is just beginning really,  Quinn said.  We've gotten through the point where we're produced all the data and answered all the questions and I think that process will kick off this summer.  In June, a Senate panel voted 19-1 to advance the nomination of Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim and it is not clear when they will vote. Until Delrahim is confirmed,  it is kind of hard to predict whether even the list that we see preliminarily will be the final list that they want to close on,  said Quinn, without elaborating. The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier still needs some foreign approvals. In March, it won the European Commission's nod for the deal. Separately, a group of Senate Democrats on Wednesday, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, urged the Justice Department to closely scrutinize the deal.  We have strong concerns that the combined company's unmatched control of popular content and the distribution of that content will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and poorer quality services for Americans,  they wrote.  Before initiating the next big wave of media consolidation, you must consider how the $85 billion deal will impact Americans' wallets, as well as their access to a wide range of news and entertainment programming.  AT&T; said in a statement it had previously addressed all the issues in the letter and argued that the deal would offer consumers more choice, and  will expand distribution and creative opportunities for diverse and independent voices.

I find that very troubling,  Lighthizer said.  It doesn't necessarily make sense to me.

If he isn't doing Professor Severus Snape, the mysterious potions master at Hogwarts School, the 27-year-old likes to dress in some other costume relating to J.K. Rowling’s fantastical world of witches and wizards. Massingham said of his colleagues:  They don't react as much now as they used to. They just sort of go 'oh, you're wearing that again'.  Monday marks 20 years since the release of  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,  the first of seven Potter books in a series that sold 450 million copies in 79 languages and sparked a $7 billion movie franchise. Massingham is not the only super fan. Tracey Nicol-Lewis, 43, and her 15-year-old son Brenden like to dress up in Hogwarts uniform for trips to the supermarket in Cardiff, Wales. Nicol-Lewis' obsession with Rowling's world of wizards started when her husband gave her one of the books,  Goblet of Fire,  shortly before he died.  We kind of clung to that,  she said.

His dark hair, thin nose, brown eyes and even his voice bear a striking resemblance to Radcliffe, who first starred as Harry in the 2001 film version of  The Philosopher’s Stone.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the session flat following two days of straight losses, while the blue chips were also flat. Health care was the top-gaining sector, up 2 percent and briefly touching its highest level since December 2015, with Switzerland's Novartis in the driving seat. Novartis' shares marched 5 percent higher following a positive study result for its canakinumab medicine, which cuts risks for heart attack survivors.  Expectations around this catalyst have been low and as a result we have previously highlighted success could drive 3% to 5% upside to mid-term EPS and valuations,  analysts at Jefferies said in note. Oil continued to dog European shares, however, as prices eased slightly off multi-month lows. Europe's energy sector was down 0.3 percent, touching near-7-month lows.  What didn't help were those conflicting comments from OPEC ... and Iran. They need to be singing from the same hymn sheet if we are to believe that there's positivity to be taken from these cuts while the U.S. continues to produce more and the rig-count goes up,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  As we saw yesterday, even a drawdown in stockpiles offered absolutely no help because it just added to the murky outlook.  Likewise pessimism on the oil sector and concerns around a 2018 supply glut from broker Morgan Stanley put pressure on shares in Subsea 7, which they downgraded to  equal weight . Subsea 7's shares dropped 4.4 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. Elsewhere, Imagination Tech, once a high flyer as a supplier of graphics technology to Apple <AAPL.O, soared more than 20 percent after it put itself up for sale. In April, Apple said that it would no longer use Imagination's graphics technology in the iPhone, wiping out more than 60 percent of the British firm's market value. Broker action also lifted shares in industrial machinery firms Rotork and Alfa Laval, which rose 3.6 percent and 3.9 percent respectively following double upgrades from Morgan Stanley to  overweight . The broker said that it was positive on forecasts for Alfa Laval's divisions, and saw growth potential for Rotork's products.

The announcement, which comes as several other banks prepare a similar move, shows financial groups are pressing on with plans to relocate part of their businesses, regardless of the shape of a final deal reached in Brexit divorce talks. Such moves are set to further bolster Frankfurt's influence. Despite its small size and dull image, the city is favoured because it is the financial capital of Europe's biggest economy and also home to the European Central Bank. Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, has also picked Frankfurt as its EU headquarters after Brexit, one person with knowledge of the matter said. Several other banks are poised to make a similar move, said two people familiar with those discussions. Daiwa had previously said it favoured the German city, because London-based staff could easily be transferred to its investment banking branch there. Daiwa said in a statement on Thursday it would apply for a licence in Germany and its move would  ensure that Daiwa can continue to service its clients in EU after the United Kingdom leaves . The group has said it would still keep staff in London even after Brexit. It has 450 staff working in the EU now, mostly in the British capital. Frankfurt, which has long grappled with an unfavourable backwater image, promotes itself as a stable city for banks seeking to relocate, while the German government and politicians have discreetly welcomed those looking to move. Britain's future following Brexit talks to leave the trading bloc is more uncertain than ever after an election where voters denied its Prime Minister Theresa May a majority in parliament. Against this backdrop, Germany's steady, if sometimes grey, image holds appeal.

We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal,  he told reporters, referring to talks on Brexit that began in Brussels this week.  Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. I told them that in fact the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve,  he said, before turning to the late Beatle to clarify.  So, who knows?,  said Tusk, citing Lennon's  Imagine .  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I am not the only one.  Asked later if it was not an  illusion  to imagine halting Brexit, the 60-year-old Pole insisted:  Politics without dreams would be a nightmare .

Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister chairing a summit of EU leaders in Brussels attended by British Prime Minister Theresa May, spoke of the revival of discussion in Britain since May lost her parliamentary majority on June 8.  We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal,  he told reporters, referring to talks on Brexit that began in Brussels this week.  Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU.

Once considered one of the most promising emerging markets, Nigeria was hammered when it introduced draconian foreign exchange restrictions to counter the effects of the 2014 oil price crash. These will take years to unwind, some analysts fear, while others are concerned the new trading facility could come under pressure if oil prices were to take another tumble, or trade through it could slow if Nigeria's currency reserves run low. The much-criticised move starved the economy of dollars, throttled foreign investment and plunged Africa's largest economy into recession for the first time in more than 25 years. But authorities have since tried to normalise the currency market and alleviate dollar shortages, most recently via the  Investors & Exporters FX Window , which allows investors and traders to swap nairas for dollars at market-determined rates. The new window adds to a confusing array of exchange rates. But it does seem to be succeeding in luring back some foreign funds, especially as the economy should return to growth soon and inflation is finally slowing.  It is a very good thing. Obviously having multiple exchange rates is not an optimum situation yet, but it is moving towards a more realistic exchange rate,  said Oliver Weeks, economist at hedge fund Emso Asset Management.  This certainly makes the country more interesting.  Under the new system, in place since April, the opening and closing naira/dollar rates are determined by a poll of authorised bank dealers. The NAFEX or Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing is set around noon and serves as a benchmark for derivatives such as forwards and futures. Weeks said Emso has used the new mechanism successfully several times in the past six weeks. Since the window's launch, foreigners have swapped some $2.2 billion through it, according to the central bank although London-based Exotix Capital said many of the deals were likely small as some people test the new system. Data from Lagos-based FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange, which hosts the window, shows the naira NAFEX fix at nearly 369 per dollar, well below the official 305 rate the central bank had previously clung to. Sola David-Borha, Chief Executive Africa Regions at Standard Bank - one of the authorised dealers in the new window - said the window was working  reasonably well  and there was definitely liquidity.  But the most important thing is that the central bank is willing to engage, and there is constant engagement now with bankers, investors and other stakeholders,  David-Borha said. Stocks Race Up The Lagos stock market has climbed nearly a third in the past six weeks and trading volumes have more than doubled. Local bonds, some paying yields over 20 percent are also luring more foreign investors, local traders said The new window has re-opened the doors to the carry trade in naira - one of the few such opportunities on the continent outside South Africa, said Yvette Babb, executive director for sub-Saharan Africa research and strategy at J.P Morgan. Babb estimates foreign portfolio outflows from Nigeria were around $6 billion last year, but added:  Depressed equity prices and high local currency yields in combination with the exchange rate adjustment is likely to give rise to further foreign portfolio inflows.  But NAFEX still has plenty of critics. Above all, investors are worried by authorities' failure to guarantee that the window will remain available in future, especially in the event of another sharp decline in oil prices. Secondly, the central bank sold more than $4 billion from February to May to narrow the gap between the official and black market exchange rates. But with reserves of just over $30 billion, it is doubtful it can keep selling at such a pace.  In the case of oil production coming down again, it is not clear that the currency will adjust and you could go back to a position where the market goes completely illiquid again,  Emso's Weeks said. And those betting that NAFEX heralds a swift and full-fledged naira liberalisation may be disappointed. Although an exporter of oil, Nigeria's reliance on imports for fuels such as gasoline is a drain on foreign exchange. The government has pledged to end its reliance on oil product imports by 2019 - and the two are connected, Babb said.  Markets are expecting more exchange rate liberalization in the next six months, but policymakers seem to be seeking convergence by 2019,  Babb added. So more conservative investors are holding back. For instance Guy Tousso, portfolio manager for emerging markets fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management, is waiting for a functioning naira market to return but says it is inevitable.  They are getting there, but it is a slow pace in Nigeria because the social impact will be negative. But I don't think they have any choice.

Meanwhile, shares dipped. By 1600 GMT the rand gained 0.7 percent to 12.9950 per dollar, dipping below 13.00 for the first time since Monday. Despite data signalling the economy could bounce back from recession, investor sentiment has been clouded by political turbulence. The rand slipped to a three-week low on Monday as a government anti-graft body recommended a change to the central bank's mandate on targeting currency and inflation stability. A push back from the bank and Thursday's court ruling on a no-confidence vote eased investor concerns, lifting demand for the currency. Wichard Cilliers, chief dealer at Treasury One, said anticipation of the court ruling lured buyers to the rand and helped shake off sluggish demand for emerging market assets.

Najibullah Ahmadzai, chairman of the Independent Election Commission (IEC), announced the date at a news conference in Kabul. He said the success of the polls would depend on proper funding and security.  The government has the responsibility to prepare the budget. Security of the election will be the responsibility of the government and security agencies,  he said.  Preparations for the polls were hit by infighting within a government struggling to contain the Taliban insurgency. Parliamentary and council elections have been a headache ever since a disputed 2014 presidential vote that saw the creation of a national unity government led by former rivals President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. There have been disagreements between the Ghani and Abdullah camps and issues around voter registration, electoral fraud and security.  The U.S. embassy in Kabul and the United Nations both welcomed the decision on the new election date, which comes at a time of growing political and ethnic tensions.  The people of Afghanistan have made clear their desire for credible, inclusive elections,  said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan.  We welcome the IEC's commitment to a realistic date for holding parliamentary and district council elections, and to an improved and transparent electoral process,  he said. The current parliament's five-year mandate ended in June 2015 but, amid worries over security and disputes over how to hold a fair vote, the president issued a decree extending its term until new elections could be held.

A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolAsked if Airbus had lost momentum after years in which it often trounced Boeing at annual industry gatherings, sales chief John Leahy said the slowdown in orders had been expected.   Is this a slower show than previous years? Yes, it is. Are we conceding that Boeing sold a few more airplanes than we did? Yes,  he told a news conference.  In a late flurry on Thursday morning, Airbus signed deals for almost 100 aircraft, with AirAsia and privately-owned Iranian carriers Zagros Airlines and Iran Airtour.  Slideshow (7 Images)Boeing topped up its tally by announcing a firm order for 125 737 MAX 8 airplanes with an undisclosed customer and another deal with lessor AerCap (AER.N) to convert 15 of its MAX 8 orders into the larger MAX 10. It also added a memorandum of understanding from Chinese domestic Riuli Airlines for 20 737 MAX 8 aircraft.  Analyst Richard Aboulafia, of Virginia-based Teal Group, said commercial activity had been better than expected and was reminiscent of shows in 2009 and 2011, when the aircraft industry had bucked a retreating world economy.   This time we've got instability and uncertainty in many regions of the world, but airline traffic is strong, and as we've seen at this show, airlines want jets and the finance people are certainly happy to help.   Leahy said he had expected the new Boeing plane to make more of a splash.  We had expected they would have had a bigger launch on the 737 MAX 10, not quite as many conversions, more incremental orders.   While he did not expect the MAX 10 to be a viable competitor to the A321, Leahy said the Boeing plane's launch could result in price pressure.  They're clearly going to come after us on price.   The A321 is larger than any previous member of the 737 family, a gap that the MAX 10 is intended to close.

Benchmark aluminum on the London Metal Exchange closed up 0.2 percent at $1,870 a tonne after earlier touching $1,866.50, near Wednesday's lowest since May 11 of $1,866.  China is producing and exporting more aluminum. Rising stocks do not signal a tight market,  said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.  Production costs have come down because coal prices are lower.  EXPORTS: China's aluminum exports are rising. In May the country exported 460,000 tonnes of unwrought aluminum and aluminum products, up from April's 430,000 tonnes. OUTPUT: China's aluminum production last year accounted for 55 percent of the global total, estimated at nearly 59 million tonnes, according to International Aluminum Institute. Its output has been rising since March. INVENTORIES: Aluminum stocks in LME warehouses are up around 13,000 tonnes this week to above 1.43 million tonnes. [MALSTX-TOTAL] SHANGHAI: Stocks in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange at 433,110 tonnes are more than four times the levels seen in January. [AL-STX-SGH] POWER: Electricity, generated by burning coal, accounts for  30 to 40 percent of aluminum production costs in China. Lower coal prices cut output costs and boost margins. HIGH: Aluminum hit $1,981 in March, its highest since December 2014 on expectations of falling supplies from China, where an environmental crackdown could mean output cuts during the winter months starting in November. POLLUTION: The crackdown on pollution is part of a broader move to reduce overcapacity, boost revenues and help improve banks' balance sheets under pressure from non-performing loans, said Goldman Sachs analyst Max Layton. BANKS:  Steel and coal output cuts were about bank balance sheets in the first instance, they also reduced pollution. These cuts were put in place early last year when non-performing loans were spiking,  Layton said.  China's aluminum output cuts will move the needle, you are looking at a balanced Chinese market over the next couple of years and lower export growth.  ZINC: Zinc closed up 2.3 percent at $2,700 a ton. Earlier it touched $2,710, its highest since April 7, on falling stocks in LME warehouses, which are down nearly 30 percent since January to 304,000 tonnes, and on canceled warrants -- metal earmarked for delivery -- at above 65 percent.

In an interview with Reuters ahead of his trip to Washington next week for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, Moon said 'strong' sanctions should be imposed if North Korea tests an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or conducts a sixth nuclear test. “It must be sufficiently strong enough that it would prevent North Korea from making any additional provocations, and also strong enough that it will make North Korea realize that they are going down the wrong path,” Moon said.  The comments mark the toughest warning yet by the liberal former human rights lawyer, who was elected in May after campaigning for a more moderate approach to the North and engaging the reclusive country in dialogue. As a candidate, he said, sanctions alone have failed to impede Pyongyang's defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. North Korea will acquire the technology to deploy a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of hitting the mainland United States  in the not too distant future,  Moon said. Exert More Pressure  I believe China is making efforts to stop North Korea from making additional provocations, yet there are no tangible results as of yet,  Moon told Reuters at the sprawling Blue House presidential compound.  China is North Korea’s only ally and China is the country that provides the most economic assistance to North Korea,  Moon said.  Without the assistance of China, sanctions won't be effective at all.  Moon's remarks echoed that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said in a tweet on Tuesday Chinese efforts to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear program have failed. Top U.S. officials pressed China on Wednesday to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea-level in talks with their counterparts in Washington on Wednesday. “Maybe President Trump believes that there is more room for China to engage North Korea and it seems that he is urging China to do more. I can also sympathize with that message,” Moon said. China accounts for 90 percent of world trade with North Korea. Diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor, and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo and bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers. Washington has considered imposing  secondary sanctions  against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea. g20 Meeting South Korea and the United States agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in response to the growing missile threat from North Korea. But the move has angered China, which says the system's powerful radar will look deep into its territory and undermine regional security. China has pressured South Korean businesses via boycotts and bans, such as ending Chinese group tours to South Korea and closing most of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group's Lotte Mart retail stores in China. Lotte handed over a golf course it owned in southern South Korea so the THAAD battery could be installed there. South Korean President Moon Jae-in smiles during an interview with Reuters at the Presidential Blue House in Seoul, South Korea June 22, 2017.Kim Hong-JiMoon said that while China has never officially acknowledged economic retaliation, many South Korean businesses face difficulties in China, and he hopes to hold talks with Xi at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany next month to address the issue.   If I have the chance to meet President Xi, I will ask for him to lift these measures. This is the agenda that we cannot evade,  Moon said. “If we were to link political and military issues to economic and cultural exchanges, this could lead to some hindrance to the development of our friendly relationship between our two countries.” Moon said he wants to sit down with as many world leaders as possible in Hamburg -- including Xi, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin -- where he expects the North's nuclear program will top the agenda. Thaad Mysteriously Accelerated Slideshow (7 Images)Moon, who pledged to review the controversial decision to deploy THAAD during his election campaign and delayed full deployment of the system this month to review how the system will affect the area's environment, said it was important to ensure domestic law and regulations are properly enforced.  But for some reason that I do not know, this entire THAAD process was accelerated.  In the first disclosure of the details of the schedule of the THAAD deployment agreed by the two countries last year, Moon said the original agreement was to deploy one launcher by the end of 2017 and the remaining five launchers next year. In a surprise pre-dawn operation, the U.S. military moved two launchers into the deployment site in late April just days before the election. In addition, four more launchers had been brought into the country, which Moon called “very shocking.  Japan's Wartime Past Japan is an important partner in the effort to resolve the North Korean crisis but Tokyo's refusal to fully own up to its wartime past, its claims to the disputed islands between the two countries as well as its growing military spending are concerning, Moon said.  If Japan were to show its strong resolve in looking back on its past history and sending a message that such actions will never happen again... then I believe that this will go a long way in further developing its relations with not only Korea but also with many other Asian nations,  he said. Moon has said many South Koreans did not accept a deal reached by his conservative predecessor and Japan's Abe in 2015 to resolve the issue of Korean  comfort women  -- a euphemism for women forced to work in the Japanese military's wartime brothels.  Japan does not make full efforts to resolve issues of history between our two countries, including the comfort women issue,  Moon said. Moon said he has  high expectations  for the upcoming summit with Trump next week and said the priority the two leaders have placed on North Korea has raised the possibility the nuclear issue will be resolved.  I'm very glad that President Trump has made the resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue as top of his priority list on his foreign affairs agenda.

Luton was the destination for Wizz Air's first ever flight in 2004, and the airline said that the base would help to serve its routes from the airport more effectively. It will allow the airline to keep aircraft at Luton overnight and will create 36 jobs.  London Luton has been a very important part of our story, and it remains so,  Owain Jones, chief operating officer at Wizz Air, told Reuters.  We've got 13 percent growth (in traffic) here this year, and having the aircraft based here, having the local crew, it will enable us to keep that strong growth going.  Wizz Air already flies about a third of the flights from Luton, and some months it has more flights from the airport than rival easyJet, which is headquartered there. CEO Jozsef Varadi has said the new base reflected the size of the Luton operation, where it served 5 million passengers last year, making it the second largest airline there behind easyJet. The two airlines generally compete on different routes, with Wizz Air focused on Central and Eastern Europe, while easyJet's focus is more towards western Europe and the Mediterranean.  We have limited overlap with easyJet from Luton,  he said.  easyJet has a very different business model and a very different network from us.  Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said that while Wizz only competes directly with easyJet on the Split and Tel Aviv routes, he currently favoured Wizz Air as an investment over easyJet.  Exposure to growth and improving cost structure are the two core reasons to be buying Wizz Air,  Simpson said. Wizz Air's rapid expansion has been helped by its niche in the growing central and eastern European market and its low cost base. Jones said that Wizz keeps costs down because of its young fleet, which flies primarily from secondary airports and avoids doing connecting flights. Wizz Air said on Wednesday that it had ordered 10 new Airbus A321ceo planes. Wizz Air reported record profit last month and said it saw few signs of a hit from Britain's decision to leave the European Union. Jones said that the decision to have a base at Luton showed that the airline was backing its British business.  This is really a vote of confidence in our British business. Following the (Brexit) vote last year ... we're continuing to fill our aircraft to the same extent as we were before,  Jones said. Reporting by Alistair Smout.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index reduced losses gradually to end just 0.1 percent lower at 7,439.29 points, while mid cap peers also closed 0.1 percent lower. Health stock Shire was the top gainer, up 3.7 percent after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated its Veyvondi drug which prevents bleeding.  With a string of positive clinical news flow, we do see Shire’s share price as an anomaly compared to peers, trading highly inexpensive. Shire features on several of our promotion lists, including the health care most favored list,  analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note. Peers GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca both gained around 2 percent. Safe-haven precious metals miners Fresnillo and Randgold were also in demand as the price of gold rose. Heavyweight oil firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell , which had put the most pressure on the index earlier in the session, reduced losses to trade flat as oil prices edged up from multi-month lower.  Oil has fallen back to levels not seen since mid-November 2016, and traders are worried it could bring about low inflation and diminished growth,  David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said. Financials took the most points off the index, with Barclays down 2.1 percent as cyclical stocks came under pressure. United Utilities was the biggest faller, dropping more than 4 percent as its shares traded without entitlement to their latest dividend payout. Shares in bruised Provident Financial were up 3.6 percent, however, recovering a fraction of their heavy 17.6 percent loss in the previous session after the subprime lender had issued a profit warning. Outside of the blue chips, small cap constituent Imagination Technologies jumped as much as 21 percent after putting itself up for sale. The tech firm has struggled ever since Apple, its biggest customer, said in April that it would develop its own graphics chips, sending its shares more than 60 percent lower in the immediate aftermath. It ended the session up 16.4 percent.  Without Apple we are not convinced of the long term viability of the business model,  analysts at N+1 Singer said in a note.  The stock remains firmly in special situation territory, but given the likelihood of an offer emerging we move our recommendation to 'Hold'.

Howard is one of Hollywood's best known directors with films such as  Frost/Nixon  and  A Beautiful Mind  to his credit. Lucasfilm's president, Kathleen Kennedy, announced on Wednesday that filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, best known for the 2014 hit  The Lego Movie,  had left the project due to creative differences.  Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are talented filmmakers who have assembled an incredible cast and crew, but it’s become clear that we had different creative visions on this film, and we’ve decided to part ways,  Kennedy said in a statement on StarWars.com. Kennedy announced Howard's hiring for the film on Thursday, saying in a statement,  At Lucasfilm, we believe the highest goal of each film is to delight, carrying forward the spirit of the saga that George Lucas began forty years ago.

The untitled Han Solo movie will follow the origin story of young Han Solo, the handsome, roguish space smuggler made famous by actor Harrison Ford. It started filming in February in London. Production is on a brief hiatus amid the directorial changes until Howard takes over on July 10, Lucasfilm said.  Rising star Alden Ehrenreich will play Han Solo, while Donald Glover will play Lando Calrissian, made famous in George Lucas' original  Star Wars  trilogy by actor Billy Dee Williams. Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Thandie Newton will also star in the film.  The spin-off is part of Walt Disney Co's expanding slate of  Star Wars  movies, which was rebooted by 2015's blockbuster hit,  Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

That included 147 new orders and commitments for the 737 MAX 10, plus 214 conversions to the MAX 10 from other models to support the launch of the new plane.  The MAX stole the show,  Ihssane Mounir, vice president of sales and marketing at Boeing's commercial aircraft division, told journalists.  This is probably one of our busiest air shows.  Asked if Airbus had lost momentum after years in which it often trounced Boeing at annual industry gatherings, sales chief John Leahy said the slowdown in orders had been expected.  Is this a slower show than previous years? Yes, it is. Are we conceding that Boeing sold a few more airplanes than we did? Yes,  he told a news conference. In a late flurry on Thursday morning, Airbus signed deals for almost 100 aircraft, with AirAsia and privately-owned Iranian carriers Zagros Airlines and Iran Airtour. Boeing topped up its tally by announcing a firm order for 125 737 MAX 8 airplanes with an undisclosed customer and another deal with lessor AerCap to convert 15 of its MAX 8 orders into the larger MAX 10. It also added a memorandum of understanding from Chinese domestic Ruili Airlines for 20 737 MAX 8 aircraft. Analyst Richard Aboulafia, of Virginia-based Teal Group, said commercial activity had been better than expected and was reminiscent of shows in 2009 and 2011, when the aircraft industry had bucked a retreating world economy.  This time we've got instability and uncertainty in many regions of the world, but airline traffic is strong, and as we've seen at this show, airlines want jets and the finance people are certainly happy to help.  Leahy said he had expected the new Boeing plane to make more of a splash.  We had expected they would have had a bigger launch on the 737 MAX 10, not quite as many conversions, more incremental orders.  While he did not expect the MAX 10 to be a viable competitor to the A321, Leahy said the Boeing plane's launch could result in price pressure.  They're clearly going to come after us on price.  The A321 is larger than any previous member of the 737 family, a gap that the MAX 10 is intended to close.

The yen garnered some safe-haven demand on initial weakness on Wall Street and softness in other major stock markets.      The Norwegian crown and the New Zealand dollar were the notable gainers in a quiet trading session after their countries' central banks showed confidence in their economic outlook.     The dollar had strengthened following the Federal Reserve's decision to raise U.S. interest rates last week and leave the door open for another increase by year-end despite a recent softening of inflation.     The bounce faded as doubts crept in as to whether the modest current economic expansion warrants further rate increases and while the Fed plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.      The market has not bought into the Fed's hawkish rhetoric,  said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.  The market is dubious about U.S. growth in the second half of the year. That's having a mild negative effect on the dollar.      The U.S. bond market has reflected traders' doubts as the yield curve on Wednesday flattened to levels not seen in nearly a decade.     The yield curve stabilized on Thursday in reaction to reports showing a continuingly tight labor market and home prices that appreciated in April more than what traders expected.     An index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies was 0.05 percent lower at 97.509. It reached an one-month high of 97.871 on Tuesday.     The euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1157, while the dollar was fractionally weaker at 111.35 yen.     The yen was 0.1 percent firmer against the euro at 124.22 yen, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 0.04 percent.     The Dow and S&P; 500 were modestly higher.     Among other currencies, the Norwegian crown rose after Norway's central bank lifted its rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018 and said a rate cut was no longer likely.         It was last up 0.55 percent at 8.4826 crowns per dollar and up 0.6 percent at 9.4670 crowns per euro.     Meanwhile, the kiwi rose 0.7 percent to $0.7267 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand rang several upbeat notes in its outlook for growth and impact of current exchange rates.  ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 11:25AM (1525 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last      U.S. Close  Pct Change  YTD Pct                                          Previous                Change                                          Session                  Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1159   $1.1166     -0.06%      +6.14%  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        111.3600  111.3700    -0.01%      -4.71%  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     124.26    124.36      -0.08%      +0.91%  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9721    0.9724      -0.03%      -4.49%  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.2667    1.2668      -0.01%      +2.68%  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3220    1.3332      -0.84%      -1.56%  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7545    0.7550      -0.07%      +4.57%  ar                                                               Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0848    1.0858      -0.09%      +1.22%  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8806    0.8812      -0.07%      +3.38%  NZ               NZD=        0.7267    0.7223      +0.61%      +4.70%  Dollar/Dollar                                                    Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.4875    8.5304      -0.50%      -1.73%  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.4710    9.5242      -0.56%      +4.24%  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.7339    8.7446      -0.19%      -4.10%  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     9.7472    9.7656      -0.19%      +1.75%                           (Additional reporting by Patrick Graham, Ritvik Carvalho in London; Editing by Alison Williams and Pritha Sarkar)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JJ3LE"},

Researchers asked 576 black youth in the U.S. with asthma whether they had been hassled, made to feel inferior or prevented from doing something because of their race, ethnicity, color or language in situations at school, in medical settings or at restaurants and stores. Roughly half of them reported experiencing some form of discrimination at some point in their lives.  When they had not experienced these forms of discrimination, the children and young adults were almost twice as likely to have well-controlled asthma than when they had, researchers report in the journal PLoS One.  “Discrimination is a form of stress, and thus, its effect on asthma may be all or mostly due to stress,” said study co-author Dr. Luisa Borrell, a public health and health policy researcher at the City University of New York.  “Racial or ethnic discrimination experiences could affect our response to medications by changing our airway tissues and mucous production,” Borrell said by email.  The link between symptom control and discrimination was even more pronounced for a subset of participants who had high levels of an immune-system signaling molecule known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in their blood. It is a protein that’s involved in inflammation and elevated in asthma patients who don’t respond well to standard medications.  Still, even among the participants with high TNF-alpha levels, the youth who didn’t experience discrimination were almost three times more likely to have well-controlled asthma symptoms than their peers who did experience racism.  To assess symptom control, researchers tested how participants responded to albuterol, an inhaled bronchodilator that is used as a rescue therapy to open inflamed airways when people have an asthma attack. People who have frequent attacks may also be prescribed corticosteroids to control their symptoms.  “In asthma that is well controlled, you would expect a low response to albuterol since the patient is not having a lot of symptoms and their airways are not inflamed,” said co-senior study author Dr. Neeta Thakur of the University of California, San Francisco. “But in people who are not prescribed control medications, or are under-dosed, you might see a higher response,” Thakur said in a statement.  When researchers did lung function tests before and after giving participants albuterol, they found people who experienced discrimination had a bigger response to albuterol than those who didn’t.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that discrimination directly worsens asthma symptoms.  Another limitation is the possibility that factors such as segregated neighborhoods, exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution, violence in the community or other social and economic disadvantages might at least partially explain the connection between discrimination and asthma symptoms found in the study, the authors note.  “Race, ethnicity and social class are important proxies for unmeasured factors that influence health outcomes,” said Dr. Avni Joshi of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota.  “A child who is in a poor housing situation, is more likely to come from a less educated family, which in turn are likely to be low income with incomplete or poor health coverage and access to care,” Joshi, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It is in these families that the stress levels are likely high due to insecurities for food, money and perceived or actual discrimination in all spheres of life.” Controlling stress, however, might help keep asthma symptoms in check, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui of Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore.  “The details of how stress leads to inflammation are not clear, but links between stress and inflammation have been shown repeatedly, and asthma is a disease characterized by inflammation in the lungs,” Matsui, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “We know that stress is broadly a risk factor for worse asthma, so stress management to reduce stress is appropriate.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sZAz8n PLoS One, online June 13, 2017.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that French citizens had been killed by Iraqi artillery and ground troops using location coordinates and other intelligence supplied by French special forces during the battle to drive the extremist group from the Iraqi city of Mosul. About 700 French nationals are fighting in Islamic State ranks in Iraq and Syria. French officials have in the past said their priority on the ground was to ensure they did not return to their homeland to carry out attacks.  We don't do specific targeting. It makes no sense,  Vice-admiral Laurent Isnard, who heads up the Special Forces Command (COS), told reporters in a rare exchange.  We're facing fighters. We're in tiny streets, districts and are attacking the medina. We're on the frontline and are dealing with people who we come across. How are you supposed to know who is in front of you beforehand? They don't stand exposed with their biography,  he said.  France, the first country to join U.S.-led air strikes in Iraq, carries out aerial operations against Islamic State from its bases in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. It also has dozens of special forces operating in the region, provides weapons to Iraqi Kurds and has deployed artillery to support Iraqi troops.  The objective is to take back streets, districts and houses,  he said. Isnard said French forces were sharing intelligence with Iraqis, but solely to assess  how the enemy was organized.  The  liberation  of Mosul from Islamic State will be announced in a few days, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Thursday.

Eighty-three percent also favor barring gun purchases by those on federal no-fly or watch lists, the survey found. But gun owners were far less supportive than non-owners of creating a federal database to track gun sales or to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The survey of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April, provided a snapshot of American views on guns and gun policies as the nation grapples with gun violence. On June 14, an Illinois man opened fire on Republican members of Congress with legally purchased guns during a baseball practice near Washington, wounding Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise.  A few hours later, a UPS driver opened fire with a handgun inside a United Parcel Service Inc delivery center in San Francisco, killing three co-workers before fatally shooting himself. Some advocates called for a renewed push for gun control measures, as the Republican-controlled Congress has sought to relax existing gun laws. The National Rifle Association has opposed expanded background checks and argued the government was already being notified when someone on a no-fly list attempts to buy a gun. Pew's survey respondents often diverged based on whether they were gun owners or non-owners, Republicans or Democrats and urban or rural residents.  Overall, 52 percent of Americans say gun laws should be stricter than they are today,  according to Washington-based Pew. Forty-four 44 percent of adults surveyed said they personally knew someone who was shot, accidentally or on purpose, and 83 percent believed gun violence was a very big or moderately big U.S. problem. As for violence in their local communities, 49 percent of black respondents said it was a very big problem, compared with 11 percent of whites.  A large majority said easy access to illegal guns contributed to gun violence, but just as many thought expanding gun ownership would boost crime as reduce it. Among all adults, 89 percent favored policies preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns, and 84 percent favored background checks in private sales and at gun shows.  Tracking gun sales was favored by 71 percent overall, banning assault weapons by 68 percent, and banning high-capacity magazines by 65 percent, with gun-owners showing less approval than non-owners.

The largest of the planned zones includes Idlib province, which neighbors Turkey, and adjoining districts of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia provinces.  The other three zones are in northern Homs province, the Eastern Ghouta region east of the capital Damascus and along the Jordanian border in southern Syria.

Trump,Mitch McConnell,Sheryl Skolnick,Susan Collins,USA,HEALTHCARE/ (UPDATE 5,PIX,TV),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A seven-year push by U.S. Republicans to dismantle Obamacare and kill the taxes it imposed on the wealthy reached a critical phase on Thursday when Senate Republican leaders unveiled a draft bill they aim to put to a vote, possibly as early as next week. With Democrats deeply opposed to Republican attempts to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, the route to passage was extremely narrow for President Donald Trump's party, with no assurances that moderates and conservatives will be able to bridge their differences. The draft bill proposes repealing a 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners retroactively to the start of 2017, not at some point in the future, as some analysts had speculated. The tax, affecting high-income Americans and imposed to help pay for Obamacare, has been a key target for Republicans. The legislation also curbs Obamacare's expanded Medicaid help for the poor and reshapes subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his lieutenants worked in secret for weeks on the bill, and he said debate on it would start next week. Republicans who control the House of Representatives approved a more conservative version last month. Hospital Stocks Surge U.S. hospital stocks traded sharply higher after the bill was released, adding to gains from earlier in the session. HCA Healthcare Inc rose 3.3 percent, while Tenet Healthcare Corp surged 7.4 percent. Health insurers also traded broadly higher, with large players Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc each up more than 1.5 percent. Insurers that specialize in Medicaid also gained, with Centene Corp up 2.2 percent and Molina Healthcare Inc rising 2.4 percent. The overall S&P; 500 healthcare sector was up 1.3 percent and hit an all-time high. Mizuho Securities' director of research, Sheryl Skolnick, said in a research note, “Hospital stocks are up on this news today. They should be, in our view, as the near-term risks would be abated if the subsidy and Medicaid provisions hold through Senate and House negotiations.” The subsidies enabling low-income people to buy private health insurance are expected to be linked to recipients' income in the Senate bill, a  major improvement  from a measure approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said. Some of the Senate bill's provisions could be political land mines, with individual senators' reactions crucial to determining whether or not the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, survives a Republican attack that has been underway since its passage in 2010. But even with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress since January, the Republicans have struggled to make good on their bold campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare. The law is credited with expanding health insurance to millions of Americans. Republicans say it costs too much and involves the federal government too much in healthcare.  Trump made Obamacare repeal a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more  generous  bill than the one approved by the House. He privately described that version as  mean,  according to congressional sources. Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican bill will make healthcare unaffordable for poorer Americans while cutting taxes for the wealthy. McConnell may have a tough job convincing enough Republican senators that the Senate bill improves on the House version. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month found nearly 60 percent of adults believed the House bill would make insurance costlier for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Only 13 percent said it would improve healthcare quality. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House bill would kick 23 million people off their healthcare plans. Healthcare is a top priority for voters, and many Republicans fear a legislative misstep could hurt them.

The Outlook is Negative. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that unreserved impaired loans are putting pressure on capitalisation and that internal capitalisation has weakened as Creval's operating performance has deteriorated. The Negative Outlook reflects execution risks around Creval's strategic plan in a weak operating environment. Creval's strategy aims to address the bank's key weaknesses in asset quality, through non-performing loan (NPL) reductions, cost efficiency and to recover an adequate and sustainable internal capital generation from its core activities. Although the bank's fully loaded CET1 and total capital ratios at 11.1% and 12.2% at end-1Q17 are above minimum regulatory requirements, Fitch views capitalisation as not commensurate with the risk arising from the bank's large stock of impaired loans. Unreserved impaired loans accounted for about 170% of its Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-1Q17. We expect capital to remain under pressure from high levels of unreserved impaired loans even after the bank's planned reduction in NPLs. We also see the risk that the capital management initiatives envisaged in Creval's strategic plan might not be sufficient to relieve pressure on capital levels if the bank achieves the planned impaired loan disposals (around gross EUR1.8 billion by end-2018) and at current market prices. Additionally, internal capital generation from core activities remains weak. Creval's operating profitability suffers from a less diversified business model that leaves the bank more vulnerable to interest rate and economic cycles. Creval's profitability is under pressure from the low interest rate environment and modest new lending. The need to reduce its large stock of impaired loans might leave it vulnerable to possible increases in provisioning to achieve the planned NPL sales. The bank's recent wholesale debt issuance has demonstrated that the cost for the bank to access the wholesale markets has increased, which might have an impact on its net interest income in the future if wholesale funding issuance attract more expensive rates. Asset quality is weak but has been stabilising in recent quarters, reflecting tighter credit standards and risk controls and an improved approach to address its large portfolio of impaired loans by more efficient workout and larger disposals than other medium sized banks in Italy. Creval has sold about EUR610 million impaired loans since end-2015, which together with a reduced inflow of new impaired loans and higher recoveries resulted in a reduction in the stock of impaired loans by almost 3% at end-1Q17. Nonetheless, impaired loans remain high at 26% of gross loans. The disposal of around EUR1.5 billion gross loans through a planned securitisation in 2H17 will reduce the ratio to close to 20%, which still remains above the domestic industry average. Net impaired loans will continue to represent well above 100% of FCC following the transaction. Creval targets an 18.4% gross problem loan ratio, including past due exposures, by end-2018. Fitch believes this could be achieved, but we see execution risk if the operating environment deteriorates further. Our assessment of funding and liquidity reflects our view that while these are generally stable, risk has heightened regarding access to funding, particularly from wholesale sources and in periods of market stress might be less certain for Creval than for stronger peers. Funding sources are currently adequately diversified. Creval's overall liquidity is underpinned by access to central bank facilities and commensurate with the bank's ratings, with liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratio above 100%. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect our view that following the introduction of Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the likelihood of Creval being supported, in case of need, by the Italian authorities has reduced substantially. We therefore no longer rely on the possibility of such support in our ratings. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Creval's subordinated debt is rated one notch below the bank's VR, comprising one notch for loss severity relative to senior unsecured creditors and zero notches for incremental non-performance risk relative to the VR. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The Negative Outlook reflects our view that the bank's VR, Long-Term IDR and debt ratings would be downgraded if capitalisation declines from current levels as a result of losses caused by sales of impaired loans if the bank fails to build up capital. The ratings would also be downgraded if the bank fails to achieve the planned reduction in impaired loans or if underlying profitability does not improve. Fitch could revise the Outlook to Stable if the bank makes progress in disposing impaired loans while maintaining adequate capitalisation, manifested in a steady reduction in unreserved impaired loans as a share of FCC. A Stable Outlook would also require a recovery in operating profitability to sustainable levels. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support Creval. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The rating of the notes is sensitive to a change in the bank's VR. The rating is also sensitive to a change in the notes' notching, which could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of their loss severity or their non-performance relative to the risk captured in the VR. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term IDR: downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB', removed from RWN; Outlook Negative Short-Term IDR: affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating: downgraded to 'bb-' from 'bb', removed from RWN Support Rating: affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor' EMTN Long-term rating: downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB', removed from RWN EMTN Short-Term Rating: affirmed at 'B' Subordinated notes: downgraded to 'B+' from 'BB-', removed from RWN Contact: Primary Analyst Gianluca Romeo Director +39 02 8790 87 201 Fitch Italia S.p.A.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Coury,MYLAN,MEETING/ (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Mylan NV shareholders re-elected the generic drugmaker's board at its annual meeting on Thursday, despite a shareholder campaign to vote down most of the directors in the wake of a scandal related to its high prices for emergency allergy treatment EpiPen. The company did not disclose the vote totals for the directors. More than two-thirds of the shares voted, as well as more than half of Mylan's outstanding shares, would have needed to be against the directors in order for them to lose. Shareholders voted against a measure to approve the company's executive compensation. The shareholder campaign against Mylan's board picked up steam after Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package was disclosed earlier this year. The annual meeting was held in Amsterdam, where the company has been headquartered since 2015. It was sparsely attended, with around the same number of attendees from the company as those in the audience. The only shareholder to speak was Quirijn Bongaerts of the Dutch small shareholders association VEB. He challenged Coury on executive pay, ethics, and the appointment of board members. The New York City and State pension funds and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, as well as influential proxy advisory firm ISS, had urged shareholders to vote against the directors to voice their dissatisfaction. ISS said earlier this month that shareholder value had eroded as the board mismanaged the situation around the company's life saving EpiPen treatment, whose sharp price increases spurred congressional, Justice Department and other government investigations into Medicaid overcharging. Mylan shares were up 36 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $38.63 in morning trading on the Nasdaq.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mylan-meeting-idUSL1N1JJ12I"},

A Qatari government official said some leave had been canceled in  essential government sectors  to keep staff on hand as authorities made plans to cope with the crisis, but did not mention travel restrictions or any focus on foreigners. Expatriate executives and engineers at Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] said the orders started a day after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed trade and transport links with Qatar this month accusing Doha of backing militants - a charge it dismisses.  I was told not to travel. My exit permit and holiday was canceled,  said a British expatriate at one of the state-owned group's subsidiaries.     A spokesman for Qatar Petroleum said that due to the sanctions on Qatar  a few selected critical employees may have been asked to postpone their leave for operational reasons at their discretion.  He said all expatriate and Qatari staff could still apply for leave by following standard procedures but did not mention exit permits. Doctors from the government-run Hamad hospital made similar reports and others said the orders had affected hundreds of people. There was no one immediately available to comment from the hospital's management. A work-sponsorship system widely enforced in the Gulf and known in Qatar as  kafala  requires foreign workers to get their employer's consent to change jobs or leave the country. Expatriates from Europe and America usually acquire multiple-exit permits from their employers allowing them to travel more freely than migrant laborers from India and Nepal who make up the bulk of the 2.7 million-strong population.

A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary. The affirmation of Imperial's ratings reflects Fitch's confidence regarding the continuation of its deleveraging, the resilient and strong cash-flow generation, and a renewed commitment to a prudent financial policy. These aspects offset the weak organic growth in the financial years to September 2016 and 2017 (FY16 and FY17), a modest drain on cash flow from a new phase of marketing and cost rationalisation investments and the adverse effect on net debt the pound's depreciation. The weakening of sterling against the dollar and the euro during 2016 has delayed the reduction in leverage that we expected when in March 2016 we changed our Outlook to Stable from Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS Temporary Profit Contraction: Imperial's revenues and profit have been reduced in organic terms in 1H17 by considerable price and marketing investments, largely aimed at defending its market share in its key markets. We believe these investments should deliver returns during the balance of FY17 and result in moderate profit growth in FY17, thanks also to currency translation benefits from the company's overseas operations. Thereafter we expect modest profit growth in the low single digits. The company's EBITDA margin (calculated against the company's economic net revenue of GBP8.0 billion) remains among the highest in the industry at 47% in FY16 (FY15: 46%). Operating Efficiency: The company intends to spend GBP750 million over the next four years to reduce complexity, drive operational efficiencies and secure additional global procurement benefits. This should help deliver additional savings of GBP300 million annually by 2020 on top of the previously announced GBP300 million savings that the company is targeting by FYE18 at a cost of GBP600 million. These resources will be deployed to further support the business. Deleveraging Path: We project that Imperial's lease adjusted net debt/funds from operations (FFO) should decline to approximately 3.7x in FY18 having fallen to 4.6x in FY16 from a peak of 5.1x in FY15. Compared to our expectations of March 2016 when we changed our Outlook to Stable, this deleveraging path is delayed by over one year due to adverse currency movements that affected Imperial's FY16 net debt position. The maintenance of a Stable Outlook is aided by FCF generation and from management's track record of prioritising debt repayment. Consistent Free Cash Flow: In FY16 Imperial's free cash flow (FCF) grew to a strong GBP980 million, representing a healthy 12.3% of economic revenues. We expect FCF to fall to approximately GBP800 million pa over FY17-FY18 as we assume a progressive increase in dividend distributions by 10%. Nevertheless, this remains very healthy FCF which supports continued deleveraging. Management Commitment: Net debt increased by GBP1.7 billion in FY16, mostly due to the adverse impact of sterling weakness. However, management's intention to continue to prioritise paying down debt, together with the announced capital discipline and management policy of cash allocation underlines the company's willingness to protect its credit metrics. US Turnaround: Imperial's strategy in the US centres around a relaunch of the Winston brand, which had suffered a long-term decline in volume before its acquisition by Imperial. Encouragingly in FY16, Winston's market share improved by 23bp, thanks to new packaging and advertising together with optimised retailer agreements. Part of Imperial's marketing investments during 1H17 were directed at repositioning Winston to a more affordable pricing point and should result in a further volume recovery. Manageable Regulatory Changes: The first notable implementations of plain packaging in Europe are taking place in 2017 in the UK and France. We believe that part of Imperial's pricing investments of 1H17 have been directed at maintaining an overall competitive profile in the UK market ahead of the introduction of plain packaging and addressing the likely reduction of pricing power that tends to result from restricted branding differentiation. This early reaction to the regulatory change should enable Imperial to defend its market share in the profitable UK market. Overall, Fitch continues to view the impact of regulatory restrictions on the tobacco industry, including the revised European Union Tobacco Product Directive (EUTPD), of smoking bans, cabinet display bans, graphic health warnings on consumption, and plain packaging, as broadly manageable. However, plain packaging could in the longer term lead to erosion of pricing power for the more premium brands and a reduction in the new generation smokers. In Europe, the strength of Imperial's portfolio in the lower priced segment helps it cope with this challenge. DERIVATION SUMMARY In comparison to its peers, Imperial Brands is mainly a European operator, although now with a larger US presence and with a strong presence in the medium- and low-priced segments. Its lower rating than its peers' - British American Tobacco (A-/RWN) and Philip Morris International (A/Negative Outlook) - reflects more limited geographic diversification and higher leverage. At the same time, Imperial's creditors benefit from a more conservative shareholder distribution policy, which gives Imperial the highest free cash-flow margin in the industry. Imperial's 'BBB' is at the same level as Reynolds American Inc, which has seen a spike in leverage from the 2015 merger with Lorillard but which only operates in the more protected environment of the large and oligopolistic US market. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth by +3% in FY17, aided by favourable FX of +1% onwards; - EBITDA margin gradually growing from 47% towards 50% over the forecasts horizon; - dividends per share increasing by 10% pa; - no further material M&A; - capex of GBP250 million pa; - tax rate of 20% for FY17; - average exchange rates: GBP/EUR 1.18 (FY16: 1.28); GBP/USD 1.25 (FY16: 1.42) RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - In light of the company's current stretched financial profile, we do not foresee any rating upside in the short term. However, future developments that could lead to positive rating action include: - the trading environment in Imperial's territories is not permanently challenged by widespread introduction of plain packaging legislation or by an accelerated substitution of traditional cigarettes by other products; - FFO net leverage below 3.0x and FFO fixed charge cover ratio above 5.0x; - EBITDA margin above 48% (FY16: 47%); - maintenance of current financial policy. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Another M&A; transaction or a change in shareholder distribution policies preventing FFO net leverage from returning to a sustainable level of around 3.5x (FY16: 4.6x) - FFO fixed charge cover ratio below 4.0x (FY16: 5.4x) - Annual FCF margin below 5% (FY16: 12.3%) on a sustained basis. LIQUIDITY Adequate liquidity: At FYE16, Imperial had GBP0.8 billion of unrestricted cash (as defined by Fitch) and undrawn committed facilities of GBP4.7 billion. The cash decreased in FY16 as a result of a major bond repayment; but liquidity is sufficient to meet short-term debt of GBP1.3 billion due in FY17. The majority of debt is composed of bonds issued by the wholly owned issuing vehicle Imperial Brands Finance PLC and guaranteed by Imperial Brands PLC and by the sub-holding and UK operating subsidiary Imperial Tobacco Ltd.

Gerlinde Pommer-Angloher filed a legal challenge to the constitutional court in January, seeking annulment of a law which allowed the state to seize the three-storey house in Braunau am Inn on Austria's border with Germany. The state took possession of the house under a compulsory purchase order after a parliament vote, saying it wanted to stop it becoming a shrine for neo-Nazis to visit. The fact that the house is still a meeting point for neo-Nazis more than 70 years after World War Two had nothing to do with its former owner, Pommer-Angloher's lawyer Gerhard Lebitsch said at court hearing on Thursday.  Mrs. Pommer-Angloher has always had an interest in a neutral use of the house,  Lebitsch said.  She thinks that nothing is achieved with the expropriation.  Instead, police, security services and the judiciary could do a better job to prevent it becoming a site for neo-Nazi tourism, he said. Austria's government says expropriation was the only way to end a long-running dispute with Pommer-Angloher. Retired without children, she has turned down previous offers by the state to convert or buy the house. Austrian Constitutional Court Chief Justice Gerhart Holzinger opens a hearing in Vienna, Austria, June 22, 2017.Heinz-Peter BaderHitler, who led Nazi Germany into a global war that cost more than 50 million peoples' lives, was born in the house in 1889.  Pommer-Angloher's grandparents bought the house in 1913 but were forced to sell it in 1938. After the war, her mother bought it back.

Hermann Feiner, an interior ministry representative, told the court that Austria had to live up to its historic responsibilities.  This is not just any property. It is here that the person was born who ... committed the greatest crime of human history,  Feiner said.  How Austria deals with it is not just an issue within Austria.  Austria plans to refurbish the house and convert it into a center for people with learning disabilities, in a bid to break its historic connection to Hitler's ideology.

History beckons for the team with a win at Ellis Park, where they have lost all four previous tests against the touring French but can now sweep a three-match series against their European opponents for the first time. A sense of optimism has returned to the team after a disastrous 2016 in which they lost eight of their 12 tests, including historic defeats to Ireland, Italy and Argentina. It is with that in mind that Springbok coach Allister Coetzee has again made minimal changes to his side, preferring continuity over the temptation to give a number of fringe players a run after two convincing wins so far.    Jesse Kriel returns at outside center after sitting out the 37-15 victory in the second test in Durban because of concussion, while Francois Hougaard and Jean-Luc du Preez come in as injury replacements for Ross Cronje and Opua Mohoje. Coetzee has handed a first start to prop Ruan Dreyer in the place of Frans Malherbe, his one attempt at tinkering. The Bok coach says he expects another physical battle, especially as the French have maintained their forward pack that at times gave the home side a battering in Durban.  This is their last match of the season and they will be highly motivated to finish on a high, so they will yet again pose a serious threat,  Coetzee said.  We will have to work extremely hard against a very physical French side who will again test us in all departments.  France coach Guy Noves has made just three changes to his backline, including a recall to the flyhalf position for Jules Plisson. Other changes see Brice Dulin come in for South African-born Scott Spedding at fullback and Nans Ducuing get a first test start ahead of Yoann Huget on the wing.  Three changes seemed right to us, we have had two tests to evaluate the players' mindset,  Noves said on Thursday.  We've got nothing to lose in the sense that what we have to do is defend the jersey. I felt there was a lot of progress from one test to the next. Admittedly the first game was so poor, that wasn't difficult.  The progress is real, I know it. Commitment is the minimum when we put on the jersey.

BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a speech on Tuesday it was not the right time to raise interest rates, while the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, separately said he expected to vote for a rate rise later this year. That split came barely a week after three members of the central bank's eight-strong rate-setting committee voted to hike record low interest rates, fuelling differing views among investors over when the Bank would make the first UK interest rate hike in a decade. Sterling weakened almost 1 percent after Carney's comments, but was bumped higher after Haldane spoke on Wednesday, recovering to as much as $1.2704.  It hovered between $1.2654 and $1.2688 for most of the day, last trading flat at $1.2666 by 1440 GMT. GBP=D3 Against the euro, it was 0.1 percent higher at 88.10 pence. EURGBP=D3 Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist with CIBC World Markets said sterling's bump higher on Haldane's speech looked overdone.  The market has become a little over-excited about the prospect of monetary tightening in the UK...Haldane's growth assumptions I think are too elevated and accordingly if those are revised lower he will not be too hawkish and sterling support will prove to diminish.  An English ten Pound note is seen in an illustration taken March 16, 2016.Phil Noble/Illustration/File PhotoStrategists at Nomura took a different view, saying they expected the BoE to undo its Brexit-induced rate cut at its next meeting on Aug. 3.  With the Bank growing increasingly intolerant of above-target inflation, it has begun to feel that weaker data would now be needed to prove the case for keeping policy on hold, rather than stronger data being required to justify higher rates,  they wrote in a note. Potentially adding to arguments for a rate hike from the BoE was a monthly survey which showed British factory orders hit their highest level in nearly 30 years in June. The same survey showed export order growth at its strongest in 22 years, helped by the fall in sterling's value that was triggered by Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union.  Outgoing MPC member Kristin Forbes, long an anti-inflation hawk on the BoE committee, is due to speak at London Business School later in the day. Investors were also following political developments, with Prime Minister Theresa May presenting to EU leaders her approach to giving guarantees to EU citizens over their rights in Britain. After a snap election eroded her Conservative Party's majority in parliament, May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to form a minority government. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said he was confident May would strike a deal with the DUP to gain support for her minority government, and DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a  very good  chance of a deal by next Thursday.  Sterling has had its Haldane-inspired lift, and probably has little further upside with the main focus on politics,  Kit Juckes, currency strategist with Societe Generale wrote in a note.

The syndication of the credit facilities was oversubscribed,  company President Ian Anderson said in the statement.  We are gratified by the outstanding level of support for this project within the financial community.  Energy infrastructure projects have faced opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities whose land they touch. Opposition to Trans Mountain is set to mount after the effective rise of an unfriendly government last month in Canada's British Columbia province that the pipeline passes. According to the company's statement, Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, has entered into agreements for C$4.0 billion in revolving credit, C$1 billion in contingent credit and C$500 million in revolving working capital. Kinder Morgan Canada did not specify the source of the credit, although it said the funds would come from a group of banks, some of which underwrote its public offering last month. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada were the main underwriters, according to Kinder Morgan's prospectus. A group of more than 20 indigenous and environmental organizations this month called on 28 major banks, including all underwriters, to back away from Trans Mountain. Ruth Breech, senior campaigner for Rainforest Action Network, one of the groups, said by phone the banks' backing of Trans Mountain was disappointing.   We'll be committed to challenging this project all the way through,  she said.  There'll absolutely be follow-up discussions with those banks.   Ratings agency DBRS Ltd on Friday placed Kinder Morgan Cochin ULC, the Canadian parent company's operating subsidiary, at BBB (high). The Trans Mountain expansion has  execution risks  including political and environmental opposition, the agency said.  In its rating assessment, DBRS has conservatively assumed a project delay of one year.  The expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, which is designed to carry crude from Canada's oil sands to the West Coast.  The expansion has obtained both federal and regulatory approvals and has passed an environmental assessment under British Columbia's incumbent Liberal Party, which lost its legislative majority in a May 9 election.  The opposition Greens and New Democrats parties, both of which oppose Trans Mountain's expansion, have sealed a deal to unseat the Liberals.

Shares of the Dublin-domiciled company, which also provides outsourcing services, were down 4.7 percent at $121.17 in morning trading. The stock earlier fell to its lowest level in nearly two months. Accenture, which gets 17.5 percent of its revenue from healthcare and public service clients, said its North American business was hurt by slower-than-expected spending by these customers due to uncertainty around U.S. healthcare legislation. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to replace Obamacare, and Republican leaders unveiled a draft healthcare bill on Thursday. Accenture said it now expects net revenue to rise 6 percent to 7 percent for the year ending August, compared with an earlier forecast for a 6 percent to 8 percent increase.  The lower revenue guidance highlights concerns that their legacy consulting business is deteriorating,  Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said, adding that the business was slowing at a faster rate than Accenture's shift to digital, cloud and security services. Accenture's revenue forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected net revenue for the third quarter ended May 31. Revenue rose 5.1 percent to $8.87 billion in the quarter, as the company benefited from investments to boost its digital and cloud services. Analysts on average had expected $8.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Accenture, like other IT services providers, has beefed up its security, cloud and analytics services to meet burgeoning demand from businesses for digital services. The company has invested heavily on acquisitions to boost these services, which now make up about half its total revenue. Accenture expects to spend about $1.8 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. Accenture also raised its forecast for full-year profit, citing a lower-than-anticipated impact from a strong dollar. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.84 to $5.91, compared with a prior forecast of $5.70 to $5.87. Net income attributable to Accenture fell to $669.5 million or $1.05 per share in the third quarter, from $897.2 million or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. The company took a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $510 million in the quarter related to the termination of its U.S. pension plan.

Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agricultural meteorologist working with Rural Clima in Uberlândia in Minas Gerais state, said a dry polar mass over most of Brazil will guarantee dry conditions for at least a week and possibly longer.  With that, we would have good conditions for harvesting coffee, cane, corn and cotton, among other products,  he said.  It is going to be a perfect weather for field work.  The Thomson Reuters Weather Dashboard shows basically zero cumulative precipitation through July 7 in the major cane belt around Ribeirão Preto in Sao Paulo state. The same forecast applies to the top coffee producing region of South Minas Gerais. Coffee farmers have made extensive use of machines to dry the beans before they can send new-crop lots to the market. Under drier weather their work should speed up. Brazil's center-south cane harvest was some 30 million tonnes behind last year's crop, according to the latest report from cane industry group Unica. The coffee harvest was also lagging last year's harvest and the average over the last five years. The same thing is happening with the harvesting of the second corn crop. The dry weather is expected to allow producers to make up much of those lags. Although some trading houses pointed to possible frost in the center-south region in the coming days, Rural Clima's dos Santos said he saw no such risk since temperatures are not expected to fall to the levels required for that to happen.

Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister chairing a summit of EU leaders in Brussels attended by British Prime Minister Theresa May, spoke of the revival of discussion in Britain since May lost her government majority on June 8.  We can hear different predictions, coming from different people, about the possible outcome of these negotiations: hard Brexit, soft Brexit or no deal,  he told reporters, referring to talks on Brexit that began in Brussels this week.  Some of my British friends have even asked me whether Brexit could be reversed, and whether I could imagine an outcome where the UK stays part of the EU. I told them that in fact the European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible to achieve,  he said, before turning to the late Beatle to clarify.  So, who knows?,  said Tusk, citing Lennon's  Imagine .  You may say I'm a dreamer, but I am not the only one.  Several other leaders at the summit took up the theme of the 1971 hit about an end to war and national divisions.  Yeah, we all have that dream. I hate Brexit from every angle,  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said of stopping a move Britons voted for last year.  But this is a sovereign decision by the British people and I can't argue with democracy.  His Belgian neighbour Charles Michel, who has long voiced concern that British ambivalence should not be allowed to derail much deeper European integration, was more cautious about even raising the prospect of Britain staying in the Union.  I am NOT a dreamer and I'm not the only one,  Michel told reporters as he arrived at the summit, reflecting the Brussels consensus that Britain is definitely leaving and that talk of a U-turn, which would need EU consent, is simply a waste of time.  It's time for action and certainty. Not for dreams and uncertainty,  the Belgian premier tweeted in response to Tusk. For the president of Lithuania, which has more than 100,000 citizens living in Britain, keeping close ties after Brexit is vital. But Dalia Grybauskaite also joined in the pop lyrics fun on Twitter by suggesting that even after Britain's  divorce , its European allies could still be counted on as friends. Quoting from a Motown classic in which a former lover tells an ex  If you need me call me , the ever-eloquent Lithuanian leader tweeted:  #Brexit: ain't no mountain high enough.

Shares of the Dublin-domiciled company, which also provides outsourcing services, were down 4.7 percent at $121.17 in morning trading. The stock earlier fell to its lowest level in nearly two months. Accenture, which gets 17.5 percent of its revenue from healthcare and public service clients, said its North American business was hurt by slower-than-expected spending by these customers due to uncertainty around U.S. healthcare legislation. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to replace Obamacare, and Republican leaders unveiled a draft healthcare bill on Thursday. Accenture said it now expects net revenue to rise 6 percent to 7 percent for the year ending August, compared with an earlier forecast for a 6 percent to 8 percent increase.  The lower revenue guidance highlights concerns that their legacy consulting business is deteriorating,  Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said, adding that the business was slowing at a faster rate than Accenture's shift to digital, cloud and security services. Accenture's revenue forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected net revenue for the third quarter ended May 31. Revenue rose 5.1 percent to $8.87 billion in the quarter, as the company benefited from investments to boost its digital and cloud services. Analysts on average had expected $8.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Accenture, like other IT services providers, has beefed up its security, cloud and analytics services to meet burgeoning demand from businesses for digital services. The company has invested heavily on acquisitions to boost these services, which now make up about half its total revenue. Accenture expects to spend about $1.8 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. Accenture also raised its forecast for full-year profit, citing a lower-than-anticipated impact from a strong dollar. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.84 to $5.91, compared with a prior forecast of $5.70 to $5.87. Net income attributable to Accenture fell to $669.5 million or $1.05 per share in the third quarter, from $897.2 million or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. The company took a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $510 million in the quarter related to the termination of its U.S. pension plan.

In a quarterly report, the bank lowered its inflation outlook to 3.8 percent from 4.0 percent for 2017 and to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent for 2018.     But it reiterated that the next policy decisions still depend on incoming economic data, signaling it was unsure whether to slow monetary easing from the brisk 100 basis-point current pace of rate cuts.     Rate-future yield prices showed an increased likelihood that the central bank will lower the benchmark Selic rate by 100 basis points to 9.25 percent next month, although a majority of traders still bet on a slower 75-basis-point reduction.      Concerns that a mounting political crisis could delay the implementation of structural reforms have led the central bank to adopt a cautious stand.     Those concerns helped to keep the Brazilian real flat, while most other Latin American currencies strengthened on the back of rising prices of crude and other commodities.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.8 percent, supported by shares of iron ore miner Vale SA and state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA .     Shares of Cia Energética de Minas Gerais, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, led the gains after it kick-started the sale of its controlling stake in Light SA  to cut debt. Shares of Light, which are not part of the Bovespa index, soared more than 25 percent, its biggest daily gain in more than two decades.     Argentina's Merval stock index rose 1.8 percent, rebounding from its biggest daily loss in a year and a half following a decision by MSCI not to include the country in its emerging market index.

The S&P; healthcare index rose 1.08 percent to hit a record high as investors cheered the bill, which is aimed at curbing Medicaid funding and reshaping subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. United Health, Johnson and Johnson and Gilead rose between 1 percent and 3.6 percent, and were among the biggest boosts on the three major indexes. The Nasdaq biotechnology index rose 1.3 percent and is now up more than 9 percent for the week. A slight rebound in oil prices also relieved some pressure. U.S. crude was up 1.4 percent at $43.11 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was 1.65 percent higher at $45.56. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, skidding into bear market territory, despite OPEC-led efforts to stabilize the market.  Oil is at a price level where it tends to keep markets down,  said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

The Nasdaq Composite index was up 6.31 points, or 0.1 percent, at 6,240.26. Investors are also concerned that the drop in oil prices could affect inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, even as the central bank adopts a hawkish tone regarding future rate hikes.  Right now the bond market seems to be convinced that inflation is going to remain much lower than what the Fed thinks,  Frederick added. Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last increased by 3,000 to 241,000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market.

Restaurant Brands International Inc said it intends to switch to chicken raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine in the United States and Canada by the end of 2018. More specific details of the plan, released as part of the company's first sustainability report, were not immediately available. Human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23,000 Americans each year, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many infection-related deaths are going uncounted. Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Medical researchers have concerns that overuse of those drugs on farms may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. As You Sow, a non-profit shareholder advocacy group, withdrew a shareholder resolution calling for reduced antibiotic use in Restaurant Brands' meat supply following its commitment on chicken.  This is great news for modern medicine and for long-term shareholder value,  said Austin Wilson, Environmental Health Program Manager at As You Sow.

Oil edged up from November lows hit in the prior session, but prices remained under pressure from a supply glut that has persisted despite OPEC-led efforts to balance the market. U.S. crude rose 1.62 percent to $43.22 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.71, up 1.99 percent on the day.  It’s pretty low and you are looking for a bit of a breather but all the forces seem to be aligning against the price of oil, it is just a question of where does it settle out,  said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.  You go below $40 and you get a lot of people who are worried about things.  With the gains, the energy sector in Europe remained under pressure, down 0.4 percent, but well off earlier lows. The index is down about 2 percent on the week and is on track for its fifth straight weekly drop. Those declines weighed on European shares but the picture was reversed on Wall Street, with energy up 0.5 percent, among the best performing sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 35.07 points, or 0.16 percent, to 21,445.1, the S&P; 500 gained 3.46 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,439.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.15 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,238.10. Healthcare, up 1.5 percent was the best performing group on Wall Street as Senate Republicans unveiled a draft bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.01 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.20 percent. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year after the initial OPEC-led production cut. Oil's decline has hurt energy stocks and curbed investor expectations for higher inflation that would enable major central banks to pursue tighter monetary policies. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have led to a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds on Wednesday narrowed to 94.9 basis points, holding near its smallest since December 2007. The curve steepened slightly to 96.5 basis points on Thursday, suggesting the flattening of the yield curve this week was stalling. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator. It shows concern about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.1633 percent, from 2.155 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro down 0.07 percent to $1.1158.

The Section 232 investigation was announced by the Department of Congress on April 27 and follows hot on the heels of a similar probe into U.S. steel imports, the results of which are pending. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to give its full title, was last used in 2001 against imports of iron ore with a  no action necessary  outcome.  This time around, everyone's expecting a different result. The Trump administration has pledged to stem the rising metallic import tide and reverse the ebbing of the country's primary aluminum production capacity.  The United States was once one of the world's largest producers with 22 aluminum smelters. The number of operating plants is down to just five, although in truth a lot of them closed years ago due to hard economics rather than imports.  A Section 232 investigation allows for broad tariffs against any and all imports, an artillery barrage rather than the precision targeting of specific product anti-dumping penalties.  Which is why the North American aluminum industry is scrambling to direct U.S. President Donald Trump's trade guns in the right direction.  Towards China.  U.S. imports of primary aluminum - top 10 suppliers: tmsnrt.rs/2p55b28 U.S. imports of plate, sheet and strip - top 10 suppliers: tmsnrt.rs/2p8lD2x Don't Shoot Us - We're Your Friends! Because when it comes to primary aluminum metal, the greatest share of U.S. imports comes from over the border in Canada.  But, as everyone agrees, Canada is not the enemy here.   U.S. aluminum trade with Canada is strategically vital and supports many American jobs,  according to a letter to Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, from the cross-party Congressional Aluminum Caucus.  Indeed,  for over twenty years U.S. law governing the armed forces has defined the U.S. national technology and industrial base to include Canada,  adds Alf Barrios, chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which ships 75 percent of its Canadian smelters' output to its neighbor.  The two countries' aluminum industries have been intertwined since 1928, when U.S. producer Alcoa span off its international operations to a new Canadian company called Aluminum Ltd.  With hindsight, handing over the low-cost, hydropowered Canadian smelter network that now forms Rio Tinto Aluminum may not have been the most prescient of moves.  However, World War Two and the urgent demand for a metal critical to aircraft manufacture saw U.S. and Canadian aluminum supply chains integrated to the extent that the United States was producing war materials in Canada to supply to Britain. That level of coordination has continued ever since and  from WW2 Lancasters to 21st century Teslas, Canada's reliability has always met the test , according to the written testimony of Jean Simard, head of the Aluminum Association of Canada.  In other words, don't shoot us, we're your friends.  And while you're at it, don't shoot the Europeans either because they're your friends too.   The aluminum associations of U.S., Canada and Europe, can testify that there is no unfair competition between our three regions to the disadvantage of one of the industries we represent,  the trade bodies noted in a joint statement.  Europe doesn't supply primary aluminum to the United States but it does ship a lot of semi-manufactured products, around 17 percent of total plate, sheet and strip imports last year, for example.  The Enemy's Over There! If you're wondering about the identity of the second-largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the United States last year, by the way, don't expect much public enlightenment.  Russia is, perhaps not entirely surprisingly, keeping a very low profile in this Section 232 investigation.  But then this whole thing is not really about primary aluminum at all.  There have been some throwaway comments about the importance of high-purity metal for specific military applications but industry analysts HARBOR point out that existing U.S. output meets defense requirements three times over. ( Special Analysis: Is high-purity aluminum a national security concern for the U.S.? , April 27, 2017) The real target, as far as the North American and European aluminum sectors are concerned, is the amount of Chinese semi-manufactured product ( semis ) entering the supply chain. The United States doesn't import much Chinese aluminum metal because China doesn't export aluminum in that form, just 17,000 tonnes last year.  China's massive aluminum sector is highly vertically integrated to the point that over half of all smelter output is in the form of hot, molten metal which is then transferred to a products casting plant.  And China exports a lot of  semis , over 4 million tonnes in both 2015 and 2016.  U.S. imports of Chinese plate, sheet and strip last year represented around 38 percent of the total, according to figures from the International Trade Centre.  Some of these are essential for U.S. manufacturers. The Aluminum Association asks, for example, for a dispensation from any tariffs for Chinese aluminum powders and flakes.  Many of them have in the past been what the Canadian association terms  wrongly classified and misrepresented products . Aluminum traders call them  fake semis  and a mountain of them is once again sitting in Vietnam, having been rejected by North American users. Most of them are just what they purport to be. It's just that there is too much of the stuff.  Chinese imports, according to Marco Palmieri, head of the North American operations of aluminum products giant Novelis [NVLX.UL], have already  forced us to exit certain product lines .  The collective and unanimous bottom line is that, to quote the three aluminum associations,  the issue of Chinese excess capacity (is) the root cause of the challenges faced by the aluminum industries in North America and in Europe .  The Russians, by the way, agree, but they're not going to say so right now.  We Need to Talk but We Might Shoot First China, let us remember, has lifted its aluminum production from 2.8 million tonnes at the start of the century to 31.6 million tonnes in 2016. Last year's tally represented around 54 percent of the global total.  It's a remarkable grab of a global supply chain.  And one, industry executives outside China believe, that has been based on what Canada's Simard calls  a plethora of market distortions .  The previous Obama administration also agreed, which is why its parting trade shot was a complaint about China's alleged aluminum subsidies to the World Trade Organization. The WTO calls for bilateral talks. The aluminum associations are pushing Chinese overcapacity onto the agenda of the G20 countries for multi-party talks. Steel is already there.   Ultimately,  notes Heidi Brock, head of the U.S. Aluminum Association,  our view is that the best solution for the U.S. aluminum industry and the jobs it supports would be a negotiated agreement with China that results in measurable reductions in Chinese aluminum capacity and/or growth.  The pressure for China to engage with the rest of the world about its aluminum sector is becoming irresistible.  Talks will take time, though.   The Section 232 process is a fast one, requiring the secretary of commerce to report to the president within 270 days from the start of the investigation.  This secretary of commerce may not take that long.  And this administration looks minded to start shooting first and talk later.  Just as long as everyone's agreed on where the guns are aiming, right?  (This version of the story corrects name to Rio Tinto Aluminium from Rio Tinto Alcan in paragraph 14).

The syndication of the credit facilities was oversubscribed,  company President Ian Anderson said in the statement.  We are gratified by the outstanding level of support for this project within the financial community.  Energy infrastructure projects have faced opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities whose land they touch. Opposition to Trans Mountain is set to mount after the effective rise of an unfriendly government last month in Canada's British Columbia province that the pipeline passes. According to the company's statement, Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, has entered into agreements for C$4.0 billion in revolving credit, C$1 billion in contingent credit and C$500 million in revolving working capital. Kinder Morgan Canada did not specify the source of the credit, although it said the funds would come from a group of banks, some of which underwrote its public offering last month. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada were the main underwriters, according to Kinder Morgan's prospectus. A group of more than 20 indigenous and environmental organizations this month called on 28 major banks, including all underwriters, to back away from Trans Mountain. Ruth Breech, senior campaigner for Rainforest Action Network, one of the groups, said by phone the banks' backing of Trans Mountain was disappointing.   We'll be committed to challenging this project all the way through,  she said.  There'll absolutely be follow-up discussions with those banks.   Ratings agency DBRS Ltd on Friday placed Kinder Morgan Cochin ULC, the Canadian parent company's operating subsidiary, at BBB (high). The Trans Mountain expansion has  execution risks  including political and environmental opposition, the agency said.  In its rating assessment, DBRS has conservatively assumed a project delay of one year.  The expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, which is designed to carry crude from Canada's oil sands to the West Coast.  The expansion has obtained both federal and regulatory approvals and has passed an environmental assessment under British Columbia's incumbent Liberal Party, which lost its legislative majority in a May 9 election.  The opposition Greens and New Democrats parties, both of which oppose Trans Mountain's expansion, have sealed a deal to unseat the Liberals.

Turkey has backed Qatar after Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states cut all economic and diplomatic ties this month, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies. But Ankara, which has long tried to play the role of regional mediator, is also wary of upsetting its other allies, including Saudi Arabia. Turkey fast-tracked legislation on June 7 to allow more troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar that houses Turkish soldiers under an agreement signed in 2014. Five armored vehicles and 23 military personnel arrived in Doha on Thursday as part of the new deployment plans, Turkey's armed forces said in a statement, adding that the move was in the framework of legal measures regarding military training and cooperation between the two countries. Some 88 Turkish soldiers were already in Qatar, according to the Hurriyet newspaper.   After the deployment, a joint exercise by Turkish and Qatari forces was expected following the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday, Hurriyet said. The number of Turkish soldiers sent to the Gulf state could eventually reach 1,000, it said, adding that an air force contingent was also envisaged. The first Turkish ship carrying some 4,000 tonnes of dry food supplies, fruit and vegetables set off from a port in western Turkey's Izmir province at dawn on Thursday, state-run Anadolu news agency said. It cited the head of the logistics company delivering the supplies as saying it was expected to arrive in Doha in around 10 days.  Though Turkey has sent 105 cargo planes of supplies,  Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said on Wednesday that it was not sustainable to maintain aid supplies through an air lift. Regional Ties In supporting Qatar, Turkey was not trying to threaten anyone, Erdogan's spokesman said.  We don't want any sort of tension with any Gulf state. We would also not want any of them to be in a row with each other. This has been our approach to this crisis since the beginning,  Ibrahim Kalin told reporters on Thursday.  In other words, if two of your friends, two neighbors are disagreeing with each other and if there is something you can do about this, it is perfectly natural to go into action.     Sources from Erdogan's office said the president spoke by phone overnight with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and new crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, congratulating the latter on his promotion.  Agreement was reached on increasing efforts toward ending tension in the region related to Qatar,  the sources said in a statement regarding the phone calls on Thursday. Erdogan and King Salman agreed to hold face-to-face talks at the G20 meeting in Hamburg next month, the sources said. King Salman made his son next in line to the throne on Wednesday, handing the 31-year-old sweeping powers as the kingdom seeks a radical overhaul of its oil-dependent economy and faces mounting tensions with regional rival Iran.

The sale is the latest so-called initial coin offering (ICO), in which creators of digital currencies sell tokens to the public in order to finance their projects, in a similar way that companies raise money with an initial public offering, except there is no regulatory oversight. Civic, which calls the move a  token sale  rather than an ICO, is building an identity network which will connect companies and users and has created 1 billion tokens to achieve that goal. The token allows for secure and low-cost access to identity verification through the blockchain, a public online ledger of transactions that leapt to prominence as the technology underpinning the first digital currency, bitcoin.    We're selling tokens for ID verification,  Lingham said. The tokens are being sold for the equivalent of 10 U.S. cents, but they can only be purchased using digital currencies bitcoin and ethereum. Of the 1 billion tokens created by Civic, 33 percent were offered in the public sale, which is continuing until June 28. Another 33 percent will be given away to companies and users to accelerate network growth, and the remaining 33 percent will remain in the company's inventory and will be available for sale only after three years, according to Lingham.  For this sale, $33 million was the maximum amount that could be raised. Proceeds from the sale of the tokens will count as revenue for the company, Lingham said. Civic held a pre-sale several days ago, Lingham said, to ensure that the company was able to place all 330 million tokens. It was able to do that, but it decided to hold a public sale this week to allow smaller buyers to acquire up to 110 million of the 330 million total token allocation. If this week's token offering sells out, the pre-sale buyers would only get 66 percent of their initial allocation, Lingham said.  We want a big network of people behind what we're trying to do,  said Lingham.  This is probably the most widely distributed sale with the most number of people participating.  Lingham said Civic has more then 10,000 buyers, and as of late Wednesday, there were 28,678 people lining up to buy the token.  With Civic, no one person owns more than 1 percent of the tokens sold. That's built in the model,  he added. Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Bill Rigby","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-civic-blockchain-token-idUSKBN19D200"},

Several members of Congress have spoken about death threats since the June 14 attack in which Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was wounded along with a Capitol Police officer in his security detail, a Republican aide and a lobbyist. Funding for the Capitol Police, whose more than 2,100 officer are responsible for protecting Congress, is set at $422.5 million for the 2018 fiscal year, an increase of $29.2 million from 2017 in a bill unveiled by the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday. The increased funding includes $7.5 million for increased training, equipment and technology-related support, the appropriations panel said in a statement. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Fox News on Thursday he has received dozens of death threats and that security needed to be stepped up.  I’ve got stacks, mounds of written threats that people put their names to and send us emails. And, again, they don't get prosecuted. There’s got to be a way to better protect members of Congress,  Chaffetz said. On Wednesday, Republican Representative Jody Hice of Georgia, warning that members of Congress have a  bull's eye on our backs,  said he had introduced a bill to make it legal for senators and representatives to carry guns anywhere in the country, except the U.S. Capitol building. The gunman in last week's attack in Alexandria, Virginia, was killed in a gun battle with police.

The state of emergency, which would have expired at the end of June, has been extended by three months, cabinet statement showed, meaning it will now last at least until the end of September. Egypt faces an Islamic State insurgency in the restive Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013. The group has increasingly carried out attacks in the mainland against Coptic Christian civilians in recent months, killing around 100 Copts since December. Police killed seven people in connection with the violence against Christians on Thursday. Security forces found militants hiding in a desert training camp, the Interior Ministry said.

The former Portuguese colony, where corruption is endemic and most people live in poverty despite its vast oil wealth, has branded the charges as  a serious attack  that threatens relations between the two countries.  State-run media called the investigation  revenge by the former colonial master  and  neo-colonialism . An official at the Lisbon Criminal Court told Reuters Wednesday's decision by Judge Ana Cristina Carvalho was valid for all the formal suspects in the case, including Vicente. The dates for court hearings will be set at a later phase, he said. Vicente, who was once seen as a possible successor to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is accused of bribing a magistrate when he was chief executive of state oil company Sonangol.  Dos Santos plans to retire after 38 years in power after an Aug. 23 election. No one knows how wealthy he is but his daughter Isabel, who runs Sonangol and has business interests in Portugal, is worth $3.2 billion, according to Forbes. According to Portugal's state news agency Lusa, Vicente's Portuguese lawyer, Rui Patricio, contends that Vicente has not been notified of the accusations against him, so the judge's decision has no effect on him as he does not fit the status of   arguido , or a formal suspect. Patricio did not respond to calls and emails from Reuters, and court officials would not comment on his statement.  Arguido  is a status in the Portuguese legal system that means a suspect can be questioned in an investigation if he is presented with evidence held against him, while being granted a wider array of rights than, for instance, a witness. Prosecutors said in April Vicente had refused to come to Portugal to be questioned and Angolan authorities were not cooperating. But Vicente's lawyer denied his refusal to attend.  Former Portuguese prosecutor, Orlando Figueira, who was arrested in early 2016, will go on trial on charges of receiving a bribe of 760,000 euros ($850,000) to suspend an inquiry into Vicente's dealings in Portugal before he became vice president. Two of Vicente's legal and financial representatives, Paulo Blanco and Armindo Pires, both Portuguese, were also charged with corruption and money laundering for allegedly paying the bribe jointly with Vicente. According to local media, the investigation that was suspended in January 2012 focused on the origin of funds with which Vicente had bought a luxury apartment in Lisbon. Angola ranked 164th of 170 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions index last year.

The Canadian company, which was spun off from U.S. department-store pioneer Sears Holdings Corp in 2012, said it planned to close 59 of its 225 stores and cut 2,900 of its approximately 17,000 workers. Existing lenders have agreed to provide up to C$450 million ($340 million) in interim financing to help the company, controlled by billionaire hedge fund investor Eddie Lampert, and reinvent itself as an apparel company selling discounted designer labels and low-priced clothing. It will abandon areas long associated with the Sears brand, such as home appliances, tools, electronics and auto parts sold at its Sears department stores, home stores, discount outlets and Corbeil appliance and electronics chain. The news was not unexpected as Sears Canada, much like Sears Holdings, its fourth-largest shareholder, has struggled for years to regain business from shoppers who prefer stores that keep up with fast-changing fashion trends. The company flagged doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern last week and said it was exploring strategic options, including selling itself..  The continued liquidity pressures facing the company, as well as legacy components of its business, are preventing it from making further progress and from restructuring its legacy assets and businesses,  the company said in a statement. It named Bank of Montreal as its financial adviser and the law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP as its legal adviser. It said FTI Consulting would serve as restructuring consultant.

Der Spiegel reported on Thursday that his second wife, Maike Kohl-Richter, had tried to prevent Chancellor Angela Merkel, his one-time protege, from speaking at his memorial service and  instead proposed a vocal critic of her, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The young, liberal Orban was mentored by Kohl in the early years after the 1989 collapse of East European Communism, although as prime minister of Hungary he has steered an anti-EU, authoritarian course that many say is at odds with Kohl's legacy. Kohl-Richter has also clashed with his estranged son Walter, who said he was barred from visiting the couple's home to discuss funeral arrangements on Tuesday, a claim denied by his widow's lawyer. The Christian Democrat has been lauded as the statesman who seized the opportunity of collapsing Soviet power in Eastern Europe to win a prize few believed attainable: the reunification of East and West Germany. Next week he becomes the first person to be honored with a European memorial service for pushing for deeper European integration that led to the birth of the European Union and the common euro currency. Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sits next to his second wife Maike Kohl-Richter (L) at the former lower house of parliament Bundestag in Bonn August 27, 2012.Wolfgang RattayBut Kohl became increasingly isolated after leaving office in 1998, his legacy tarnished by a party financing scandal involving illegal anonymous donations. He remarried in 2008 after first wife Hannelore's 2001 suicide. Thirty-four years his junior, Kohl-Richter jealously guards his legacy, keeping reams of official papers in their marital home. Slideshow (2 Images)Kohl also grew estranged from former political allies. Merkel was never forgiven for finally plunging in the knife at the time of the funding scandal. Then the party's General Secretary, she effectively dispatched Kohl with an article in a prominent newspaper in which she said the party must  learn to fight without the old warhorse . Many questioned whether it was really an increasingly frail Kohl who was close to Orban, a nativist critic of Merkel's open-doors refugee policy, whom he received in his Oggersheim home last year when she was under fire for opening Germany's borders to Syrian refugees. Orban has campaigned to  stop Brussels , home to the EU's headquarters, which he has compared to Moscow. Russian troops occupied Hungary for more than 40 years. But he was fulsome in his praise for Kohl's life-work.  His visage is still before me, my dear friend Helmut's valedictory look, as he repeated: 'Europe, Europe',  Orban wrote in a condolence letter to his widow. Kohl-Richter has been talked out of her objections to Merkel. A government spokesman confirmed that Merkel would speak at the Strasbourg memorial service on July 1.

Ancora Advisors LLC, which said it owns 4 percent of Potbelly shares, outlined steps it wants the company to take to boost its share price, including franchising more of its restaurants. It said it should explore a sale if it does not go through with these proposed changes.   We would strongly urge it to immediately pursue a sale/ going-private transaction, as we do not believe the current strategy would be attractive for current or potential public/minority shareholders over any investable time frame,  Ancora said in the letter, which was sent to the board. Potbelly, a chain of sub and sandwich shops based in Chicago with a $276 million market capitalization, did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  The company's wood-paneled restaurants, fast service, and make-your-own-sub format from an array of fresh ingredients make it a popular place for the in-and-out lunch crowd. After shares doubled on its debut to nearly $31 in October 2013, the stock has steadily declined. Shares rose 3 percent on Thursday to $11.50. The company announced last month that Chief Executive and Chairman Aylwin Lewis will leave the company in August.  Ancora, an activist investor based in Cleveland, said that during the search for a new chief executive, the board should find a candidate with a significant amount of franchise experience.  Activist investors often call on restaurant chains to franchise more restaurants, rather than owning them outright, because it allows the company to accumulate more cash to give back to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. Ancora's chief criticism was that the company was opening too many new restaurants that are not franchised.  The investment fund said a heavier mix of franchised restaurants could more than double the company's stock price.   We firmly believe Potbelly should seek out shareholder representation for its board,  Ancora said in the letter, adding it may seek its own board presence at next year's annual meeting.

Shareholders in Metro overwhelmingly voted in February to back the plan to split the group's wholesale and hypermarket food business from Media-Saturn, Europe's biggest consumer electronics group, by the middle of the year. But Erich Kellerhals, the founder of Media-Saturn, as well as other shareholders, launched a legal challenge. Their objections threatened to prevent Metro from entering its planned split into the commercial registry, a necessary step for the break-up to go ahead. Gabriele Peters, presiding judge at the higher regional court in Duesseldorf, said on Thursday that most of the challenges should present no obstacle. However, she left it up to another judge to decide whether some motions, which seek to declare the documents laying out the plan invalid, could prevent an entry into the registry. It was unclear how long the decision would take, though Metro said the motions would not stop its demerger as they did not trigger a so-called commercial register blockage.  Metro Group is confident that, on this basis, it will be able to implement the demerger into two strong, successful and strategically focused companies as planned,  Metro said, adding it still expected the split at mid-year and the stock-market listing of the new Metro group in mid-July.

Turkey has backed Qatar after Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states cut all economic and diplomatic ties this month, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies. But Ankara, which has long tried to play the role of regional mediator, is also wary of upsetting its other allies, including Saudi Arabia. Turkey fast-tracked legislation on June 7 to allow more troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar that houses Turkish soldiers under an agreement signed in 2014. Five armored vehicles and 23 military personnel arrived in Doha on Thursday as part of the new deployment plans, Turkey's armed forces said in a statement, adding that the move was in the framework of legal measures regarding military training and cooperation between the two countries. Some 88 Turkish soldiers were already in Qatar, according to the Hurriyet newspaper.   After the deployment, a joint exercise by Turkish and Qatari forces was expected following the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday, Hurriyet said. The number of Turkish soldiers sent to the Gulf state could eventually reach 1,000, it said, adding that an air force contingent was also envisaged. The first Turkish ship carrying some 4,000 tonnes of dry food supplies, fruit and vegetables set off from a port in western Turkey's Izmir province at dawn on Thursday, state-run Anadolu news agency said. It cited the head of the logistics company delivering the supplies as saying it was expected to arrive in Doha in around 10 days.  Though Turkey has sent 105 cargo planes of supplies,  Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said on Wednesday that it was not sustainable to maintain aid supplies through an air lift. Regional Ties In supporting Qatar, Turkey was not trying to threaten anyone, Erdogan's spokesman said.  We don't want any sort of tension with any Gulf state. We would also not want any of them to be in a row with each other. This has been our approach to this crisis since the beginning,  Ibrahim Kalin told reporters on Thursday.  In other words, if two of your friends, two neighbors are disagreeing with each other and if there is something you can do about this, it is perfectly natural to go into action.     Sources from Erdogan's office said the president spoke by phone overnight with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and new crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, congratulating the latter on his promotion.  Agreement was reached on increasing efforts toward ending tension in the region related to Qatar,  the sources said in a statement regarding the phone calls on Thursday. Erdogan and King Salman agreed to hold face-to-face talks at the G20 meeting in Hamburg next month, the sources said. King Salman made his son next in line to the throne on Wednesday, handing the 31-year-old sweeping powers as the kingdom seeks a radical overhaul of its oil-dependent economy and faces mounting tensions with regional rival Iran.

Triggered by Wednesday's sharp fall in oil prices, a key gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations came close to 1.50 percent for the first time this year, well off its February peak of 1.80 percent. This raises further doubts about the ECB's ability to meet its inflation target of just below 2 percent, analysts said.  It's not good news for the ECB and it maybe reinforces expectations that (ECB President Mario) Draghi can't get inflation back on target, a problem in the U.S. as well at the moment,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  If inflation is not reviving, the ECB needs to keep a loose policy stance, which helps the periphery in particular.  Lower-rated southern European government bonds are seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's bond buying scheme. Italian debt outperformed the rest of the market, its 10-year debt dropping as much as 5 basis points to a fresh five-month low of 1.86 percent. As European trading came to a close, it was at 1.89 percent. The country's 30-year borrowing costs dropped below 3 percent for the first time since early January. The yield on Spain's 10-year government bonds fell as much as 4 bps to a five-month low at 1.33 percent, before edging back up to 1.36 percent. Italian government bonds have benefited after the possibility of a snap election faded and anti-establishment party 5-Star Movement, while riding high in national opinion polls, suffered a beating in local votes. In addition, 5-Star Movement has also relegated its pledge to hold a referendum on the euro - a key concern for the market - to  plan B . But many higher-rated euro zone government bond yields are not far off recent lows either. Germany's 10-year yield , the benchmark for the region, shed a couple of basis points on Thursday to trade at 0.24 percent, not far from a one-month low of 0.225 percent hit last week. French and Belgian 10-year borrowing costs are also close to their lowest levels of 2017.  Central bankers would have thought that after a year, weakness in oil would have been washed away but you can see in the market that market-based inflation expectations move closely with oil prices, for instance the five-year, five-year forward in Europe,  said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.

KEY RATING DRIVERS EIF's 'AAA' IDR reflects the following key rating drivers: The ratings are underpinned by the strong extraordinary support Fitch believes it would receive from its shareholders, which at end-December 2016 included the European Investment Bank (EIB; AAA/Stable; 59.9% of subscribed capital), the European Union (EU; AAA/Stable; 28.1%) as well as 31 large financial institutions based in the EU and in Turkey. Shareholders' capacity to support is assessed at 'aaa' by Fitch; this reflects the rating of EIB, which is EIF's key shareholder. Additionally, the agency views EIF shareholders' propensity to support EIF as strong. That assessment primarily reflects EIF's role in leveraging funds for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, as evidenced by its participation in the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) alongside EIB and the EU. At end-2016, EIF's shareholders had already subscribed 92% of the EUR1.5 billion capital increase they committed to in 2014, which we view as additional evidence of their willingness support the fund. Based on Fitch's Financial Guaranty criteria, EIF's intrinsic rating is assessed within the 'AA' rating category. In 2016, EIF's own-risk exposures - guarantees and private equity participations - grew at a faster pace than EIF's yearly targets under EFSI. Although Fitch expects EFSI to continue boosting EIF's own-risk exposures growth in 2017, we forecast their annual growth to stabilise at between 10% and 15% over the medium-term. EIF's ratings reflect the fund's robust capitalisation. EIF's own-risk drawn guarantees/own funds ratio worsened to 1.7x at end-2016 (end-2015: 1.3x), reflecting increased business volumes. Fitch expects this ratio to remain consistent with our 'AAA' median of 2.5x for a  high frequency/high severity  guarantee portfolio without currency risk, such as EIF's. Profitability was healthy in 2016, with a return on equity of 6.5%, compared with 5.5% in 2015. The increase was mainly driven by a strong rise in management fees from funds disbursed under EU/EIB mandates, reflecting increased business volumes. Fitch, however, expects lower profitability in the coming years, in line with continued low interest rates and higher staff costs due to increasing demand for EIF financing. Fitch assesses EIF's liquidity as average. At end-2016, the fund's liquid asset buffer was weaker than our 'BBB' median for Fitch-rated financial guarantors. However, EIF has no financial debt and a track record of very limited cash requirements for disbursements of calls on own-risk exposures. At end-2016, liquid assets (investment-grade securities and cash) covered risky assets by 3.4x; additionally 53% of treasury assets were rated within the 'AA'-'AAA' range. The credit quality of risks borne by EIF is strong and remains stable. The weighted average rating of EIF's own-risk guarantees portfolio was 'A-' at end-2016, stable since 2011. Despite the amount paid for called financial guarantees being higher in 2015 and 2016 than in previous years, they still account for only a small share of outstanding guarantees. The fair value of the private equity book was above its cost value at end-2016. In Fitch's views, EIF's risk management is consistent with the fund's 'AAA' rating. Despite the fundamentally risky nature of the fund's focus on SMEs, EIF keeps own-risk guarantees and private equity portfolios well-balanced and diversified and follows strict internal prudential rules. CRITERIA VARIATION ANALYSIS Fitch's analysis of EIF's shareholders' support capacity includes a variation from the agency's Supranational Rating Criteria. While coverage of net debt by callable capital is typically used when assessing the support rating of a multilateral development bank (MDB) whose shareholders have subscribed callable capital, Fitch based its assessment of EIF's support using the average rating of key shareholders. In Fitch's view, this criterion is more appropriate given the specific features of EIF, which is a supranational financial guarantor (SFG) and not a MDB. EIF's operations largely consist of financial guarantees; unlike MDBs, EIF does not need to raise debt to fund loans and its balance sheet is structurally debt-free. Hence, coverage of net debt by callable capital does not provide a meaningful measure of support. RATING SENSITIVITIES As EIF's rating is based on extraordinary support from shareholders, negative rating action on key shareholder EIB would lead to a negative rating action for EIF. A rating downgrade could also be triggered by severe deterioration in intrinsic credit quality, leading to a one notch downward revision of the intrinsic rating. This could result from pressure on liquidity and investment risks or from marked deterioration the fund's financial performance. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Callable capital would be provided by EIF's shareholders on a timely basis, if EIF requires it to meet its financial liabilities. - The strategic relationship between EIF and the EIB and EU remains strong. - No significant amount of debt will be issued by EIF in the medium term.

The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds  briefly flattened to 94.9 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007, as 30-year Treasury yields hit more than a seven-month low of 2.713 percent.      That trading pattern was unwound later in the session, however, as a recovery in U.S. crude prices from Wednesday's 10-month lows suggested greater inflationary pressures and pushed yields on long-dated bonds slightly higher.     U.S. 30-year U.S. Treasury yields have fallen in recent days on worries about slowing U.S. inflation. Data last week showed the so-called core Consumer Price Index (CPI) posted its smallest rise since May 2015.     In addition to the bounce in oil prices, analysts said traders were taking profits from the recent rally in 30-year bonds.     The uptick in 30-year debt yields also occurred as traders prepared for a 30-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) auction later on Thursday. Traders typically sell Treasuries ahead of auctions to make way for the new supply of government debt, pushing yields higher.      At least today the long-end rally is taking a pause,  said Stanley Sun, interest rate strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York.     U.S. 30-year Treasuries were last down 6/32 in price to yield 2.733 percent, from a yield of 2.724 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. three-year Treasuries were last up slightly in price to yield 1.492 percent, from a yield of 1.497 percent late on Wednesday.      Analysts said yields on short-dated Treasuries, which are most sensitive to Federal Reserve policy, were remaining stable to slightly-lower on skepticism that the U.S. central bank would be able to raise interest rates again this year.       The timing for the next rate hike is definitely getting pushed out,  said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.  The market's not pricing in aggressive rate hikes.      Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 3/32 in price to yield 2.165 percent, from a yield of 2.155 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. two-year notes were last roughly flat in price to yield 1.352 percent.

Brazilian Parsons, an IPC vice president who unveiled his election manifesto and is the fourth presidential candidate to succeed Philip Craven in the September election, said Russia still had work to do.    The Russian Federation and the Russian Paralympic Committee, they know the steps they have to take until September because in September we have a governing board meeting and in this meeting we can decide if we lift the suspension or not,  Parsons told reporters in London.  So, of course if we decide in September that they're not ready to come back as a full member it will be difficult for the Russian athletes to compete in Pyeongchang.   We don't want that to happen. We want the Russian athletes back but of course what happened in Sochi (in 2014), in the lead-up to Sochi, cannot be forgotten.  Last year the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report compiled by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren showed more than 1,000 Russian competitors across more than 30 sports were involved in an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over the course of five years.     The report provided exhaustive evidence of an elaborate doping scheme sponsored by Russia's Sports Ministry leading up to the Sochi Winter Olympics.     The IPC banned the Russian Paralympic Committee from participating in the 2016 Rio Games and Parsons said there would need to be substantial evidence provided in September.  We have to respect not only the rights of the Russian para-athletes but also the rights of all the other athletes in the world to compete on a level playing field,  he said Russia has rejected the accusations that doping took place with political support, but has pledged to reform its anti-doping structures and the World Anti-Doping Agency has noted progress.     The election for a new IPC president will take place at the IPC General Assembly on September 7-8.

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) (BAC.N) dominate the sector, using stock and bond issues, the sale of naming rights, and securitisations of future ticket and TV revenues to fund improvements in infrastructure.  With financial fair play rules curbing the sums deep-pocketed owners can spend, the banks are hoping to capitalize on clubs' need for new sources of financing.  We are building on a base in Europe, what we call greenfield. I want to get to 60 stadiums done, I'm on 40 now,  said Goldman Sachs' Greg Carey, one of the biggest names in U.S. sports finance, who now comes to Europe once a month. Goldman and BAML were among banks that lent Tottenham Hotspur, known as Spurs, 400 million pounds ($512.32 million) in May to help finance a new 61,500-seat stadium in London. The five-year loan is secured on the new stadium and related commercial and match day revenues.   Carey has orchestrated stadium deals worth more than $20 billion for the New York Yankees, San Francisco 49ers and other elite American teams and has arranged private transactions for Italian soccer clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan.  The banks do not disclose how much they make from sports financing but  the margins are very, very attractive  said Chris Wheeler, banking analyst at Atlantic Securities.   Yes, it's profitable. It's not a big people business, you don't need 500 traders to do it ... You need a small team. And there are only so many stadiums being built, so you don't need vast resources.  The margins charged reflect risks including the chance that future revenues might not stack up to pay off the debt taken on.  For Europe's big soccer clubs there is the annual prospect of a sharp fall in earnings if they fail to qualify for the Europe-wide Champion's League competition or are relegated to a lower division.  Early this century, English club Leeds United was relegated and had to sell players and its stadium after borrowing heavily to chase a Champions League place but missing out. Investors took heavy losses.  Construction projects can also be subject to cost overruns and delays, as with the rebuilding of London's Wembley Stadium. These risks can be offset by ensuring stadium projects can generate additional revenue from hosting concerts or other sporting events. Spurs plan to host two NFL games a year.     The Two Main Rivals BAML started its sports finance and advisory practice in 1992 and has helped bankroll stadia including a $1.2 billion 80,000 seat arena for the Dallas Cowboys that opened in 2009 and also the Yankees' stadium.  We decided there was a good business model here. We provide a full platform -- investment banking, capital raising, corporate banking,  said managing director Elliott McCabe.   The U.S. market is highly developed for financings in the sports sector. Our biggest focus growing up has been domestically in the U.S..  FILE PHOTO: Britain Football Soccer - Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal - Premier League - White Hart Lane - 30/4/17 General view as a Tottenham fan poses for a picture in the construction of the new stadium Reuters / Toby Melville Livepic/File Photo We have interest in Europe. There are many well-run clubs with strong ownership groups,  he added.  However, every situation is unique, it's not cookie-cutter.           The deals can require banks to put in a lot of their own money, one reason U.S. banks have an edge over European rivals with less available balance sheet to put to work. Goldman and BAML often write big cheques -- Goldman committed $850 million so construction could start on the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium.  How do we help the clubs become more competitive?  Carey said.  By building better facilities so they can put more money into the team, so they can be potentially better and play in the Champions League and make more money. So it's a virtuous cycle.   With their new stadium, Spurs aim to boost earnings like arch-rivals Arsenal have done since moving into the Emirates Stadium -- itself financed by borrowing against future ticket sales -- in 2006.  Arsenal's matchday revenues of 134 million euros in 2015/16 were more than double Spurs' 55 million euros, according to Deloitte analysis which shows Europe's top clubs made just 18 percent of revenues from matchday income in the 2015/16 season. That makes upping capacity or getting fans to spend more with better facilities a main lever for increasing cashflows.  TV and broadcasting rights, which are mostly collectively arranged, generated 39 percent of revenues, while 43 percent came from commercial income such as advertising and merchandising.  The Spurs deal and proposals by Dutch team Feyenoord include plans to regenerate the area around their stadiums. Similar promises of regeneration have seen U.S. city authorities put money into stadium projects in the last decade, often raised via a hotel tax. But the economic benefits are disputed.  Stanford economist Roger Noll is among those who say such  public/private partnerships have provided poor value because the additional revenue raised as a result of the development does not cover the funding provided. Museum of Sports Europe's love affair with soccer means it is seen as the main area of opportunity there. Big-name teams including Feyenoord, Italy's AS Roma and Fiorentina, Chelsea and Everton in England and Spanish team Barcelona all have plans for new or improved stadia seating up to 100,000 people.  The experience of the New England Patriots shows what an impact a new stadium can have.  Since the Boston-based NFL team moved into the Gillette Stadium in 2002, they have won five Superbowls and are now the sixth most valuable sports team in the world, with a franchise worth $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. Then at Citigroup, Carey made his name with an innovative  financing deal for the stadium that allowed owner Robert Kraft to raise $325 million at low interest rates by pledging future revenues from advertising, naming rights and other income.  The sports-mad 56-year-old from Long Island's office at Goldman is filled with memorabilia.  My office looks like a sports museum,  Carey said.

With per capita consumption at nearly 58 kilograms (128 lbs) per year, barbecue-loving Argentines are among the most carnivorous people in the world.  Despite the high consumption level, the number of heavy cattle - the type most demanded by international markets - sent to slaughter houses is relatively low.   I prefer small animals, not the big ones because their meat is harder,  said Rosa Dimonica, a customer at a butcher shop in the old-fashioned San Telmo Market in Buenos Aires.  That attitude is typical of Argentine consumers, who tend to prefer veal even though it can cost more, said Miguel Schiaritti, president of the Meat Industry and Commerce Chamber.  More than 65 percent of bulls sent to slaughter in Argentina are young and light. Cows graze in a flooded farm near Victoria, Argentina, June 16, 2017.Marcos Brindicci They are well-accepted by the internal market, but they have no chance of being exported,  said Victor Tonelli, an agricultural consultant.  The average weight of a slaughtered animal in Argentina in 2016 was 226 kg (498 lbs) per animal, compared with 280 kg (617 lbs) and 360 kg (794 lbs) in competitors Australia and the United States, respectively, Tonelli added. Slideshow (7 Images)Once a top five global beef exporter, Argentina is currently eleventh, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.  High financing costs and inflation in Latin America's No. 3 economy discourage the investment necessary to produce the steers demanded by the global market and prompt the early slaughter of cattle for local consumption, said Adrian Bifaretti, head of the Beef Promotion Institute.  A stronger-than-expected peso versus the U.S. dollar also discourages the production of meat for export, leading producers to avoid heavy cattle with little demand in the domestic market, Bifaretti said.   An animal's age is not the only factor affecting how tender its beef is, said Schiaritti, noting that the amount of time a carcass spends in a refrigerator before being shipped to market also has an impact.

The sale is the latest so-called initial coin offering (ICO), in which creators of digital currencies sell tokens to the public in order to finance their projects, in a similar way that companies raise money with an initial public offering, except there is no regulatory oversight. Civic, which calls the move a  token sale  rather than an ICO, is building an identity network which will connect companies and users and has created 1 billion tokens to achieve that goal. The token allows for secure and low-cost access to identity verification through the blockchain, a public online ledger of transactions that leapt to prominence as the technology underpinning the first digital currency, bitcoin.    We're selling tokens for ID verification,  Lingham said. The tokens are being sold for the equivalent of 10 U.S. cents, but they can only be purchased using digital currencies bitcoin and ethereum. Of the 1 billion tokens created by Civic, 33 percent were offered in the public sale, which is continuing until June 28. Another 33 percent will be given away to companies and users to accelerate network growth, and the remaining 33 percent will remain in the company's inventory and will be available for sale only after three years, according to Lingham.  For this sale, $33 million was the maximum amount that could be raised. Proceeds from the sale of the tokens will count as revenue for the company, Lingham said. Civic held a pre-sale several days ago, Lingham said, to ensure that the company was able to place all 330 million tokens. It was able to do that, but it decided to hold a public sale this week to allow smaller buyers to acquire up to 110 million of the 330 million total token allocation. If this week's token offering sells out, the pre-sale buyers would only get 66 percent of their initial allocation, Lingham said.  We want a big network of people behind what we're trying to do,  said Lingham.  This is probably the most widely distributed sale with the most number of people participating.  Lingham said Civic has more then 10,000 buyers, and as of late Wednesday, there were 28,678 people lining up to buy the token.  With Civic, no one person owns more than 1 percent of the tokens sold. That's built in the model,  he added. Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Bill Rigby","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/civic-blockchain-token-idUSL1N1JI1VD"},

As Wednesday marked the summer solstice - the longest day of the year - forecasters said temperatures in Paris were expected to hit 37 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit), Madrid could see 38C, and London was set for 34C with warnings of thunderstorms. Rounding up the record temperatures set in the past two months, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the Earth was experiencing  another exceptionally warm year  and the heatwaves were unusually early.  Parts of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the United States of America have seen extremely high May and June temperatures, with a number of records broken,  the WMO said late on Tuesday. The trend seen during the past two months has put average monthly global temperatures among the highest ever recorded since data began to be collated in 1880. Even before this month, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed Europe, the United States and Northeast Asia - including eastern China, Japan and South Korea - had experienced unusually warm weather between March and May. In China, the world’s top grain producer, hot and dry conditions in the main corn belt have delayed plantings and stunted crop development, especially in the province of Liaoning where soil moisture levels are at their lowest in at least five years. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that precipitation in Liaoning for the past month has been between 40 and 60 percent below the seasonal norm.  The drought that hit parts of China’s northeast is the worst for this time of the year in the past decade, in the breadth of areas it has affected and the length of time it has lasted,  Ma Wenfeng, analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultancy, said. The hot, dry weather is a major factor behind forest fires that have killed dozens of people in Portugal, while the Russian news agency Tass reported scores of forest fires, mostly in Siberia and the far east region of Irkutsk.

And in Britain, regional media in the southeast county of Surrey reported that the intense sun had melted tarmac roads. Solar power generation was expected to surge in Germany on Wednesday, with Eikon data showing a potential of 27,500 megawatt-hour (MWh) could be generated, compared with a seasonal norm of just 20,000 MWh.

A study published earlier this week found that nearly one in three of the world's people were already exposed to potentially deadly heatwaves and predicted that number would rise to nearly half by the end of the century unless governments take steps to aggressively reduce climate-changing emissions.  People are talking about the future when it comes to climate change, but what we found from this paper is that this is already happening … and this is obviously going to get a lot worse,  said Camilo Mora, geography professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the study published in the Nature Climate Change journal.

Ortiz will attend the ceremony on Thursday, one day before the Red Sox are scheduled to retire his No. 34 prior to their game against the Los Angeles Angels. Ortiz's number will be the 11th on the right field facade of Fenway Park, joining Bobby Doerr (No. 1), Joe Croin (No. 4), Johnny Pesky (No. 6); Carl Yastrzemski (No. 8); Ted Williams (No. 9); Jim Rice (No. 14); Wade Boggs (No. 26); Carlton Fisk (No. 27); Pedro Martinez (No. 45); and Jackie Robinson (No. 42), which is retired throughout Major League Baseball. A 10-time All-Star, Ortiz retired last season after spending 14 seasons of his 20-year major league career in Boston. He powered the Red Sox to three World Series championships, including their first in 86 years in 2004. Ortiz retired as Boston's all-time postseason leader in homers (17), doubles (19), extra-base hits (38), hits (80), runs (51), RBIs (57) and walks (59). Ortiz was named MVP of the 2004 AL Championship Series and the 2013 Fall Classic. Ortiz belted 483 career homers with the Red Sox, a total that trails only Williams (521) on the franchise's all-time list. He also ranks third with the club in RBIs (1,530), sixth in hits (2,079), third in doubles (524), third in extra-base hits (1,023) and fifth in runs scored (1,204).

While Carr did not divulge the terms of the deal, multiple outlets reported that it was a five-year, $125 million contract. Should that be the case, it would make the two-time Pro Bowl selection the highest-paid player in the league in terms of new money average. Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts receives $24.6 million per year, just ahead of fellow quarterbacks Carson Palmer ($24.35 million) of the Arizona Cardinals, Drew Brees (24.25 million) of the New Orleans Saints and Kirk Cousins ($23.9 million) of the Washington Redskins.  Now it's done,  Carr wrote on Twitter.  From the jump I've wanted to be a Raider 4 life. One step closer to that! Blessed!!! Business done! Let's just play now!!!  Carr had given the Raiders a training camp deadline for the deal or planned to shut down negotiations and play the final season of his existing four-year contract. Carr enjoyed a stellar season in 2016 before sustaining broken fibula in Week 16, which kept him sidelined for Oakland's playoff loss to the Houston Texans.

Antoine Bouvier, chief executive of missile maker MBDA, said failure to agree on a  new association  on defence could have significant negative implications for both sides, as well as the United States.  Without the UK, with its capabilities, technologies, industry and programmes, we the remaining 27 states will have more difficulties to achieve critical mass in terms of budget, in terms of industrial capabilities,  Bouvier told Reuters in an interview at the Paris Airshow.  So we will have to find a way to maintain the right access for the UK to the EU defence initiatives,  said Bouvier, whose company is owned by Airbus Group, Britain's BAE Systems Plc and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA. EU leaders are meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss defence, security and other issues, including Brexit. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this month urged EU governments to forge a tighter military alliance, given Britain's decision to leave the bloc and U.S. President Donald Trump's lukewarm stance on the Washington-led North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Although the EU has more than a dozen military missions abroad, the world's biggest trading bloc has never been able to match its economic might with broad defensive power, preferring to rely on NATO instead. Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the European Parliament and chair of the Sky & Space Intergroup, told Reuters she was open to Britain remaining engaged in defence and security matters, but only if it stopped blocking EU initiatives.  There can't be the cherrypicking that we've seen in the past,  she said.  The Britons have to make up their minds where they want to participate, and then they have to contribute.  France, Germany and Italy want ways to pay for common military missions abroad, to be able to use EU battlegroups for the first time and for industries to collaborate and develop weapons and helicopters that can be used by all EU armies.

Stock STAFFORD, England (Reuters) - Researchers at a British University have embarked on a decade-long experiment that will pump a forest full of carbon dioxide to measure how it copes with rising levels of the gas - a key driver of climate change.  The Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment at the University of Birmingham's Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR) will expose a fenced-off section of mature woodland - in Norbury Park in Staffordshire, West Midlands - to levels of CO2 that experts predict will be prevalent in 2050. Scientists aim to measure the forest's capacity to capture carbon released by fossil fuel burning, and answer questions about their capacity to absorb carbon pollution long-term.  (Forests) happily take a bit more CO2 because that's their main nutrient. But we don't know how much more and whether they can do that indefinitely , BIFoR co-director Michael Tausz told Reuters. The apparatus for the experiment consists a series of masts built into six 30-metre wide sections of woodland, reaching up about 25 meters into the forest canopy.  Concentrated CO2 is fed through pipes to the top of the masts where it is pumped into the foliage. Last year the U.N World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the global average of carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, reached 400 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere for the first time on record.  The forest here sees nearly 40 percent more CO2 than it sees normally, because that's what it will be globally in about 2050; a value of 550 parts per million, compared to 400 parts per million now,  Tausz said. With deforestation shrinking the carbon storage capacity of the world's forests, researchers hope that a greater understanding of their role in climate change mitigation could help policy makers make informed decisions.  We could get a clear idea of whether they can keep helping us into the future by sucking up more CO2,  said Tausz.

The foreign ministry statement also came a day after Pakistan said its forces had shot down an Iranian drone near its southwestern border with Iran.  Washington claims Islamabad provides safe havens for the Afghan Taliban and other militants fighting the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, something Pakistan strongly denies. U.S. officials told Reuters this week Washington was hardening its stance toward Pakistan, and a new policy on Afghanistan could see an increase in drone attacks..   Our position is that drone strikes are counter-productive and violate the sovereignty of Pakistan,  foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said on Thursday in response to the Reuters report.  The United States has been carrying out attacks against  militants on Pakistani territory for more than a decade. Islamabad has repeatedly condemned such strikes in public, but U.S. diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks in 2011 suggested the Pakistani military tacitly approved of the drone program. U.S. drone strikes have slowed to a trickle in the past 18 months.  Pakistan has received more than $33 billion in U.S. assistance since 2002, but some aid was withheld last year because of Washington's dissatisfaction with Islamabad's actions against militants. U.S. officials have said the Trump administration is also considering withholding some assistance.  Pakistan attaches importance to its relationship with the U.S.,  Zakaria said.  We firmly believe that continued close cooperation between our two countries is critical for promoting peace and security in the region and beyond.   On Wednesday, Pakistan said it shot down an unmanned Iranian drone flying over its southwestern Baluchistan province. The incident followed warnings by Tehran that it would strike against Islamist militants who hid in Pakistan and carried out cross-border attacks.     Ten Iranian border guards were killed by militants in April. Iran said Jaish al Adl, a Sunni Islamist militant group, had shot them from inside Pakistan.     The border area has long been plagued by both drug smuggling gangs and separatist militants.      Pakistan has already shared the information about striking down of this drone with the Iranian authorities indicating that the drone was struck down by our security forces as it was unmarked and there was no prior information about its flight,  the Pakistan foreign ministry said.  Editing by Andrew Roche","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-drones-idUSKBN19D1V8"},

Brian Ferguson's announcement on Tuesday that he will step down as CEO in October is the latest sign of tumult within Canada's oil sands industry, which has seen international oil majors dump $22.5 billion in assets this year alone. It follows Cenovus' unpopular, debt-fueled $13.3 billion purchase of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) oil sands and natural gas assets in March, which sparked a near 50 percent fall in Cenovus shares. Cenovus' aim to pay down debt to restore its once-pristine balance sheet now hinges on selling conventional oil and gas assets in a market with a shrinking pool of buyers as oil prices hit 10-month lows around $42 a barrel CLc1. [O/R]  Everybody knows they are selling and that they have a weak hand. (The divestitures) are not impossible and they have good assets, but it's challenging,  said John Stephenson, president of Stephenson & Co Capital Management. He said Cenovus needs to repair its balance sheet and find a credible CEO replacement to look attractive again. His fund has sold around 85 percent of its Cenovus holding since the ConocoPhillips deal. Drilling for oil and gas in western Canada is relatively expensive compared with other parts of the world, making these assets less appealing. Fierce opposition to new crude oil export pipelines like Kinder Morgan's (KML.TO) Trans Mountain expansion project and stricter environmental regulations than in the United States are also likely to  be of concern to potential buyers. Cenovus should be able to achieve at least the low end of its divestiture target, said Ryan Bushell, portfolio manager at Leon Frazer & Associates Inc, which is a shareholder. But doing so would depend on commodity prices and finding buyers with a positive long-term view on the oil market, he added. The pool of potential buyers is limited. Global majors like Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) have already cut back operations in Canada, and large domestic firms like Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) are digesting sizeable acquisitions. Small and medium-sized companies whose share prices have taken a battering from more than two years of depressed oil prices are likely to struggle to raise the equity to fund acquisitions, analysts said.  Many shareholders will be wanting management to be prudent and not issue equity at such depressed levels, which will naturally take buyers out of the bidding process,  said Jeremy McCrea, an analyst with Raymond James. Mid-sized conventional producers Painted Pony Energy Ltd (PONY.TO) and Cardinal Energy Ltd (CJ.TO) issued equity to fund acquisitions this year, and saw their share prices slump as a result. For Cenovus shareholders, who are sitting on about a C$10 billion paper loss, ConocoPhillips' impending sale of its 20 percent stake in the company is another factor to weigh on the stock on top of the current challenges. Ratings agencies DBRS is currently reviewing Cenovus' credit rating, spokesman Scott Anderson said. DBRS placed Cenovus, which it rates BBB, under review with negative implications after the ConocoPhillips deal and said a rating downgrade is likely depending on proceeds from asset sales.

Berkshire Hathaway will also take a 38.4 percent stake in the company after buying $400 million worth of Home Capital stock. Home Capital had sought new funding to replace a costly emergency credit line it received on April 26 from the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) after depositors rushed to withdraw funds from its high-interest savings accounts. Depositors have pulled 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high-interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Officer Martin Reid. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada's biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital last week reached a settlement with the commission and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about mortgage underwriting problems. The HOOPP funding came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, including a non-refundable commitment fee. The new credit agreement with Berkshire comes with an interest rate of 9 percent, with a standby fee on funds not drawn down of 1.75 percent, compared with 2.5 percent previously. It has no additional fees attached. Berkshire will buy C$400 million in new Home Capital shares, issued at C$9.55 per share, a 15 percent discount to the average share price prior to Berkshire Hathaway's final proposal on June 13 and a 33 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price. Home Capital Director Alan Hibben said the lender had interest from over 70 parties prior to the investment from Berkshire Hathaway.  We had over 70 people under NDA (non-disclosure agreement) within the data (room). They were not just Canadians, there were global players involved with that,  Hibben told analysts on a conference call.  Other proposals that we received were not as attractive to us with respect to the cost of the backstop,  he added. The stock rose as high as $18.94 before easing to $16.65, up 11.4 percent.

In her home country she had been forced to hide the fact that she was a lesbian from her family, her friends and, most importantly, from the authorities as same-sex relationships are illegal in Tunisia and punishable by three years imprisonment. When her disapproving brother found out she was gay she was forced to flee.   It's something prohibited, forbidden and unforgivable, and going back I can get attacked by my brother,  Afef told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at a meeting for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) asylum seekers in Dublin.  That's my past and it's not a good past. Here you have total freedom.  Afef, a slight woman aged in her mid 20s, is one of a rising number of LGBT people in Ireland seeking asylum due to fears of being persecuted for their sexuality in their home countries. Ireland made history in 2015 as the first country to legalize gay marriage by a popular vote, with 62 percent voting in a referendum in favor of gay marriage in the Irish Republic that was once dominated by the Catholic Church. Ireland this month formally elected its first openly gay prime minister, Leo Varadkar. But the asylum seekers find their bids to build new lives in Ireland keep hitting obstacles, getting bogged down in a slow, laborious system that has been criticized both domestically and internationally with proposed changes slow to take effect. Complex System Asylum seekers applying for refugee status in Ireland are provided with accommodation and food at hostels known as direct provision centers and given a weekly stipend of about 20 Euros  ($22) but they are cannot work or access further education. Afef, who did not want to use her full name for fear of reprisals, said this made it difficult to settle and become financially stable as the process could take years and the lack of transparency in the system was a massive frustration.  If they say within two years, you get your answer and finish the whole process it's fine. But some people can spend 10 years and some people can spend one. Basically you know nothing,  she said at a meeting of the Identity LGBT Refugee Support group at the Irish Refugee Council. Hailing from Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Gambia and Tunisia, all of the 35 regular members of the group are claiming asylum in Ireland based on their LGBT status. They only get together about once a month as many live outside Dublin and struggle with the cost to travel to meetings but they do stay in touch on social networks and WhatsApp. For while many of the group viewed Ireland as a safe haven,  being LGBT in the asylum system has its own difficulties as many face threats and intimidation from other asylum seekers in the centers, said Brian Collins from the Irish Refugee Council. Afef said one man in her center harassed her constantly.

Thomson Reuters Foundation / Cormac O'Brien That's why we created the group. Some of us know about lawyer stuff. Some of us know about housing. Some of us know about the communities around,  said another group member who requested anonymity.  We need that so we can support each other.  Lgbt and Stuck in the System There are no statistics on the number of LGBT people seeking asylum in Ireland but there are almost 5,000 in the system overall, housed in about 32 centers around Ireland, according to recent figures from the Reception and Integration Agency set up in 2001 to coordinate services to asylum seekers and refugees.  It's a system that has come under fire from human rights watchdogs in Ireland as well as internationally with reports of people languishing in a system for up to 15 years. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission described the system as a  severe violation of human rights  in 2015 because of the time it took to process applications. Slideshow (3 Images)While Amnesty International has urged Ireland to expedite reforms of its direct provision accommodation, a system set up as a temporary emergency measure in 2000, as this was regarded as unsuitable for long-stay residence, especially for families children and victims of torture.  With calls for change mounting, Ireland's International Protections Office has committed to speed up decisions for asylum seekers while the Irish Supreme Court in May 2017 ruled denying asylum seekers the right to work was unconstitutional. Activists welcomed the proposed changes around employment. But Katrin Hugendubel, advocacy director for the European unit of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), cautioned fast-tracking applications could end up hurting the most vulnerable groups of asylum seekers – including LGBT individuals.  If you look at the accelerated procedures, that leaves people with very little time to prove their sexual orientation,  she said because LGBT asylum seekers need to provide evidence to back up their claim of LGBT persecution to get asylum. New Freedoms, New Problems The Identity group, set up in 2016, is supported by an asylum seekers' theater group, Change of Address, and the Irish Refugee Council. Theater director and co-founder of Identity, Oonagh Murphy, said they used crowdfunding to bring a group of LGBT asylum seekers in Ireland to attend the Dublin Gay Pride March in 2015 and it grew from there into a support group.  You come to Ireland, a tiny island at the edge of Europe, the last thing you expect is to be put back into close living arrangements from that culture,  Murphy said. Maverick from Zimbabwe arrived in Ireland in May 2015 and is awaiting a decision on his asylum application.  I was a bit nervous before I met the LGBT group, but it's getting a little bit better now,  said the 27-year-old motor mechanic who faced jail if found to be gay in Zimbabwe.  Last year I really had fun. We danced on the street,  he said.  Of course back home, you get killed for that.

The Taiwan-based firm has been eyeing U.S. investments for some time and its CEO, Terry Gou, had previously said the company hoped to spend over $7 billion to set up a display-making plant in the country - which has no panel-making industry but is the No.2 market for televisions. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co,  is currently considering Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina as possible locations, Gou told reporters after the company's annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.  In July we will make a conclusion,  Gou said, adding the company would invest the money over five years. Foxconn operates vast factories in China, where it employs a million people and makes most of Apple's iPhones, but so far it has not invested heavily in manufacturing in the United States.  This time we go to America, it's not just to build a factory, but to move our entire supply chain there,  Gou told shareholders, without providing specific details.

The value of retail sales rose 0.8 percent, exceeding forecasts for a 0.2 percent gain and providing a firm start to the second quarter. Stripping out the effects of price changes, April's sales volumes were less robust, rising just 0.3 percent. Canada's economy is on track to grow at an annual rate of near 3 percent in the second quarter, said Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at TD Securities. The economy expanded at a 3.7 percent pace in the first three months of the year. The report increases the odds the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates at its next meeting in July, though Friday's inflation report will be key, particularly in regards to the central bank's measures of core inflation, Baumann said.  Further deceleration in core inflation is more likely to stay the bank's hand in July, while some stabilization or uptick, which cannot be excluded at this stage, will put further pressure on the Bank of Canada to act,  she said. Bank of Canada policymakers took a more hawkish turn last week, setting the stage for rate hikes. The central bank has held its policy rate at 0.50 percent since 2015 when it cut rates twice to offset the impact of cheaper oil, one of Canada's main exports. The Canadian dollar gained against the greenback and was trading at C$1.3253 or 74.45 U.S. cents after Thursday's report. Sales in the building material, garden equipment and supplies sector rose 3.5 percent, the biggest increase in nearly two years. Increased sales of home appliances and hardware have helped the sector rise for eight months in a row. Canada's housing market has been robust, with sales and starts rising in the first months of 2017, though activity has cooled in Toronto since the provincial government imposed in late April a foreign buyers tax in Canada's largest city and surrounding areas as part of an effort to rein in the market. Sales rose 2.1 percent at general merchandise stores, which include big-box and department stores. Sales at gasoline stations rose 1.7 percent, the seventh increase in nine months as Canadians paid higher prices at the pump. Vehicle and parts dealer sales fell 1.0 percent following a solid increase in March as consumers bought fewer new cars. Excluding the auto sector, retail sales rose 1.5 percent.

Bob Quinn, AT&T;'s (T.N) senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said in a C-SPAN interview this week that the telecommunications company was unclear what final conditions the Justice Department may seek as part of any approval.  That conversation is just beginning really,  Quinn said.  We've gotten through the point where we're produced all the data and answered all the questions and I think that process will kick off this summer.  In June, a Senate panel voted 19-1 to advance the nomination of Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim and it is not clear when they will vote. Until Delrahim is confirmed,  it is kind of hard to predict whether even the list that we see preliminarily will be the final list that they want to close on,  said Quinn, without elaborating. The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier still needs some foreign approvals. In March, it won the European Commission's nod for the deal.  Separately, a group of Senate Democrats on Wednesday, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, urged the Justice Department to closely scrutinize the deal.  We have strong concerns that the combined company's unmatched control of popular content and the distribution of that content will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and poorer quality services for Americans,  they wrote.   Before initiating the next big wave of media consolidation, you must consider how the $85 billion deal will impact Americans' wallets, as well as their access to a wide range of news and entertainment programing.

The 63.9-million share offering raised $1.9 billion after being priced at $30 per share, within the expected range of $27 to $31 per share. Shares touched a high of $32.17 in early trading. The company, which Netherlands-based Altice NV put together by acquiring Cablevision Systems and Suddenlink Communications, is only the second U.S. cable operator to go public in the last five years. WideOpenWest Inc raised about $310 million in its IPO last month, which was priced below the expected range. New York-based Altice USA's IPO comes at a time when U.S. cable companies are struggling with a downturn in pay-TV subscriptions due to cord-cutting, as consumers ditch traditional cable services to watch content online. A U.S. listing will allow Altice, the country's fourth largest cable provider, to keep expanding in the country by way of local acquisitions, and compete better with bigger rivals Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp. Altice USA's IPO is viewed as a means for founder, Franco-Israeli media mogul Patrick Drahi, to expand his burgeoning U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can then use as currency for new acquisitions. Following the IPO, 75.2 percent of the company's shares will be held by its parent, Altice NV, which translates to 98.5 percent of the voting power. Drahi fattened Altice NV into a telecoms and cable empire through debt-heavy acquisitions in Europe and Israel, and entered the U.S. market in 2015 by acquiring cable company Suddenlink for $9.1 billion. A few months later, it extended its reach to 20 U.S. states by snapping up Cablevision for $17.7 billion. Altice USA, which reported a net loss of $76.2 million for the three months ended March 31, expects to use proceeds from the offering to pay down debt of nearly $21 billion.

With the window for tax reform narrowing, lobbyists and analysts say Congress could abandon comprehensive tax reform for simple tax cuts to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, well above the 15 percent advocated by President Donald Trump. But House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, one of six principals involved in closed-door efforts to agree on legislation, told CNBC that such a measure would not meet the Republican goals of bolstering economic growth and enhancing U.S. business competitiveness overseas.    It's not acceptable to me. I don't think it's acceptable to the House or anyone else, for that matter. Look, that won't make us competitive,  Brady said.  Just doing low rates is a little like putting supercharged fuel in an old clunker of a tax car. There's no question it'll go faster. It can't keep up with the newer models on the road,  he added.  We've got to go after a competitive design.   Brady spoke as principals prepared to meet later on Thursday. Members of the group have vowed to make good this year on a top Republican campaign pledge to overhaul the U.S. tax system. But while the principals have met three times, the discussions have major issues to resolve.  How low we can get these rates; how do we stop businesses from continuing to leave the U.S.; and more importantly, how do we bring those supply chains back; how we deal with issues like full and unlimited expensing – those are still parts of this discussion,” Brady said.  Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing for changes outlined in the  A Better Way  agenda released a year ago, including a border adjustment tax that would tax imports but exempt export revenues from federal tax. The measure could raise more than $1 trillion in revenue to help pay for tax cuts and effectively resolve the problem of corporations shifting profits overseas. But it is opposed by some industries and unpopular with Republicans in the House and Senate who fear it would raise consumer prices.

We believe our current assumption that sharia compliance typically does not have credit implications for Fitch-rated sukuk remains appropriate. Resolving the relevant issues could be a complex and drawn-out process with uncertain implications and the potential for a market or regulatory response. Fitch does not rate Dana Gas or its sukuk. Dana Gas publicly stated on 13 June 2017 that it had  received legal advice that the sukuk in its present form is not sharia compliant and is therefore unlawful under UAE law  and that it had started court proceedings in the UAE to have the sukuk declared unlawful and unenforceable. It has proposed restructuring the sukuk  to ensure that it conforms to the relevant laws  and also to take into account  the Company's need to focus on short to medium term cash preservation . Sukuk distributions due on 31 July and 31 October  cannot be paid now that the existing sukuk is deemed unlawful but will be accounted for  as part of the restructured instrument, Dana Gas said. Sukuk regulations have been introduced and updated in several countries in recent years, but standardisation, harmonisation and legal precedents are limited in most jurisdictions. This case could set an important precedent for the relationship between sharia compliance and credit risk, and give greater clarity on enforceability and how court interpretations of commercial law might be influenced by sharia. However, this will depend on numerous factors. Debt restructurings in the UAE have generally been informal, out-of-court arrangements, partly due to creditor perceptions that local courts have a limited track record (Dana Gas has said that it is seeking a consensual restructuring). It is not clear whether or when the case might result in a conclusive binding legal judgement, and if this would have implications for all sukuk issues in multiple jurisdictions or only for mudaraba sukuk in a limited number of jurisdictions. An initial hearing is not due until 25 December, according to Dana Gas, and proceedings may be lengthy and multi-jurisdictional (the company said on Sunday, 18 June that it had been granted an injunction by the English High Court of Justice  against any hostile action  by sukuk holders, following injunctions in the British Virgin Islands and the UAE). Our sukuk ratings are based on our assessment of credit risk and do not imply any confirmation that the sukuk are sharia compliant. This is usually the responsibility of the sharia board of the lead manager/originator and to date questions of sharia compliance have not had credit implications for Fitch-rated sukuk. But while there is broad consensus among sharia scholars and market participants on the key tenets of sharia, there are differences of interpretation that Fitch would not be in a position to anticipate or assess. For this reason, if non-compliance had credit implications and such implications cannot be quantified under our criteria for rating sukuk, instruments may not be rateable. Our criteria state that our analysis and ratings  will reflect Fitch's view that the default of senior unsecured obligations would reflect default of the entity in accordance with Fitch's rating definitions . Sukuk are unrateable when contractual commitments do not fully cover timely full payment of principal and periodical distribution unless other mechanisms indemnify the sukuk holders in the case of non-payment. Fitch will continue to monitor the evolution of sukuk structures and legal developments. Where this leads us to modify our rating approach, we will communicate the reasons and the consequences to market participants.

The push comes amid growing legal uncertainty, in the United States and across the globe, about how technology firms must comply with government requests for foreign-held data. That has raised alarm that criminal and terrorism investigations are being hindered by outdated laws that make the current process for sharing information slow and burdensome. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel, announced the company's international framework during a speech in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that wields influence in the Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. He urged Congress to update a decades-old electronic communications law and follows similar efforts by Microsoft Corp . Both companies had previously objected in court to U.S. law enforcement efforts to use domestic search warrants for data held overseas because the practice could erode user privacy. But the technology industry and privacy advocates have also admitted the current rules for appropriate cross-border data requests are untenable. The Mountain View, California-based company called for allowing countries that commit to baseline privacy, human rights and due process principles to directly request data from U.S. providers without the need to consult the U.S. government as an intermediary. The measure is intended to be reciprocal. Countries that do not adhere to the standards, such as an oppressive regime, would not be eligible, but the framework could incentivize better respect for digital privacy among those nations, Walker said. Google did not detail specific baseline principles in its framework. 'Urgent Issues'  This couldn't be a more urgent set of issues,  Walker said in an interview before his speech, noting that recent acts of terrorism in Europe underscored the need to move quickly. Current agreements that allow law enforcement access to data stored overseas, known as mutual legal assistance treaties, involve a formal diplomatic request for data and require the host country to obtain a warrant on behalf of the requesting country. That can often take several months. In January, a divided federal appeals court refused to reconsider its decision from last year that said the U.S. government could not force Microsoft or other companies to hand over customer data stored abroad under a domestic warrant. The U.S. Justice Department has until midnight on Friday to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court. It did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. judges have ruled against Google in similar recent cases, however, elevating the potential for Supreme Court review. Companies, privacy advocates and judges themselves have urged Congress to address the problem rather than leave it to courts. U.S. lawmakers have worked on bipartisan legislation, known as the International Communications Privacy Act, in recent years that would modernize cross-border data requests, but it has failed to become law. Walker said on Thursday Google largely supported the legislation, calling it necessary to move forward with international agreements. Google also asked Congress to codify warrant requirements for data requests that involve content, such as the actual message found within an email. Chris Calabrese, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said Google's framework was  broadly correct  but urged caution about the process for letting countries make direct requests to providers.  We need to make sure the people in the club are the right people,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-google-cyber-idUSL1N1JJ0FW"},

U.S. First Secretary to the U.N. in Geneva Jason Mack said, after a resolution from Canada on eliminating violence against women was adopted by consensus, that the U.S.  must dissociate from the consensus  specifically on access to safe abortions.  We do not recognize abortion as a method of family planning, nor do we support abortion in our reproductive health assistance,  he said in a statement read to the Council. Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., gave formal notice this month that the Trump administration is reviewing its participation in the forum and called for reforms to eliminate what she called its  chronic anti-Israel bias . The Council said women and girls are at higher risk of sexual violence in wars and post-conflict situations and require access to health care, psychosocial support and legal aid.  It said all women should have access to  comprehensive sexual and health-care services  including modern contraception, prevention programs for adolescent pregnancy, and  safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law . Despite rejecting that call, the U.S. delegation said that the United States  strongly supports the spirit of this resolution and joins other members of this Council in condemning all acts of violence against women and girls .

Bob Quinn, AT&T;'s (T.N) senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said in a C-SPAN interview this week that the telecommunications company was unclear what final conditions the Justice Department may seek as part of any approval.  That conversation is just beginning really,  Quinn said.  We've gotten through the point where we're produced all the data and answered all the questions and I think that process will kick off this summer.  In June, a Senate panel voted 19-1 to advance the nomination of Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim and it is not clear when they will vote. Until Delrahim is confirmed,  it is kind of hard to predict whether even the list that we see preliminarily will be the final list that they want to close on,  said Quinn, without elaborating. The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier still needs some foreign approvals. In March, it won the European Commission's nod for the deal.  Separately, a group of Senate Democrats on Wednesday, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken, urged the Justice Department to closely scrutinize the deal.  We have strong concerns that the combined company's unmatched control of popular content and the distribution of that content will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and poorer quality services for Americans,  they wrote.   Before initiating the next big wave of media consolidation, you must consider how the $85 billion deal will impact Americans' wallets, as well as their access to a wide range of news and entertainment programing.  AT&T; said in a statement it had previously addressed all the issues in the letter and argued that the deal would offer consumers more choice, and  will expand distribution and creative opportunities for diverse and independent voices.

A Stavanger court earlier in June upheld an injunction on the technology's use, pending payment of a 20 million Norwegian crown ($2.35 million) security by privately owned NeoDrill. NeoDrill was unable to post the security due to its  very limited economic position . But it was open to finding a commercial solution with Statoil, Kyrre Tangen Andersen, a lawyer representing NeoDrill, told Reuters in an email. The decision meant there was no formal ban on Statoil using the technology. However, the company would risk being liable to NeoDrill in the main case before the Oslo District Court to be heard later this year, he added. Statoil, which has previously denied infringing NeoDrill's patent, was not immediately available for comment. NeoDrill has said Statoil's Cap-X drilling technology, unveiled last year, included  essential parts  of its Conductor Anchor Node (CAN) technology, to which Statoil had access as NeoDrill's minority stakeholder since 2010. Statoil plans to drill at least five exploration wells in the Barents Sea this summer, and its Cap-X technology was meant to cut costs and increasing drilling efficiency.

With the window for tax reform narrowing, lobbyists and analysts say Congress could abandon comprehensive tax reform for simple tax cuts to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, well above the 15 percent advocated by President Donald Trump. But House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, one of six principals involved in closed-door efforts to agree on legislation, told CNBC that such a measure would not meet the Republican goals of bolstering economic growth and enhancing U.S. business competitiveness overseas.    It's not acceptable to me. I don't think it's acceptable to the House or anyone else, for that matter. Look, that won't make us competitive,  Brady said.  Just doing low rates is a little like putting supercharged fuel in an old clunker of a tax car. There's no question it'll go faster. It can't keep up with the newer models on the road,  he added.  We've got to go after a competitive design.   Brady spoke as principals prepared to meet later on Thursday. Members of the group have vowed to make good this year on a top Republican campaign pledge to overhaul the U.S. tax system. But while the principals have met three times, the discussions have major issues to resolve.  How low we can get these rates; how do we stop businesses from continuing to leave the U.S.; and more importantly, how do we bring those supply chains back; how we deal with issues like full and unlimited expensing – those are still parts of this discussion,” Brady said.  Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing for changes outlined in the  A Better Way  agenda released a year ago, including a border adjustment tax that would tax imports but exempt export revenues from federal tax. The measure could raise more than $1 trillion in revenue to help pay for tax cuts and effectively resolve the problem of corporations shifting profits overseas. But it is opposed by some industries and unpopular with Republicans in the House and Senate who fear it would raise consumer prices.

As more consumers, notably the  Millennial  generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, Danone, along with rivals such as Nestle, have been seeking to adapt. Faber unveiled a new company  signature  dubbed  One Planet. One Health  for Danone on Thursday in Berlin at the annual meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum, a gathering of the world's biggest retailers and packaged food companies.   A revolution is cooking, what are we going to do about it?  Faber told the meeting, warning that consumers will turn their backs on big food companies if they do not do more to address issues like obesity, inequality and climate change.  We are losing them. They are getting out of our shops, out of our brands. They are going for food without the food industry. Not only without us, but maybe against us,  he said. Danone has bought U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave in a $12.5 billion deal, bringing the company more into line with healthier eating trends. The deal also aims to boost growth at Danone, whose shares trade at a discount to rivals. The company's depressed valuation was highlighted this week as a reason for it being touted as a potential bid target. Faber told Reuters that Danone, which has no large controlling shareholder, was  no more and no less than usual  vulnerable to a possible takeover bid. Danone is seeking to build on the WhiteWave deal with a campaign to promote itself as a leader in terms of healthy eating habits.   The global industrial food system is reaching its limits,  Faber told Reuters in a phone interview before his speech in Berlin. He said evidence of this included obesity and malnutrition, wasting water and food, soil depletion, and climate change.   Everywhere people want to regain control over their food,  said Faber, a rock climber and campaigner for corporate social responsibility. Buying Into the Future WhiteWave's products have outsold mainstream packaged food businesses in recent years, highlighting the consumer shift toward natural foods and healthier eating. The deal should also help Danone to cope with tougher market conditions in dairy products in Europe, and babyfood in China. WhiteWave makes Danone the world's biggest producer of organic food and gives it a stronger foothold in North America, which is becoming its biggest market, accounting for $6 billion, or around 25 percent of group sales against 13 percent previously.  Faber said he hoped the new Danone signature would help to address a general consumer mistrust of big, corporate brands.  Small brands communicate on their intentions, they are activists. It is key that big brands also state their intentions,  he said. Faber, the first Danone CEO from outside the founding Riboud family, is pushing on with a dual economic and social agenda, which - like that of many blue-chip companies - aims to not only boost shareholder value and profits but also meet other targets on the environment and social policies.  The big risk is to avoid transforming ourselves and end up only cutting costs to return cash to shareholders,  he said. A pledge at the annual shareholder meeting in April for Danone to be certified as a for-profit corporation that commits to positive social and environmental goals - was in line with that strategy, he said. Bid Talk Bid speculation around Danone pushed its shares sharply higher this week. Broker Exane said it could be an acquisition target for Kraft Heinz, also citing PepsiCo and Coca Cola as credible suitors. Analysts at Berenberg wrote in a research note that investors would need concrete evidence of Danone's progress in its new areas.  We believe investors will need to see further evidence of organic growth and margin momentum to agree with the CEO that Danone is 'uniquely placed to embrace the food revolution' and for its valuation discount to the sector to close fully.  Faber is confident Danone will deliver.  I am absolutely convinced our strategy creates value for the long-term but also the short-term,  he said, adding he expected sales growth to improve in the third quarter.

Britain's oil regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), said on Thursday that some 3.8 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of tight gas remain in the southern North Sea, one of the world's oldest offshore gas extraction areas that has produced more than 40 tcf. Drilling activity in Britain's North Sea has been at a record low for two years as weak oil prices make projects less attractive. The basin is estimated to have billions of barrels of oil left for extraction, worth around 200 billion pounds ($250 billion) for British government coffers, which the government is keen to see developed. The regulator on Thursday published an eight-step programme it wants oil companies to follow to tap the southern North Sea tight gas deposits, which were traditionally unpopular among explorers because they were difficult to access and therefore more expensive to develop. Tight gas deposits sit in less permeable stone, such as sandstone, and are part of the unconventional type of reservoirs like shale gas or coal bed methane. New technologies allowing extraction in less permeable geologies and efforts by explorers to share equipment mean tapping these resources is now more economic.  Maximising recovery of tight gas represents a real opportunity to extend the life of the southern North Sea's existing infrastructure,  said Eric Marston, the OGA's area manager for the southern North Sea. Companies exploring for gas in the southern North Sea are supportive of the regulator's push to develop tight gas projects and are making plans to drill new wells.  It's clear that there is still a lot the industry can do to maximise the potential of one of the most mature regions of the North Sea,  said Fraser Weir, North Sea director at Centrica , one of the companies active in the area. The energy company said it managed to reduce costs at one of its prospective gas fields, Pegasus, by 25 percent partly by finding ways to share some of the equipment with other companies. Centrica will later this year decide whether to proceed with the project. Oil explorer Premier Oil is also assessing whether to invest in developing a huge gas field in the area, Tolmount, which it said could contain up to 1 tcf of gas.

Calendar spreads for Brent futures throughout the rest of 2017 and 2018 have weakened significantly since OPEC agreed to roll over its production allocations at the end of May. Calendar spreads (price differences between futures contracts for delivery in different months) are closely linked to the expected level of oil inventories. Physical traders and refiners use spreads to hedge oil stored at tank farms and refineries as well as onboard ships in transit or acting as floating storage. But spreads can also be used by traders and specialist hedge funds to speculate on the level of global oil stocks in future. High and/or rising inventories are normally associated with a contango structure, where the price for oil delivered in future is higher than for immediate delivery. Low and/or declining global inventories are normally associated with a backwardation, where the price for future deliveries is below the spot price. The theoretical relationship between stocks and spreads was formulated by economist Holbrook Working in the 1930s in relation to U.S. grain futures. But the same relationship has been visible in oil, where the shift in Brent spreads between contango and backwardation has mirrored the build up and draw down in inventories since the 1990s. Brent spreads have therefore become one of the favorite ways for speculative traders to express a view on the outlook for oil production, consumption and stocks. Spreads for the remaining months of 2017 have moved into an increasingly wide contango since May 25 (tmsnrt.rs/2rZ7llh). Spreads for 2018 have seen an even more startling move from a small backwardation into a broad contango over the same period (tmsnrt.rs/2stXAzc). On May 24, the day before OPEC last meeting, Brent futures for December 2017 were trading at a premium of 99 cents per barrel over contracts for December 2018. By June 21, December 2017 futures were trading at a discount of $2.69, a shift in the spread of more than $3.50 per barrel in less than a month (tmsnrt.rs/2stKbak). Plentiful Stocks Calendar spreads are not an infallible guide to future stock levels especially beyond the next few months. Spread traders are often proved wrong.  But the emergence of a large contango implies many hedgers and speculators now expect stocks to remain higher than before. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, have pledged to do  whatever it takes  to bring OECD inventories down to the five-year average. But many analysts and traders are skeptical the current level of cuts will be enough to bring stocks down to the target this year or prevent them rising again next year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts global inventories will fall by an average of 0.2 million barrels per day in 2017 before increasing by an average of 0.1 million bpd in 2018. EIA forecasts OECD commercial stocks will still stand at 2,989 million barrels at the end of 2017, almost 230 million barrels higher than the year-end average for 2012-2016. The agency also predicts OECD stocks will rise to 3,020 million barrels at the end of 2018, which would be almost 260 million barrels over the 2012-2016 average. The forecasts assume OPEC's output agreement is extended beyond March 2018 but compliance deteriorates ( Short-Term Energy Outlook , EIA, June 2017). If these forecasts prove correct, OPEC will only have made limited progress towards its goal of rebalancing the market even by the end of 2018. Storage and Shale The recent drop in oil prices has been concentrated in near-term futures contracts. Brent for delivery in October 2017 has fallen by $9.50 since May 23, while Brent for delivery in December 2018 is down by only $5.50 per barrel. Sharp falls in the cost of crude for delivery in the near future provide an enhanced incentive to buy and store excess oil, helping the market carry a higher level of inventories than anticipated before. Near-term price declines also send a strong, urgent signal to U.S. shale producers to curb their drilling to avert an even bigger build up of inventories in future.

But the technology industry and privacy advocates have also admitted the current rules for appropriate cross-border data requests are untenable.     The Mountain View, California-based company called for allowing countries that commit to baseline privacy, human rights and due process principles to directly request data from U.S. providers without the need to consult the U.S. government as an intermediary.

U.S. crude traded up 0.45 percent at $42.71 per barrel. They closed down 1.6 percent on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Global benchmark Brent was 0.83 percent higher at $45.19. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, skidding into bear market territory, despite OPEC-led efforts to stabilize the market.  Oil is trying to balance, but I'm worried that it would continue to head lower,  said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K; Investment Management.  I think this a situation where OPEC is ceding market share and is no longer able to control prices.  The S&P; energy index, which has lost 14.9 percent this year, is the worst performing sector, largely underperforming the broader S&P; 500 index. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.32 points, or 0.03 percent, at 21,403.71, the S&P; 500 was down 1.63 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,433.98 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 3.89 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,230.06. Investors are concerned that the drop in oil prices could affect inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, even as the central bank adopts a hawkish tone regarding future rate hikes.  I've been more worried about deflation. I know (the Fed) wants to normalize, but I think it would be tough to get one more this year and three next year in the face of a flattening yield curve,  added Clark. A flattening yield curve is often interpreted as a negative economic indicator as it shows concerns about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. The yield spread between five-year Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds flattened to its narrowest level since December 2007. Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last increased by 3,000 to 241,000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market. The healthcare index was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors with a 0.43 percent rise. Among stocks, Accenture was off 4 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider trimmed its annual revenue forecast. Oracle's shares were up about 10 percent as the business software maker forecast an upbeat current-quarter profit, prompting brokerages to raise price targets. American Airlines was up 3 percent at $49.93 after the U.S. airline said Qatar Airways had expressed interest in buying a 10 percent stake. The news lifted shares of other major U.S. airlines such as Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest Airlines, which were up about 1 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,444 to 1,046. On the Nasdaq, 1,284 issues rose and 915 fell.

The fighting in and around the city of Beni between Congo's army and what is believed to be a new coalition of armed groups, the National Movement of Revolutionaries (MNR), killed at least eight militiamen and four soldiers, said activist Teddy Kataliko. The clashes, some of which occurred near the mayor's office, broke out early Thursday morning but the army had driven back the militias by mid-afternoon, he added. Gilbert Kambale, another local activist, told Reuters that at least 13 militiamen and three soldiers had died in Thursday's fighting. The mayor and a local army spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday afternoon.      The fighting followed a breakout by more than 900 inmates, many suspected militiamen, from Beni's main prison this month - one of a series of mass jailbreaks that have undermined security in Congo since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December. Worsening security in the vast central African nation has raised fears of a return to the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease, and sucked in more than half a dozen neighboring countries. Kataliko and Kambale also said unidentified assailants set off an explosive device at a local secondary school, wounding several students sitting exams. A hospital source said at least three students were injured in the blast.  Eastern Congo contains dozens of armed groups that prey on locals and exploit mineral reserves. Hundreds of civilians have died near Beni since October 2014 in a series of overnight massacres, mostly carried out with hatchets and machetes.

In a letter to the bank's lawyers made public on Thursday, five Democrats who have been seeking financial information about Trump argued U.S. federal laws protecting banking customers' confidentiality did not apply to requests from Congress. The bank could also circumvent privacy concerns by obtaining disclosure consent from the president and his family, they said.  Given President Trump's repeated assertions that he does not have ties to Russia, such disclosure would ostensibly be in his interest,  they wrote. Investigations are underway in Washington into claims of collusion between Trump's inner circle and Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign - which both the president and Moscow have denied. Public records show that Deutsche Bank loaned Trump millions of dollars for real-estate ventures. As well as details about those transactions, the lawmakers are seeking information about a Russian  mirror trading  scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines over the scheme, which could have been used to launder money out of Russia. No Power to Compel In the letter, dated Wednesday, Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, and four peers reiterated requests for information and gave Deutsche Bank until June 29 to respond. They first asked the bank in May to share what it might know about Trump's real-estate business and whether the president had financial backing from Russia. Deutsche Bank's Washington-based external counsel responded to that request earlier this month by saying it was barred from sharing information about Trump's finances.  We hope that you will understand Deutsche Bank's need to respect the boundaries that Congress and the courts have set in an effort to protect confidential information,  the bank's law firm, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, wrote. A disclosure document posted on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics website last week showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, suggesting the German bank is one of Trump's biggest lenders. They included one exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where Trump has opened a hotel. The Democrats do not have the power to compel Deutsche Bank to comply with their request. The Financial Services Committee has subpoena power but Republican committee members, who are in the majority, would have to cooperate. No Republicans signed any of the letters to Deutsche Bank. The Russian  mirror  trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in roubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for dollars for a related customer. Deutsche Bank has provided the Democrats with copies of settlements regarding the trades.

The U.S. index provider said on Wednesday it would add 222 China-listed large cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets. The decision was hailed as a major endorsement of China's reform agenda, but it also comes at a time of renewed concerns following a flurry of corporate scandals and a surge in public campaigns by activist investors alleging problems with fraud, financial engineering and market manipulation. Given that the Beijing government is also stepping up its interference in corporate affairs by insisting that Communist Party committees be established at state firms, some governance activists are questioning MSCI's decision.  Is this the right time for global investors to have to be exposed to China? It's hard to argue that the level of investor protection, regulatory consistency, and overall corporate governance in China is high enough,  said Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA). China ranks ninth out of 11 Asian economies for corporate governance, according to the ACGA. Its overall scores have declined since 2014. This stems largely from the authorities' heavy-handed intervention during the 2015 market crash, when the government put a cap on share sales and allowed more than 50 percent of companies to suspend their shares. The ACGA also highlighted slow progress on reform of state firms, poor audits and disclosure, and low levels of management accountability. “We continue to encounter managements of large A-share companies who have yet to appoint an investor relations officer and who see no reason for senior management to meet shareholders,  Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management, said in a note to clients and media.  Governance is often a challenge, as management may owe primary allegiance to municipal, provincial or national administrations,  said Greenberg, adding many of these issues should have been fixed by now. Government interference at listed companies has grown after Beijing began imposing Communist Party committees at state firms. These committees have the power to overrule the board of directors, marking a  step backwards  for China corporate governance, said Allen. Several such companies feature in MSCI's selection after the index compiler added a surprise 53 extra stocks to its original list, many of them  old economy  companies in the troubled financial and industrials sector such as China Construction Bank and PetroChina. Alpha Opportunities Benchmark providers take into consideration the quality of regulation and supervision when deciding how to classify a country, but they do not screen individual companies for corporate governance issues when adding them to global benchmarks.  These are purely quantitative indexes, where we take into consideration the size and liquidity of the stock, but not governance aspects,  Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, told reporters on Wednesday. To be sure, the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC), the country's markets regulator, has increased enforcement in the financial sector. The government is expected to update its 15-year-old corporate governance code this year. CSRC vice-chairman Fang Xinghai also seemed to confirm a widely-held view that inclusion should promote better governance over the long-term when he pledged on Wednesday to continue with reforms and ensure “good” companies come to the market. In the meantime, active investors that measure their performance against the EM index said the challenges of investing in China created ripe opportunities for those prepared to do their homework.  It works both ways. All the problems that people complain about, including a lack of transparency and corporate governance, all create investment opportunities,  said Qi Wang, a former MSCI executive director and currently chief executive for asset manager MegaTrust Investments.  Governance in Chinese companies is so varied, it creates alpha opportunities for those who can see through these issues.

Talks between Etisalat Nigeria and lenders to restructure the $1.2 billion loan agreed in 2013 have failed to produce a deal, forcing the banks to step in this month. Ibrahim Dikko, vice president for regulatory affairs, said the company currently owed lenders around $575 million and talks with lenders were ongoing. The total amount of debt outstanding were $227 million and 113 billion naira ($359 million), he told Reuters in a phone interview. The loan agreed with 13 local banks in 2013 was a seven-year facility to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of its network. Etisalat Nigeria missed payments in February after sharp falls in the value of the Nigerian naira bloated the loan value, making repayments difficult. Exotix Capital said in a note Etisalat Nigeria shareholders had refused to give further bailouts to the company to reduce pressure or convert its obligations to equity, and hence the telecom firm had missed its most recent repayment in May. Parent Etisalat, which is carrying its 45 percent stake in the Nigerian arm at nil value, said on Tuesday it had been ordered to transfer its shares to a loan trustee by June 23, after negotiations failed. The UAE group, which generates 3.7 percent of its revenue from Nigeria, had questioned the rationale of investing more in the local unit, when asked by lenders to recapitalise its affiliate as an option, sources said. Exotix said the company had struggled with several years of losses due to low revenue, tough competition and more recently currency losses, adding its second-biggest shareholder Abu Dhabi state investment fund Mubadala has been trying to divest its stake for some time. One telecom analyst said Etisalat Nigeria could struggle to find new investors, putting lenders in a weak negotiating position, although the company could be viable if acquired by one of its rivals. Another option could be to restructure the loan, pending any new investors coming along, Exotix said. Etisalat Nigeria has initiated changes to its shareholding structure. Renaissance Capital analyst said Etisalat could be worth $1.2 billion based on an enterprise value to operating cashflow multiple, compared with South Africa's MTN and other African peers. Etisalat Nigeria has 20 million subscribers, according to Nigeria's telecom regulator, making it the country's number four mobile operator with a 14 percent market share.

The fighting in and around the city of Beni between Congo's army and what is believed to be a new coalition of armed groups, the National Movement of Revolutionaries (MNR), killed at least eight militiamen and four soldiers, said activist Teddy Kataliko. The clashes, some of which occurred near the mayor's office, broke out early Thursday morning but the army had driven back the militias by mid-afternoon, he added. Gilbert Kambale, another local activist, told Reuters that at least 13 militiamen and three soldiers had died in Thursday's fighting. The mayor and a local army spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday afternoon.      The fighting followed a breakout by more than 900 inmates, many suspected militiamen, from Beni's main prison this month - one of a series of mass jailbreaks that have undermined security in Congo since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December. Worsening security in the vast central African nation has raised fears of a return to the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease, and sucked in more than half a dozen neighboring countries. Kataliko and Kambale also said unidentified assailants set off an explosive device at a local secondary school, wounding several students sitting exams. A hospital source said at least three students were injured in the blast.  Eastern Congo contains dozens of armed groups that prey on locals and exploit mineral reserves. Hundreds of civilians have died near Beni since October 2014 in a series of overnight massacres, mostly carried out with hatchets and machetes.

Canadian retail sales rose 0.8 percent in April from March to C$48.64 billion. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent.                   The solid run of Canadian data continues,  Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note.  There's nothing here to alter the Bank of Canada's now more hawkish path.       The Bank of Canada's top two officials said last week that looser monetary policies put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether interest rates must remain at near-record lows.                  Chances of a rate hike as early as next month rose to 38 percent from less than one-in-four before the retail sales report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed. Traders have already priced in a rate hike for 2017.                    Oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged up from multi-month lows, but prices remained under pressure from a supply glut that has persisted despite the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to balance the market.           U.S. crude        was up 0.49 percent at $42.74 a barrel.     At 9:14 a.m. EDT (1314 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was up 0.6 percent at C$1.3260 to the greenback, or 75.41 U.S. cents.     The currency traded between C$1.3247 and C$1.3338. On Wednesday, it touched a nine-day low of C$1.3348.     Home Capital Group Inc         , which nearly collapsed in April, said billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway would provide a new C$2 billion line of credit to its Home Trust Co unit.                  Bearish bets on the Canadian dollar had reached a record high in May as investors worried that the alternative lender's troubles could hurt the country's red-hot housing market.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across much of a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 5 Canadian cents to yield 0.939 percent and the 10-year             falling 4 Canadian cents to yield 1.495 percent.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.7 basis points to a spread of -40.4 basis points, its smallest since Feb. 24.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.  Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.      As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.  The  whatever it takes  pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.   You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,  said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant.  Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.   The oil price decline and Saudi's ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia's future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.  Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.  Waiting It Out  Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.  They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.  OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.   We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,  Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday.  But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,  he added.  An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.  OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.  Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.  Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.  Shale Returns at Full Force   Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.     The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country's total crude output.  Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.   A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,  said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.  OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.  Mistakes of the Past  Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.  Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.  Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC's other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even  the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at .  That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.   For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,  said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.  Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.  While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.

It estimates gross funding needs at 62.6 billion lei ($15.25 billion) and 60.4 billion lei in 2018 and 2019, respectively, down from this year's estimated 63.9 billion lei. The gross funding needs estimated for this year are slightly lower than the 67 billion lei envisioned in February. The paper was published one day after the ruling Social Democrats and their junior coalition partner ALDE toppled their own Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu in a no-confidence motion after barely six months in office. They will nominate a new prime minister on Monday, who, if endorsed by the country’s president will then need to form a cabinet and secure parliament’s approval in a vote, ending political gridlock in the European Union’s fastest-growing economy. The debt outlook was based on economic growth expectations of 5.5 percent next year and 5.7 percent in 2019. Analysts, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have all said this year’s 5.2 percent growth forecast is optimistic. They and ratings agencies, have also expressed concerns previously approved public sector wage hikes and a range of tax cuts will drive the budget deficit above the EU’s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product. The budget ran a small surplus at the end of April. Inflation returned to positive territory in January after a year of negative figures due to a value added tax cut, but was expected to stay within the central bank’s targets.  The evolution of fiscal and budgetary policy, a medium term rise of the budget deficit, the possibility of delaying structural reforms are among the domestic risk factors,  the debt strategy said.  So are market expectations of interest rate rises in the short term given the return to positive inflation.  The ministry also said Romania's hard currency funding buffer currently stood at 6.3 billion euros, giving it ample room to tackle volatility spikes. So far this year, Romania has sold roughly 23.52 billion lei and 240 million euros of domestic bills and bonds. It has tapped foreign markets for 1.75 billion euros.

India is home to more slaves than any other country in the world, yet a lack of crime data is hindering efforts to understand the organized networks that are buying, selling and exploiting women and children for personal profit. Activists hope the online record might be a game changer.  This is important as it comes at a time when the government is framing new legislation on human trafficking and there is a lot of conversation about tackling the crime,  said Ravi Kant, founder of anti-trafficking charity Shakti Vahini. Kant is partnering with Texas Christian University (TCU) to replicate the technology its academics and software engineers used to create a database of U.S. trafficking prosecutions.  As slave traders turn ever more to technology to further their business, Kant says it is time to play them at their own game and digitize data so it can be used to better effect.  After inputting details from court records into the database, we will for the first time be able to analyze everything from the profile of traffickers, their modus operandi and the types of trafficking, to the quality of police investigations and the quantum of sentences being handed down,  Kant told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. From the data, researchers will be able to identify trends nationwide, said Kant, such as identifying states with fewer prosecutions and making the case for increased funds and training for police, prosecutors and judges.  There are an estimated 46 million people enslaved worldwide, with more than 18 million of them living in India, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation.  Many are villagers lured by traffickers with the promise of a good job and money up front, only to find themselves or their children forced into work as domestic help, agricultural laborers or prostitutes. Almost 20,000 women and children were the victims of human trafficking in India in 2016, a rise of nearly 25 percent from the previous year, according to government data. Lawyer, Fighter That rise is not lost on Kant. A supreme court lawyer and human rights activist, Kant has spent about two decades fighting for the rights of women and children who have been trafficked and enslaved. Together with his two brothers, Kant works with police to locate and rescue the missing. Their charity also campaigns for strong anti-trafficking policies and laws. While there have been some wins and losses in their efforts to influence legislation, Kant says the one constant that has been desperately lacking all these years is data.  We know what the challenges are in tackling trafficking in India and we also know what the possible solutions are,  Kant said.  The problem is that no one is willing to listen if you don't have the numbers to back it up.  Named as a  Global Innovator  by TCU in March, Kant is now working with the university's political science department, which recently developed a database of more than 900 trafficking cases prosecuted in the U.S. federal courts. Kant and a team of researchers are now replicating this for India, scouring records from more than 600 district courts to find trafficking cases then logging all the data they find. By the end of the year, they hope to have details of about 4,000 cases dating back to 2000, which they will then use to identify trends and patterns.  We know it's a Herculean task, but it is possible. Most court records are digitized and are in English and we hope to work with law students to build the database,  he said.  We see how traffickers are increasingly using technology to lure, buy and sell victims, so we feel we also have to do the same and use technology to stop them.

They signed a development contract at the Paris Airshow on Thursday to develop a demonstrator engine, powered by liquid oxygen and methane. Airbus Safran said it would use new manufacturing techniques, including the use of 3D printers, to keep the engine's cost down to around 1 million euros ($1.1 million).  The commercial market - at least the European one - is asking for reliability, on-time delivery and cost, and we have to find the best way to answer these market expectations,  its CEO, Alain Charmeau, told Reuters. The firm, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran that will become ArianeGroup on July 1, currently powers the rockets it uses to launch satellites for commercial clients with Vulcain 2 engines costing around 10 million euros each. Prometheus, whose partners also include Italy's Avio, GKN from Sweden, and Safran AeroBooster from Belgium, demonstrated Europe's commitment to remain a major player in the global  race for access to space , Charmeau said. As one growth driver for the industry he identified the adoption of technology enabling driverless cars, which would boost demand for communications satellites - and hence for rockets to launch them - to relay uninterrupted signals.  We know it will happen. We see prototypes that are already working in Germany and California,  he said.  We know this will be a big market but when is difficult to predict.  In the near term, ArianeGroup would remain focused on rolling out the successor to its current Ariane 5 rocket.  We need, and will have Ariane 6 in 2020, but we also have to prepare for the future ...and that is why this (Prometheus) program is important,  he said. The jury was still out on the issue of reusability, however. California-based Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) earlier this year achieved what it called  a huge revolution in spaceflight  by reusing part of one of its Falcon 9 rocket on a subsequent launch. Charmeau said Prometheus would include work on reusability.  (But) the market is not asking for reusability... As long as we have a limited number of institutional launches it's difficult to bet on reusability.  If the market grew significantly, reusability could become a more important factor, but that was unlikely for 15 years, Charmeau said, adding that ArianeGroup was not competing directly with SpaceX. He said the group would have estimated sales of 3 billion euros in 2017 and expected flat revenues with a slight upward trend over the next few years, with stronger growth to kick in from 2020. Avio chief executive Giulio Ranzo told Reuters that reusable engines were not necessarily economically efficient given their need to be refurbished. To cut unit costs, Avio had started standardizing components for different launchers, a solution that was  as efficient as reusable engines .

The ruling concerned violence that occurred during a summit of the G8 group of industrialized nations in July 2001, at time when a wave of concern over economic globalization often prompted violent clashes on the fringes of such gatherings. The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, denounced what it called a  particularly serious and cruel  police raid on the protesters who were using the Diaz-Pertini school in Genoa as a base during the summit. It said many of those hit by police were sitting on the floor with their hands in the air. In a ruling prompted by legal action that 42 people present at the school filed, the rights court said:  The court considered that the violence perpetrated against the applicants had caused severe physical and psychological suffering and had been particularly serious and cruel.   It therefore held (ruled) that the treatment to which the applicants had been subjected in Diaz-Pertini School was to be regarded as torture  in violation of the European rights convention, a statement on the ruling said. Italy was order to pay damages of 45,000 euros per plaintiff and 55,000 euros in the case of two of the plaintiffs, on top of legal costs. Anti-riot officers  arrived at the scene running and in anti-riot gear, wearing helmets and carrying shields and truncheons , the statement on the ruling said.  They had entered the school premises using an armored vehicle to force their way through the entrance gate. Once inside, the officers had made indiscriminate, systematic and disproportionate use of force,  it said.  The incident happened in the middle of the night on July 21, 2001, during a summit where, in a totally separate incident, a protester was killed in skirmishes with police in the ancient port city in northwest Italy.

They signed a development contract at the Paris Airshow on Thursday to develop a demonstrator engine, powered by liquid oxygen and methane. Airbus Safran said it would use new manufacturing techniques, including the use of 3D printers, to keep the engine's cost down to around 1 million euros ($1.1 million).  The commercial market - at least the European one - is asking for reliability, on-time delivery and cost, and we have to find the best way to answer these market expectations,  its CEO, Alain Charmeau, told Reuters. The firm, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran that will become ArianeGroup on July 1, currently powers the rockets it uses to launch satellites for commercial clients with Vulcain 2 engines costing around 10 million euros each. Prometheus, whose partners also include Italy's Avio, GKN from Sweden, and Safran AeroBooster from Belgium, demonstrated Europe's commitment to remain a major player in the global  race for access to space , Charmeau said. As one growth driver for the industry he identified the adoption of technology enabling driverless cars, which would boost demand for communications satellites - and hence for rockets to launch them - to relay uninterrupted signals.  We know it will happen. We see prototypes that are already working in Germany and California,  he said.  We know this will be a big market but when is difficult to predict.  In the near term, ArianeGroup would remain focused on rolling out the successor to its current Ariane 5 rocket.  We need, and will have Ariane 6 in 2020, but we also have to prepare for the future ...and that is why this (Prometheus) program is important,  he said. The jury was still out on the issue of reusability, however. California-based Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) earlier this year achieved what it called  a huge revolution in spaceflight  by reusing part of one of its Falcon 9 rocket on a subsequent launch. Charmeau said Prometheus would include work on reusability.  (But) the market is not asking for reusability... As long as we have a limited number of institutional launches it's difficult to bet on reusability.  If the market grew significantly, reusability could become a more important factor, but that was unlikely for 15 years, Charmeau said, adding that ArianeGroup was not competing directly with SpaceX. He said the group would have estimated sales of 3 billion euros in 2017 and expected flat revenues with a slight upward trend over the next few years, with stronger growth to kick in from 2020. Avio chief executive Giulio Ranzo told Reuters that reusable engines were not necessarily economically efficient given their need to be refurbished. To cut unit costs, Avio had started standardizing components for different launchers, a solution that was  as efficient as reusable engines .

Oil producers around the world have faced highly volatile oil markets and declining prices due to a supply glut.  Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, told the company's annual general meeting that global markets were undergoing  tectonic shifts  shown by tougher competition, regulatory changes and higher risks for oil producers. He said Rosneft, in which BP owns around 20 percent, was working on a new strategy to tackle those issues.  The basis for this strategy should be high-quality changes in the company's business, thanks to a technological          breakthrough,  he said adding the strategy should be ready by the year-end. He also said part of the strategy, called Rosneft-2022, would be a shift to a holding structure in Rosneft's management, and would aim to unbundle the retail business and increase petrochemicals' share of the company's total refining capacity to 20 percent. Within this strategy, Rosneft plans organic oil production growth of 20-30 million tonnes in the next five years thanks to new technologies. Last year, Rosneft produced 210 million tonnes of oil (4.2 million barrels per day). Sechin also said Rosneft had budgeted for an average oil price of $40 per barrel in 2018 and a little over $40 for 2017.  Higher Dividends Rosneft, controlled by state-owned Rosneftegaz holding, decided to pay 35 percent of its net income as dividends on 2016 results. The government, which is battling a budget deficit mainly due to falling oil prices, has ordered state companies to pay 50 percent of earnings in dividends. Highly indebted Rosneft, which has been on a buying spree for the past few years to become the world's largest oil producer by output, had fought off the order. However, earlier this week Putin told Sechin to increase the payout.  We support this decision,  said Sechin, referring to paying 50 percent of its net profit in dividends starting from 2017. Rosneft pays dividends twice a year. Among the assets, which Rosneft recently acquired, is India's Essar Oil. The completion of the deal had been held up by Essar's creditors. Sechin said the deal was now practically completed after a legally binding deal was signed on Wednesday.

Dladla, currently CEO of investment arm Eskom Enterprises and with more than two decades' experience at the utility, replaces Brian Molefe, who was removed last month by a team of government ministers amid growing concerns about governance at the country's sole electricity provider.  Dladla is a seasoned business leader with impeccable credentials. His business acumen, which includes his commendable knowledge of Eskom intricacies, will come in handy in his new role,  acting chairman Zethembe Khoza said in a statement. Dladla takes the helm as Eskom has come under scrutiny in the media after leaked documents put it at the centre of allegations of improper dealings in government contracts by business friends of President Jacob Zuma. Eskom was also named in a report by the Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated corruption watchdog, which raised questions over coal deals between the utility and a company controlled by the Gupta family, business friends of Zuma. Eskom has denied any wrongdoing. A leadership crisis deepened last week when Chairman Ben Ngubane resigned, citing personal reasons. His departure came two weeks after the government reversed Eskom's decision to reinstate Molefe as chief executive.

About 400 migrants from the Middle East and Africa have returned to the northern French port city where the last government sent in bulldozers to clear a migrant camp known as The Jungle in November 2016.  Prefects have given instructions for more flexibility to be shown, in particular for more humanity to be shown,  government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting.  We cannot treat women and men as if they are just numbers.  Castaner said that reforming France's asylum process was a priority for new President Emmanuel Macron. The Jungle camp, where thousands of migrants hoping to reach Britain lived in squalid conditions, came to symbolize Europe's difficulty in dealing with an ongoing migrant crisis. Former president Francois Hollande's Socialist government ordered the camp's destruction under pressure from locals who blamed the migrants for rising crime, turning a deaf ear to charities that warned the migrants would recongregate. Jacques Toubon, who heads France's public human rights watchdog, met with Macron this week. On Thursday, he pressed the government to ensure that migrants in Calais have access to clean water and that charities can distribute food.  The government's determination not to see migrants back in Calais ... seems to result in everything being done to prevent the migrants from settling: tents and shelter are not tolerated, people -- including minors -- are sleeping on the ground,  Toubon said in findings published on Thursday. Earlier this month, two French charities accused police of using excessive force against migrants and preventing aid groups from distributing meals. Thousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia have converged on the port city over the past decade, hoping to find a way of getting across the Channel to Britain. Most attempt to climb onto trucks or trains using the Channel Tunnel. Police have had to be deployed permanently in the area. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb will visit Calais on Friday, three days after a van driver was killed when he crashed into a tail-back on a motorway outside Calais where migrants had blocked the way with tree trunks.

Milan is a relative laggard. But fashionable lateness is a Lombard charm, and there are others that make the Italian city a dark-horse candidate in the race for post-Brexit prominence. Belatedly, Milan and Italy’s government are getting their act together, wooing firms who may find their ability to do business in the European Union impaired by last year’s referendum. City leaders have made the pilgrimage to London while the government has approved tax incentives designed to attract skilled foreigner workers and entice thousands of Italians – part of a brain drain over the past two decades – to return. Milan’s mayor is even lobbying Italy’s prime minister to move the headquarters of Consob, the financial markets regulator, to his city. For anyone watching the travails of the Italian financial system of late, it’s hard to imagine the capital of Lombardy playing host to American, Chinese or Japanese bank balance sheets. True, its financiers brought the practice of collateralized lending to London a few centuries ago. But Italy’s higher cost of capital, partly a reflection of the country’s elevated debt load and fractious politics, makes a modern-day return unappealing. As a place from which to do business across the single market, though, the city the Romans called Mediolanum has several attractions. Though Frankfurt has a leg up with the big banks, “there are some important sectors where we really can compete, like investment management and private equity”, says Giuseppe Sala, who celebrated his first anniversary as mayor this week. “Our efforts now are focused on asking those players to consider relocating important departments to Milan or adding people in the city.” The Ministry of Economy and Finance in Rome is lending a hand, presenting a sort of road-show touting Italy’s fiscal benefits for incomers. These include the absence of property taxes on main dwellings, a maximum bill of 100,000 euros on foreign income for 15 years, and tax exemptions on 50 percent of remuneration for managers and professionals for five years. Italy is also speeding up its debt restructuring, bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings; lowering corporate tax rates to 24 percent; simplifying work contracts and harmonizing carried interest and capital gains tax rates. Milan has a long-deserved reputation as the place in Italy where business gets done. It produces a tenth of the nation’s gross domestic product and hosts 85 percent of the foreign banks with operations in the country. As home to 270,000 non-Italian citizens – a fifth of the population – Milan is open to foreigners. Its seven universities attract 200,000 students, around 15 percent of whom are from abroad. Only New York plays host to more foreign consulates. “English is very much the professional lingua franca of the city – facilitating interactions for those who have not yet mastered the language of Dante,” says Jean Pierre Mustier, a French investment banker who uprooted to Milan last year to run UniCredit, Italy’s second-largest financial institution. He notes that when UniCredit sold its Pioneer Investment arm to Amundi, the French fund manager announced that Milan will become one of its global investment hubs, with plans to hire several hundred people who would otherwise have been based in the United Kingdom. It’s true that “Italy” and “banking” are words that have recently appeared in conjunction with “crisis”. As with its post-Brexit offensive, Italy has come late to cleaning up its financial system. While other European countries were nationalizing and recapitalizing their banks, Italy battled a sovereign debt panic and downplayed its own banking woes. Even here, though, there is room for optimism. As soon as this weekend, authorities are expected to resolve the plight of two medium-sized banks in the Veneto region that have weighed on the domestic financial system. The contours of the bailout are still taking shape, but will likely involve wiping out the equity and subordinated creditors of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, carving out 5 billion euros of non-performing loans to a government-funded entity, and selling the remaining good assets, branches and other operations to Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest bank, for a nominal sum. This won’t solve Italy’s banking problems overnight. There are still nearly 200 billion euros of crummy loans clogging up the economy. But at least the stock has stopped growing. And the state-led resolution of the Veneto banks may free up additional capital for Atlante, an investment vehicle funded by other Italian lenders, to acquire bad debts such as the 26 billion euros of loans that Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been struggling to offload. Even with the end of Italy’s financial woes on the horizon, Milan is unlikely to be a grand beneficiary of lenders moving from London. But with UniCredit and Intesa both headquartered in the city, Milan is already a banking capital in its own right. As a result, Mayor Sala is focusing on an approach less dependent on finance, for instance wooing the European Medicines Agency, which is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of drugs in the EU. The agency will need to leave London as a result of Britain’s withdrawal. Milan’s financial community is confident Sala can make the approach work. It’s not just work, anyway, that will sell the city. From the top of UniCredit’s new headquarters, Italy’s tallest skyscraper, Mustier has sweeping views across the Po valley to the foothills of the Alps. “Milan’s unique geographical position means you can go skiing in the mountains or swimming in the sea less than two hours’ drive from the city.

Last year, despite driver complaints about the safety of the Baku circuit, 18 of 22 cars finished the challenging anti-clockwise track, which runs along the shores of the Caspian Sea and around the walls of the medieval old town.  We got kind of lucky,  Bottas told a news conference on Thursday.  There was not much action.  It's a track where, normally, things will happen, so my guess is that we're going to see a bit more of a mess than before.  In 2016, Bottas's Mercedes teammate, title contender Lewis Hamilton, started the race in 10th after clipping the barriers during qualifying, leaving his main rival Nico Rosberg on pole, and able to cruise to victory in a subdued race. Haas driver Romain Grosjean agreed that this year's race should be more open.  Rosberg last year was far ahead and Lewis was at the back with various issues, so there weren't many fights around the field.  During last year's Baku qualifying, Bottas, then with Williams, registered the highest speed ever recorded in a Formula One session, reaching 373 km/h (234 mph) on what is the longest stretch of any race on the calendar. The Finn drove superbly to claim victory on the street-style circuit in Sochi, Russia, in April, but, perhaps demonstrating Mercedes' inconsistencies, last month his teammate Hamilton all but disappeared on a similar track, in Monaco.  It's definitely a challenge here, it's one of those places like Monaco or Singapore that there's places where you can't afford any kind of mistakes,  Bottas said.  You're going so close to the walls and it's sometimes even like touching them. That's always a challenge ... You need to take some risks, and can't lose focus at all.  Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel each have three wins from seven races so far this season.

China's Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) have invested heavily in offline retail - bricks-and-mortar stores - in recent years to complement their online offerings.  With their ready-made payment and social media platforms to lure shoppers, Alibaba and JD.com have helped China become the world’s largest online grocery market, far ahead of the United States.  This early lead, cemented by densely populated urban areas and cheap labor, could be key as retailers and tech firms race to boost margins on low-cost consumer goods by reinventing supply chains with big data analytics.   China is already the largest online grocery market in terms of value in the world so it's really advanced in terms of scale,  said Nick Miles, London-based head of Asia Pacific for food and grocery industry research body IGD. Sales made online are set to more than double to around 6.6 percent of China's broader grocery market by 2020, compared to around 1.4 percent for U.S. sales by then. Both U.S. and Chinese e-commerce firms are grappling with the challenge of increasing their margins on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), which include low-margin, high-demand goods with a short shelf-life - a staple of grocery stores. Alibaba, which has a burgeoning cloud business that competes directly with Amazon, plans to use its trove of consumer data to provide a suite of connected services back to brands whose goods they sell. Services will include inventory management, smart manufacturing and logistics, aiming to slash waste and margins across the entire supply chain, according to the company's so-called  New Retail  strategy. Likewise, JD.com uses data from a partnership with China's hugely popular messaging app WeChat, which has over 930 million users, to build data profiles for a range of brands including baby products, cosmetics and soft drinks.  Catch Up Alibaba has invested over $9.3 billion in offline retail stores since 2015, including supermarket chain Sanjiang, department store Intime Retail Group and Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (002024.SZ), one of China's biggest offline retailers. In May it took an 18 percent stake in Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co Ltd (0980.HK), part of retailer Bailian Group.  JD.com bought Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) Chinese online platform Yihaodian for about $1.5 billion in shares in 2016. FILE PHOTO: A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoU.S. firms are now looking to play catch up - key as bricks-and-mortar stores are hit by a slowdown and online players battle with tight profit margins and high delivery costs. Amazon launched a $13.7 billion bid for grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.N last week, marking its intention to take on Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, which got a stake in JD.com in the Yihaodian deal, upped its share in the Chinese firm to 12.1 percent in February, having bought online retailer Jet.com in a $3 billion deal last year. It's a race with a big global impact on the wider market: worries about Amazon's new clout with the Whole Foods deal wiped more than $35 billion off the combined market value of dozens of U.S. supermarkets, food producers and shopping malls. The incentive for Chinese tech firms to slash costs and take a bigger bite of the offline market is clear.  Slideshow (7 Images)Despite being the world's largest e-commerce market, over 80 percent of transactions are still conducted offline in China. The country's e-commerce market grew over 50 percent last year while hypermarket and supermarket sales flatlined, according to consultancy Bain & Company. Online retail growth hasn't been immune either, with analysts pointing to high delivery costs and tight margins.  It's going to very hard for those pure e-commerce players to grow (margins), and for those offline players, it's going to be very hard to survive and make money,  said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain.  The answer is to combine in an integrated supply chain.  Competition China's firms and their global rivals are increasingly looking to tap into overseas market such as South East Asia and India, the most likely battlegrounds for any stand-off. However, online-offline tie-ups, even in China, are still at a relatively early stage. Challenges remain with integrating physical store assets to online systems, cutting delivery costs and dealing with fierce competition. At the Hema seafood market on the east side of Beijing, these challenges - and China's ambition - are on display. Shoppers peruse fresh fish and clams, but pay with smartphones, scanning QR codes using Alibaba-linked payment platform Alipay as staff in red t-shirts help set up accounts and connect to wifi.  I don't think Amazon is competitive in this field... its pages, functions and payments are old fashioned,  said one female shopper in her 20's with the last name Liu.  Hema is like Ikea but better... it feels like home.

All we do is win, win, win,” he told a cheering crowd. His first tweet on Thursday morning praised the  special people  there. A feisty Trump spoke for more than an hour at a rally in Cedar Rapids that was similar to those he held during last year's presidential campaign. It included protesters escorted out by police, Trump attacking the news media and supporters waving signs saying  Drain the Swamp  in Washington. Trump's first trip to Iowa since taking office on Jan. 20 came against a backdrop of problems in Washington. His legislative agenda is struggling to gain traction, a federal investigation of alleged Russian meddling into the election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign continues, and his approval rating is below 40 percent in most polls. But Trump touted job gains and an improving stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working, and he lauded his wealthy appointees such as his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries.  In those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person — does that make sense?  Trump said.     He also vowed he would eventually get funding for a border wall with Mexico, possibly with solar panels attached, despite congressional refusal thus far.  We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall,  he said.  Pretty good imagination, right? It's my ideas.

Buoyed by Republican victories in special congressional elections in Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump blasted his opponents as  unbelievably nasty  and said cable news anchors appeared stunned by the Democratic losses. Slideshow (10 Images)Unable to get Democrats to join Republicans in major legislative efforts, Trump said the wounding by a gunman last week of Republican Representative Steve Scalise in Alexandria, Virginia, had fostered a spirit of unity. But he did not sound optimistic about breaking through the partisan divide any time soon. Trump said he doubted he would have help from Democrats in getting major healthcare legislation through the U.S. Congress. He wants the Senate to join the House of Representatives in approving legislation soon to overhaul the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  If we went and got the single greatest healthcare plan in the history of the world we would not get one Democrat vote because they’re obstructionists,  Trump said. Looking to foreign policy, Trump complained about the  bad hand  he had been dealt, such as North Korea's nuclear program. His comments came days after American student Otto Warmbier died after returning in a coma from captivity in North Korea. On Tuesday, Trump had tweeted that he has basically given up on getting help from Chinese President Xi Jinping on North Korea after investing a lot of effort to coaxing Beijing to use its influence on Pyongyang.  I do like President Xi,  said Trump, who was with the new U.S. ambassador to China, former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.  I do wish we would have a little more help on North Korea.

Diageo said late on Wednesday it would pay $700 million initially for the company, co-founded by the American actor, with potential payment of a further $300 million linked to performance over 10 years. The deal comes two weeks after Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) took a stake in mezcal maker Del Maguey, and highlights the opportunity companies see in Mexico's native spirits.  Several new, high-end tequilas has helped the drink change its traditional image as a party beverage for young drinkers. Its sales rose 5.2 percent globally last year, according to data tracker IWSR, outperforming a spirits industry that edged up only 0.3 percent.  Diageo did not disclose revenue or profit figures, but Morgan Stanley estimates the deal's enterprise value was about 20 times annual turnover, which an industry source said would make it much pricier than other spirits deals, which he said often get done at about 4 to 6 times sales.      Diageo's North American president, Deirdre Mahlan, told reporters that high-growth companies like Casamigos were  notoriously challenging to value under traditional methods . Casamigos, which means  house of friends,  was founded in 2013 by Clooney and his friends - nightlife entrepreneur Rande Gerber, who is married to model Cindy Crawford, and real estate developer Mike Meldman. They will continue to promote the brand. Diageo, which has arrangements with other celebrities including David Beckham and Sean Combs, said Casamigos would be neutral to earnings for the first three years and add to earnings thereafter.

But if not, it might be value destructive.  They said the success of Casamigos, which has grown 54 percent over the last two years, depended on the brand owners' star status, and flagged a risk of losing focus in the next 10 years.  Diageo's shares were down 1.3 percent at 0923 GMT on Thursday, underperforming the FTSE .FTSE. A man walks past barrels outside the Diageo Shieldhall facility near Glasgow, Scotland August 26, 2010.David MoirThe brand sold 120,000 cases in 2016, primarily in the United States, and is on track to reach over 170,000 by the end of the year. Diageo said expanding the brand to Europe would be a source of future growth. Casamigos sells for $45 to $55 per bottle, about the same price as Diageo's other Don Julio tequila. Bernstein analysts said Diageo could successfully sell both, with Casamigos promoted as a celebrity lifestyle brand, and Don Julio positioned as a heritage craft spirit, but they were sceptical.  In our experience, it is difficult for sales, distributors and customers to focus on two brands in the same category at similar price points at the same time,  they said.  Diageo distributed the much bigger Jose Cuervo brand  outside of Mexico until 2012, following its failure to strike a deal to buy it outright from the its founding family. In 2015, it took over the Don Julio brand it had previously shared with the family, trading it for its Bushmills Irish whiskey and cash.  The Casamigos deal is expected to close in second half of the year. Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-diageo-m-a-casamigos-idUSKBN19C296"},

French banks in general have been closing down retail branches and cutting staff, while investing more in the faster-growing online banking sector.  The objective of this reorganisation is to reduce the number of decision-making chains and to concentrate decision-making powers closer to the needs of the customers,  said a BNP Paribas spokesman on Thursday, following a report on the plan by French newspaper Le Monde. Revenues at BNP Paribas' French retail banking networks fell 3 percent in 2016, and fell 1.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. BNP Paribas said it was discussing the job cuts plan, that would come via natural attrition, with French trade unions. The French retail banking unit employed around 29,000 people in 2016, according to the bank's annual report. The bank declined to comment on how many people would be impacted directly by the management revamp. The presentation of the plan comes after the bank outlined its strategy during an investor day earlier this year. BNP said then that it wanted to reduce its cost to income ratio - a key measure of profitability - in the retail bank business to 70 from 73 percent by 2020 through a  digital transformation, simplification of the organisation and streamlining of the branch networks .

Oil producers around the world have faced highly volatile oil markets and declining prices due to a supply glut.  Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, told the company's annual general meeting that global markets were undergoing  tectonic shifts  shown by tougher competition, regulatory changes and higher risks for oil producers. He said Rosneft, in which BP owns around 20 percent, was working on a new strategy to tackle those issues.  The basis for this strategy should be high-quality changes in the company's business, thanks to a technological          breakthrough,  he said adding the strategy should be ready by the year-end. He also said part of the strategy, called Rosneft-2022, would be a shift to a holding structure in Rosneft's management, and would aim to unbundle the retail business and increase petrochemicals' share of the company's total refining capacity to 20 percent. Within this strategy, Rosneft plans organic oil production growth of 20-30 million tonnes in the next five years thanks to new technologies. Last year, Rosneft produced 210 million tonnes of oil (4.2 million barrels per day). Sechin also said Rosneft had budgeted for an average oil price of $40 per barrel in 2018 and a little over $40 for 2017.  Higher Dividends Rosneft, controlled by state-owned Rosneftegaz holding, decided to pay 35 percent of its net income as dividends on 2016 results. The government, which is battling a budget deficit mainly due to falling oil prices, has ordered state companies to pay 50 percent of earnings in dividends. Highly indebted Rosneft, which has been on a buying spree for the past few years to become the world's largest oil producer by output, had fought off the order. However, earlier this week Putin told Sechin to increase the payout.  We support this decision,  said Sechin, referring to paying 50 percent of its net profit in dividends starting from 2017. Rosneft pays dividends twice a year. Among the assets, which Rosneft recently acquired, is India's Essar Oil. The completion of the deal had been held up by Essar's creditors. Sechin said the deal was now practically completed after a legally binding deal was signed on Wednesday.

The initial public offering (IPO) will be priced in range of 120 francs to 140 francs per share, valuing the company founded by Swiss doctors in 1993 at between 780 million francs and 870 million francs, Zur Rose said. Zur Rose will use the proceeds to boost TV advertising in Germany, its largest market, as well as for its shop-in-shop concept with Swiss grocery chain Migros which kicks off with its first location next month. Acquisitions elsewhere in Europe are also on the horizon, with an undisclosed target slated to be bought this year, said the company, which was set up to help doctors manage the cost of the medicines they distribute through their practices.  Europe is an untapped market when it comes to online sales of pharmaceutical products,  Chief Executive Walter Oberhaensli told reporters in Zurich.  It would be negligent to wait to take advantage of these opportunities.  Zur Rose, which had 2016 sales of 879.5 million francs, gained an anchor shareholder last year when the Swiss Frey family's Corisol vehicle paid 40 million francs for a 20 percent stake. Saudi Arabia's Al Faisaliah Group has 6.1 percent. Trading in Zur Rose shares is set to start on July 6 The liberalisation of European Union pharmacy markets offers chances for further international expansion that Zur Rose aims to serve from its DocMorris logistics centre on the German-Dutch border. Court Assistance Zur Rose also got help from last October's European Court of Justice decision that a German law fixing prescription drug prices violated EU free trade rules. After the decision, Zur Rose's DocMorris division resumed offering financial incentives for German residents who order drugs online, helping DocMorris's revenue increase 17 percent in the first quarter of 2017.  We want to take advantage of the momentum created by the court ruling,  Oberhaensli said. Among its competitors is Germany's Shop Apotheke, which last year raised about 100 million euros ($112.6 million) in an IPO to fund its own expansion plans. Zur Rose will be the second Swiss pharmacy company to list shares this year. Galenica Sante's listing in April was Europe's largest IPO of 2017 so far.

John Allan, chairman of the supermarket and of housebuilder Barratt Developments, told The Times newspaper on Thursday that an over-restrictive immigration policy would drive the British economy down.  That will be bad for everyone. It will lead to fewer jobs and decreasing real wages,  Allan said in his role as chairman of lobby group London First. He called for an  intelligent debate  on the immigration issue. Prime Minister Theresa May promised on Wednesday to listen more closely to business concerns about Britain leaving the European Union when she set out a Brexit-focused government programme, pared back to reflect her weakened authority in the wake of an election that saw her lose her parliamentary majority. She plans a bill to repeal EU law on immigration to end free movement, and make migration of EU nationals subject to UK law. The government remains committed to its target to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.  No one in the business community now believes there can be a complete free-for-all in terms of immigration. We have got to have some regime. But it has got to be an intelligent regime, as opposed to simply a blanket ban on bringing people in,  said Allan. Tesco has a UK workforce of 310,000, though it announced up to 1,100 job cuts on Wednesday. Separately on Thursday the BBC reported that British summer fruit and salad growers are having difficulty recruiting pickers with more than half saying they did not know if they will have enough migrant workers to harvest their crops. The BBC said its survey found growers blamed the weak pound which has reduced workers' earning power, as well as uncertainty over Brexit.

The meeting of top U.S. and Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs was held a day after President Donald Trump said China's efforts to use its leverage with Pyongyang had failed, raising fresh doubts about his administration’s strategy for countering the threat from North Korea. The death of American university student Otto Warmbier this week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, has further complicated Trump’s approach to North Korea, his top national security challenge.  We reiterated to China that they have a diplomatic responsibility to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime if they want to prevent further escalation in the region,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a joint news conference with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Mattis vowed to  continue to take necessary measures to defend ourselves and our allies  against North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. But with the long-standing option of pre-emptive military strikes seen as far too risky for now, Trump's aides are stressing economic and diplomatic pressure. Tillerson said Trump would make a state visit to China this year, and Mattis said both sides agreed to expand military-to-military ties, signaling the new administration’s determination to continue efforts to improve relations between the world's two largest economies, despite frustration over North Korea. Related CoverageTillerson says U.S., China call on North Korea to stop nuclear weapons programNorth Korea topped the agenda at the newly established Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which paired Tillerson and Mattis with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of joint staff of the People's Liberation Army. While the U.S. officials stressed agreement on the goal of North Korean denuclearization, the talks also dealt with China’s sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea, with the Americans reaffirming opposition to Beijing’s militarization of islands it is building in the strategic waterway. High Hopes Tillerson urged China to help crack down on illicit North Korean activities that fund its nuclear and missile programs, and said the Chinese had agreed their companies  should not do business  with sanctioned North Korean entities. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis meet with Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui, chief of the People's Liberation Army's Joint Staff Department prior to the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue at the State Department in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinTillerson stressed the need to choke off funding sources including money laundering, labor export and computer hacking.  Countries around the world and in the U.N. Security Council are joining in this effort, and we hope China will do their part as well,  he said. China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has been accused of not fully enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on its neighbor, and has resisted some tougher measures. Washington has considered further  secondary sanctions  against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea. Slideshow (3 Images)A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China did not exert  so-called economic or diplomatic pressure  in its interactions with other countries.  What we do is to develop friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of five principles of peaceful coexistence,  the  spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular briefing on Thursday. Trump has had high hopes for cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders met in Florida in April and Trump has  praised Xi for working on the issue, despite only modest steps so far by Beijing. At the same time, Trump has mostly held back on attacking Chinese trade practices, which he railed against during the presidential campaign.  While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!  Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, a day after Warmbier died following his return from captivity in a coma. The tweet puzzled even Trump's own aides. Asked whether Trump had lost faith in China’s ability to restrain North Korea, Mattis said the president’s view represented Americans'  frustration” with Pyongyang’s provocations and after seeing “a young man go over there healthy, and with a minor act of mischief, come home dead, basically.  Later on Wednesday, Trump said in a speech in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that the United States has a  great relationship with China and I really like President Xi.  The talks followed what a U.S. official said on Tuesday were new movements detected by U.S. spy satellites at North Korea's nuclear test site. But it was unclear if Pyongyang was preparing for a sixth nuclear test.

Jiang Guorong, who has been with UBS for about three years and was its head of China investment banking and vice-chairman of Asia investment banking, has left to join Citi as chairman and head of the bank's China corporate and investment banking, according to a memo sent to Citigroup staff and seen by Reuters. Guorong is likely to start his role at Citi in September this year. A Citi spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed the content of the memo. Separately, Citi on Thursday said it had hired Alison Harding-Jones, UBS's head of Asia Pacific M&A;, as its new head of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) M&A; and vice-chairman of EMEA corporate and investment banking. In her new role, Harding-Jones, who worked at UBS for 28 years, will focus on expanding M&A; market share across the EMEA sectors and countries. She will move from Hong Kong to London,  a Citi statement said.  With her long track record of building successful M&A; practices... she will be a strong asset to our team and a key part of our growth strategy,  Raymond McGuire, global head of corporate and investment banking at Citi, said. UBS has had a number of senior level departures in Asia in the last six months. In May, UBS lost three senior investment bankers, including its deputy head of China, Cheng Wang, who is due to join Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in August as vice chairman of investment banking in Asia Pacific. Joseph Chee, one of UBS' top dealmakers in Asia, who was the go-to banker for Chinese state and private companies seeking to raise funds in Hong Kong and the United States, left in January to set up his own fund.  In December last year, Damien Brosnan, co-head of Asia ECM at UBS, left the bank only seven months after taking up that position.  UBS said in an internal note to staff on Thursday Samson Lo, its co-head of Asia M&A;, will now become the head of that business. It also named Greg Peirce and Pei Shen Chou as co-heads of its M&A; advisory business in Asia Pacific. UBS was a powerhouse in Asia equity capital markets and along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), it dominated the league tables from 2002. But in the past two years its performance has suffered as Chinese investment banks made inroads.

The Riyadh index added 1.2 percent to a 20-month high of 7,426 points in heavy trade. It is now up 6.8 percent in reaction to the appointment of the architect of the economic reform and privatisation plans, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince. Previously the 31-year old was deputy crown prince. Some shares which were top gainers on the previous day continued to rally with the only listed miner, Saudi Arabian Mining, surging 9.4 percent. The now crown prince had previously stressed the importance of expanding the mining sector as part of plans to diversify the economy from oil. Banks were also strong with government-majority owned National Commercial Bank gaining 4.6 percent, extending on its 10 percent surge on Wednesday. Analysts at Dubai-based Exotix said in a note the Saudi banking stocks  screen particularly well  compared to other sectors, because they are trading at a relatively attractive valuation. News of the retroactive reinstatement of civil servants' allowances was supportive for the retail sector on the expectation that shoppers will be spending more money in the Eid al-Fitr break, which will start either Sunday or Monday. Apparel retailer and mall operator Fawaz Alhokair climbed 4.7 percent. The austerity reversal will bring in between 5 and 6 billion riyals ($1.3 billion to $1.6 billion) according to the finance minister. Public sector workers were also given an extra week off for Eid, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Also, investors were happy that index compiler MSCI placed Riyadh on the watch list for an emerging market upgrade. Analysts predict the market may gain 20-30 percent through to the decision date in June 2018. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures staying near overnight 10-month lows weighed on some large cap petrochemical stocks; Saudi Basic Industries lost 2.5 percent. Qatar, Uae Qatar's stock index rebounded 2.9 percent, snapping four sessions of declines as 39 shares rose and only two declined. Foreign funds, which have been net sellers of Qatari shares since June 5 when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and trade links with Doha, were net buyers on Thursday, suggesting they have regained some confidence in the market. Shares of Vodafone Qatar, a constituent of the MSCI emerging market benchmark, jumped 5.2 percent and was the most traded stock on Thursday. Elsewhere, Abu Dhabi's index fell 0.6 percent as Eshraq Properties, the most traded stock, lost 8.7 percent. On Thursday the company said it will meet on July 5 to ratify the sale of its shares in real-estate investment fund Ward Holding. Dubai's index fell 0.5 percent as shares of the most traded stock GFH Financial Group slumped 8.9 percent. On Wednesday the company said that Integrated Capital (IC), owned by Abu Dhabi Financial Group (ADFG) transferred its 21 million shares in GFH to Ajman Bank. IC will remain to be  beneficial owner  with a 13.38 percent stake.  This announcement clearly prompted retail investors to cash out, it was negative on sentiment,  said a Dubai-based broker. Gulf stock markets will be closed as of June 25 because of the Eid break with Saudi Arabia and Qatar's bourse announcing they will resume trade on July 2.

All we do is win, win, win,” he told a cheering crowd. His first tweet on Thursday morning praised the  special people  there. A feisty Trump spoke for more than an hour at a rally in Cedar Rapids that was similar to those he held during last year's presidential campaign. It included protesters escorted out by police, Trump attacking the news media and supporters waving signs saying  Drain the Swamp  in Washington. Trump's first trip to Iowa since taking office on Jan. 20 came against a backdrop of problems in Washington. His legislative agenda is struggling to gain traction, a federal investigation of alleged Russian meddling into the election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign continues, and his approval rating is below 40 percent in most polls. But Trump touted job gains and an improving stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working, and he lauded his wealthy appointees such as his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries.  In those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person — does that make sense?  Trump said.     He also vowed he would eventually get funding for a border wall with Mexico, possibly with solar panels attached, despite congressional refusal thus far.  We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall,  he said.  Pretty good imagination, right? It's my ideas.  U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the U.S. Cellular Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, U.S. June 21, 2017.Scott MorganSolar panels along the wall are among proposals that have been submitted by companies to the Department of Homeland Security, according to media reports. Buoyed by Republican victories in special congressional elections in Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump blasted his opponents as  unbelievably nasty  and said cable news anchors appeared stunned by the Democratic losses. Slideshow (10 Images)Unable to get Democrats to join Republicans in major legislative efforts, Trump said the wounding by a gunman last week of Republican Representative Steve Scalise in Alexandria, Virginia, had fostered a spirit of unity. But he did not sound optimistic about breaking through the partisan divide any time soon. Trump said he doubted he would have help from Democrats in getting major healthcare legislation through the U.S. Congress. He wants the Senate to join the House of Representatives in approving legislation soon to overhaul the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  If we went and got the single greatest healthcare plan in the history of the world we would not get one Democrat vote because they’re obstructionists,  Trump said. Looking to foreign policy, Trump complained about the  bad hand  he had been dealt, such as North Korea's nuclear program. His comments came days after American student Otto Warmbier died after returning in a coma from captivity in North Korea. On Tuesday, Trump had tweeted that he has basically given up on getting help from Chinese President Xi Jinping on North Korea after investing a lot of effort to coaxing Beijing to use its influence on Pyongyang.  I do like President Xi,  said Trump, who was with the new U.S. ambassador to China, former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.  I do wish we would have a little more help on North Korea.

The improving activity picture has been accompanied by rapid disinflation in the aftermath of two years of recession and a recent strengthening in exchange rates.  Recent inflation outturns of around 4% in Brazil and Russia are very low by historical standards and are  opening up space for further monetary easing in both countries,  said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch. With nominal wage growth steady, real wage growth is rising, helping to support a nascent recovery in consumer spending in Russia and a stabilisation in Brazil. On the basis of recent industrial production, credit growth and labour market trends, Russia's 2017 recovery looks to be on a firmer footing than that in Brazil. Fitch's bi-monthly 20/20 Vision chart pack covers 20 major economies and 20 economic variables that are the focus of Fitch's economics team's global macro analysis and plots five years of high frequency economic data with consistent coverage across each country. 20/20 Vision is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link.

Jiang Guorong, who has been with UBS for about three years and was its head of China investment banking and vice-chairman of Asia investment banking, has left to join Citi as chairman and head of the bank's China corporate and investment banking, according to a memo sent to Citigroup staff and seen by Reuters. Guorong is likely to start his role at Citi in September this year. A Citi spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed the content of the memo. Separately, Citi on Thursday said it had hired Alison Harding-Jones, UBS's head of Asia Pacific M&A;, as its new head of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) M&A; and vice-chairman of EMEA corporate and investment banking. In her new role, Harding-Jones, who worked at UBS for 28 years, will focus on expanding M&A; market share across the EMEA sectors and countries. She will move from Hong Kong to London,  a Citi statement said.  With her long track record of building successful M&A; practices... she will be a strong asset to our team and a key part of our growth strategy,  Raymond McGuire, global head of corporate and investment banking at Citi, said. UBS has had a number of senior level departures in Asia in the last six months. In May, UBS lost three senior investment bankers, including its deputy head of China, Cheng Wang, who is due to join Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in August as vice chairman of investment banking in Asia Pacific. Joseph Chee, one of UBS' top dealmakers in Asia, who was the go-to banker for Chinese state and private companies seeking to raise funds in Hong Kong and the United States, left in January to set up his own fund.  In December last year, Damien Brosnan, co-head of Asia ECM at UBS, left the bank only seven months after taking up that position.  UBS said in an internal note to staff on Thursday Samson Lo, its co-head of Asia M&A;, will now become the head of that business. It also named Greg Peirce and Pei Shen Chou as co-heads of its M&A; advisory business in Asia Pacific. UBS was a powerhouse in Asia equity capital markets and along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), it dominated the league tables from 2002. But in the past two years its performance has suffered as Chinese investment banks made inroads.

Eastern states such as Poland and Hungary have refused to take in asylum-seekers to ease the burden on Greece and Italy, where most of the 1.7 million refugees and migrants entering the EU since 2014 have landed by boat after fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Their reluctance to host a share of the arrivals has also angered wealthier countries such as Germany and Sweden, the preferred final destination for many of the migrants. Despite political pressure, Warsaw, Budapest, Prague and Bratislava have been vehement and the issue has opened deep divisions in the EU at a time it needs unity to face Britain's exit from the bloc.  Germany has been pushing for relocation (of asylum-seekers) for a long time. Now they have said we'd better focus on where we can agree and come back to this in October,  a senior EU diplomat said.  October comes after September,  the person said, stressing the link to the election in which conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel faces off against the social democrat Martin Schulz. Merkel has come under fire for allowing more than one million refugees to enter Germany over the past two years. Diplomats said the change of tactics by Germany, which hosts the highest number of refugees, came with a realisation that no political points can be won now on the intractable dispute.  The change of strategy is justified. We have to make progress in areas like the return of migrants and common standards in the asylum system,  a German EU diplomat said.  Those achievements will give us the momentum to tackle the more disputed topics.  Difficult to Accept German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said after meeting his 27 EU colleagues earlier in June there was  no way to find an agreement within the current style of negotiation.   I therefore proposed that we first focus on those parts in which agreements are possible,  he said. A second senior EU diplomat saw this as a  clear change of strategy . A senior EU official preparing the leaders' summit said the aim was to  highlight areas in which there has been progress and convergence . As immigration spiked, EU leaders in 2015 decided by majority on an obligatory relocation system, outvoting four eastern states. The bloc's executive has since opened legal cases against Warsaw, Budapest and Prague for not meeting their obligations. Hungary and Slovakia challenged the scheme in the EU's top court and a ruling is expected later this year. A third senior EU diplomat said of the leaders' discussion on migration, due on Friday:  The matter causing the biggest controversy - it's not that it won't be mentioned at all but it will not be the subject of a big debate or decisions.  This theme will be largely avoided at this summit for purely political reasons. It's the internal German situation behind this change of perspective.  That is difficult to accept for Athens and Rome. They have called for cuts in EU funding for the eastern states if they do not take part in the relocation scheme. After a 2016 deal with Turkey slashed arrivals in Greece, Italy is now the main gateway to Europe, with some 71,000 arrivals so far in 2017, about a third more than a year ago.  Another diplomat worried the eastern states were being let off the hook:  There is an effort to play it down. There is no way to get an agreement, so let's avoid another bad quarrel.   But we want solidarity. It's very tricky.  To sweeten the situation for Italy and Greece, the leaders will say the bloc's executive should propose more ways to help the frontline states, according to the latest draft of the summit conclusions, seen by Reuters on Thursday. Compared to more than a million arrivals in the EU in 2015, last year saw around 360,000 sea crossings and the figure is expected to be lower this year. So while Italy remains under pressure, the sense of urgency has weakened for some other countries in the bloc. Another Brussels official said:  The only way to manage migration is to keep it off the political agenda. You can't win. Let's take the heat out of it.

U.S. crude futures were up 0.52 percent at $42.74 per barrel. They closed down 1.6 percent on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Global benchmark Brent traded up at $45.21. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, skidding into bear market territory, despite OPEC-led efforts to stabilize the market.  Oil is trying to balance, but I'm worried that it would continue to head lower,  said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K; Investment Management.  I think this a situation where OPEC is ceding market share and is no longer able to control prices.  The S&P; energy index, which has lost 14.9 percent this year, is the worst performing sector, largely underperforming the broader S&P; 500 index. Dow e-minis were down 13 points, or 0.06 percent, with 18,947 contracts changing hands at 8:26 a.m. ET (1226 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.08 percent, with 128,228 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 5.75 points, or 0.1 percent, on volume of 33,190 contracts. Investors are concerned that the drop in oil prices could affect inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, even as the central bank adopts a hawkish tone regarding future rate hikes.  I've been more worried about deflation. I know (the Fed) wants to normalize, but I think it would be tough to get one more this year and three next year in the face of a flattening yield curve,  added Clark. A flattening yield curve is often interpreted as a negative economic indicator as it shows concerns about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. The yield spread between five-year Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds flattened to its narrowest level since December 2007. Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last increased by 3,000 to 241,000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market. Among stocks, Accenture was off 2.57 percent in premarket trading after the consulting and outsourcing services provider trimmed its annual revenue forecast. Oracle's shares were up about 12 percent as the business software maker forecast an upbeat current-quarter profit, prompting brokerages to raise price targets. American Airlines was up 5.93 percent at $51.30 after the U.S. airline said Qatar Airways had expressed interest in buying a 10 percent stake.

Although Qamishli lies on the Turkish border, the crossing is closed and the U.N. aid effort in northeastern Syria has relied on airlifts from Damascus to Qamishli since July 2016. Last week, Syria gave the U.N. permission to get aid to Qamishli by truck, relieving the strain on a base that is supporting thousands of people who have been displaced by the war with Islamic State. A convoy of three lorries from Homs has since arrived in the city in the northeastern Hasakeh region, passing by Aleppo and bringing a month's supply of food for 15,000 people, the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said.   This humanitarian breakthrough will allow us to increase regular support for all 250,000 people in need in Hasakeh,  WFP's Syria country director Jakob Kern said in a statement. The agency said it could previously assist only 190,000 people by airlifts, due to higher costs and limited capacity.   Once regular land access to Hasakeh is established, WFP will gradually phase out of its current airlift operation,  Kern said. That could save the agency some $19 million annually - enough to provide a year's food aid to 100,000 people, WFP said. WFP flights had been running at full capacity, twice a day, six days a week for almost a year.  Roads became inaccessible in December 2015, and restoration of deliveries was only made possible by improved security, the agency said. The development came as U.S. backed Syrian militias were closing in on Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include Arab and Kurdish fighters and are supported with air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition, began an offensive two weeks ago to seize the northern city from Islamic State, which overran it in 2014. Earlier in June, the U.N. said it estimated that 440,000 people might need humanitarian aid as a result of the offensive.  Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ended June 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless claims rising to 240,000 in the latest week. Following the report, the dollar held at slightly lower levels against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries were little changed. Jobless claims for the prior week were revised upwards by 1,000 to 238,000 from 237,000. The week's tally is the 120th consecutive week that claims have been below 300,000, the threshold associated with a strong labor market. It's the longest stretch that claims have remained below that level since 1970. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smoothes week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 244,750 last week, the highest since early April.  Many economists consider the labor market to be at or near full employment. The unemployment rate in May declined to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point last week for the second time in three months and signaled it remains on track for one more rate hike this year. Fed officials have been buoyed by the tightening jobs market although it has yet to translate into significant pricing pressures. Indeed, some policymakers at the central bank have begun to show increasing concern that a recent pullback in inflation may point to sustained difficulty in returning it to the Fed's 2 percent target.  A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data. Only claims for Louisiana were estimated. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 8,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended June 10.

In its quarterly inflation report, the central bank cut its inflation predictions to 3.8 percent for 2017 and 4.5 percent for 2018, from 4.0 percent and 4.6 percent previously. The bank sees the annual inflation rate falling to 4.3 percent by mid-2019, below its official target of 4.5 percent. Lower inflation forecasts provide greater room for aggressive interest rate cuts, such as the 100-basis-point reductions made at the bank's latest two meetings. They may also help policymakers reduce the country's inflation target next week for the first time in more than a decade, to 4.25 or 4 percent, as government sources have suggested to Reuters. Brazil is slowly emerging from a two-year recession, and lower interest rates are expected to speed up the recovery by encouraging investments and consumption. Yields on interest rate futures were slightly down in morning trading as investors pared majority bets on a 75-basis-point rate cut at the bank's next meeting on July 26. The benchmark rate is currently at 10.25 percent, down from 14.25 percent in October last year. The central bank has been signaling since its latest policy decision in May that higher political uncertainty following a corruption investigation into President Michel Temer would probably lead to a reduction in the size of rate cuts. The bank reiterated that message on Thursday, but added that such an assessment was made considering the information available at its latest meeting on May 31. The bank repeated that the pace of policy easing  will continue to depend  on economic growth, inflation expectations and other risks.  We have more than a month until the next policy decision,  said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at J. Safra, in São Paulo.  Is it possible that we see reasons for a bigger (rate) cut? Yes. Today, our call is for a 75-basis-point cut.  The Supreme Court investigation into Temer has eroded congressional support for his austerity agenda and fueled market volatility since May, as investors fear Brazil may not be doing enough to curb public spending and reduce chronically high inflation in the long run.

After a fiercely contested, months-long auction, Toshiba on Wednesday said a consortium of Japanese government investors and private equity firm Bain Capital was the preferred bidder, aiming to seal a deal worth some $18 billion by next week. The sale will provide much-needed cash for the electronics giant, which has been forced to divest part of its chip business to cover billions of dollars in cost over-runs at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear power business Westinghouse.      But the group of awkward bedfellows could struggle in the cash-intensive and competitive tech sector, famous for hairpin swings in consumer demand and a brutally small margin of assembly-line error, senior industry participants said. Flagging a lack of industry expertise and cultural differences, the disparate consortium would likely need to bring in a leader from outside to run the core unit to be spun off from the world's eighth largest semiconductor maker, they said.  Chip chiefs must be someone like Carlos Ghosn, who exercised strong leadership in Nissan's turnaround,  said Tsugio Makimoto, former Hitachi Ltd chief engineer, referring to the Brazilian-born boss credited with reviving the fortunes of car makers Renault and Nissan.  It will be hard for a patched-together group like the Japan-U.S.-South Korea consortium to achieve such leadership.  State Intervention Japanese policymakers are notoriously reluctant to let big business failures hurt the wider economy, but state-led investors have a patchy history of turning around troubled corporates in the country. In addition to Bain, the group includes state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) and the Development Bank of Japan. South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are in talks to provide financing. A senior Toshiba executive said that anti-trust concerns around SK Hynix's memory operations mean it would not participate in the management of the chip business.  No one in the consortium knows the management of the memory chip business as SK Hynix would stay in the background,  the executive said.     SK Hynix declined to comment.     Still, the group is seen by many analysts as being the most likely suitor as it would automatically gain an implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government, which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba is the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash memory chips that are increasingly in demand from electronics makers as consumers look for ever larger long-term data storage. Mixed Results INCJ's past record in bringing Japanese electronic component makers back from the brink and aiding wider restructuring in the sector has yielded mixed results. The group, a public-private partnership, five years ago cobbled together Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba. The liquid crystal display maker has posted three consecutive years of losses and is now considering deeper restructuring despite receiving 75 billion yen ($685 million) in investment from INCJ in December. On the other hand, INCJ's bailout of Renesas Electronics Corp in 2013 is considered a win, with its share price more than trebling to trade around 1,000 yen, from 300 yen at the time of its rescue. However, Kuninori Hamaguchi, a semiconductor expert who is currently external audit and supervisory board member at Oki Electric Industry Co, warns Toshiba's investment requirements are incomparably greater than those of INCJ's past rescues.  INCJ's investment in Renesas is considered a success. Their strategy worked because they narrowed down their target to the automotive industry and focused on automotive chips,  Hamaguchi said.  But Toshiba's memory business is massive in scale. Flash memory will be central to data servers in coming years. It would be a capital battle.  An INCJ spokeswoman said the fund plans to proceed with detailed negotiations to clinch a deal as a consortium, but declined to comment further. The Development Bank of Japan declined to comment, while representatives Bain Capital could not be reached. A spokeswoman said Toshiba Memory plans to provide sufficient information to the consortium to allow the new management to make decisions in a timely and appropriate manner.  Not Over Yet Meanwhile, the consortium's bid is not over the finishing line yet. Rival bidder Western Digital says Toshiba is in breach of its joint venture contracts. The companies jointly operate a flash memory chip plant in Japan. Western Digital has requested a U.S. court injunction and a hearing is scheduled for mid-July. Terry Gou, the outspoken founder of Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and another bidder in the auction, still saw scope for his company's bid to succeed given some of the uncertainties around the consortium's structure. He also questioned the Japanese government's involvement in the auction, contrasting it with his own experience of raising investment.   I haven't gotten any government money,  Gou told reporters at his company's annual general meeting on Thursday.  I haven't asked for a single dollar from the Taiwan government.

The vehicle ploughed into people as they left a mosque shortly after midnight on Monday, injuring 11. Makram Ali, 51, had fallen ill at the scene just before the attack, and police initially said it was unclear whether he had been killed in the incident or had died of other causes. But they said on Thursday the preliminary findings of a post mortem had concluded he died of multiple injuries.  We know that he had some form of collapse because of his weak leg, a condition he suffers from, before recovering, sitting up and expressing a wish to return home only to then become a victim of this horrific incident,  Ali's family said in a statement. The father-of-six, who had come to Britain from Bangladesh at the age of 10, was a quiet man who regularly attended his mosque and enjoyed playing with his grandchildren, the statement said. Four others injured in the attack remain in hospital with two receiving critical care, police said. The 47-year-old suspected van driver was detained by people at the scene and named by British media as Darren Osborne. He remains in police custody and detectives have been given permission to hold him until Saturday. Police said the rented van involved had been driven from Cardiff to London on Sunday and officers appealed for anyone who saw it to come forward. The incident at Finsbury Park in north London was the fourth attack in Britain since March described by police as terrorist, and the third to involve a vehicle driven at pedestrians. Previous attacks were blamed on Islamist extremists. Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Andrew Roche","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-death-idUSKBN19D1KP"},

For many, higher Medicare premiums will take a big bite out of their raise.  The 2018 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will not be announced until October, but inflation trends point toward an increase of about 2 percent, according to a recent forecast by the Senior Citizens League. That would be a welcome change compared with the 0.3 percent bump in 2017, and 2016 when no COLA was made.  COLAS are determined by an automatic formula tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). From 2013 to 2015, the annual increases have ranged around 1.5 percent. For a retiree receiving the average monthly Social Security benefit of $1,360, a 2 percent raise would translate to an increase of $27.20. But for most beneficiaries, Medicare Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security. And the impact of the Part B premium on net benefits next year will vary due to what is known as the “hold harmless” provision governing Social Security. By law, the dollar amount of Part B premium increases cannot exceed the dollar amount of the COLA - a feature that ensures net Social Security benefits do not fall. The hold harmless provision applies to the 70 percent of the Medicare population enrolled in both programs. Those not held harmless include anyone delaying their filing for Social Security benefits, but others affected include some federal and state government retirees. Affluent seniors who pay high-income Medicare premium surcharges also are not protected. The stingy COLAs of the past two years are rare, and now they have set the table for an equally unusual situation for 2018. The recent flat COLAs meant that nonprotected Medicare enrollees shouldered most of the burden of rising Part B premiums; the premiums for this group jumped sharply in 2016 and 2017. This year, they are paying $134 per month, while protected beneficiaries are paying an average of $109. But a generous 2018 COLA will spread higher Part B program costs across the entire Medicare population. That means nonprotected enrollees will see their premiums fall, while the protected group will pay more. Consider an example where the standard Part B premium falls to $125. That above-mentioned average Social Security beneficiary, (receiving $1,360 monthly) now faces a $16 increase in her monthly Part B premium, reducing her COLA from $27.20 to $11.20. If she were receiving $2,000 a month she would receive a net monthly COLA of $24, instead of $40. How would low-income beneficiaries be affected? Someone receiving $600 would see her $12 gross COLA cut to just $6 - although she might also be eligible for a Medicare Savings Program depending on where she lives. In some states, these programs turn to Medicaid to pay Part B premiums, which means she would receive her full COLA (reut.rs/1OXKZ9b).    Cola Falls Behind Setting aside the hold-harmless math, the COLA formula is not keeping seniors even with rising inflation. The Senior Citizens League’s annual study of changes in key costs impacting seniors found that Social Security beneficiaries have lost nearly one-third of their buying power since 2000, and they have lost 7 percent just over the past 12 months. Healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket costs loom large, accounting for five of the top 10 items in the study. “Retirees are either spending down their savings to cover the gaps, or simply going without,” said Mary Johnson, the group’s Social Security and Medicare policy consultant. Rising healthcare costs threaten to erode net Social Security benefits dramatically over time, according to Healthview Services, a maker of healthcare cost projection software. A Healthview report issued last week projects that healthcare inflation will rise an average of 5.47 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That is almost triple the recent historical U.S. inflation rate and more than double the annual projected Social Security COLAs. A couple turning 65 this year receiving average Social Security benefits will pay 59 percent of lifetime Social Security benefits for healthcare; the same couple aged 55 this year can expect to pay out 92 percent when they reach Medicare age. The healthcare cost trend underscores the value of working longer. Staying on the job reduces the number of years of Medicare premium payments, and creates opportunities to boost Social Security income - and COLAs - through delayed claiming. A growing number of planning experts also suggest that retirees keep part of their portfolio in stocks well past retirement age to help beat inflation. For workers in high-deductible health plans, health savings accounts (HSAs) offer the opportunity to save tax-free; the dollars can be invested and later spent tax-free to meet health expenses. But for most people, HSA contributions wind up being used to meet current health expenses. But in general, healthcare cost inflation simply underscores the need to boost saving, notes Ron Mastrogiovanni, Healthview’s CEO. “Big numbers scare people, but you can do something about this.” (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

In a survey, 74 percent of Republicans polled said they believed that climate change is happening, but only 66 percent said they believed in global warming. In contrast, 94 percent of Democrats said they believed in both. The reasons why people discredit climate science may be because they do not like the policies being proposed to tackle the problem, said study co-author Jonathon Schuldt, assistant professor of communication at Cornell.  Acknowledging the reality of global warming or climate change may lead to new government regulations on businesses, which goes against core conservative values,  he said.  So, telling a pollster that the phenomenon isn't happening may reflect something about a person's general policy preferences, not just their level of certainty that the global climate is changing.  U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets are less likely to speak about climate change than global warming - which he has described as a hoax. In all, 106 of his tweets mentioned  global warming  and 36 said  climate change , the researchers found.      Our results suggest that Trump's emphasis on 'global warming' may be an effective rhetorical strategy that resonates with his Republican constituents, who express more scepticism in response to that term in particular,  said Schuldt. But the chasm between Republicans and Democrats on climate science might not be as large as it seems, Schuldt added.  If you ask people what they think about climate change - not global warming - we find that the partisan gap shrinks by about 30 percent,  he said.  There's actually more agreement here than we think.  The effect identified by the researchers is especially relevant given Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, said co-author Peter Enns, associate professor of government. Trump's announcement on June 1 that he wished to renegotiate the terms of the landmark 195-nation climate deal was met with dismay by other countries who signed the agreement. Trump has said participating in the accord - which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - would undermine the U.S. economy, wipe out jobs, weaken national sovereignty and put his country at a permanent disadvantage.  The Cornell University research was based on a national probability survey of 1,461 U.S. adults carried out in October last year, and published on Wednesday.

Under current rules, companies are allowed both to advise and sell mutual funds or other investment products only through  separately identifiable departments or divisions , which must maintain an  arms-length relationship  between the two functions. Fees charged for each service must also be clearly separated. But the SEBI on Thursday sought to make that separation more clear, proposing that companies would no longer be able to offer both advisory and distribution services unless they were split into separate subsidiaries, proposing that the division be completed within six months. The SEBI also said those providing investment advice must have proper permission from regulators of the products about which they give advice. The SEBI oversees equities, corporate bonds, and mutual funds, while the central bank oversees trading of currencies and government bonds.  To  prevent the conflict of interest that exists between advising of investment products and selling of investment products by the same entity/person, there should be clear segregation between these two activities,  the SEBI said in a draft proposal. The regulator also said mutual fund distributors - third-party companies hired by asset managers to sell investment products to retail investors - would not be able to offer investment advice beyond explaining the characteristics and  suitability  of schemes. Over the past several years, the SEBI has sought to tighten supervision of the mutual fund industry after the sector suffered from frequent accusations that distributors and asset managers were colluding to sell specific schemes, regardless of whether they actually suited retail investors' needs. The SEBI said market participants needed to submit their responses to the proposals by July 14.

The Debt Management Office (DMO) raised a total of 99.26 billion naira ($315.11 million), less than the 140 billion naira it wanted to raise, as it did not want to pay more for the notes. It sold 4.22 billion naira of the 2021 paper at 16.19 percent, compared with 16.30 percent last month and 30.25 billion naira of the 2027 paper at 16.19 percent against 16.29 percent in May, it said. It also sold 64.79 billion naira of the 2037 paper at 16.19 percent, compared with 16.29 percent last month.  Demand for the five-year bond dropped significantly because of lack of interest in the shorter end of the market, because most investors, especially the pension funds prefer to lock in on the longer tenor paper,  one fixed-income trader told Reuters. He added that the 2037 maturing debt was viewed favourably in light of falling inflation in the West African country. Nigeria's annual inflation eased for the fourth straight month in May, falling to 16.25 percent from 17.24 percent in April, while analysts expect further declines in the consumer price index this month. Traders said tight liquidity reduced the demand for debt at the auction as the central bank sustained its intervention in the foreign exchange market, draining naira cash from the banking system.

Team Principal Dave Brailsford will be hoping for a smooth ride over the three-week race after a rocky year in which he became embroiled in the so-called  jiffy bag saga .

Team Sky and British Cycling have both been subjects of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) into allegations of wrongdoing in the sport. Both denied any doping violations.

With European stock markets down for a third day, investors sought the traditional security of the yen, pushing it around 0.1 percent higher against both the euro and the dollar by afternoon in London. Norway's central bank lifted its rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018 and said a cut in interest rates was no longer likely, pushing the Norwegian crown, also known as the  Nokkie  by traders, half a percent higher against the dollar and the euro. It last stood up 0.4 percent at 8.4987 crowns per dollar and 9.4853 crowns per euro.  It's (the move) is all about the change in their rate path - no longer seeing a possible probability of a rate cut but now moving their rate path unchanged for this year, next year, and then higher in 2019,  said Niels Christensen, currency strategist with Nordea in Copenhagen.  That's obviously a strong signal and the reason why we see a stronger Norwegian crown.  Dealers said  short  bets against the kiwi had been squeezed after the New Zealand central bank sounded several upbeat notes on the outlook for growth and impact of current exchange rates. A number of banks had been calling for more gains for the kiwi around the meeting, arguing that a 3 percent gain since May still leaves it well undervalued compared to long term measures of fair value and others in the commodities currencies bloc more exposed to falling oil prices.  While the RBNZ kept a neutral stance and continued to pledge to keep rates low for a long time, it did not complain strongly about the currency’s recent strength, which caused the New Zealand dollar to rise post the decision,  analysts from Credit Agricole said in a morning note. By 1142 GMT, the kiwi was up 0.4 percent to $0.7245. It was also around 0.5 percent higher against both the Aussie and Canadian dollars - both currencies that tend to be closely dependent on the prices of oil and other major commodities. After a dip in the past week, however, there was little sign of more pain for the group, as Brent crude recovered after falling below $45 a barrel overnight. The Aussie and the Canadian dollar were both 0.2 percent higher against their U.S. counterpart . In an updated outlook for the year ahead published on Thursday, Barclays called for the kiwi to gain almost 5 percent against the Aussie over the next year.  The NZD has performed well despite RBNZ trying to dampen expectations of an early rate rise,  the British bank said.  Strong net permanent and long-term migration is helping to support domestic activity and lift business sentiment, but also... dampening wage pressures.

The authorities and the bank confirmed Edmond de Rothschild had been fined nearly 9 million euros ($10.1 million) for failing to take proper safeguards against money laundering. They did not comment on news reports that the case concerned 1MDB. Paying the fine  marks the end of the proceeding in which it has actively participated , the bank said in a statement, noting the Luxembourg arm had taken measures since the first half of 2016 to strengthen its compliance and risk control procedures. The group installed a new CEO of Edmond de Rothschild (Europe) in Luxembourg last year in a management shake-up. Swiss watchdog FINMA said it was conducting its own enforcement proceedings against the bank to determine whether the group had fulfilled anti-money-laundering standards.  Rothschild is the latest Swiss bank to be swept up in the 1MDB case, which has triggered money-laundering investigations in at least six countries including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chaired 1MDB's advisory board, has denied any wrongdoing. As part of an extensive review into 1MDB-related transactions, Singapore has shut down the local units of Switzerland's BSI Bank and Falcon Bank due to failures of money laundering controls and improper conduct by senior management, frozen millions of dollars and charged several private bankers. The review uncovered a complex web of transactions involving shell companies and individuals operating in many jurisdictions, including the United States, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Malaysia. Singapore's central bank last month fined Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and United Overseas Bank (UOB) a total of S$1.6 million  ($1.15 million) for breaching anti-money laundering rules in transactions related to 1MDB. Last year, it fined DBS (DBSM.SI), UBS (UBSG.S), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and private bank Coutts for breaches of Singapore's anti-money laundering laws in connection to 1MDB transactions. Swiss agency FINMA has already reprimanded Credit Suisse and UBS for dealings surrounding 1MDB.

Foreign ministers and defense officials of the three neighboring countries agreed to work together to share information, track communications and crack down on the flow of arms, fighters and money, amid what experts says is the biggest security threat facing Southeast Asia in decades. Despite signs that the rebels battling government forces in Marawi City were on the back foot, authorities are worried that the fighting - now in its fifth week - might be the beginning of a wave of violence as the ultra-radical Islamic State group tries to establish a foothold. Militants holed up in Marawi were cornered and their firepower was flagging, the military said on Thursday, estimating the number of remaining fighters at just over 100, and all within a 1 square kilometer area. Malaysia Foreign Minister Anifah Aman told the meeting the that extremism needed an immediate response, and constant engagement between the three countries that must be a  cohesive unit .   This is an urgent task that we need to undertake as clearly evidenced through the current situation in Marawi,  he said.  This means our enforcement agencies must constantly engage with one another, not only in intelligence sharing but new active and innovative measures.  Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have launched joint patrols to control militant movements across their archipelagic region. But experts point to how they have previously failed to work together to prevent festering militancy and banditry from worsening, plagued as they are by mistrust, dormant territorial disputes and limited capabilities.  The Philippines in particular is widely seen as the weaker link.  Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Thursday's meeting aimed to revisit existing security programs between the three and draw up a plan to strengthen and implement them. Smoke billows are seen as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over parts of Marawi city, Philippines June 22, 2017.Romeo Ranoco'Looking for Bases' His country was now a clear target for extremists, he said, and the region only needed to look at how quickly Islamic State, or ISIS, managed to recruit fighters and carve out strongholds in Iraq and Syria  These jihadists will be looking for land bases or areas outside Iraq and Syria,  Cayetano told reporters.  Everyone has their vulnerability, no one is perfect. Slideshow (11 Images) If other countries have nationals in Marawi and Mindanao and are extremists, they are as much a threat to their home country as here.  A Philippine officer, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Tampus, said troops were blocking escape routes out of Marawi and rebels were hemmed-in and using civilians dressed in black as human shields.   Our forces are coming from the east and the north and we are blocking the three bridges,  he said. Tampus said the militant snipers were firing from  strategic nests  in schools and mosques, and their bombs were hampering his troops' operations. Malaysia is worried that militants could flee to its eastern state of Sabah.  Malaysia has a wanted list that includes two militants who spearheaded the attempt to capture Marawi. They are a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group, Isnilon Hapilon, who was proclaimed by Islamic State last year as its  emir  of Southeast Asia, and Abdullah Maute, whose followers accounted for a large number of the estimated 400-500 fighters who overran parts of Marawi, killing Christians and taking dozens of civilians hostage. According to official estimates, 369 people have been killed, three-quarters of them militants. The number of security forces and civilians killed stood at 67 and 26, respectively.

The number of suspected cases of the disease, which is caused by ingesting bacteria from water or food contaminated with faeces, reached 179,548 by 20 June, with 1,205 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.  This is because of conflict, it's man-made, it's very severe, the numbers are absolutely staggering, it's getting worse, and the cholera element in addition to the lack of food, the lack of medical supplies, primarily one has to put that at the door of all the parties to the conflict,  O'Brien said.   Be that the parties on the ground or their proxies, they all have to recognize that there is a shared responsibility for causing a man-made humanitarian catastrophe, which is where we are in Yemen at the moment.  A Reuters analysis of WHO data showed the cholera caseload is growing at more than 4 percent a day, while the number of deaths is rising at just over 3.5 percent a day.  That marks a slowdown in the spread of the disease compared to the early stages of the eight-week outbreak, but still puts the number of cases on course to reach 300,000 in the first week of July, while deaths are expected to rise to 2,000.  Stephen O'Brien, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, leaves after a news conference at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland June 22, 2017.Denis BalibouseThat means the disease is spreading twice as quickly as the WHO feared. The WHO's representative in Yemen said on May 19 that the 300,000-mark might come within six months. Yemen's cholera epidemic follows an economic collapse and two years of civil war which has left 19 million people in need of humanitarian aid. FILE PHOTO: Women sit with relatives infected with cholera at a hospital in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen May 14, 2017.Abduljabbar ZeyadThe exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, supported by the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. Nigel Timmins, humanitarian director at aid charity Oxfam, which has called for a  cholera ceasefire , told a U.N. meeting on Wednesday that governments were stoking the war rather than prioritizing the humanitarian crisis.  In Yemen, governments who are providing generous funding are also making money from supplying weapons, munitions, military equipment, technology. They are providing logistical and financial support for the military action taking place,  he said.  Diplomatic pressure on the warring parties inside and outside the country has to be made so that we can find solutions, because surely that is a priority over arms sales?

The authorities and the bank confirmed Edmond de Rothschild had been fined nearly 9 million euros ($10.1 million) for failing to take proper safeguards against money laundering. They did not comment on news reports that the case concerned 1MDB. Paying the fine  marks the end of the proceeding in which it has actively participated , the bank said in a statement, noting the Luxembourg arm had taken measures since the first half of 2016 to strengthen its compliance and risk control procedures. The group installed a new CEO of Edmond de Rothschild (Europe) in Luxembourg last year in a management shake-up. Swiss watchdog FINMA said it was conducting its own enforcement proceedings against the bank to determine whether the group had fulfilled anti-money-laundering standards.  Rothschild is the latest Swiss bank to be swept up in the 1MDB case, which has triggered money-laundering investigations in at least six countries including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chaired 1MDB's advisory board, has denied any wrongdoing. As part of an extensive review into 1MDB-related transactions, Singapore has shut down the local units of Switzerland's BSI Bank and Falcon Bank due to failures of money laundering controls and improper conduct by senior management, frozen millions of dollars and charged several private bankers. The review uncovered a complex web of transactions involving shell companies and individuals operating in many jurisdictions, including the United States, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Malaysia. Singapore's central bank last month fined Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and United Overseas Bank (UOB) a total of S$1.6 million  ($1.15 million) for breaching anti-money laundering rules in transactions related to 1MDB. Last year, it fined DBS (DBSM.SI), UBS (UBSG.S), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and private bank Coutts for breaches of Singapore's anti-money laundering laws in connection to 1MDB transactions. Swiss agency FINMA has already reprimanded Credit Suisse and UBS for dealings surrounding 1MDB.

Shareholders at Masraf Al Rayan, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA and International Bank of Qatar were committed to pushing ahead with the deal despite the current embargo by some of Qatar's Arab neighbours, the sources said.  There is no hesitation. If anything, the situation [the GCC dispute] makes the need for banking sector consolidation more acute,  said one of the sources. None of the banks were available to comment. A shake-up has long been mooted in the Qatari banking sector given that 18 local and international commercial banks serve a population of 2.6 million. The argument for consolidation has become more compelling now that lower oil and gas prices has trimmed state spending, curtailing deposit growth and revenue generation. The more than two-week travel and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt could further dent bank performance if the dispute drags on, say analysts. Masraf Al Rayan, which is the acquiring bank, was holding discussions with the other two lenders to finalise the valuation of the deal, the sources said. Other matters will be agreed by the board of the newly-merged bank including the potential impact on the three banks' existing branch network and staffing, said the soources. In December, Reuters reported that the trio had begun merger talks which, if successful, would create the Gulf state's second-largest bank. The new bank, which would be run in compliance with Islamic banking principles, would have assets worth around 160 billion riyals ($43.6 billion). KPMG is advising Masraf Al Rayan on the merger, the sources said, with Perella Weinberg advising IBQ, the sources said. Credit Suisse was advising Barwa, they added.

The firms include HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International Ltd and Zhejiang Luosen, which was behind the purchase of A.C. Milan football club earlier this year, one of the sources said. Chinese financial journal Caixin reported on the investigation earlier on Thursday. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) made the request as it moves to control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring more global assets. China launched a clampdown on overseas direct investment last year. The sources said the CBRC's communication to the banks was made earlier this month, but Thursday's news of the requests appeared to have battered shares in a handful of listed firms. Shares in Fosun International fell as much as 9.6 percent in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, while shares of HNA Holding Group Co Ltd fell more than 6 percent. Liu Zhiqing, deputy director general of the prudential regulation bureau of the CBRC, declined to comment on the reported communication to banks, but said the regulator does keep an eye on large corporate groups that could pose systemic risks. “Some big companies are indeed the focus of our attention on systemic risks, because a big company has big risk exposure for banks and they could transmit to other companies,  he told journalists on Thursday. Outbound investment by Chinese companies in the first five months of the year dropped 53 percent from a year earlier, according to China's commerce ministry. Overseas deals by Chinese companies hit a record $170.1 billion in 2016. Spokesmen for Anbang and HNA declined comment. A Fosun spokeswoman said:  Everything is going well and normal with Fosun. Thank you for your concern.  Earlier on Thursday, Dalian Wanda Group denied as  malicious speculation  that some Chinese banks had ordered the sale of its bonds. Shares in Wanda Film Holding Co fell 10 percent, before they were suspended from trading in Shenzhen. The shares will resume trading on Friday, the company said. HNA Group, the sprawling aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, has announced more than $50 billion in deals since 2015, including stakes in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Worldwide Hotels Inc.. Dalian Wanda has purchased a slew of movie theatre companies, led by AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, along with buying a controlling stake in U.S. film studio Legendary Entertainment. Earlier this month, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, which made headlines with a $30 billion spate of deals including the 2015 purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, was detained by authorities, according to sources. The company said that its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties.

Clearly visible from Bolivia's capital La Paz, Illimani's  eternal snows  are frequently referenced in the music, mythology and literature of the Aymara people. But scientists say global warming is rapidly melting the glaciers of the Andes, removing an important source of fresh water for many communities and threatening others with deadly avalanches. Illimani itself has warmed by 0.7 degree Centigrade in the last 18 years, said Ice Memory glaciologist Patrick Ginot. The team dug over 130 meters (430 ft) into the glacier to remove 75 ice samples, which they say yield some 18,000 years of climatic history.  As glaciologists, we want to keep this kind of glacier sample because for us it is an encyclopedia of the climate and environment,  Ginot told Reuters on Tuesday.  When you remove a glacier sample, you're perforating through into the world's history.  The French-led Ice Memory organization says its goal is to create a global ice archive sanctuary in Antarctica.

Foreign ministers and defense officials of the three neighboring countries agreed to work together to share information, track communications and crack down on the flow of arms, fighters and money, amid what experts says is the biggest security threat facing Southeast Asia in decades. Despite signs that the rebels battling government forces in Marawi City were on the back foot, authorities are worried that the fighting - now in its fifth week - might be the beginning of a wave of violence as the ultra-radical Islamic State group tries to establish a foothold. Militants holed up in Marawi were cornered and their firepower was flagging, the military said on Thursday, estimating the number of remaining fighters at just over 100, and all within a 1 square kilometer area. Malaysia Foreign Minister Anifah Aman told the meeting the that extremism needed an immediate response, and constant engagement between the three countries that must be a  cohesive unit .   This is an urgent task that we need to undertake as clearly evidenced through the current situation in Marawi,  he said.  This means our enforcement agencies must constantly engage with one another, not only in intelligence sharing but new active and innovative measures.  Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have launched joint patrols to control militant movements across their archipelagic region. But experts point to how they have previously failed to work together to prevent festering militancy and banditry from worsening, plagued as they are by mistrust, dormant territorial disputes and limited capabilities.  The Philippines in particular is widely seen as the weaker link.  Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said Thursday's meeting aimed to revisit existing security programs between the three and draw up a plan to strengthen and implement them. Smoke billows are seen as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over parts of Marawi city, Philippines June 22, 2017.Romeo Ranoco'Looking for Bases' His country was now a clear target for extremists, he said, and the region only needed to look at how quickly Islamic State, or ISIS, managed to recruit fighters and carve out strongholds in Iraq and Syria  These jihadists will be looking for land bases or areas outside Iraq and Syria,  Cayetano told reporters.  Everyone has their vulnerability, no one is perfect. Slideshow (11 Images) If other countries have nationals in Marawi and Mindanao and are extremists, they are as much a threat to their home country as here.  A Philippine officer, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Tampus, said troops were blocking escape routes out of Marawi and rebels were hemmed-in and using civilians dressed in black as human shields.   Our forces are coming from the east and the north and we are blocking the three bridges,  he said. Tampus said the militant snipers were firing from  strategic nests  in schools and mosques, and their bombs were hampering his troops' operations. Malaysia is worried that militants could flee to its eastern state of Sabah.  Malaysia has a wanted list that includes two militants who spearheaded the attempt to capture Marawi. They are a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group, Isnilon Hapilon, who was proclaimed by Islamic State last year as its  emir  of Southeast Asia, and Abdullah Maute, whose followers accounted for a large number of the estimated 400-500 fighters who overran parts of Marawi, killing Christians and taking dozens of civilians hostage. According to official estimates, 369 people have been killed, three-quarters of them militants. The number of security forces and civilians killed stood at 67 and 26, respectively.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of China iron ore imports vs spot price: tmsnrt.rs/2tv98AD By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 22 (Reuters) - Iron ore's demand-driven price surge last year is increasingly looking like an aberration as supply factors once again start to weaken the price outlook. When spot Asian iron ore prices .IO62-CNO=MB jumped 81 percent in 2016, the surprise rally was chalked up to stronger Chinese imports and signs that a market that had been oversupplied for several years was back in balance. China, which buys about two-thirds of seaborne iron ore, certainly did boost imports in 2016, buying more than 1 billion tonnes in a year for the first time, with overseas purchases of the steel-making ingredient rising 7.5 percent. There has been little let up in the pace this year, with imports from January to May jumping 7.9 percent from the same period in 2016 to 444.6 million tonnes, putting them on track for an annual increase of about 65 million tonnes. Imports look set to remain robust in June as well, with ship and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts pointing to arrivals of 93 million tonnes. This number was filtered to show only vessels that have already discharged cargoes or are underway, and may be revised higher as late cargoes get added. Overall, the picture shows that China's appetite for imported iron ore remains strong, meaning the price decline so far this year isn't driven by weakening demand. The spot price .IO62-CNO=MB ended at $56.82 a tonne on Wednesday, down 28 percent from the start of the year and 40 percent from a peak of $94.86 on Feb. 21. Chinese domestic iron ore futures have fared some better, with Dalian Commodity Exchange contracts slipping 8.1 percent so far this year to Wednesday's close of 426 yuan ($62.37) a tonne, and down 33 percent from their Feb. 21 peak. Steel, Iron Ore Tread Different Paths In contrast, benchmark Chinese steel futures, the Shanghai rebar contract, have gained 15.1 percent since the end of last year to Wednesday's close of 3,060 yuan a tonne. This divergence between Chinese steel and iron ore prices is a marked change from last year, when they rallied in tandem, with rebar gaining 96 percent to spot iron ore's 81 percent. China's steel market appears relatively robust currently, with output in May rising 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 72.26 million tonnes, just below April's monthly record of 72.78 million tonnes. In the first five months of 2017, production was 346.8 million tonnes, up 4.4 percent from the same period last year, according to official figures. Higher steel output is a response to solid margins for steelmakers, which are being supported by ongoing capacity cuts and a still reasonable outlook for construction and manufacturing. It's mainly low-quality furnaces that are being targeted for closure by Chinese authorities as part of plans to shut at least 50 million tonnes of capacity this year, which follows on from 65 million tonnes idled last year. Assuming the demand outlook for steel doesn't deteriorate too much in the second half of the year, the capacity closures should help keep steel mills profitable and support prices. But for iron ore the arrival of additional tonnes on the seaborne market from expansion projects by Brazil's Vale and the new Roy Hill mine in Western Australia will keep the market's focus on supply. Citi analysts said in a report received this week that the seaborne market could be oversupplied by 100 million tonnes in 2017, leading them to cut their average price forecast for this year to $61 a tonne from $70 previously. Once again, it appears that the iron ore market is going to play the game of who can survive lower prices the longest. While low-cost major miners such as Vale and Anglo-Australian pair Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are best-placed, smaller Australian players and producers in minor exporters like Ukraine and Canada will struggle to hold on.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-ironore-idUSL3N1JJ2HT"},

The EU will abolish its production and export quotas on Sept. 30, which has encouraged sugar companies in the bloc to raise production from next season by what analysts have estimated will be around 15 percent in total. That has fueled a glut in sugar that sent prices to 16-month lows on Thursday.  We already do a third of our sales in emerging countries. Only that share can rise over time, structurally, because this is where the market is expanding,  Tereos CEO Alexis Duval told Reuters in an interview. For now, forecasters expect the EU to produce 18.3 million tonnes of sugar in 2017/18, with exports of 2.7 million tonnes. Part of the extra output will replace what the EU currently imports, but Tereos will also need to find new export markets to sell the 25 percent rise in sugar output the group expects in France this year after producing 2.5 million tonnes in 2016, Duval said.  In Europe sales can increase through consolidation but the market is not growing organically,  Duval said. More health-conscious consumers in developed countries have lowered their sugar consumption in the past years.  Analyst group Platts Kingsman says world consumption may grow at its slowest pace in seven years in 2017/18 with a rise of 1.04 percent, nearly half the average growth of about 2 percent per year over the last decade. Tereos is not alone in chasing overseas growth.  Germany's second-largest sugar refiner Nordzucker said last month it is in talks on international expansion in South America, Asia and also within Europe. Meanwhile, a revival in Ukrainian sugar exports could pose a challenge for western European sugar exporters. Tereos Commodities To boost exports further, Tereos has opened six trading desks through its Tereos Commodities unit, of which two were started last year, in New Delhi and Nairobi.  Other desks are in France, Brazil, Switzerland and Singapore.  Tereos Commodities traded over 1 million tonnes of sugar in the fiscal year to March 31 with a total revenue of $500 million. A large part of that came from Brazil where Tereos exports half of its output, which came to 1.6 million tonnes last year. Duval pointed to Nigeria, India, Indonesia, West and East Africa and South-east Asia as key growth markets for global sugar producers.  Every day world (sugar) consumption is shifting a bit more toward emerging countries. When we look at consumption growth it's +2.5 percent per year in emerging countries and zero in developed countries,  Duval said.   The difficulty for a producer is more and more, how do I make the link between my field in Europe or Brazil and the final consumer who is far from it,  he added. Tereos also aims to expand output and exports of grain-based protein, a by-product of its starch activities, increasingly used in bakery, aquaculture and pet food products, Duval said. After two difficult years due to weak sugar prices, Tereos posted a 14.7 percent rise in sales to 4.8 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in the 2016/17 fiscal year to March 31, mainly helped by a rebound in sugar prices and an expansion in its international trading. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rose 38 percent to 607 million euros, also pulled up by its sugar cane and starch businesses.  Despite the recent fall in prices, Tereos expects earnings to rise slightly in the 2017/18 fiscal year, due to higher European output and good competitiveness. Duval also expected a rebound in sugar prices after the recent slump although declined to give a forecast.  Our point of view is that the correction is normal in terms of fundamentals but excessive because of the funds who amplify moves,  Duval said, noting that some were now short and would have to come back into the market to cover their positions.

The firm, whose defective air-bag inflators have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 150 injuries worldwide, will file for protection in Tokyo District Court under the Civil Rehabilitation Act, Japan's version of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, said the sources, one of whom has direct knowledge of the matter and one who was briefed on the process. Takata will then seek bridge loans from the core banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, which will provide tens of billions of yen (hundreds of millions of dollars) in bridge loans, one source said. Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa said nothing had been decided regarding any filing or financing. Shares in Takata changed hands for the first time since sources said last week that the struggling airbag maker was preparing to file for bankruptcy. By mid-afternoon shares had more than halved in value to 116 yen, eroding Takata's market capitalisation by about 75 percent from a week ago to nearly $86 million now. Any filing would coincide with a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc. Key is expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy, a source told Reuters. Takata would stop making air-bag inflators after completing a global recall as part of the restructuring plan with Key, separate sources said. Takata plans to begin bankruptcy proceedings in both the United States and Japan, sources have said. Such moves would culminate a long, tumultuous fall for the family-controlled company that grew to become a global supplier to most of the world's major automakers. $1 = $1.0000 Reporting by Taro Fuse and Maki Shiraki","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/takata-bankruptcy-idUSL1N1JJ0FP"},

A case for damages from the carrier was brought by 83-year-old Renee Rabinowitz, who was asked by a flight attendant, after boarding a flight from Newark to Tel Aviv in 2015, if she would agree to move. The airline has said it tries to accommodate ultra-Orthodox men, who cite religious beliefs in seeking to avoid close proximity to women other than their wives, but never pressures female passengers to accede to a seat swap request. Rabinowitz did agree to move to another seat but later sued El Al, arguing she had felt  deep humiliation , the Israel Religious Center, which represented her, said in a statement. The group, which is the legal advocacy arm of the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism, said a Jerusalem court ruled on Wednesday that asking women to change seats at the request of ultra-Orthodox passengers violated anti-discrimination laws. The court ordered El Al to issue a written directive to its staff that such requests are illegal. It awarded Rabinowitz, a Holocaust survivor, 6,500 shekels ($1,800) in damages.  I feel good about the fact that (El Al) will now be required to tell ... haredim (ultra-Orthodox men) who want women to move, that they can't do it, that El Al flight attendants can't do it,  Rabinowitz said on Israel Radio. Incidents in which flights on El Al and several non-Israeli airlines have been delayed on the tarmac over the refusal of some ultra-Orthodox men to sit next to women have drawn media attention in recent years.

The industrial solutions unit is suffering from low oil prices that have discouraged investments in new plants. It has also missed out on a large Australian submarine order and is already undergoing an extensive reorganization. The business got a new chief executive in May after the previous incumbent stepped down after accepting an inappropriate gift from a business partner.  In addition to the measures already initiated, cost cuts are planned in a triple-digit million euro range,  a spokesman said on Thursday, confirming an earlier report in Germany's Manager Magazin. He did not give a specific figure.  The positive effects of the changes already initiated will only become visible after a time lag due to the long-term nature of plant engineering projects,  he said.  The new cost cuts will come on top of 450 million euros  ($502 million) over a three-year period that were announced in December, the spokesman said. Thyssenkrupp shares jumped to a two-year high and were trading up 2.7 percent at 24.84 euros by 1120 GMT, at the top of a flat German blue-chip index .GDAXI.  The unit, whose revenues of 5.74 billion euros were about 15 percent of the group's last fiscal year, is Thyssenkrupp's second-most profitable after elevators - ahead of the steel business from which it is trying to distance itself. Thyssenkrupp has been trying to put its steel business into a joint venture with Tata Steel's (TISC.NS) British and Dutch activities for over a year but negotiations have been hampered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Industrial Solutions reported its highest order intake in three years last quarter, and an operating profit margin of 1.8 percent, compared with 5.8 percent last fiscal year and its long-term target of 6-7 percent.

Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients' income, a  major improvement  from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid.  There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,  Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN.  People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.  Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was  every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House.  President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          Republican Concern Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party's leaders prepare to unveil it. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017.Joshua RobertsRepublican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes.  I'd find it hard to believe we'll have enough time,  he said, adding that if he did not get enough information,  I won't be voting yes.  Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.  Slideshow (8 Images)Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a  really good  bill.  I’ve been talking about a plan with heart,  Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation  mean,  according to congressional sources. Party Tensions Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid's growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025.  That's what we're told it might be,  said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare  for a couple of years.  Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.   The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,  she said.  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO.

Canakinumab, already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions, was also found to reduce further heart attacks or strokes, when used with current therapies, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday, boosting its share price. The drug targets inflammatory atherosclerosis, where inflammation aggravates risks posed by clogged arteries. Industry analysts said Thursday's announcement was unexpected, in part because GlaxoSmithKline's pursuit of anti-inflammatory approaches to heart risks with its experimental darapladib failed in 2013. Consequently, cholesterol-lowering strategies have remained the mainstay. Baader Helvea analyst Bruno Bulica said Novartis's findings were  a ground-breaking discovery likely to transform the therapeutic paradigm . The result also boosts market confidence in Novartis's ability to revive sales growth from 2018. Novartis shares rose more than 3 percent as the company said it would initiate discussions with regulatory authorities over approval.  Novartis hopes to present trial data at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in late August.  Sales estimates for Ilaris are going to have to be raised considerably,  said Michael Nawrath, a Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst. Bank Vontobel raised its estimate for the drug's chances of eventually hitting $2 billion in peak sales to 60 percent, up from 30 percent. Because canakinumab works differently than existing drugs given after a heart attack, such as cholesterol-lowering statins or blood-thinners, it could be given on top of standard medicines. Still, uncertainties linger about its clinical profile, pending presentation of full data, as well as the potential response from customers. With Entresto, for instance, the heart failure drug that Novartis launched in 2015, uptake was initially sluggish despite stellar trial findings, amid resistance over the price of the drug and doctors' reluctance to switch patients who were stable on older drugs. Heart Powerhouse  Combined, canakinumab and Entresto could help rejuvenate Novartis's leadership on heart disease, a role it relinquished after its blockbuster Diovan lost patent protection in 2012. As a new injection, canakinumab will be much more expensive than generic cholesterol and blood-thinning pills, and the recent record with the new class of PCSK9 cholesterol injections from companies including Amgen and Sanofi suggests high prices can hinder uptake.  We need to be careful before becoming too enthusiastic,  Deutsche Bank's Tim Race said.  Canakinumab is an expensive injection and faces uptake hurdles.   Ilaris costs some $200,000 annually for treating rare diseases, according to Bernstein's Tim Anderson. But even at $15,000 per year -- the ballpark for PCSK9 cholesterol injections -- its potential for some 4 million eligible heart patients could still be substantial.  The bottom line is that this could end up becoming a multi-billion dollar product,  Anderson said. The heart drug news comes just two days after Novartis reported positive results with another experimental drug for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss.

Details such as the frequency of ads, how much money was spent on them, where they were seen, what the messages were and how many people were reached would remain confidential under the company's corporate policy, which is the same for political advertising as for commercial customers.  Advertisers consider their ad creatives and their ad targeting strategy to be competitively sensitive and confidential,  Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about political ads.   In many cases, they'll ask us, as a condition of running ads on Facebook, not to disclose those details about how they're running campaigns on our service,  he said.  From our perspective, it's confidential information of these advertisers.   Sherman said it would not make an exception for political advertising.  We try to have consistent policies across the board, so that we're imposing similar requirements on everybody.   Academics who study political campaigns worldwide said this kind of information fosters accountability by analyzing how candidates compete for votes and whether election systems live up to expectations of fairness. Transparency can also deter fraudulent ads, they said.   We don't have the capacity right now to track it, and nobody does, as far as we can tell,  said Bowdoin College professor Michael Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which catalogs political ads on traditional television but has no means of doing so on Facebook. Television has been the backbone of political advertising  for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of ads. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets.  Online advertising, though, often targets narrow, more carefully constructed audiences, so for example an ad could be directed only to Democrats under 25 years of age.  Thousands of variations of online ads can be directed at select groups and the targeting can be extreme. Academics argue this is where the process can become very opaque.  Candidates can speak out of both sides of their mouths,  said Daniel Kreiss, a communications professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Having some kind of digital repository of ads that are purchased during a particular cycle and linked to a particular source is a good, democratic thing for the public.  No such repository exists, and the quandary for researchers is expected to worsen as more politicians use digital advertising because of its relatively low cost and opportunities for target marketing.  According to U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, $70 million was spent for its ads on Facebook, more than on any other digital platform including Google (GOOGL.O), and Trump has credited Facebook with helping him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton last November.  Advertising on Facebook also figured prominently in recent elections in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, researchers said.  Britain is investigating how candidates use data to target voters. Facebook ads generally disappear with the scroll of a thumb on a smartphone, and they have no permanent links. Advocates for transparency call them  dark ads.  Facebook calls them  unpublished posts.   Researchers said that disclosure reports from the U.S. Federal Election Commission are unhelpful because they show what campaigns pay to intermediaries, not to internet platforms.  The role of advertising online is as important to study as the effect of so-called  fake news,  which has received more attention than ads, scholars said.   The holy grail, I think, of political analysis for the 2016 election is to figure out which communications from which entities had an effect on which jurisdictions in the United States,  said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University professor who writes about elections.  Facebook has such information and should make it available for study, Persily said.  Facebook's Sherman said the company was open to hearing research proposals, but he doubted much could be achieved.  Even if we were able to be more transparent in this area, it would only be a very small piece of an overall story,  he said.

Egypt's economy has been struggling since a 2011 uprising drove foreign investors and tourists away. The government is hoping a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending program signed last year will put it on the road to recovery, together with a rebound in investment. Investors have been keen to see the executive regulations in the new investment law, which provide details on what types of projects and investment will be eligible for tax breaks and how the investment process will be streamlined. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on June 1 ratified the long-delayed investment law, which provides a raft of incentives like tax breaks and rebates while reducing red tape for new projects. Nasr said the related regulations were submitted to the cabinet on Wednesday for the prime minister's approval, which is required within 90 days of the initial law's ratification. She sees the investor-friendly law along with the IMF program as boosting foreign direct investment for the 2017-18 fiscal year starting in July past an initial $10 billion target.  Within the last 4 months (ending in May) we already achieved $6.8 billion and based on that I am projecting that we go beyond the initial target,  Nasr said from her downtown office. Investment and International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr talks during an interview with Reuters in Cairo, Egypt June 21, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyExecutive Regulations The executive regulations are likely to take an expansive view on what qualifies as new investment, opening up tax breaks to a broad range of investors, not just those establishing entirely new projects, said Nasr. Investment and International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr talks during an interview with Reuters in Cairo, Egypt June 21, 2017.Mohamed Abd El Ghany The general consensus is that if it is really a new production line, that entails new land, new business, new recruitment and staffing. The majority are labeling that as new investment and it will be eligible,  Nasr said. The initial investment law stipulates investors get back half of what they pay to acquire land for industrial projects if production begins within two years, and provides a 50 percent tax discount on investments made in underdeveloped areas. The executive regulations will for the first time stipulate a specific number of days that the government will have to approve new licenses and clearances, said Nasr, reducing the waiting time for starting new businesses. By the end of 2017, Egypt will also launch an electronic investor map, which will provide detailed information on what incentives and resources are available to investors based on what part of the country they plan to establish their investment project in, said Nasr.  (Investors) want to look at a comprehensive map where they see different opportunities and can compare if it's worth it to invest in Upper Egypt, what are the incentives provided and what is the proximity to the nearest port,  she said.

The airline has said it tries to accommodate ultra-Orthodox men, who cite religious beliefs in seeking to avoid close proximity to women other than their wives, but never pressures female passengers to accede to a seat swap request. Rabinowitz did agree to move to another seat but later sued El Al, arguing she had felt  deep humiliation , the Israel Religious Center, which represented her, said in a statement. The group, which is the legal advocacy arm of the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism, said a Jerusalem court ruled on Wednesday that asking women to change seats at the request of ultra-Orthodox passengers violated anti-discrimination laws.

By Peter Szekely NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City agreed on Wednesday to create a new position with a watchdog agency that hears complaints against the police as part of a settlement with retired tennis star James Blake, who was roughed up by a plainclothes officer in 2015. Instead of a monetary award, the settlement creates a fellowship in Blake's name with the Civilian Complaint Review Board to help people with complaints against the police. The fellowship will augment the existing procedure for complaints.  It has been my intention since Day One to turn a negative situation into a positive and I think this fellowship accomplishes that goal,  Blake, 37, said in a joint statement with the city announcing the agreement.  Transparency and accountability are critical to further strengthening the bonds between law enforcement officials and the communities they serve,  added Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY SportsBlake, who was the No. 4 ranked tennis player in the world in 2006, was waiting for a car outside a Manhattan hotel to take him to the U.S. Open on Sept. 9, 2015, when Officer James Frascatore tackled him without provocation or warning in what police said was a case of mistaken identity. Blake was bodyslammed, handcuffed and led away in an incident recorded by a security video camera and widely circulated, sparking outrage at a time of rising tension nationwide over police relations with minorities. Blake has a black father and a white mother, while Frascatore is white. Police said Blake had been mistakenly identified by a cooperating witness as a suspect in a fraud ring. The newly created Blake fellowship, which will begin in January and is funded for six years, will be awarded to lawyers who would rotate out of the position every two years and receive a minimum annual salary of $65,000, a spokesman for the city's Law Department said. Under the settlement, the city also will reimburse Blake for attorney fees and travel costs totaling nearly $175,000, the spokesman said. In return, Blake is withdrawing a notice of claim, an advisory of a probable lawsuit, which his lawyer filed shortly after the incident, the spokesman said. Three days after the incident, Blake told CNN that Frascatore should be fired for abusing his power. Frascatore is still with the New York Police Department.

Canakinumab, already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions, was also found to reduce further heart attacks or strokes, when used with current therapies, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday, boosting its share price. The drug targets inflammatory atherosclerosis, where inflammation aggravates risks posed by clogged arteries. Industry analysts said Thursday's announcement was unexpected, in part because GlaxoSmithKline's pursuit of anti-inflammatory approaches to heart risks with its experimental darapladib failed in 2013. Consequently, cholesterol-lowering strategies have remained the mainstay. Baader Helvea analyst Bruno Bulica said Novartis's findings were  a ground-breaking discovery likely to transform the therapeutic paradigm . The result also boosts market confidence in Novartis's ability to revive sales growth from 2018. Novartis shares rose more than 3 percent as the company said it would initiate discussions with regulatory authorities over approval.  Novartis hopes to present trial data at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in late August.  Sales estimates for Ilaris are going to have to be raised considerably,  said Michael Nawrath, a Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst. Bank Vontobel raised its estimate for the drug's chances of eventually hitting $2 billion in peak sales to 60 percent, up from 30 percent. Because canakinumab works differently than existing drugs given after a heart attack, such as cholesterol-lowering statins or blood-thinners, it could be given on top of standard medicines. Still, uncertainties linger about its clinical profile, pending presentation of full data, as well as the potential response from customers. With Entresto, for instance, the heart failure drug that Novartis launched in 2015, uptake was initially sluggish despite stellar trial findings, amid resistance over the price of the drug and doctors' reluctance to switch patients who were stable on older drugs. Heart Powerhouse  Combined, canakinumab and Entresto could help rejuvenate Novartis's leadership on heart disease, a role it relinquished after its blockbuster Diovan lost patent protection in 2012. As a new injection, canakinumab will be much more expensive than generic cholesterol and blood-thinning pills, and the recent record with the new class of PCSK9 cholesterol injections from companies including Amgen and Sanofi suggests high prices can hinder uptake.  We need to be careful before becoming too enthusiastic,  Deutsche Bank's Tim Race said.  Canakinumab is an expensive injection and faces uptake hurdles.   Ilaris costs some $200,000 annually for treating rare diseases, according to Bernstein's Tim Anderson. But even at $15,000 per year -- the ballpark for PCSK9 cholesterol injections -- its potential for some 4 million eligible heart patients could still be substantial.  The bottom line is that this could end up becoming a multi-billion dollar product,  Anderson said. The heart drug news comes just two days after Novartis reported positive results with another experimental drug for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss.

Mark Schneider, who took charge of the maker of KitKat chocolate and Nescafe coffee in January, admitted at the annual meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) that the world had changed dramatically over the past 30 years, with the anti-globalisation movement and the financial crisis eroding trust in big brands.  For global brands, there is an extra mile we have to go to win that confidence,  Schneider said.  Local brands, local products automatically have a headstart,  he added.  Consumers are getting more and more interested in how a product is actually made ... that requires a whole lot of transparency,  he told the meeting, which brings together the world's biggest retailers and packaged food companies. A survey by KPMG and the CGF released this week found that three quarters of consumer and retail executives cited consumer trust and loyalty as  very to critically important  to their near-term success. Schneider said smaller brands were benefiting from fact they can now communicate with consumers directly via social media and sell their products online, bypassing retailers.  The barrier to entry ... has all but disappeared,  he said.  This is what gets small businesses started.  Big consumer goods firms have responded by snapping up some niche brands, particularly in the drinks sector, with Diageo Plc saying on Wednesday it will buy George Clooney's high-end tequila brand Casamigos for up to $1 billion. In February, Schneider scrapped Nestle's long-standing sales target as it reported disappointing annual results, echoing rivals by striking a cautious tone in an uncertain environment. Schneider said on Thursday the rise of niche products, as well as deflation and stagnant growth in western Europe and Japan, had prompted some consumer goods companies to respond with radical cost-cutting.  We don't believe in that model. We don't believe it is proven in its long-term viability,  he said.  Strong brands either grow or die and we are committed to grow.

Mytaxi Chief Executive Andrew Pinnington said the company was paying an “eight figure” sum to buy Romanian market leader Clever Taxi, which operates in 20 cities across the country.  Earlier this year, Hamburg-based mytaxi bought Greece’s Taxibeat, and Pinnington said he expected more acquisitions to help to expand the service in Eastern Europe. “The major driving factor is strategic, to grab market share and extend into more geographic territories,” he said in a telephone interview. The growth of ride-hailing services and the prospect of driverless vehicles has led to predictions that people will switch to paying for individual journeys rather than buying their own cars. My Taxi logo are displayed on the smarphone and display in this illustration taken June 22, 2017.Dado RuvicTo ensure they do not become providers of low-margin commoditized hardware to companies like Uber in the future, Stuttgart-based Daimler and rivals are investing in ride-hailing app companies like mytaxi, Lyft, Grab, Gett and others which connect drivers and passengers. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has taken a $300 million stake in Gett and General Motors (GM.N) invested $500 million in Lyft. Like Uber, mytaxi links drivers with passengers in return for a share of the fare paid. But mytaxi focuses on metered taxis, while Uber relies on unmetered cars and drivers who are not formally registered as taxi drivers.  Uber’s approach allows it to charge lower fares but has led to frequent battles with local and national authorities, especially in Europe where the taxi market is heavily regulated. Restrictions on its service have prompted it to pull back from some markets and led some analysts to question the sustainability of its model in continental Europe. Pinnington said mytaxi’s model was to offer its service within the existing regulatory framework, and to charge a lower commission to drivers – around half the 20-25 percent Uber takes.

A 31 percent average fee hike in January 2015 is cited by metal industry sources as a major reason behind tumbling LME volumes. Three metal industry sources said cutting the fees would be the result of a discussion paper on market structure launched by the exchange in April. Responses are due by the end of June. The LME said it would be inappropriate to second guess the outcomes of the discussion paper when asked about any move to cut fees, but said that it would take  the necessary steps to protect and grow the market . Fee cuts will be targeted at carry trades -- buying and selling for random dates that don't match contract dates -- where volumes have been hit the worst.  We've been told there's a 180-degree turn coming on carry fees. It's classic textbook, you have a new chief executive who kitchen sinks the numbers and blames his predecessor,  a senior broking source told Reuters.  They could do a complete U-turn, but it's unlikely. Flagging it as temporary would mean they don't need to do the 'revenue-neutral' thing,  the source said. Matt Chamberlain took over as CEO in April from Garry Jones who, sources say, raised fees at a time when economic slowdown in China, the world's largest consumer of industrial metals, was starting to hurt brokers' and the LME's volumes and revenues. Chamberlain recently told Reuters any fee cuts could be  revenue-neutral  in that they could be offset by rises elsewhere so the LME's income remained intact.   OTC is cheaper, I can't see that business going back, but (fee cuts) might stop more going off-exchange,  one head of a metals brokerage said.  The board will need to ok it.  One source at a resources focused fund said Charles Li, chief executive of parent company Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, might resist any moves to lower fees as the LME makes a significant contribution to its revenues.  Limiting it to three or six months might make it easier for Charles Li to accept,  the fund source said. Carry trades overall cost 90 U.S. cents per leg, per lot, per side. Within that category are short-dates -- deals between tomorrow and 15 days -- where fees were cut last year to 50 cents per leg, per lot, per side. But volumes are still sliding. Overall volumes in the five months to the end of May fell more than 5 percent from the same period last year. The annual drop last year was 7.7 percent.   The damage to carry volumes can be seen in aluminum, where falling stocks due to reforms aimed at cutting queues to get metal out of LME approved warehouses exacerbated the problem. Volumes for aluminum tom/next trades -- used to roll positions forward on a daily basis -- have crashed 40 percent since the final quarter of 2014 to just below 250,000 lots or 6.25 million tonnes in the first quarter of this year.  They will cut fees for all carries. If volumes improve, they won't need to raise fees elsewhere because income will improve too,  a source at a commodity trader said.  There's not much detail about the new exchange, but it could be a prod.  A new company, NFEx Markets, plans to launch a base metals trading platform in the first quarter of next year. Its contracts will mimic LME contracts.

The issue ratings on Egypt's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds are also affirmed at 'B'. The Country Ceiling and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs are all affirmed at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Egypt's ratings balance a large fiscal deficit, a high general government debt/GDP ratio, and recent volatile political history, with renewed progress in implementing an economic and fiscal reform programme and improving external finances. The government has pressed on with its reform programme, which regained momentum in the second half of 2016, and remains on track with the USD12 billion three-year extended fund facility (EFF) signed with the IMF in November. In May 2017 the IMF and Egypt completed the first review of the EFF, which should lead to the second disbursement, of USD1.25 billion, in June or July. After the floatation of the EGP on 3 November, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) seems not to have intervened in the market and the authorities have been gradually removing a number of capital controls. The subsequent depreciation was the second-largest among Fitch-rated sovereigns in 2016. The pound, which was managed at EGP8.9:USD1 prior to 3 November, has averaged EGP17.9:USD1 since (up to 16 June 2017). The shift in exchange rate regime has proved a turning point for Egypt's external finances. CBE's stock of international reserves rose to USD31.1 billion in May 2017, from USD19.1 billion in October 2016 (and a recent low of USD15.6 billion in July 2016). Multilateral and bilateral assistance and substantial bond issuance have boosted reserves. Egypt issued USD4 billion of Eurobonds in January and another USD3 billion in May. There has been a renewal of foreign investment in government T-bills and T-bonds. Furthermore, there are some early signs of external rebalancing, with the current account deficit narrowing to USD3.5 billion in 1Q17, from USD5.7 billion in 1Q16. We estimate that current foreign reserves are now around six months of current external payments (CXP), up from less than three months during the period of 2012-15. The public finances will remain a key weakness of Egypt's credit profile, but we expect further gradual fiscal consolidation to start to reduce government debt/GDP in the fiscal year ending June 2018 (FY18). In the first nine months of FY17 the budget sector deficit narrowed to 8% of GDP from 9.4% in the year-earlier period. The primary deficit more than halved to 1.2% of GDP. The government has exercised restraint across some expenditure items, notably compensation for public sector employees, which only edged up in July-March, thus representing a large cut in real terms. The introduction of VAT (replacing the existing GST) in October 2016 has had a positive effect on revenue growth. In July-March VAT revenue from goods and services was 30% higher yoy, of which VAT from goods was 62% higher, because Egypt had a better administrative system in place for implementing the tax on goods. Subsidy spending, however, continued to rise strongly, by around 30% yoy, despite electricity and fuel price reforms, because the weakening of the EGP increased import costs. The IMF has commended the draft FY18 budget, which is targeting a budget sector deficit of 9% of GDP and a primary surplus of 0.3% of GDP. Budget sector primary deficits have averaged 3.6% in FY11 to FY17, so to reach a surplus would be a significant achievement. We forecast the budget sector primary balance will get close to balance, at -0.3% of GDP. VAT implementation should improve further in FY18, when it will also have a full-year effect and the rate will increase to 14% from 13%. While the government's budget assumptions are largely realistic, the projected inflation rate of 15.2% is likely to prove too low. FY18 inflation may be closer to 20%. In this context, there may be pressure to boost some expenditure items, to mitigate the risk of greater social tensions. This could lead to a larger-than-projected budget deficit. There is also uncertainty over the timing and extent of further energy price reforms, which have yet to be publicly announced. We forecast that general government debt/GDP will rise above 100% by end-FY17, owing to significant additions of external debt and the weaker exchange rate. This debt stock creates a large burden of interest payments for the government (more than 40% of government revenue). We forecast that government debt/GDP will moderate to 93% in FY18 and 87.9% in FY19, assuming faster real GDP growth (averaging 5%), declining but still high inflation, and a small primary surplus in FY19. The key risk to this outlook is that reform momentum weakens, as it did after a round of reforms in FY15. The level of guaranteed debt and contingent liabilities is currently unclear. The Ministry of Finance expects to release data on this later in 2017. Monetary and fiscal reforms are having a significant macroeconomic impact in Egypt, especially on inflation. Inflation has averaged 30% yoy in January-May, driven up by the weaker exchange rate, VAT and higher fuel prices. We forecast that inflation will remain above 20% for the remainder of 2017 and fall back to an average of 13.5% in 2018. CBE is pursuing monetary targeting, which is subject to indicative targets as agreed with the IMF, and has continued to raise its policy interest rates, most recently in May 2017. Headline real GDP growth has slowed in FY17, but has proved more resilient than we expected and is likely to be just under 4% for the year. Despite fiscal consolidation, we forecast stronger GDP growth in FY18, at 4.5%, as the exchange rate adjustment beds in, as gas production starts at the giant Zohr field, and with stronger investment. Fiscal and monetary reforms continue to present some risk of social backlash, especially given ongoing structural problems including high youth unemployment, deficiencies in governance and the business environment, as well as intermittent security issues. The government is seeking to mitigate these risks by emphasising that it is bolstering social safety nets (including cash transfer schemes) and that the reforms will deliver better economic performance and employment. Furthermore, food subsidy allocations have increased and electricity provision has improved markedly. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Egypt a score equivalent to a rating of 'B' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee did not adjust the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to the ratings are currently balanced. The main factors that, individually or collectively, could lead to a positive action are: - Continued progress on fiscal consolidation leading to declining government debt/GDP; - Sustained stronger economic growth supported by reforms to the business environment leading to increased investment and employment; - Further strengthening of international reserves following a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit and higher net foreign direct investments. The main factors that, individually or collectively, could lead to a negative rating action are: - Failure to narrow the fiscal deficit and put government debt/GDP on a downward trend; - Reversal of fiscal and/or monetary reforms, for example in the face of social unrest; - Renewed downward pressure on international reserves due to further strains on the balance of payments, including weaker access to foreign financing. KEY ASSUMPTIONS The political environment is assumed to be more stable than in 2011-2013, although sporadic, and at times serious, attacks on security forces are assumed to continue and underlying political and social tensions will remain.

The source gave no further details about the meeting, which comes a day after Bach announced a new IOC sponsorship deal with chipmaker Intel Corp in New York that is set to run until 2024. Trump has publicly backed the Los Angeles 2024 Games bid but has so far had no active involvement in the campaign. LA 2024 bid chief Casey Wasserman said last month Trump had given strong support to the West Coast city in its efforts to secure the Games.  Donald Trump has done everything we could have asked to support our bid,  entertainment executive Wasserman said in May.  Every letter, every phone call ... to President Bach... from what we need from the federal government, he's been all I would hope for.  Trump's predecessor Barack Obama did not meet the IOC at the White House but travelled to the IOC session in Copenhagen in 2009 to back Chicago's 2016 Games bid. However, Chicago crashed out in the first round, with U.S.-IOC ties strained at the time over revenue-sharing deals from sponsorship and broadcasting rights. The IOC has said it is planning to award both the 2024 and the 2028 Games at its session in September in Lima, Peru, and that Paris and Los Angeles are likely to share them among themselves. Earlier this month the IOC passed a recommendation for a double awarding, which will now be ratified in a July session with the final order to be decided in Lima. Los Angeles bid officials have repeatedly signalled that the city would be open to being awarded the 2028 Olympics instead of those four years earlier. Paris has insisted its bid plan could only work for 2024. With the double awarding the IOC is trying to keep both cities happy as four others dropped out of the race, concerned by the event's size and cost. More cities had dropped out of the race for the 2022. The IOC has now launched a reform process for bidding in order to make the Games a more attractive prospect to potential host cities.

Iranian domestic carrier Zagros Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to buy 20 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo jets and eight A330neo aircraft, while privatized Iran Airtour signed an MoU for 45 A320neos. Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the country were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. IranAir has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) and 20 ATR turboprops but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing.  Boeing has also signed a deal for 30 737 MAX jets with Iran's Aseman Airlines, which is managed as a private company and owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Iran Airtour was established as a subsidiary of IranAir and privatized in 2011 but maintains a status as subsidiary of the national flag carrier, according to CAPA aviation consultancy. Zagros Airlines is a private carrier.  Airbus Chief Operating Officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said he did not believe the deals were related to political issues. The company said the MoUs were contingent upon all necessary approvals, including from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he expected the U.S. approvals within the next couple of months.  Airbus said it would continue to act in full compliance with the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, and associated rules.

The source gave no further details about the meeting, which comes a day after Bach announced a new IOC sponsorship deal with chipmaker Intel Corp in New York that is set to run until 2024. Trump has publicly backed the Los Angeles 2024 Games bid but has so far had no active involvement in the campaign. LA 2024 bid chief Casey Wasserman said last month Trump had given strong support to the West Coast city in its efforts to secure the Games.  Donald Trump has done everything we could have asked to support our bid,  entertainment executive Wasserman said in May.  Every letter, every phone call ... to President Bach... from what we need from the federal government, he's been all I would hope for.  Trump's predecessor Barack Obama did not meet the IOC at the White House but travelled to the IOC session in Copenhagen in 2009 to back Chicago's 2016 Games bid. However, Chicago crashed out in the first round, with U.S.-IOC ties strained at the time over revenue-sharing deals from sponsorship and broadcasting rights. The IOC has said it is planning to award both the 2024 and the 2028 Games at its session in September in Lima, Peru, and that Paris and Los Angeles are likely to share them among themselves. Earlier this month the IOC passed a recommendation for a double awarding, which will now be ratified in a July session with the final order to be decided in Lima. Los Angeles bid officials have repeatedly signalled that the city would be open to being awarded the 2028 Olympics instead of those four years earlier. Paris has insisted its bid plan could only work for 2024. With the double awarding the IOC is trying to keep both cities happy as four others dropped out of the race, concerned by the event's size and cost. More cities had dropped out of the race for the 2022. The IOC has now launched a reform process for bidding in order to make the Games a more attractive prospect to potential host cities.

Waterland acquired JVH in 2006 from ABN Amro and NPM Capital, but lost the company to lenders in 2008 after JVH struggled with tax changes. Waterland re-acquired JVH in the same year having invested additional equity to clear its debt, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. It has now put the company on the block, hiring JP Morgan and Moelis as sellside advisers, the sources said. Information memorandums were sent out in the last week as potential buyers gear up for an auction process, the sources said. Waterland and Moelis were not immediately available to comment. JP Morgan declined to comment. JVH recently completed a debt financing with Ares, which provided a €240m unitranche financing and a €70m acquisition facility. ING provided a €20m super senior revolving credit facility. The loan refinanced existing debt and paid a small dividend to owners, the sources said. In an unusual move -- one seen more frequently in the high yield bond market -- the loan comes with portability, guaranteeing any potential buyer that the existing capital structure can remain in place in the event of a sale, the sources said. Typically a change of ownership triggers a loan repayment. Security of capital can be very attractive for potential buyers. Despite paying up for direct lenders, the big attraction is the flexibility offered compared to the cheaper syndicated loan market. Ares is able to support JVH’s buy-and-build strategy, with the capacity to increase the total amount of debt in the company to as much as €500m-€600m, the sources said. JVH is expected to be paying around 6.5%-7%, higher than they would be paying if they tapped the syndicated loan market, but at the lower end of the unitranche market given leverage on the company is below 5 times, the sources said.

The industrial solutions unit is suffering from low oil prices that have discouraged investments in new plants. It has also missed out on a large Australian submarine order and is already undergoing an extensive reorganization. The business got a new chief executive in May after the previous incumbent stepped down after accepting an inappropriate gift from a business partner.  In addition to the measures already initiated, cost cuts are planned in a triple-digit million euro range,  a spokesman said on Thursday, confirming an earlier report in Germany's Manager Magazin. He did not give a specific figure.  The positive effects of the changes already initiated will only become visible after a time lag due to the long-term nature of plant engineering projects,  he said.  The new cost cuts will come on top of 450 million euros  ($502 million) over a three-year period that were announced in December, the spokesman said. Thyssenkrupp shares jumped to a two-year high and were trading up 2.7 percent at 24.84 euros by 1120 GMT, at the top of a flat German blue-chip index .GDAXI.  The unit, whose revenues of 5.74 billion euros were about 15 percent of the group's last fiscal year, is Thyssenkrupp's second-most profitable after elevators - ahead of the steel business from which it is trying to distance itself. Thyssenkrupp has been trying to put its steel business into a joint venture with Tata Steel's (TISC.NS) British and Dutch activities for over a year but negotiations have been hampered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Industrial Solutions reported its highest order intake in three years last quarter, and an operating profit margin of 1.8 percent, compared with 5.8 percent last fiscal year and its long-term target of 6-7 percent.

Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.4 percent each. Germany's benchmark stock index DAX pared earlier losses but remained in negative territory. Trading in U.S. stock futures suggested Wall Street shares would open flat to a touch weaker .  Most of the weakness in equity markets is related to the energy sector, and that's due to the massive weakness we've seen in oil, which is now trading in bear territory,  said Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London.  In oil markets, however, we are at levels where you would see bargain hunters come back into the market.  In fact, oil prices edged higher as the European session continued but remained within sight of lows hit on Wednesday. Global benchmark Brent was up 0.6 percent at around $45.08 but not far off Wednesday's seven-month low of $44.35. U.S. crude futures were 0.4 percent firmer at $42.67 a barrel. They closed down 1.6 percent on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year after the initial OPEC-led production cut. Oil's decline has hurt energy stocks and curbed investor expectations for higher inflation that would pave the way for tighter monetary policies among major central banks.  As far as the market mentality is concerned, as long as the oil price keeps weakening, this is going to tell us something about the underlying capacity of the global economy to generate inflation on a sustained basis,  said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.6 percent. But Japan's Nikkei ended a touch lower as a stronger yen and a plunge in the shares of auto air-bag maker Takata Corp took a toll on sentiment. Excitement after MSCI included mainland Chinese shares in its emerging market indexes this week further boosted China's stock market. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose to its highest level in one and a half years. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have led to a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds narrowed to 95 basis points, holding near its smallest since December 2007. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator. It shows concern about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. In currency markets, the New Zealand dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7257 after the central bank held official cash rates at record lows but sounded less dovish than bears in the market had wagered on. The U.S. dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 111.26 yen. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six other major currencies, was roughly flat at 97.53, down from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday. The euro was also flat at $1.1164, after Wednesday's 0.3 percent gain. In emerging markets, Saudi Arabia grabbed the spotlight. Saudi Arabian stocks rose more than 1 percent, heading for their biggest weekly gain in six years, after the promotion of a reformist Prince Mohammed to the role of crown prince and the prospect of inclusion in MSCI's equity index.

The president of the South West State region, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, said in a statement that the project was part of the region's move to attract local and foreign investors. Some investment has started returning to Somalia as it recovers from two decades of conflict, but much has come from Somali expatriates and most has focused on Mogadishu. Some Turkish and other foreign firms are among the new investors.  The project will include an integrated solution of air-land-sea logistics capabilities and advanced security management,  FSG said in a statement about the deal.

He did not give details about costs or timelines. The Free Zone Authority's website offered no further information. The regional president's office could not be reached for comment. Many rural areas and small settlements in South West State, which lies south of Mogadishu, are controlled by al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group which regularly launches attacks in its bid to oust the nation's Western-backed, federal government. The Lower Shabelle region, which also lies in South West state, has also suffered clashes between two big, rival clans. Prince, a former U.S. Navy Seal who is FSG's executive chairman, founded U.S. military contractor Blackwater which drew international criticism for its actions in Iraq. He later sold Blackwater, which then changed its name.

Fitch has also assigned an instrument rating of 'B+ (EXP)'/'RR4' to the company's proposed new senior secured bond and term loans. Proceeds from the issuance will be used to refinance the current capital structure. The final IDR and debt instrument ratings will be contingent upon the completion of the proposed refinancing and the receipt of final bond and loan documentation conforming materially to information provided to Fitch. KEY RATING DRIVERS Liquid Telecom's 'B+ (EXP)' rating reflects its robust business model with its unique fibre footprint offering cross-border telecommunication connectivity in Southern, Eastern and Central Africa. Higher demand for data, storage and bandwidth represents future growth opportunities for Liquid Telecom's enterprises and wholesale data divisions. The addition of Neotel's network in South Africa has enhanced Liquid Telecom's competitive position. However, some unhedged FX exposure may lead to volatility in key credit metrics. Commitment to infrastructure investment as well as dividend distribution could weigh on its already weak free cash flow (FCF) profile over the next three years. We believe there is moderate execution risk in turning around Neotel and generating sustainable enterprise revenue growth in a competitive operating environment. Robust Business Model: Liquid Telecom's market-leading position is underpinned by its unique cross-border fibre network spanning 13 countries in Africa, with limited substitution threat from alternative network operators. The company benefits from operating leverage where additional customers can be added at low marginal costs once network capacity has been put in place. The business model is supported by long-term contracts with global and regional enterprises and telecoms operators where we see a history of low customer churn rates. We believe the acquisition of Neotel should accelerate sales opportunities with the combined group's new and existing customers. Favourable Market Trend: The African telecommunications market is growing on the back of an increase in data traffic from an increasing number of connected devices and higher broadband speeds as internet penetration and mobile network coverage improve. Expansion of IT applications in end-markets such as finance, healthcare and media should support this growth. We believe Liquid Telecom is well placed to benefit from this favourable market trend and we do not foresee any sharp reversal as long as the overall African economic backdrop remains stable. Neotel Turnaround Strategy: Before its acquisition by Liquid Telecom, Neotel's operating performance had suffered due to uncertainty about its future ownership. As part of the turnaround strategy, Liquid Telecom has already reduced Neotel's indebtedness and is in the process of restructuring the businesses. The Neotel acquisition has moderately diluted the group's margins and increased leverage. Management has a track record in turning around distressed telecoms operations in East Africa, but the timing and the magnitude of improving operations at Neotel remain uncertain. High Capex Weakens FCF: High capex in FY18 and FY19 (financial year ending February) is part of the company's plan to turn around Neotel and to expand Liquid Telecom's network to support continued revenue growth. We expect these investments to be funded by upfront payments from anchor customers as well as external financing, with the payback period likely to be over four years, leading to short-term FCF pressures. The potential to increase dividend distribution may also weaken the liquidity profile. In the case of slower top-line growth, we believe the company has the flexibility to hold back expansionary capex to maintain a more neutral FCF profile. Emerging-Market Risks: A large portion of the group's revenue (48% in FY17) is generated in South Africa (BB+/Stable), which has been subject to weak GDP growth. The rest of the group's revenue is generated in countries such as Zimbabwe, Kenya (B+/Negative) and Zambia (B/Negative), which exhibit relatively weak operating environments. Regulatory uncertainty in these jurisdictions can have a negative impact on Liquid Telecom's business profile. Our sensitivity guidance for Liquid Telecom has been set tighter than for peers operating in developed markets to reflect these emerging-market risks. A majority of USD revenue is collected in the UK and Mauritius, reducing currency transfer and convertibility risks. Exposure to FX Volatility: Liquid Telecom's cash flow profile is subject to some FX volatility, with revenue derived in South Africa (representing 48% of total revenue) denominated in ZAR and a large proportion of the remaining revenue denominated in USD. We estimate that the majority of costs are denominated in local currency, leaving almost 80% of EBITDA linked to the USD. Overall, we estimate that a 25% adverse move of the USD/ZAR would only increase our FFO adjusted net leverage metric by 0.1x. DERIVATION SUMMARY Liquid Telecommunications Holdings Limited's business profile compares best with US peers Level 3 Communications, Inc. (BB/Stable) and Zayo Group, LLC. Liquid Telecom benefits from long-term customer relationships, strong network coverage and favourable industry trends. While the growth opportunity is greater in Africa than in developed markets, Liquid Telecom operates in countries in which the economic and regulatory environment can be unstable. Liquid Telecom's FX mismatch between cash flow and debt could lead to some volatility in credit metrics should there be material changes in its key currency pair (USD/ZAR). The company's FCF profile is constrained by high levels of capex over the next two years, which will be only partially funded by upfront payments from anchor customers as well as external financing. Following the Neotel acquisition and taking into account the proposed refinancing, we expect Liquid Telecom's credit metrics to be weaker than those of Level 3 Communications but stronger than those of Zayo Group. We highlight the company's exposure to emerging markets as the key differentiating factor relative to the sector peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Moderate compound annual growth in revenue of over 5% in FY17-FY20 (pro forma for Neotel), supported by growth in enterprises and wholesale data mitigated by wholesale voice, which is subject to pricing as well as volume pressures; - An operating EBITDA (before income from associates) margin of 28% in FY17 (pro forma for Neotel), improving to 32% in FY20; - Capex as a percentage of revenue of 25%-30% in FY18 and FY19, declining to below 20% in FY20; - Dividends paid of around USD13 million per year in FY18 and beyond; and - A bespoke recovery analysis based on a going concern approach assumes a post-restructuring EBITDA of USD122milion and distressed EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.0x. However, the Recovery Rating for the USD700m of expected senior secured debt (including RCF) is limited to 'RR4' due to country considerations. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Successful implementation of the business strategy, including a turnaround of Neotel, with an improvement in operating performance leading to: - FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably below 3.0x; and - A FCF margin of 3%. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action A material deterioration in operating performance leading to: - FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably above 4.0x; and - A negative FCF margin leading to liquidity pressure. LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: As of closing of the proposed refinancing, we expect Liquid Telecom to have access to a revolving credit facility of USD50 million (undrawn) and readily available cash of USD85 million on the balance sheet by FYE18. There are operating challenges with the company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe (around 15% of revenue), in which cash is subject to transfer and convertibility risks. We treat Liquid Telecom's cash in Zimbabwe as restricted and exclude it from our net leverage calculations. As FYE17, Liquid Telecom has access to readily available cash of USD106 million (net of USD12 million held as bank guarantees and USD35 million as restricted cash in Zimbabwe), which is sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities as well as other operating requirements.

A lack of clarity regarding the UK’s future relationship with the EU and a weakened sterling has contributed to the reduction in workers on farms now being reported by labour providers who source seasonal workers,  NFU horticulture and potatoes board Chairman Ali Capper said. Farmers recruit seasonal workers mainly from eastern EU countries with 75 percent arriving from Romania and Bulgaria. The NFU called on the government to provide clarity on how farmers will access a reliable and competent workforce both now and after Britain leaves the EU.  Without that, this trend is likely to continue and at this stage in the season any further tightening in the workforce will hit hard on farms,  Capper said.

The Outlooks are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed Arcelik's senior unsecured rating at 'BB+'. The affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation that Arcelik will maintain FFO adjusted net leverage below 1.5x in the medium term despite increased expansion efforts, which will keep FCF generation under pressure until the end of 2018. Fitch believes that the current expansion plans into ASEAN markets will reduce the company's exposure to the Turkish market, but Arcelik's exposure to emerging markets continues to be higher than its peers'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak FCF Generation: Arcelik has accelerated its investments in ASEAN markets to improve its geographic diversification, which has historically been focused on Turkey and Europe. Increased capex in new factories and investments had an impact on FCF margins in 2016 (-0.2%), and Fitch expects this to continue through 2017 (-3.2%) as well. We expect capex to normalise after the current investment phase, and forecast the company to turn FCF positive from end-2018 (0.2%). Leverage Commensurate with Ratings: Arcelik has financed its new investments internally by releasing cash through better working-capital management and asset sales, keeping leverage metrics in line with the current ratings. We forecast that FFO adjusted (for receivables) net leverage will remain below 1.5x until 2020, staying below its negative rating sensitivities. Arcelik's FCF generation is still weak compared with its peers' in spite of stable leverage metrics, and a sustainable improvement would be needed for a positive rating action. Emerging-Market Exposure: The recent investment/expansion plans in the ASEAN region are a positive step towards reducing Arcelik's exposure to the Turkish economy, which has been a constraint on its ratings. Arcelik has become a more geographically diverse white-goods manufacturer in the past 10 years, with revenues from the domestic market declining to 40% in 2016 from 50% in 2008, backed by solid market share gains in Europe and expansion into new emerging markets. However, Arcelik's emerging-market presence is still high compared with peers like Whirlpool and Electrolux, which remains a credit concern. Growing Market Shares: Arcelik has achieved strong international revenue growth in the past few years, by taking advantage of the more price-conscious consumers in western Europe and by capitalising on its strong marketing and distribution network, allowing it to become one of the top-three white-goods manufacturers in Europe. We believe that Arcelik will be able to maintain and build on its market shares further, through its low-cost manufacturing, strong R&D;, and solid product line. We expect international revenue growth to be the main revenue driver beyond 2017, as Arcelik has targeted markets where appliance penetration rates are lower than in the rest of the world. Expanding into India: In May 2017 Arcelik signed a deal with Voltas, part of the Tata Group, India's largest conglomerate, to establish a joint venture in India. The JV, with an equity capital of USD100 million, will launch a refrigerator production facility which is aimed at being operational by the end of 2018. The JV will also sell other major domestic appliances in India, produced in various Arcelik facilities around the world. The partnership will leverage the Beko brand and its expertise in the major domestic appliance sector across the globe, as well as Voltas' strong brand presence and wide sales and distribution network in India. Financial Services Adjustments: Arcelik's reported leverage is affected by its higher than average working-capital needs, as a significant portion of durable goods are sold on credit in Turkey. This is partly financed by Arcelik, but the consumer credit risk is covered by banks' letters of credit and mortgages. Fitch assumes approximately 120 days of domestic receivables come from this business practice in Turkey and adjusts debt accordingly to reflect a more accurate peer comparison. Based on its financial services criteria, Fitch applies a 3x debt/equity multiple for these receivables. DERIVATION SUMMARY Arcelik has strong market shares in Turkey and Europe, which drive stable EBITDA (around10.5%) and FFO margins ( around 8%), that are commensurate with a 'A' rating median in our capital-goods Navigator, and are also in line with higher-rated peers like Whirlpool (BBB) and Panasonic (BBB). However, these strengths are mitigated by weak FCF generation, driven by intense capex in new markets, and the structurally high working-capitall needs of the company. Despite the current investment phase, Arcelik's leverage metrics adjusted for financial services remain below its negative rating sensitivities and conform to a 'A' rating median in our capital-goods Navigator. Arcelik's technological content and R&D; record are more or less in line with Whirlpool, Electrolux and the broad white-goods industry. However, compared to higher-rated white-goods manufacturers, Arcelik's revenues are mainly derived from emerging markets. Arcelik is expanding its geographical diversification away from Turkey, but the company remains vulnerable to macroeconomic, political and FX risks in emerging markets. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -  double-digit revenue growth in international markets; - short term growth in domestic market supported by government incentives -  stable profitability margins in line with historical performance; -  sizeable capex outlay for 2017 and 2018, in line with acquisition and expansion plans; -  additional financing to fund M&A; and expansion activities; -  financial services adjustment, assuming 120 days of domestic receivables, (see working-capital and financial services adjustments sections) RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Receivable-adjusted FFO net leverage ratio below 1.5x. (1.3x end-2016) -FFO margins consistently above 10%. (10.6% end-2016) -FCF margin above 2% on a sustainable basis. (-0.2% end-2016) Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Receivable-adjusted FFO net leverage ratio above 2.5x. -FFO margin below 8%. -Consistently negative FCF. LIQUIDITY Low Liquidity Score:  Historically, Arcelik's liquidity score has been below 1x, as a result of the use of short-term debt to finance its high working-capital needs. Cash on the balance sheet (TRY2,120 million as of end- 2016) matches short-term debt of TRY2,181 million for 2017, but it falls short of covering our minus TRY577 million FCF forecast for 2017. Fitch believes that this risk is mitigated by Arcelik's comfortable (uncommitted) lines from Turkish banks which were available even in 2008-2009. The liquidity score of below 1x is not considered adequate for the current rating levels, but the risk is partly mitigated by customer receivables financing that is deemed self-liquidating.

For many, higher Medicare premiums will take a big bite out of their raise.  The 2018 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will not be announced until October, but inflation trends point toward an increase of about 2 percent, according to a recent forecast by the Senior Citizens League. That would be a welcome change compared with the 0.3 percent bump in 2017, and 2016 when no COLA was made.  COLAS are determined by an automatic formula tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). From 2013 to 2015, the annual increases have ranged around 1.5 percent. For a retiree receiving the average monthly Social Security benefit of $1,360, a 2 percent raise would translate to an increase of $27.20. But for most beneficiaries, Medicare Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security. And the impact of the Part B premium on net benefits next year will vary due to what is known as the “hold harmless” provision governing Social Security. By law, the dollar amount of Part B premium increases cannot exceed the dollar amount of the COLA - a feature that ensures net Social Security benefits do not fall. The hold harmless provision applies to the 70 percent of the Medicare population enrolled in both programs. Those not held harmless include anyone delaying their filing for Social Security benefits, but others affected include some federal and state government retirees. Affluent seniors who pay high-income Medicare premium surcharges also are not protected. The stingy COLAs of the past two years are rare, and now they have set the table for an equally unusual situation for 2018. The recent flat COLAs meant that nonprotected Medicare enrollees shouldered most of the burden of rising Part B premiums; the premiums for this group jumped sharply in 2016 and 2017. This year, they are paying $134 per month, while protected beneficiaries are paying an average of $109. But a generous 2018 COLA will spread higher Part B program costs across the entire Medicare population. That means nonprotected enrollees will see their premiums fall, while the protected group will pay more. Consider an example where the standard Part B premium falls to $125. That above-mentioned average Social Security beneficiary, (receiving $1,360 monthly) now faces a $16 increase in her monthly Part B premium, reducing her COLA from $27.20 to $11.20. If she were receiving $2,000 a month she would receive a net monthly COLA of $24, instead of $40. How would low-income beneficiaries be affected? Someone receiving $600 would see her $12 gross COLA cut to just $6 - although she might also be eligible for a Medicare Savings Program depending on where she lives. In some states, these programs turn to Medicaid to pay Part B premiums, which means she would receive her full COLA (reut.rs/1OXKZ9b).    Cola Falls Behind Setting aside the hold-harmless math, the COLA formula is not keeping seniors even with rising inflation. The Senior Citizens League’s annual study of changes in key costs impacting seniors found that Social Security beneficiaries have lost nearly one-third of their buying power since 2000, and they have lost 7 percent just over the past 12 months. Healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket costs loom large, accounting for five of the top 10 items in the study. “Retirees are either spending down their savings to cover the gaps, or simply going without,” said Mary Johnson, the group’s Social Security and Medicare policy consultant. Rising healthcare costs threaten to erode net Social Security benefits dramatically over time, according to Healthview Services, a maker of healthcare cost projection software. A Healthview report issued last week projects that healthcare inflation will rise an average of 5.47 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That is almost triple the recent historical U.S. inflation rate and more than double the annual projected Social Security COLAs. A couple turning 65 this year receiving average Social Security benefits will pay 59 percent of lifetime Social Security benefits for healthcare; the same couple aged 55 this year can expect to pay out 92 percent when they reach Medicare age. The healthcare cost trend underscores the value of working longer. Staying on the job reduces the number of years of Medicare premium payments, and creates opportunities to boost Social Security income - and COLAs - through delayed claiming. A growing number of planning experts also suggest that retirees keep part of their portfolio in stocks well past retirement age to help beat inflation. For workers in high-deductible health plans, health savings accounts (HSAs) offer the opportunity to save tax-free; the dollars can be invested and later spent tax-free to meet health expenses. But for most people, HSA contributions wind up being used to meet current health expenses. But in general, healthcare cost inflation simply underscores the need to boost saving, notes Ron Mastrogiovanni, Healthview’s CEO. “Big numbers scare people, but you can do something about this.” (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

Consumer prices in Azerbaijan rose 0.2 percent month-on-month in May, at the same pace as in April. The central bank said on Thursday that average annual inflation was at 13.8 percent.  Short-term inflation risks are limited ... and inflation expectations ... should be slowing from the second half of this year,  the bank said in a statement. The central bank said a key rate cut was possible in the second half of this year, depending on the inflation and economic conditions. The central bank said on Thursday that the economic activity in the non-oil sector grew by 3.9 percent in the five months of 2017. The balance of payments was at $0.7 billion in the first quarter, after minus $2.5 billion a year ago. Azerbaijan, an energy-rich ex-Soviet republic, has seen its economy shrinking and its currency weakening as oil prices have fallen. As the economy has slumped, bad loans have increased and capital dwindled at Azeri banks. Several banks have lost their licenses. The country's biggest, state-run International Bank of Azerbaijan, has recently launched a restructuring of more than $3 billion of its debt. Another state company, Azerbaijan Railways, or ADY, has issued a request for proposal for a financial adviser earlier this month to explore options available to ADY for the financing of its future capital expenditures and the possible refinancing of certain existing liabilities. The central bank, which plans to hold its next board meeting on Aug. 1, said that the manat currency rate was expected to be stable till the end of the year.

TV: 10:10 p.m. ET, MLB Network, SNY (New York), SportsNet LA (Los Angeles) PITCHING MATCHUP: Mets LH Steven Matz (1-1, 3.21 ERA) vs. Dodgers LH Hyun-Jin Ryu (3-6, 4.35) Matz made his second start of the season on Friday and allowed four runs over seven innings in a 7-2 loss to Washington. “There’s still stuff I need to get better at, little consistency with my fastball, curveball,” Matz told reporters. “Some consistency and making better misses. I’m missing in the fat part of the plate right now.” The 26-year-old is 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in two regular-season starts against the Dodgers. Ryu is looking to record back-to-back victories for the first time this season after holding Cincinnati to two runs over five frames in a 10-2 win on Saturday. The 30-year-old has struggled this month, going 1-1 with a 5.63 ERA in three turns covering 16 innings. Jay Bruce is 3-for-6 with a home run against Ryu, who owns a 2-0 record and 1.80 ERA in three career starts against the Mets. Walk-Offs 1. The Mets placed RHP Zack Wheeler on the 10-day disabled list with biceps tendinitis. 2. The Dodgers optioned Brock Stewart to Triple-A Oklahoma City and recalled fellow RHP Brandon Morrow. 3. New York INF Wilmer Flores is batting .316 with four home runs and 17 RBIs over his last 41 games.

Details such as the frequency of ads, how much money was spent on them, where they were seen, what the messages were and how many people were reached would remain confidential under the company's corporate policy, which is the same for political advertising as for commercial customers.  Advertisers consider their ad creatives and their ad targeting strategy to be competitively sensitive and confidential,  Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about political ads.   In many cases, they'll ask us, as a condition of running ads on Facebook, not to disclose those details about how they're running campaigns on our service,  he said.  From our perspective, it's confidential information of these advertisers.   Sherman said it would not make an exception for political advertising.  We try to have consistent policies across the board, so that we're imposing similar requirements on everybody.   Academics who study political campaigns worldwide said this kind of information fosters accountability by analyzing how candidates compete for votes and whether election systems live up to expectations of fairness. Transparency can also deter fraudulent ads, they said.   We don't have the capacity right now to track it, and nobody does, as far as we can tell,  said Bowdoin College professor Michael Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which catalogs political ads on traditional television but has no means of doing so on Facebook. Television has been the backbone of political advertising  for decades, and local U.S. broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of ads. The ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets.  Online advertising, though, often targets narrow, more carefully constructed audiences, so for example an ad could be directed only to Democrats under 25 years of age.  Thousands of variations of online ads can be directed at select groups and the targeting can be extreme. Academics argue this is where the process can become very opaque.  Candidates can speak out of both sides of their mouths,  said Daniel Kreiss, a communications professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Having some kind of digital repository of ads that are purchased during a particular cycle and linked to a particular source is a good, democratic thing for the public.  No such repository exists, and the quandary for researchers is expected to worsen as more politicians use digital advertising because of its relatively low cost and opportunities for target marketing.  According to U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, $70 million was spent for its ads on Facebook, more than on any other digital platform including Google (GOOGL.O), and Trump has credited Facebook with helping him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton last November.  Advertising on Facebook also figured prominently in recent elections in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, researchers said.  Britain is investigating how candidates use data to target voters. Facebook ads generally disappear with the scroll of a thumb on a smartphone, and they have no permanent links. Advocates for transparency call them  dark ads.  Facebook calls them  unpublished posts.   Researchers said that disclosure reports from the U.S. Federal Election Commission are unhelpful because they show what campaigns pay to intermediaries, not to internet platforms.  The role of advertising online is as important to study as the effect of so-called  fake news,  which has received more attention than ads, scholars said.   The holy grail, I think, of political analysis for the 2016 election is to figure out which communications from which entities had an effect on which jurisdictions in the United States,  said Nathan Persily, a Stanford University professor who writes about elections.  Facebook has such information and should make it available for study, Persily said.  Facebook's Sherman said the company was open to hearing research proposals, but he doubted much could be achieved.  Even if we were able to be more transparent in this area, it would only be a very small piece of an overall story,  he said.

But the conditions inside many of them are so regimented that the children can find the experience harrowing, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have stayed or worked in the facilities, as well as child psychology experts familiar with the system. The concerns have prompted government officials to suggest that reform is needed, though there is no indication of when that will occur. Government-sponsored committees aimed at improving child welfare policies have been established, and changes to the centers will be on their agenda.  No one thinks it's okay to keep these shelters exactly the way they are,  said Yu Hamada, an official at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.  There hasn't been any discussion to date as to how exactly they should function, and that's what we're working on.   Originally set up after World War Two to provide food and shelter for wandering orphans and petty juvenile criminals, Japan’s 136 shelters haven't evolved much in the past 70 years, experts say. The children, who can be any age between 1 and 17, are usually kept indoors and away from school so that they can’t run off or abusing parents can’t grab them. In many of the shelters, workers with little training impose strict rules and schedules, don’t allow cell phones or toys from home, and make isolation a common punishment for misbehaving, the sources said. Stricter shelters don’t allow chatting during meals or even making eye contact with other kids, the people with knowledge of the conditions said. The shelters vary in age, size and quality. Some have gymnasiums or playgrounds and are well-stocked with DVDs and comic books; others are run-down with peeling wallpaper and old tatami mats, sleeping 10 to a room, these people said. They are administered by child guidance centers that are part of the local prefectural and municipal governments, and have gone largely unsupervised by the central government. They are funded with local and central government money. Despite its child-friendly image, Japan lags other advanced economies when it comes to protecting the rights of its youth in official care. A fundamental problem is a dearth of foster parents, which means a greater percentage of kids end up in some kind of group care facility than in other developed countries. Acknowledging problems in the system, Japan last year revised its child welfare law to spell out that children have rights, though those are not fully enforced by welfare workers, the experts say. “These shelters should be a place for children to get the care they need,” said Yukiko Yamawaki, a psychotherapist who worked with children under care for the city of Tokyo for nearly two decades until 2015 and often visited the facilities. “But the attitude is, 'You're lucky you have a place to sleep and you're not getting killed.' They don't see their jobs as providing comfort and care.   Defenders of the system say tight discipline is needed as the children come from a wide range of backgrounds and needs, and without firm control chaos would reign. A nine-year-old girl who spent more than three months in a temporary shelter in Tokyo after being reported as a victim of abuse, is pictured at her psychotherapist's office in Tokyo, Japan March 17, 2017. Picture taken  March 17, 2017.Toru Hanai It's communal living so we do have to set some rules,  said Chikako Yoshikawa, who oversees a shelter in Tokyo.  With a limited number of workers caring for lots of children, a certain level of control is inevitable to prevent accidents.  “Not a Normal Place” The average stay in the shelters is 30 days, though some children end up in staying for months before they return home, go into foster care or another residential facility. Reuters was allowed to visit one of the 33 shelters in and around Tokyo. Requests to go to others were turned down on privacy grounds.  Slideshow (3 Images)It was difficult to draw any conclusions about conditions during a recent visit to that one shelter in Yokosuka.  Boys and girls streamed into a spacious lounge after a study time. One started playing ping-pong while several others slumped onto a couch to read comics. It was a scene that could have been in any dormitory except that almost every wall and door was patched up to cover damage from punching and kicking by the kids, according to one worker. Children weren’t allowed to whisper so that staff could monitor their conversations.  Self Injury    One 9-year-old girl who spent more than three months at another shelter in Tokyo last year told Reuters that she was scolded often, felt suffocated, and longed to go home despite having previously been beaten by her mother.  When it's TV time, you have to watch TV. If you start talking, they'll say, 'Look straight ahead,'  she said. An official at the girl's shelter said occupancy sometimes exceeds capacity by a quarter, prompting stricter supervision. Dr Makiko Okuyama, head of psychosocial medicine at the National Center for Child Health and Development, said the shelter experience can verge on traumatic for many children. One teenage girl told her that acts of self-injury, common among sexual abuse victims, invited punishment, not counsel or treatment, from workers. Okuyama, who also chairs one of the government-commissioned panels seeking to improve welfare policies, said the real improvement will come when Japanese society becomes more open to fostering.  We need to think about whether these shelters should continue to exist as they are,  she said.  It's not a normal place. It's not a place where anyone should stay for more than a few days.   Reporting by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Malcolm Foster and Martin Howell","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-child-shelters-idUSKBN19D00D"},

Exports climbed 13.2 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace in 52 months, after April's 8.5 percent increase, commerce ministry data showed on Thursday. A Reuters poll expected a 6.3 percent growth in May.  A global economic recovery helped lift our exports to all key markets. Shipments of capital goods and agricultural products continued to grow,  said Pimchanok Vonkhorporn, an official at the commerce ministry. In January-May, exports rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier, the highest pace in six years. Shipments are worth about two-thirds of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy and are just recovering after years of weakness. The ministry is confident of achieving its 2017 export growth target of 5 percent and sees a strong baht as a short-term factor, Pimchanok said. The baht gained more than 5 percent against the dollar this year, competing with the Malaysian ringgit to be Southeast Asia's strongest performer. With the upbeat exports, Kasikorn Research Center plans to raise its 2017 export growth forecast from 2 percent, said economist Pimonwan Mahujchariyawong. The export growth in May was led by stronger shipments of capital goods, with electronics exports jumping about 24 percent from a year earlier after a mere 3 percent rise in April and a 0.7 percent contraction in 2016. Exports to China, the United States and Japan, Thailand's top three markets in May, rose 28.3 percent, 8.8 percent and 25.7 percent year-on-year, respectively. Imports of electronics and electrical parts increased nearly 19 percent in May from a year earlier. Exports of overall vehicles and parts rose 12.5 percent in May, compared with a 2.4 percent drop in April, while imports of such items increased 14.6 percent. Total imports in May surged 18.2 percent from a year earlier, against forecast of a 10.7 percent rise. The May trade numbers produced a trade surplus of $0.94 billion, compared with a forecast of $1.16 billion.  Stronger imports of raw material and capital goods suggest the Thai economy will continue to grow,  Pimchanok said, as many of the imported materials are assembled into completed goods and shipped out again. Thai economy is expected to grow at least 3.5 percent this year versus 3.2 percent growth last year, Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.  Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.   I get it,  said Streb, who has a degree in communications,  but it's frustrating.   Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.  The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.    Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'      This is about economics, not what Trump says,  said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM's stamping plant at Lordstown.  Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn't get the third shift back here.   Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.  Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.  In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.   There's no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,  Muro said.  If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.   Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.  In Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.  Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.  GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.   GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,  Hill said.  There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won't hurt us as bad it used to.   Lordstown's workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.   The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,  Streb said.  This is just another Lordstown downturn.     Infographic ID: '2siZUJk'     Stalling Sedan Sales  The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.  However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.  For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus  light trucks  - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.  After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.  Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.  To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.  GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.  More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.  Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.  Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM's Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM's efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker  are on an upward swing.   The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.  At GM's Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it's time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.  At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.   We're working hard to make the best product we can,  said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown,  so we can raise our hands and say to GM 'look at what we can do.

The CBI said its factory order book balance jumped to +16 in June, its highest level since 1988. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected a weaker reading of +7 compared with +9 in May. Export order growth was its strongest in 22 years, the CBI said, helped by the fall in the value of the pound that was triggered by last year's Brexit vote. The strong performance by manufacturers will be noted by the BoE, where three members of the eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee last week voted to raise rates, citing among other factors a pick-up in exports and investment which could help to offset a squeeze in spending for domestic consumers. The MPC's five other members backed keeping rates on hold but on Wednesday, the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to vote for a rate hike too later this year, as long as the economic data justified it. BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday he wanted to see how Britain's economy coped with uncertainties about Brexit in the coming months before considering a rate hike. Philip Shaw, an economist with Investec, said the CBI survey could provide marginal support for the case for a rate hike.  But while it's reassuring to see some evidence of a strengthening of exports, one should remember that manufacturing still only accounts for about 10 percent of the economy,  he said, adding that the much bigger services sector was slowing due to the squeeze on consumer spending power. The CBI survey showed factory output in the past three months slowed back to a level last seen in January while expectations for the next three months remained strong.  Nevertheless, with cost pressures remaining elevated, it's no surprise to see that manufacturers continue to have high expectations for the prices they plan to charge,  Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said. Britain's inflation rate has risen to its highest level in nearly four years, pushed up in part by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.

Turkish defense ministry sources said U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also promised his Turkish counterpart to provide a monthly list of weapons handed to the YPG, saying the first inventory had already been sent to Ankara. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's southeast since the mid-1980s. It has said supplies to the YPG have in the past ended up in PKK hands, and described any weapon given to the force as a threat to its security. The United States sees the YPG as an essential ally in the campaign to defeat Islamic State in Raqqa, the jihadists' main urban base in Syria. The fight for Raqqa was launched two weeks ago, piling pressure on Islamic State which also faces defeat in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul. Mattis told Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik that a detailed record of all equipment provided to the YPG was being kept and that all the weapons would be taken back after Islamic State was defeated, the sources said. In a letter to the minister, Mattis also said that Arab fighters would form 80 percent of the forces which will recapture Raqqa. Once the mainly Sunni Arab city was taken, it would be held by Arab forces, the sources said he told Isik. Relations between the NATO allies have been strained by President Donald Trump's decision to arm the YPG, despite protests from President Tayyip Erdogan who set out Turkey's objections at a White House meeting last month. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the YPG if it felt it was threatened by the group. A Syrian war monitor and Kurdish sources said on Wednesday that Turkey had sent military reinforcements including troops, vehicles and equipment into an area of northern Syria where it has been fighting Islamic State and YPG forces. Turkish officials have not commented, but the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish reinforcements headed south of Azaz town, which is held by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and is close YPG-controlled territory.

Singapore shares rose 0.4 percent, with financials contributing most of the gains, while Thai shares advanced 0.3 percent after data showed customs-cleared exports in May rose at its fastest pace in 52 months, handily beating expectations.      An official at the Thai commerce ministry expressed confidence in achieving its 2017 export growth target of 5 percent, after exports climbed 13.2 percent in May from a year earlier after April's 8.5 percent increase.     However, caution prevailed in Southeast Asia amid weak oil prices as traders assessed a glut of physical supply that has persisted despite OPEC-led efforts to balance the market.     Philippine shares closed 0.4 lower percent after falling as much as  0.7 percent earlier in the day.      The Philippine central bank said after market close that it would leave its key overnight borrowing rate steady at 3.0 percent, as expected.     However, the central bank cut its inflation forecast for this year to an average of 3.1 percent in 2017 from 3.4 percent.     The real estate and industrial sectors accounted for most of the losses, with Ayala Land and SM Investment losing 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.

The Taiwan-based firm has been eyeing U.S. investments for some time and its CEO, Terry Gou, had previously said the company hoped to spend over $7 billion to set up a display-making plant in the country - which has no panel-making industry but is the No.2 market for televisions. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co,  is currently considering Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina as possible locations, Gou told reporters after the company's annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.  In July we will make a conclusion,  Gou said, adding the company would invest the money over five years. Foxconn operates vast factories in China, where it employs a million people and makes most of Apple's iPhones, but so far it has not invested heavily in manufacturing in the United States.  This time we go to America, it's not just to build a factory, but to move our entire supply chain there,  Gou told shareholders, without providing specific details. Terry Gou, founder and chairman of Foxconn speaks during a news conference, in Taipei, Taiwan June 22, 2017.Tyrone SiuWhile the plant would create jobs, Gou added it would not employ as many people as in its China plants, as the cost of labor is higher and the plant would rely on automation.

The move comes after the FA was criticised for punishing players for betting violations while having deals in place with gambling companies.  At May's board meeting, it was agreed that The FA would end all sponsorships with betting companies starting from the end of the 2016-17 season,  the FA said in a statement on Thursday.  The decision was made following a three-month review of The FA's approach to it as a governing body taking betting sponsorship, whilst being responsible for the regulation of sports betting within the sport's rules.  As a consequence, The FA has mutually agreed with Ladbrokes that its current partnership will be terminated from June 2017,  concluded the statement. FA rules ban players from betting on any football matches. In April, former Manchester City and Burnley midfielder Joey Barton was banned for 18 months after he was found to have made more than 1,200 bets on football matches. Barton, who said he had a gambling addiction, had pointed out the heavy involvement of the gambling industry in British football where bookmakers act as sponsors at several levels.  That all means this is not an easy environment in which to try to stop gambling, or even to encourage people within the sport that betting is wrong,  Barton had said in a statement. England's second tier, run by the Football League, is known as the Sky Bet Championship, while numerous clubs have betting companies as shirt sponsors. The FA said they would continue to work with betting companies, including Ladbrokes, in information sharing schemes on suspect betting patterns. Martin Glenn, chief executive of The FA, said:  We would like to thank Ladbrokes for both being a valued partner over the last year and for their professionalism and understanding about our change of policy around gambling.  Jim Mullen, CEO of Ladbrokes Coral, said:  We understand The FA's decision regarding their commercial partnerships on gambling.

The rating agency maintained its A-/A-2 foreign currency and A/A-1 local currency ratings on Malaysia, saying the challenges will not materially impede policy flexibility and responsiveness. It also said Malaysia's outlook was  stable.   Ongoing political challenges in relation to the corruption allegations of 1MDB, combined with the approaching elections, pose potential challenges to the sovereign rating over the near-to-medium term,  S&P; said in a statement.  Those challenges could manifest themselves via a rise in the cost of refinancing Malaysia's sizable gross external financing needs, or via nonresident outflows from Malaysia's deep local-currency government bond market,  it said. State investment fund 1MDB is the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in civil lawsuits filed last week that about $4.5 billion of funds were misappropriated from 1MDB. Prime Minister Najib Razak has denied taking money from 1MDB for personal gain, after it was reported that investigators traced nearly $700 million to his bank accounts. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing and local authorities have also cleared him of any wrongdoing. Government sources have told Reuters that Najib could call elections in the second half of this year. General elections have to be held by mid-2018. S&P; also flagged a few credit risks: high share of foreign ownership of Malaysia's ringgit-denominated government bonds, and the central bank's record-high forward position on its foreign-exchange reserves. Foreigners, who had held about half of the outstanding Malaysian government bonds, fled the market between November 2016 and March this year after the central bank said they could no longer trade in ringgit non-deliverable forwards. Some investors started to return since April.  A continued sell-down of foreign-owned securities could undermine Malaysia's external buffers. At the same time, we maintain that risks of external outflows are attenuated by our expectations of continued sound policymaking,  S&P; said. The central bank's short forward position hit an all-time high of $19.1 billion in April. While Malaysia's headline reserves have remained stable over recent months, its dollar borrowings in the form of currency swap deals have risen steadily from around $2.8 billion in October. S&P; said its forecast assumes that pressure on reserve coverage will level off over the next one to two years. Reporting by A.

Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation, arrived in Israel on Wednesday morning and was due to spend barely 20 hours on the ground. Video showed him giving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a friend of Kushner's father, a handshake and a hug as they prepared to sit down with the Israeli ambassador to Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Israel and other senior officials for preliminary discussions.  This is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security, prosperity and peace,  Netanyahu said.  Jared, I welcome you here in that spirit. I know of your efforts, the president's efforts, and I look forward to working with you to achieve these common goals.  Kushner replied:  The president sends his best regards and it's an honor to be here with you.  Kushner did not speak to the media or take questions, maintaining the circumspect profile he has established since Trump took office in January. U.S. officials and Israeli leaders  underscored that forging peace will take time and stressed the importance of doing everything possible to create an environment conducive to peacemaking,  the White House later said in a statement. Kushner traveled to Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for two hours of talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily Ramadan fast. Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said all major issues at the heart of the conflict were discussed. U.S. officials called the trip part of an effort to keep the conversation going rather than the launching of a new phase in the peace process, saying that Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the president's special representative for international negotiations, are likely to return often.

Thaer Ghanaim/PPO/Handout via REUTERSTrump has described peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians as  the ultimate deal  and made it a priority. As well as receiving both Netanyahu and Abbas in the White House, he visited the region last month. But it remains unclear what approach Trump, via Kushner and Greenblatt, plans to take on resolving one of the world's most intractable conflicts.  For at least two decades, the goal of U.S.-led diplomacy has been a  two-state solution , meaning an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side and at peace with Israel. But when Trump met Netanyahu in Washington in February, he said he was not fixed on two states saying,  I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas meets with White House senior advisor Jared Kushner in the West Bank City of Ramallah June 21, 2017. Thaer Ghanaim/PPO/Handout via REUTERS12 'Bullet Points' Netanyahu has in the past given conditional backing to two states. But ahead of his last election victory in 2015, he promised there would never be a Palestinian state on his watch, a remark seen as an attempt to shore up right-wing support. In discussions with Greenblatt before Kushner's visit, Palestinian sources said the phrase  two-state solution  had not been used. Palestinian sources said that ahead of Kushner's meeting with Abbas, they had been asked to draw up a list of 12  bullet point  demands they would want met in any negotiations.  They saw it as a helpful exercise in focusing on core elements rather than an oversimplification of a complex issue. Trump administration officials have said that if they are going to make progress on peace, they do not want to get bogged down in process but to move rapidly on tackling what are known as  final status  issues, the complexities around Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, water resources, security and borders. Those have long been thorny problems in the multiple rounds of peace negotiations launched by both Republican and Democratic presidents since the mid-1990s. It remains unclear what new approach Trump's administration may have to untangling disputes that blend politics, land, religion and ethnicity and have defied resolution for 70 years.

Iranian domestic carrier Zagros Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to buy 20 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo jets and eight A330neo aircraft, while privatized Iran Airtour signed an MoU for 45 A320neos. Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the country were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. IranAir has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) and 20 ATR turboprops but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing.  Boeing has also signed a deal for 30 737 MAX jets with Iran's Aseman Airlines, which is managed as a private company and owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Iran Airtour was established as a subsidiary of IranAir and privatized in 2011 but maintains a status as subsidiary of the national flag carrier, according to CAPA aviation consultancy. Zagros Airlines is a private carrier.  Airbus Chief Operating Officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said he did not believe the deals were related to political issues. The company said the MoUs were contingent upon all necessary approvals, including from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he expected the U.S. approvals within the next couple of months.

Countries on the periphery of the 19-member euro zone worry that when the ECB ends its 2.3 trillion-euro ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying scheme, yields will rise. The higher financing costs could curb growth and would disproportionately hurt indebted countries such as Italy, Spain or Portugal.  If the spreads for a particular country rise, that’s not a monetary policy problem,   ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said in an interview published in Spiegel on Thursday.  We are not singling out particular countries and neither are we there to ensure governments have favourable financing conditions.  The ECB gave up its bias towards more rates cuts earlier this month in a small step towards normalisation. It will decide this autumn whether to extend or wind down its bond buying.  When the day comes, we will look at inflation and act accordingly, regardless of whether governments complain,  Praet said.  We forewarned them and they clearly understood that.  I have just read a commentary by the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pier Carlo Padoan. 'When the bond purchases come to an end, we are on our own', he writes. And he’s right,  Praet said. The bond purchase scheme is set to run until the end of the year, but even if the programme is wound down, it would be reduced over a period several months. Although many market analysts expect another extension of the programme, the scarcity of government debt to buy could limit the ECB's ability to continue buying. $1 = 0.8951 euros Reporting by Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Maria Sheahan, Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-praet-idUSL8N1JJ26G"},

Automakers are leveraging expertise in automated driving functions for mass-market cars to develop mobility services, as they compete with tech firms such as Alphabet Inc and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in the fast-growing  pay-per-ride  market which threatens to hit demand for car ownership. Ogi Redzic, head of Nissan-Renault's Connected Vehicles and Mobility Services division, said the alliance would begin self-driving services based on its electric cars  certainly within 10 years,  though not likely before 2020.  We think that the big opportunity for us is in automation, electric vehicles and ride-sharing and hailing together,  Redzic said in an interview on Thursday. Nissan and Renault join a small group of automakers aiming to enter the ride-hailing market, which Goldman Sachs last month estimated would grow eightfold by 2030 to be five times the size of the taxi market. Redzic said the Japanese and French partners were testing self-driving vehicles, and that any service would run on pre-mapped courses with predetermined pick-up and drop-off points. The two automakers are developing the system with Japanese game software maker DeNA Co Ltd and French public transport operator Transdev SA. German rival BMW AG is also testing autonomous vehicles for use in ride-hailing services, while Uber has been developing self-driving technology. U.S. tech firm nuTonomy Inc and ride services company Lyft Inc, which counts General Motors Co as a major shareholder, this month announced they would begin piloting an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service in Boston.

Implementation of supervisory policies and measures has been steady and orderly, and has produced some positive results,  Liu Zhiqing, deputy director general of the China Banking Regulatory Commission's prudential regulation bureau, told reporters. Liu said there has been a drop in banks' riskier businesses, including their wealth management products, interbank certificates of deposit and entrusted loans. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, fell sharply to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.23 billion) in May from 177 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data Liu's comments come at a time that some investors are worried about the impact of China's policy tightening and tighter regulations on banks to force them to deleverage.. The CBRC has been implementing its regulations in a  planned and step-by-step  manner to help banks to contain risks while keeping up support for the real economy, Liu said. Borrowing costs for companies may rise eventually if liquidity conditions in financial markets continue to tighten, Liu said, adding that regulators will try to keep borrowing costs at reasonable levels. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for all Chinese banks stood at 1.99 percent at the end of May, down 0.16 percentage points from a year earlier, Liu said. The ratio covers all Chinese banks, including policy lenders. The more commonly reported NPL ratio for commercial banks was 1.74 percent at the end of March, unchanged from the end of 2016. Liu also said small and medium-sized banks needed to strengthen their liquidity and interest rate management. $1 = 6.8319 Chinese yuan Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-npl-idUSL3N1JJ387"},

It has not yet announced plans for selling the rest of the stake. To begin the process, Delek Drilling established Tamar Petroleum, which will buy the 9.25 percent stake in the field through a $650 million bond offering planned for July, followed by an initial public offering, according to a document filed via the stock exchange.  After examining several alternatives and in view of the interest of foreign and Israeli investors, we decided to establish a corporation which will allow investors optimal direct exposure to the Tamar reservoir,  Chief Executive Yossi Abu told Reuters. Texas-based Noble Energy sold off a 3 percent stake of Tamar last year in a deal valuing the field at $12.3 billion. Using a similar value, Tamar Petroleum could look to raise more than $500 million in its IPO.

In April, Sweden's tax authority won a multi-year fight with the private equity industry over how employees are taxed. The Swedish Administrative Court of Appeals ruled that part of the earnings of around 85 individuals who work or have worked for private-equity firms such as Nordic Capital, Altor, EQT and Segulah should be taxed as salary, not as capital gains, as they have been. Nordic Capital said in a statement it was appealing because it thought the ruling misunderstood facts in the case and contradicted previous rulings. Top income tax rates in Sweden, which is one of Europe's centres for private equity, are around 60 percent, among the highest in the world, and kick in for incomes over $75,000 a year. Capital gains tax is 25 to 30 percent and is not progressive. Private-equity fund managers get a salary from their company and also take a share of the profits from their investments - so-called carried interest. The Swedish Tax Agency has argued carried interest is also a kind of salary. Nordic Capital said partners at NC Advisory, which manage Nordic Capital funds, had been hit particularly hard by the April decision because all carried-interest earnings have been re-defined as salary under the April court rulings. Partners at other private-equity firms had to pay higher tax on only part of their carried-interest earnings under the April rulings because of technical differences in the way the funds were set up. The private-equity industry wants all carried interest to remain taxed as capital rather than salary, and Nordic Capital said a general appeal was likely at a later date. The Supreme Administrative Court must grant leave to appeal before cases can be heard. The ruling covers tax years 2007 to 2012.

Production of rice, the country's staple food, is forecast to drop almost 40 percent to 2.7 million tonnes in 2017, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) said in a report on Thursday. Other crops including pulses, chillies and onion are also expected to take a blow, it said. Sri Lanka was hit by the worst drought in four decades last year, with poor rains continuing into 2017, causing many farmers to lose their crops and income, the agencies said.  In May, the situation was exacerbated by the worst torrential rains in 14 years, which triggered floods and landslides in the country's southwest, killing some 200 people and forcing many from their homes. But in drought-affected areas in the north, rains were not sufficient to replenish reservoirs, and the second 2017 rice paddy harvest is expected to be at least 24 percent lower than last year's, said FAO official Cristina Coslet.  The level of water in irrigation reservoirs is still well below the average,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Some 225,000 households - or 900,000 people - face food insecurity, and have been forced to eat less and lower quality food, the report said. Unable to grow their own crops, many families have to buy food at local markets where prices have spiked due to the crisis, it said.  FAO and WFP said seeds, equipment, irrigation support, and cash assistance are urgently needed to help farmers in the next planting season starting in September, and to prevent conditions from deteriorating.    If (the planting season) fails the situation will worsen a lot for the families affected,  Coslet said. Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Alisa Tang.

Founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, Imagination has been rocked by Apple's announcement in April that it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years time. Apple's decision, which analysts said posed an existential threat to the company, sent Imagination's shares plummeting 70 percent on April 3 and they have barely recovered since. The stock jumped as much as 21 percent on Thursday, however, after the sale announcement to 149.5 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of 425 million pounds ($538 million).  Analysts said potential buyers could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various entities from China, while Apple itself could be interested.  Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group,  the company said.   The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.  Imagination has said it doubted Apple, which accounts for about half of its sales, could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents. Analysts said legal battles were likely and Imagination started a dispute resolution procedure in May with the U.S. giant, which is valued at $761 billion. The British company initially responded to Apple's decision to walk away by putting two of its main divisions up for sale.  That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer,  said Neil Wilson, Senior Market Analyst, ETX Capital.  Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.  The headquarters of technology company Imagination Technologies is seen on the outskirts of London, Britain, June 22, 2017.Hannah McKayApple Reliance Imagination has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed, prompting Apple and Intel to buy stakes and the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012. Apple owns 8 percent of the shares. Imagination struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Slideshow (6 Images)Imagination downplayed fears it could lose Apple contract for years. Facing reports that Apple was building a graphics operation and hiring Imagination staff, the British firm told investors that Apple was just improving its customization of the technology Imagination sold, rather than replacing it.     Analysts at Stifel said they thought interested parties could include those groups that want to develop their own processing technology across platforms such as mobile, wearable tech, vehicles and the so-called Internet of Things.  This could include a coordinated Chinese bid, a hyper-scale vendor from the cloud or some other IP player,  they said.  Imagination said on Thursday it had received indicative proposals for its embedded MIPS technology - processors used in vehicles and home appliances - and its mobile connectivity division Ensigma, the two businesses put up for sale in the wake of the slide in its shares. While Imagination has other clients for its technology, UBS analysts estimated in April that its non-Apple business was worth just 81 million pounds and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013, was worth 77 million pounds. UBS said the company could be worth 110 pence per share on a sum of the parts basis. In May, Jefferies said the wind up value was about 96 pence a share while Morgan Stanley said the company could be worth as little as 106 million pounds, or just 30 pence per share, though its base case was 95 pence. The U.S. investment bank said Imagination's headquarters was worth 40 million pounds.

The amendment, which was approved in March, gives companies the option of striking production sharing agreements (PSA) or service contracts with the government. Oil and gas companies currently operate fields on a concession basis, paying taxes and royalties on profits. The energy ministry will next work on laws that set the terms for production sharing agreements and service contracts, Veerasak said.

The more-than-$150 billion industry saw exports rising 7.6 percent last year, according to a statement from The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM). Revenue for the domestic market is projected to grow at 10-11 percent in 2017/18, NASSCOM added.     Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice president of IT research at Angel Broking, said the statement was  broadly in line with the outlook given by industry players and hence holds no big surprise . India's IT industry is facing uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump considers tougher visa rules, raising fears of higher labor costs as companies look at hiring more expensive U.S. workers. But the industry is also expected to benefit from positive factors such as improvements in financial services and digital businesses, while focusing on increasing investments in digitization and automation, NASSCOM said.  The industry is expected to add around 130,000-150,000 new jobs during the year, the lobby group said.

Export order growth was its strongest in 22 years, the CBI said, helped by the fall in the pound that was triggered by last year's Brexit vote. The strong performance by manufacturers will be noted by the BoE, where three members of the eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee last week voted to raise rates, citing among other factors a pick-up in exports and investment which could help to offset a squeeze in spending for domestic consumers. On Wednesday, the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to vote for a rate hike too later this year, as long as the economic data justified it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his lieutenants have worked in secret for weeks on the bill, which is expected to curb Obamacare's expanded Medicaid help for the poor and reshape subsidies to low-income people for private insurance. Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients' income in the Senate bill, a  major improvement  from a measure approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. Some of the Senate bill's provisions could be political land mines, with individual senators' reactions to it crucial to determining whether or not the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, survives a Republican attack that has been under way since its passage in 2010. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the bill would seek to repeal most of the taxes that pay for Obamacare, give states more latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services. Former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement has been a target of Republican wrath for years. But even with control of both chambers of Congress and the White House since January, the party has struggled to make good on its bold campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare. The law is credited with expanding health insurance to millions of Americans. Republicans say it costs too much and involves the federal government too much in healthcare. President Donald Trump made Obamacare repeal a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and celebrated the House-passed bill. Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican bill will make healthcare unaffordable for poorer Americans while cutting taxes for the wealthy. Tough Sell But McConnell may have a tough job convincing enough Republican senators that the Senate bill improves on the House version. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found nearly 60 percent of adults believed the House bill would make insurance costlier for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Only 13 percent said it would improve healthcare quality. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House bill would kick 23 million people off their healthcare plans. Healthcare is a top priority for voters and many Republicans fear a legislative misstep could hurt them. Collins said she would weigh the CBO's upcoming assessment of the Senate bill's impact on costs and coverage. Conservative Republican Senator Rand Paul, who wants a full repeal of Obamacare, said he feared that with the legislation being developed,  we're actually going to be replacing Obamacare with Obamacare,  referring to the continuing role of government. If legislation is to prevail in the Senate, McConnell can lose the support of only two of his 52 Republicans, assuming all 48 Democrats and independents oppose the bill, as expected.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.6 percent at 7,406.39 points by 0936 GMT, while mid caps peers traded 0.3 percent lower as well. Heavyweight oil firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell both fell around 0.8, with the sector taking 8 points off the index as the price of oil continued to tumble.  Oil has fallen back to levels not seen since mid-November 2016, and traders are worried it could bring about low inflation and diminished growth,  David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said. Lenders Barclays and Lloyds were also among the biggest fallers, down 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively as cyclical stocks came under pressure. United Utilities was the biggest faller, dropping more than 4 percent as its shares traded without entitlement to their latest dividend payout. Shares in bruised Provident Financial were up 3.6 percent, recovering a fraction of their heavy 17.6 percent loss in the previous session after the subprime lender had issued a profit warning. Risers were otherwise fairly defensive, with health stock Shire up over 2 percent after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated its Veyvondi drug which prevents bleeding. Safe-haven precious metals miners Fresnillo and Randgold were also in demand as the price of gold rose. Outside of the blue chips, small cap constituent Imagination Technologies jumped as much as 21 percent after putting itself up for sale. The tech firm has struggled ever since Apple, its biggest customer, said in April that it would develop its own graphics chips, sending its shares more than 60 percent lower in the immediate aftermath.  Without Apple we are not convinced of the long term viability of the business model,  analysts at N+1 Singer said in a note.  The stock remains firmly in special situation territory, but given the likelihood of an offer emerging we move our recommendation to 'Hold'.

Last week, U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg in Washington ruled in favor of Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who said more environmental analysis of the Dakota Access line should have been carried out. The tribes had said the 1,170-mile (1,880 km) line violates their hunting, fishing and environmental rights. On Wednesday, Boasberg set out a schedule of hearings that will decide what will happen to the line while additional review is completed.  A lawyer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for environmental review, would not estimate when asked by Boasberg how long additional review would take. The judge could still order the line to be shut at a later date following a series of hearings scheduled through the summer.  Our view has been that the pipeline should be shut down,  said Jan Hasselmann, attorney for the tribes. Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N) built the $3.8 billion pipeline to move crude from the Northern Plains to the Midwest and then on to the Gulf of Mexico. The line runs from western North Dakota into Patoka, Illinois, where it hooks up with another line to refiners in the Gulf of Mexico.  ETP said on Wednesday it was  pleased with the judge's decision  for pipeline operations to continue while the process  unfolds.  The Native American tribes have been protesting the line's construction for more than a year. The line finally went into service in June.

Diageo said late on Wednesday it would pay $700 million initially for the company, co-founded by the American actor, with potential payment of a further $300 million linked to performance over 10 years. The deal comes two weeks after Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) took a stake in mezcal maker Del Maguey, and highlights the opportunity companies see in Mexico's native spirits.  Several new, high-end tequilas has helped the drink change its traditional image as a party beverage for young drinkers. Its sales rose 5.2 percent globally last year, according to data tracker IWSR, outperforming a spirits industry that edged up only 0.3 percent.  Diageo did not disclose revenue or profit figures, but Morgan Stanley estimates the deal's enterprise value was about 20 times annual turnover, which an industry source said would make it much pricier than other spirits deals, which he said often get done at about 4 to 6 times sales.      Diageo's North American president, Deirdre Mahlan, told reporters that high-growth companies like Casamigos were  notoriously challenging to value under traditional methods . Casamigos, which means  house of friends,  was founded in 2013 by Clooney and his friends - nightlife entrepreneur Rande Gerber, who is married to model Cindy Crawford, and real estate developer Mike Meldman. They will continue to promote the brand. Diageo, which has arrangements with other celebrities including David Beckham and Sean Combs, said Casamigos would be neutral to earnings for the first three years and add to earnings thereafter.

But if not, it might be value destructive.  They said the success of Casamigos, which has grown 54 percent over the last two years, depended on the brand owners' star status, and flagged a risk of losing focus in the next 10 years.  Diageo's shares were down 1.3 percent at 0923 GMT on Thursday, underperforming the FTSE .FTSE. A man walks past barrels outside the Diageo Shieldhall facility near Glasgow, Scotland August 26, 2010.David MoirThe brand sold 120,000 cases in 2016, primarily in the United States, and is on track to reach over 170,000 by the end of the year. Diageo said expanding the brand to Europe would be a source of future growth. Casamigos sells for $45 to $55 per bottle, about the same price as Diageo's other Don Julio tequila. Bernstein analysts said Diageo could successfully sell both, with Casamigos promoted as a celebrity lifestyle brand, and Don Julio positioned as a heritage craft spirit, but they were sceptical.  In our experience, it is difficult for sales, distributors and customers to focus on two brands in the same category at similar price points at the same time,  they said.  Diageo distributed the much bigger Jose Cuervo brand  outside of Mexico until 2012, following its failure to strike a deal to buy it outright from the its founding family. In 2015, it took over the Don Julio brand it had previously shared with the family, trading it for its Bushmills Irish whiskey and cash.  The Casamigos deal is expected to close in second half of the year. Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/diageo-ma-casamigos-idUSL8N1JI599"},

The outperformance came even though crude prices resumed their slide. With Brent futures now down more than 10 percent in June, most oil-exporting emerging markets are under pressure, while broader emerging assets have also traded sideways this week amid concern over slowing U.S. inflation and growth. MSCI's emerging equity index firmed 0.2 percent, after two days of losses thanks to some recovery in Asia while most emerging currencies firmed against the tepid dollar. But the biggest winner of the day was Saudi Arabia which hit 20-month highs after MSCI put it on the watchlist for index inclusion and also the promotion of Mohammed bin Salman to the position of crown prince. The index had jumped 5.5 percent on Wednesday. Prince Mohammed has spearheaded the kingdom's reform push, including privatising part of the state oil firm Aramco. Jason Tuvey at Capital Economics noted an estimated 2.4 percent weight would see $38 billion in inflows to Saudi stocks, sufficient cover the current account gap one-and-half times over. But the optimism may be overdone, he warned.  There was a lot of optimism ahead of the opening of the Saudi stock market to foreign investors in mid-2015. Since then, however, the proportion of stocks owned by  qualified foreign investors  has remained limited and the (index) has fallen by 25 percent, taking their lead from oil prices.   The second reason for caution is that oil prices are likely to remain the key driver of Saudi equity prices.  The oil factor kept most other Gulf markets under pressure ahead of the weekend and week-long Eid holiday, and while Qatari stocks rose 2 percent on the day they are down 3 percent this week as its spat with other Gulf states dragged on. The oil prices weighed also on Russian assets where the rouble has tumbled to 4-1/2 month lows to the dollar, though it firmed half a percent on Thursday. Russian stocks fell half a percent and 10-year bond yields rose five basis points, approaching recent one-month highs. Chinese mainland shares were in buoyant mood after index provider MSCI said it would allow some of them into the emerging markets benchmark from 2018. Shenzen-listed blue chip shares jumped to 18-month highs though profit-taking erased the gains towards end of the day to close the index flat while Shanghai shares lost 0.3 percent.

Production of rice, the country's staple food, is forecast to drop almost 40 percent to 2.7 million tonnes in 2017, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) said in a report on Thursday. Other crops including pulses, chillies and onion are also expected to take a blow, it said. Sri Lanka was hit by the worst drought in four decades last year, with poor rains continuing into 2017, causing many farmers to lose their crops and income, the agencies said.  In May, the situation was exacerbated by the worst torrential rains in 14 years, which triggered floods and landslides in the country's southwest, killing some 200 people and forcing many from their homes. But in drought-affected areas in the north, rains were not sufficient to replenish reservoirs, and the second 2017 rice paddy harvest is expected to be at least 24 percent lower than last year's, said FAO official Cristina Coslet.  The level of water in irrigation reservoirs is still well below the average,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Some 225,000 households - or 900,000 people - face food insecurity, and have been forced to eat less and lower quality food, the report said. Unable to grow their own crops, many families have to buy food at local markets where prices have spiked due to the crisis, it said.  FAO and WFP said seeds, equipment, irrigation support, and cash assistance are urgently needed to help farmers in the next planting season starting in September, and to prevent conditions from deteriorating.    If (the planting season) fails the situation will worsen a lot for the families affected,  Coslet said. Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Alisa Tang.

The swifter recovery of U.S. banks and the U.S. economy after the global financial crisis of 2008 have funded a stronger dollar in recent years, firstly against the yen JPY= in 2012 and 2013 and then more broadly from the second half of 2014. But those moves have long been stalling against the euro EUR= and the yen, and a downturn in data - and faith in the economic promises of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration - this year have brought the index that measures the greenback's broader strength down from 14-year peaks. .DXY   We believe the USD super-cycle of the past five years is over: the cyclical divergence that helped the dollar in these years has likely peaked, not only because of the European recovery, but also because the U.S. business cycle is more advanced than in Europe,  Barclays said in an updated global outlook dated June 22.  Valuations also suggest downside risks over the medium term, though for the immediate future, we expect the dollar to move sideways against major currencies.  The bank accompanied the report with new currency forecasts which called for the dollar to weaken by 2-3 percent against China's yuan over the next year CNY= and by almost 7 percent against the yen.  It forecast the U.S. currency would strengthen to $1.06 per euro at the start of next year, before weakening back to $1.12, close to current levels.

Mytaxi Chief Executive Andrew Pinnington said the company was paying an “eight figure” sum to buy Romanian market leader Clever Taxi, which operates in 20 cities across the country.  Earlier this year, Hamburg-based mytaxi bought Greece’s Taxibeat, and Pinnington said he expected more acquisitions to help to expand the service in Eastern Europe. “The major driving factor is strategic, to grab market share and extend into more geographic territories,” he said in a telephone interview. The growth of ride-hailing services and the prospect of driverless vehicles has led to predictions that people will switch to paying for individual journeys rather than buying their own cars. My Taxi logo are displayed on the smarphone and display in this illustration taken June 22, 2017.Dado RuvicTo ensure they do not become providers of low-margin commoditized hardware to companies like Uber in the future, Stuttgart-based Daimler and rivals are investing in ride-hailing app companies like mytaxi, Lyft, Grab, Gett and others which connect drivers and passengers. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has taken a $300 million stake in Gett and General Motors (GM.N) invested $500 million in Lyft. Like Uber, mytaxi links drivers with passengers in return for a share of the fare paid. But mytaxi focuses on metered taxis, while Uber relies on unmetered cars and drivers who are not formally registered as taxi drivers.  Uber’s approach allows it to charge lower fares but has led to frequent battles with local and national authorities, especially in Europe where the taxi market is heavily regulated. Restrictions on its service have prompted it to pull back from some markets and led some analysts to question the sustainability of its model in continental Europe. Pinnington said mytaxi’s model was to offer its service within the existing regulatory framework, and to charge a lower commission to drivers – around half the 20-25 percent Uber takes.

We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people ... Is there any one of the royal family who wants to be king or queen?   Harry, 32, who is fifth in line to the throne, told the Newsweek magazine  I don't think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.  Queen Elizabeth, 91, has been on the throne since 1952 and is currently the world's oldest and longest reigning monarch.

[nL8N1HT34O] In the interview, Harry said how the decision to make him walk behind her coffin as the funeral cortege slowly made its way through the packed streets of London in front of huge crowds of mourners when he was just 12 had had a lasting impact.

The bank added a rate cut was no longer likely and that rates would probably begin to rise in 2019. It had previously said rates were more likely to fall than to increase in the short term. All 14 economists polled by Reuters had predicted the bank would leave the deposit rate unchanged. The bank said it expected the key policy rate would be 0.5 percent in 2017 and 2018, compared with a March forecast of 0.4 percent.  The forecast is little changed on the March Report, but is a little higher in 2017 and 2018, and a little lower towards the end of the forecast horizon,  the central bank said in a statement on Thursday. Still, the bank said it expected the key policy rate would stay at its current level in the period ahead. Oil producer Norway has seen economic growth slow and unemployment rise following the drop in crude prices since mid-2014, but the central bank and the government both expect a gradual recovery.  It was as we expected and actually moving from easing bias to neutral bias on the short term,  said Frank Jullum, chief economist at Danske Bank.  They still expect the first hike to be at the end of 2019 or 2020. I think the first hike will be much sooner, at late 2018.  Norway's currency, the crown, strengthened against the euro and the dollar after the bank's decision, which was unanimous.  We were a bit unsure if they would remove the downside bias, but they did and now it's as likely with a rate hike as a rate cut,  said Nordea Markets chief economist Kjetil Olsen.  This indicates that we definitely have seen the rate bottom and that the first rate hike is closer now.

But suspicions he may have helped a friend get favored treatment for a business, then rammed legislation through parliament to close the session and end debate over the issue, have led to a sharp slump in support. A metropolitan assembly election in Tokyo on July 2, campaigning for which starts on Friday, could give clues about how stable his administration really is - a key concern of global investors.  Things are unraveling fast for Abe and his inner circle,  said Gerry Curtis, a professor emeritus at Columbia University.   I still put my money on Abe surviving and getting a third term, but I am willing to wager much less than I would have put on the table a week ago.  At the core of Abe's troubles are concerns he may have intervened to help Kake Gakuen (Kake Educational Institution), whose director, Kotaro Kake, is a friend, win approval for a veterinary school in a special economic zone. The government has not granted such an approval in decades due to perceived glut of veterinarians. Abe has repeatedly denied doing Kake any favors.  Potentially more troublesome than the suspicions themselves is the impression among many voters that Abe and his aides, unchallenged and arrogant after more than four years in office, tried to suppress the scandal, in part by smearing an ex-official who went public with allegations and by rushing a contentious bill through parliament to close off debate.  Chief Cabinet Secretary (Yoshihide) Suga's haughty attitude at his news conference and his attack on the former official personally were a mistake,  said one Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker.   That sort of condescending attitude makes people angry.  Abe, who resigned abruptly after a troubled 2006-2007 tenure as premier, can seek another three-year consecutive term as LDP leader, and hence premier, from September 2018.  No general election need be held until late 2018, but Tokyo voters have a chance to express their views soon. On the surface, the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election is a referendum on Governor Yuriko Koike, a former defense minister now challenging the old-boy network dominated by the LDP. Koike, sometimes floated as a potential successor to Abe after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, hopes her  Tokyo Residents First  party and its allies will take a majority in the 127-seat local legislature. Among her allies is the Komeito party, Abe's national coalition partner. Bellwether Poll  The capital's poll is often a bellwether for national trends.  If the LDP loses half of its seats in the July Tokyo election, there will be worries about instability of the Abe administration,  said Tomoaki Fujii, head of the investment research division at Akatsuki Securities Inc.  Koike may have lost some of her luster lately after a year in office and delays in deciding whether the move of the world-famous Tsukiji fish market would go ahead. The main opposition Democratic Party, meanwhile, is struggling with single digit support rates.  But the LDP is worried.   Past Tokyo assembly elections have definitely affected national politics,  Hakubun Shimomura, head of the LDP's Tokyo chapter and an Abe ally, told reporters this week.  The prime minister's ratings tumbled in surveys released this week, sliding 10 points to 36 percent in a Mainichi newspaper survey and 12 points to 49 percent in one by the Yomiuri newspaper.  Abe has pledged to regain voter trust, but his ruling bloc is resisting opposition calls to have committees address the Kake Gakuen reports while parliament is closed. Opposition parties can demand an emergency session but the cabinet has ignored such demands in the past. An extra session of parliament is expected in the autumn.  Last week, under public pressure, the education ministry produced documents that opposition parties argued proved Abe was involved in the approval of Kake Gakuen's school.  The ministry had earlier said the documents could not be found in an internal probe, and chief cabinet secretary Suga said the idea that such documents existed was  dubious . On Tuesday, the ministry also released an internal memo  suggesting Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda, a close Abe ally, was involved. Hagiuda has denied he had received or conveyed instructions from the premier. Abe's support rates have dipped and then rebounded in the past. If they remain limp or worsen, LDP rivals would be encouraged to mount a challenge, and revising the constitution - a politically divisive step - would be tough. The U.S.-drafted constitution has never been amended since it was adopted after World War Two. Conservatives are keen to revise what they see as a humiliating symbol of Japan's defeat, but others see the charter as the foundation for the country's post-war democracy and peace, and oppose altering it.

It was from this medieval mosque three years ago that the militants' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a self-styled  caliphate  spanning parts of Syria and Iraq. ''Blowing up the al-Hadba minaret and the al-Nuri mosque amounts to an official acknowledgement of defeat,'' Iraqi Prime Minister said in a brief comment on his website. The Iraqis called the 150-foot (45-metre) leaning minaret Al-Hadba, or  the hunchback.  Baghdadi's black flag had flown  over it since June 2014.  Islamic State's Amaq news agency accused American aircraft of destroying the mosque, a claim swiftly denied by the U.S.-led  coalition fighting the militant group.  We did not strike in that area,  coalition spokesman U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian told Reuters by telephone.   The responsibility of this devastation is laid firmly at the doorstep of ISIS,  U.S. Army Major General Joseph Martin,  commander of the coalition's ground component, said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.  The media office for Iraq's military distributed a picture taken from the air that appeared to show the mosque and minaret largely flattened and reduced to rubble among the small houses of the Old City, the historic district where the militants are under siege.

An Iraqi military spokesman gave the timing of the explosion as 9:35 p.m (1835 GMT).  This is a crime against the people of Mosul and all of Iraq, and is an example of why this brutal organization must be annihilated,  said U.S. Major General Martin. Iraqi forces said earlier on Wednesday that they had started a push toward the mosque. ''This will not prevent us from removing them, no, killing them not removing them, inside the Old City,'' Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi, senior CTS commander in Mosul, said in a video posted over a messaging app.   A still image taken from video shows the destroyed Grand al-Nuri Mosque of Mosul in Iraq, June 21, 2017. Iraqi Military Handout/via Reuters TVThe forces on Tuesday had encircled the jihadist group's stronghold in the Old City, the last district under Islamic State control in Mosul. Baghdadi proclaimed himself  caliph,  or ruler of all Muslims, from the mosque's pulpit on July 4, 2014, after the insurgents overran vast swathes of Iraq and Syria.  Baghdadi's speech from the mosque was the first time he revealed himself to the world, and the footage broadcast then is to this day the only video recording of him as  caliph.  Minaret Was Vulnerable Iraqi officials had privately expressed hope that the mosque could be retaken in time for Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. The first day of the Eid falls this year on June 25 or 26 in Iraq. Slideshow (3 Images) The battle for the liberation of Mosul is not yet complete, and we remain focused on supporting the Iraqi Security Forces with that objective in mind,  said Martin.  The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate,  even though Islamic State would still control territory west and south of the city, the largest over which they held sway in both Iraq and Syria. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The mosque was named after Nuruddin al‑Zanki, a noble who fought the early crusaders from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It was built in 1172-73, shortly before his death, and housed an Islamic school. By the time renowned medieval traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta visited two centuries later, the minaret was leaning. The tilt gave the landmark its popular name: the hunchback. It was built with seven bands of decorative brickwork in complex geometric patterns also found in Persia and Central Asia. Nabeel Nouriddin, a historian and archaeologist specialising in Mosul and its Nineveh region, said the minaret had not been renovated since 1970, making it particularly vulnerable to blasts even if it was not directly hit. The Mosque's destruction occurred during the holiest period of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, its final 10 days. The night of Laylat al-Qadr falls during this period, marking when Muslims believe the Quran was revealed to prophet Mohammed. Islamic State fighters have destroyed many Muslim religious sites, churches and shrines, as well as ancient Assyrian and Roman-era sites in Iraq and in Syria. The group posted videos online in 2015 showing the destruction of artifacts in the Mosul museum, some of which dated from the 7th century BC. It is also suspected of selling artifacts. additional reporting by Ahmed Rasheed in Baghdad and Phil Stewart in Washington; writing by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Toni Reinhold","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-mosque-idUSKBN19C2Q1"},

The push comes amid growing legal uncertainty, both in the United States and across the globe, about how technology firms must comply with government requests for foreign-held data. That has raised alarm that criminal and terrorism investigations are being hindered by outdated laws that make the current process for sharing information slow and burdensome. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel, will announce the company's framework during a speech in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that wields influence in the Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. The speech urges Congress to update a decades-old electronic communications law and follows similar efforts by Microsoft Corp . Both companies had previously objected in court to U.S. law enforcement efforts to use domestic search warrants for data held overseas because the practice could erode user privacy. But the tech industry and privacy advocates have also admitted the current rules for appropriate cross-border data requests are untenable. The Mountain View, California-based company calls for allowing countries that commit to baseline privacy, human rights and due process principles to directly request data from U.S. providers without the need to consult the U.S. government as an intermediary. It is intended to be reciprocal. Countries that do not adhere to the standards, such as an oppressive regime, would not be eligible. Google did not detail specific baseline principles in its framework.  This couldn't be a more urgent set of issues,  Walker said in an interview, noting that recent acts of terrorism in Europe underscored the need to move quickly. Current agreements that allow law enforcement access to data stored overseas, known as mutual legal assistance treaties, involve a formal diplomatic request for data and require the host country obtain a warrant on behalf of the requesting country. That can often take several months. In January, a divided federal appeals court refused to reconsider its decision from last year that said the U.S. government could not force Microsoft or other companies to hand over customer data stored abroad under a domestic warrant. The U.S. Justice Department has until midnight on Friday to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court. It did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. judges have ruled against Google in similar recent cases, however, elevating the potential for Supreme Court review. Companies, privacy advocates and judges themselves have urged Congress to address the problem rather than leave it to courts. Google will also ask Congress to codify warrant requirements for data requests that involve content, such as the actual message found within an email. Chris Calabrese, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said Google's framework was  broadly correct  but urged caution about the process for letting countries make direct requests to providers.  We need to make sure the people in the club are the right people,  he said.

The changes, announced on Thursday, come amid a strategy review at the Abu Dhabi carrier as once rapidly expanding Gulf airlines face tighter profit margins amid overcapacity in the market and tighter corporate travel budgets. The fee for economy passengers to access the business class lounge at Abu Dhabi International Airport will start from 370 dirhams ($101) and will depend on how much time is spent in the lounge, an Etihad spokesman said. It will also offer economy class passengers paid access to its lounges at other airports around the world. The changes, effective on July 3, will also allow business class passengers to pay to use the first class lounges, whilst a previously complimentary chauffeur for business and first class passengers will become a paid for service outside of Abu Dhabi. Etihad will also open up the service to economy passengers. Will Horton, senior analyst at Australian aviation consultancy CAPA, said chauffer services have always been a high-cost for airlines so to start charging for them was  not surprising.  Passengers travelling in the three-room suite available on Etihad's Airbus A380s, dubbed 'The Residence,' will not be charged. Rival Emirates said in January it would allow economy class passengers who are frequent flyer members to pay to access its lounges. That followed an earlier decision to introduce fees for advanced seat selection for economy passengers. Other changes at Etihad include introducing a bidding system for economy passengers to pay to have up to three empty seats next to their own, following similar systems in place at some other airlines.  Airlines are increasingly asking what they have and do not sell but could,  Horton said.  Airlines have been allowing passengers to bid for upgrades but guaranteeing an empty seat next to you is still catching on.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.4 percent, on track for its third day of straight losses, while the blue chips dropped 0.6 percent. The price of oil fell further as worries persisted over global oversupply, with Europe's energy sector down 1.5 percent, close to 7-month lows, and mining stocks also retreated 0.7 percent.  What didn't help were those conflicting comments from OPEC ... and Iran. They need to be singing from the same hymn sheet if we are to believe that there's positivity to be taken from these cuts while the U.S. continues to produce more and the rig-count goes up,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.  As we saw yesterday, even a drawdown in stockpiles offered absolutely no help because it just added to the murky outlook.  Health care was the top-gaining sector, however, up 0.7 percent with Switzerland's Novartis in the driving seat as its shares advanced nearly 3 percent, following a positive study result for its canakinumab medicine, which cuts risks for heart attack survivors.  Expectations around this catalyst have been low and as a result we have previously highlighted success could drive 3% to 5% upside to mid-term EPS and valuations,  analysts at Jefferies said in note. Elsewhere, Imagination Tech, once a high flyer as a supplier of graphics technology to Apple <AAPL.O, soared more than 20 percent after it put itself up for sale. In April, Apple said that it would no longer use Imagination's graphics technology in the iPhone, wiping out more than 60 percent of the British firm's market value. Broker action also lifted shares in industrial machinery firms Rotork and Alfa Laval, which both rose more than 3 percent following double upgrades from Morgan Stanley to  overweight . The broker said that it was positive on forecasts for Alfa Laval's divisions, and saw growth potential for Rotork's products. Morgan Stanley was more pessimistic around the oil sector, however, with analysts saying in a note that they expected concerns around a 2018 oil supply glut to weigh. This put pressure on shares in Subsea 7, Amec Foster Wheeler, TGS NOPEC Geophysical Company and Tullow Oil, which were all down between 2.6 to 4.8 percent at the bottom of the STOXX.

However, the new crown prince has already made Saudi foreign policy less predictable and, in Fitch's view, his promotion could raise tensions with Iran further. Given Mohammed bin Salman's rise, it had long been uncertain whether previous crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef would stay in the role. The decision to replace Mohammed bin Nayef has clarified the succession process, as there are now no obvious challengers. Tensions within the royal family could still possibly lead to changes in the succession process, but the probability is relatively low. At 31, the new crown prince is also much younger than previous holders of the title. Therefore, his eventual succession may lead to a very long period in power, breaking the pattern of relatively short reigns by elderly leaders. Mohammed bin Salman was instrumental in setting up the Vision 2030 reform agenda and its implementation plans, including the National Transformation Programme 2020, the Fiscal Balance Programme and the plan to partly privatize Saudi Aramco. Together, these reforms intend to reduce oil dependence and ensure the long-term viability of public finances. Under his leadership of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs, Saudi economic policy has surprised most observers by its boldness, including early cuts in subsidies, which has helped to build confidence in the government's ability to rein in large fiscal deficits. His promotion will entrench the reform agenda and makes it more likely that the main elements of Vision 2030, including the Saudi Aramco IPO, will go ahead. The new crown prince has been the key driving force behind the Saudi-led war against the Houthis in Yemen and the boycott of Qatar. The war in Yemen remains unresolved despite the superior fighting power of the Saudis and their allies. The boycott on Qatar could also still backfire by driving Qatar closer to Iran or simply by showing the limits of Saudi power if Qatar still refuses to submit to demands. Mohammed bin Salman has also used confrontational rhetoric over Iran. While Fitch still sees the risk of direct outright Saudi-Iran confrontation as low, his rise, as well as the ambiguous statements from the US administration, mean that further escalation cannot be excluded.

The European planemaker said it had won 326 net new orders and commitments against its estimate of the comparable Boeing tally of 443, excluding conversions from other models to support the launch of its new Boeing 737 MAX 10. Based on firm new orders, Airbus said it was a tie.  Is this a slower show than previous years? Yes, it is. Are we conceding that Boeing sold a few more airplanes than we did? Yes,  said Airbus sales chief John Leahy. Leahy said he had expected the new Boeing plane to make more of a splash.  The only negative thing I would see is that we had expected they would have had a bigger launch on the 737 MAX 10, not quite as many conversions, more incremental orders.

The military seized power in a May 2014 coup it said was necessary to end months of unrest, including street protests aimed at ousting a populist, civilian government. It blamed short-term populist policies introduced by previous civilian governments as a source of more than a decade of political instability. Since then, the junta has sought to put in place measures, including political reforms, which it says are necessary to bring order to the country before an election can be held in 2018. The military-appointed National Legislative Assembly, the country's parliamentary body, voted unanimously to pass the bill on Thursday.   The assembly approves of the National Strategy Act and enacts it as law,  said Pornpetch Wichitcholchai, head of the assembly.  The law will set up a committee to be chaired by the prime minister, coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha. It will include the heads of the armed forces, representatives of Thai businesses and industries and other experts. The committee will work with the cabinet of future governments to revise plans for national strategy every five years over the next two decades.  In the same session, the assembly also approved a national reform bill which will create at least ten committees to draft reform plans in areas including politics, law and the economy.  The duration of the national strategy and the fact that it will be legally binding for future governments has fueled concerns among critics that the army aims to maintain its grip on power no matter who wins the next election.   This 20-year plan is designed to embed the military's role and supervision over Thai politics and economy for the long term,  said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS) at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.  It will take place at the expense of elected representatives and ensure that military and bureaucratic elite hold sway regardless of electoral outcomes.  In April, Thailand's new King Maha Vajiralongkorn signed a military-backed constitution, the country's 20th since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, which critics have said will also give the generals a powerful say over Thai politics for years, if not decades.

When asked what the chances were of a deal by next Thursday, DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson, told BBC radio:  I think very good,  adding  the sooner the better .  After her botched gamble on a June 8 snap election deprived her Conservative Party of a majority in the 650-seat Westminster parliament, May is trying to get the support of the DUP's 10 lawmakers to avoid a second election. Since talks began with the DUP almost two weeks ago in the chaos following May's unexpected loss of her majority, the negotiations have followed an uncertain course with conflicting signals about whether a deal would be struck. Donaldson, who is helping to lead the detailed talks from the DUP side, told Ireland's RTE that talks had made progress and that he hoped for a deal before a vote on May's legislative plan which is due next Thursday.  They're (talks) going well, we've made progress and I'm hoping we've an agreement before voting on the queen's speech,  he said. May, the Conservatives and the DUP have much to lose without a deal: May could be out of a job, the Conservatives could face another election and the DUP would lose their best chance in decades to secure more financing for Northern Ireland. When asked whether May would still be prime minister at the end of this year, her finance minister Philip Hammond told the BBC:  Yes I do.   The prime minister is moving this process, the agreement process, forward,  Donaldson said.  She's engaged now and we welcome that and I think that since that has happened we have been moving forward.  Still, there is brinkmanship on both sides. The DUP, which won 292,316 votes in the election, does not want to sink May's government because it fears Jeremy Corbyn, who has in the past appeared beside their Irish nationalist opponents Sinn Fein, could get into power.  I'll say this about Ulster men and Ulster women, we are no pushover,  he said.

Grindeanu fell in a no-confidence vote initiated by his own party, which is controlled by political adversary Liviu Dragnea. Dragnea is expected to come up with a new candidate by Monday, when President Klaus Iohannis considers his choice.     Centrist President Klaus Iohannis has said he will only approve a candidate who has a clean criminal record - something that prevents Dragnea, who has a conviction for vote rigging, from taking the top job himself.      The leu will probably stick to this area of under 4.6 for a while until markets see what is going on with the new government,  said one trader with a foreign bank in Bucharest.      But I don't think there are reasons for it to appreciate. There is instability, unpredictability and (hasty) policies.      Iohannis rejected Dragnea's candidate for prime minister in December after his party won an election by a wide margin.       It can only be hoped that Dragnea will choose his candidate wisely. Otherwise President Iohannis will once again be unable to agree and a deepening of the crisis will be inevitable. Against this background (the leu) will remain under depreciation pressure against the euro,  analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.     All other currencies also moved in tight ranges on Thursday.     In the Czech Republic, the crown could continue to appreciate, albeit slower, despite a fresh message from several rate-setters, including central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok, that rate hikes may come later than expected.     A strengthening Czech crown may lead to a slower rise of interest rates, possibly pushing a move beyond the third quarter projected in the central bank's latest economic outlook, Rusnok was quoted as saying on Wednesday.      We view the change of guidance as the result of declining inflation momentum around the region, and declining probability of the ECB hiking rates anytime soon,  Commerzbank said.      But such a change of guidance is likely to slow down the pace of CZK appreciation from here - we forecast EUR-CZK to stay stable at around 26.00 through end-2017.      Stocks around the region fell moderately except in Budapest  where majors OTP Bank and Richter fuelled mild gains.     French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday singled out Hungary and Poland when he said EU states that spend the bloc's finances but turn their backs on its principles should feel  the full political consequences .     Macron will meet leaders of the Visegrad Four nations of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic at a summit of the European Council on Thursday and Friday.

Spot gold        rose 0.5 percent to $1,252.41 per ounce at 0812 GMT. It rose 0.3 percent in the previous session, its largest intraday percentage change since June 6.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,253.30 per ounce.      A softer U.S. dollar and a risk-off bias following the recent declines to crude saw gold turn higher during Asian hours on Thursday,  MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.     Oil turned lower on Thursday after posting gains earlier in the session as traders look ready to test new lows for crude prices with worries persisting over a global glut.                The uncontrolled oil price spill in the futures markets may have seen some traders pushing the risk aversion button and buying gold,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.          The primary driver appears to be the flattening of the longer-dated U.S. Treasury curve.           The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to almost 10-year lows on Wednesday as investors evaluated the impact of hawkish Federal Reserve policy on the economy even as inflation measures are deteriorating.                       U.S. home resales unexpectedly rose in May to the third highest monthly level in a decade and a chronic inventory shortage pushed the median home price to an all-time high.                       Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates and yields, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.      Investors are waiting for any clues on whether the timing of the next rate hike is September or December,  said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.     Spot gold may bounce more into a range of $1,257 to $1,261 per ounce, as it has cleared a resistance at $1,251, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                  The U.S. dollar index       , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, retreated from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday.         Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.04 percent to 853.98 tonnes on Wednesday.                  Among other precious metals, silver        gained 1 percent to $16.61 per ounce. Platinum        touched its highest in a week during the session and was up 0.6 percent to $929.20 per ounce, while palladium        slipped 0.8 percent to $880.99 per ounce.

When asked what the chances were of a deal by next Thursday, DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson, told BBC radio:  I think very good,  adding  the sooner the better . After her botched gamble on a June 8 snap election deprived her Conservative Party of a majority in the 650-seat Westminster parliament, May is trying to get the support of the DUP's 10 lawmakers to avoid a second election. Since talks began with the DUP almost two weeks ago in the chaos following May's unexpected loss of her majority, the negotiations have followed an uncertain course with conflicting signals about whether a deal would be struck. Donaldson, who is helping to lead the detailed talks from the DUP side, told Ireland's RTE that talks had made progress and that he hoped for a deal before a vote on May's legislative plan which is due next Thursday.  They're (talks) going well, we've made progress and I'm hoping we've an agreement before voting on the queen's speech,  he said. May, the Conservatives and the DUP have much to lose without a deal: May could be out of a job, the Conservatives could face another election and the DUP would lose their best chance in decades to secure more financing for Northern Ireland. When asked whether May would still be prime minister at the end of this year, her finance minister Philip Hammond told the BBC:  Yes I do.   The prime minister is moving this process, the agreement process, forward,  Donaldson said.  She's engaged now and we welcome that and I think that since that has happened we have been moving forward.  Still, there is brinkmanship on both sides. The DUP, which won 292,316 votes in the election, does not want to sink May's government because it fears Jeremy Corbyn, who has in the past appeared beside their Irish nationalist opponents Sinn Fein, could get into power.  I'll say this about Ulster men and Ulster women, we are no pushover,  he said.

Securing agreement on the purchase of 22 unarmed drones is seen in New Delhi as a key test of defence ties that flourished under former President Barack Obama but have drifted under Trump, who has courted Asian rival China as he seeks Beijing's help to contain North Korea's nuclear programme. Modi's two-day visit to Washington begins on Sunday. Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in April and has also had face-time with the leaders of nations including Japan, Britain and Vietnam since taking office in January, prompting anxiety in New Delhi that India is no longer a priority in Washington. If the Indian navy gets the unarmed surveillance drones it wants to keep watch over the Indian Ocean it would be the first such purchase by a country that is not a member of the NATO alliance.  We are trying to move it to the top of the agenda as a deliverable, this is something that can happen before all the other items,  said one official tracking the progress of the drone discussions in the run-up to the visit. India, a big buyer of U.S. arms recently named by Washington as a major defence ally, wants to protect its 7,500 km (4,700 mile) coastline as Beijing expands its maritime trade routes and Chinese submarines increasingly lurk in regional waters. But sources tracking the discussions say the U.S. State Department has been concerned about the potential destabilising impact of introducing high-tech drones into South Asia, where tensions are simmering between India and Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir, which is divided between them. Other strains have emerged, with the United States vexed by a growing bilateral trade deficit and Trump accusing New Delhi of negotiating unscrupulously at the Paris climate talks to walk away with billions in aid. U.S. officials expect a relatively low-key visit by Modi, without the fanfare of some of his previous trips to the United States, and one geared to giving the Indian leader the chance to get to know Trump personally and to show that he is doing so. Modi is also not expected to press hard on a U.S. visa programme the Trump administration is reviewing to reduce the flow of skilled foreign workers and save jobs for Americans, seeing limited gains from raising a sensitive issue, they said. Indian Trade Secretary Ria Teaotia told reporters this week the H-1B visa programme, under which Indian IT firms send large numbers of professionals to the United States, would be one of the one issues on the table during Modi's visit. Falling Off the Radar  There is a palpable fear in New Delhi that the new U.S. president's lack of focus on India, and limited appointment of South Asia focused advisors, has resulted in India falling off the radar in Washington,  Eurasia Group's Shailesh Kumar and Sasha Riser-Kositsky said in a note. Defence deals, however, are one area where the two countries could make progress because of bipartisan support, an Indian official involved in the preparations for the visit said. The two sides have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to get inter-agency clearance for the sale of the Guardian drone, made by California-based General Atomics. India has raised the issue of the drones with the Pentagon three times since June 2016, officials said. U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Mark Warner wrote in March to Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying the Guardian deal, estimated at more than $2 billion, would advance U.S. national security interests and protect U.S. jobs. An industry official involved in promoting India-U.S. business ties said the drone sale enjoyed support from the White House and Congress, and was now awaiting clearance from the State Department. While the Guardian drones that India is pushing for are unarmed, the Indian military had originally asked for missile-firing Predator Avenger aircraft, a request turned down by the Obama administration. Sources say there is some concern in the State Department that if India were to get the surveillance drones New Delhi would renew its push to acquire armed drones, which its military has eyed ever since they were deployed by U.S. forces against militants in Pakistan. U.S. export laws typically prohibit the transfer of such arms to a country unless it is fighting alongside U.S. forces. Fighter Jets India and the United States will also discuss the sale of U.S. fighter jets during Modi's trip, in what could be the biggest deal since they began deepening defence ties more than a decade ago. On Monday, Lockheed Martin announced an agreement with India's Tata Advanced Systems to produce F-16 planes in India, provided it won a contract to equip the Indian Air Force with hundreds of new aircraft. Lockheed has offered to shift its ageing F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas as part of Modi's  Make-in-India  drive while it ramps up production of the high-end F-35 aircraft at home. Since Trump's election on an  American First  platform, U.S. and Indian officials have sought to play down any contradiction between his stated desire to protect American jobs and Modi's  Make in India  policy, arguing, for example, that deals in which components made in the United States are shipped to India for assembly benefit workers in both countries.

Scholars decline to comment specifically on the case, which Dana has filed at a court in the emirate of Sharjah. The company argues it should no longer make payments on the sukuk because the interpretation of Islamic finance standards has changed since they were issued in 2013, making them  unlawful . But many scholars say Islamic instruments are not subject to reinterpretation if they were originally certified by a competent authority.  The matter of compliance is determined at the time of issue,  Sheikh Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, author of a 1996 textbook on Islamic banking that is an industry reference, told Reuters.  Once that bridge is crossed, the matter is closed.  Sharia compliance is embedded in a document and cannot be voided even if some parts of a deal turn out to be faulty, said Mohamad Akram Laldin, executive director of the Malaysia-based International Sharia Research Academy for Islamic Finance. Such arguments may help to determine the result of a dispute that has stunned the Islamic finance industry and made some investors question whether sukuk are safe investments. Dana said last week that since its sukuk were no longer valid, it would not redeem them upon maturity in October. It wants an agreement with creditors to exchange them for new, four-year Islamic instruments offering much lower profit. Unlike other legal systems, sharia has not been codified. It relies on interpretation through a process known as ijtihad, or legal reasoning. That means different views often exist, and over time the consensus among the scholars who certify financial instruments as sharia-compliant can change. For many investors, Dana's case is alarming because it raises the prospect that other companies with Islamic debt could justify not honouring their obligations by claiming sharia standards had changed since the debt was issued. Mudaraba Dana's existing sukuk were originally certified as sharia-compliant by Dar Al Sharia, a unit of Dubai Islamic Bank . The Dubai-based advisory firm did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The sukuk use the mudaraba format, a common structure which resembles an investment management partnership. One party provides funds while the other supplies expertise and management services. A source with direct knowledge of Dana's position said the company would argue its sukuk were invalid because the repurchase price was fixed in advance, while coupon payments were decided with an interest-based calculation and paid regardless of the firm's performance. Several scholars said there was no intrinsic problem in the mudaraba format, however.  With specific reference to mudaraba, there is no sharia authority in the world who would opine that it is a somehow faulty or suspect method of contracting and conducting business,  DeLorenzo said. A fixed repurchase price and coupon payments are common across the industry, said Laldin, who is also deputy chairman of the sharia advisory council of Malaysia's central bank.  There is nothing unusual about the structure. I am not aware of any new ruling about mudaraba that comes from scholars or industry bodies.  Mudaraba is covered by a UAE law dating to 1985, which all the parties would have known when the sukuk was issued, Laldin said. A by-product of the Dana case may be wider implementation around the world of standards issued by the Manama-based Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). AAOIFI's standards are followed wholly or in part by regulators across the globe, although only a handful of countries, including Bahrain and Sudan, make them mandatory. AAOIFI declined to comment on the Dana case. But the dispute illustrates the need for harmonisation of industry practices, AAOIFI secretary-general Hamed Hassan Merah told Reuters.  A lot of regulators are now contemplating whether to implement AAOIFI standards on a mandatory basis. This would eliminate many issues across the industry, especially in cross- border transactions and syndications.  AAOIFI is working on an overhaul of its sharia standard for sukuk, which was issued 15 years ago. A draft is expected this year and a final version in early 2018, Merah said.

The Riyadh stock index surged 5.5 percent in reaction to the appointment of the architect of the economic reform and privatisation plans, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince. Previously the 31-year old was deputy crown prince. The index was up 1.2 percent in the first hour of trade as some shares which were top gainers on the previous day continued to rally with the only listed miner Saudi Arabian Mining jumping surging its 10 percent daily limit in the first half hour of trade. Banks were also strong with government-majority owned National Commercial Bank jumping 7.3 percent, extending on its 10 percent surge on Wednesday. Civil servants' salaries are mainly deposited in their current accounts with NCB. News of the retroactive reinstatement of their allowances, which will bring in between 5 and 6 billion riyals ($1.3 billion to $1.6 billion) according to the finance minister, gave an added boost to the stock. Samba Financial Group was up 4.2 percent and Saudi British Bank added 2.1 percent. Analysts at Dubai-based Exotix said in a note the Saudi banking stocks  screen particularly well  compared to other sectors, because they are trading at a relatively attractive valuation. Also, investors were happy that index compiler MSCI placed Riyadh on the watch list for an emerging market upgrade. Analysts predict the market may gain 20-30 percent through to the decision date in June 2018. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures staying near overnight 10-month lows of $44.35 a barrel weighed on some large cap petrochemical stocks; Saudi Basic Industries was down 1.2 percent. Qatar's stock index rebounded 2.0 percent, snapping four sessions of declines as almost all the traded stocks rose. Vodafone Qatar was up 2.7 percent. Two traders told Reuters local mutual funds and government related funds were buying to help support the market. Meanwhile Abu Dhabi's index fell 0.8 percent as Eshraq Properties, the most traded stock, lost 5.8 percent. On Thursday company said it will meet on July 5 to ratify the sale of the company's shares in real-estate investment fund Ward Holding. Dubai's index was down 0.4 percent.

The sovereign is marketing benchmark notes due February 2023 at a yield of low to mid 7%, and benchmark notes due June 2027 at a yield of high 7% to 8%. Investors have been divided in the run up to the bond hitting the screens over fair value, although many thought it should come wide of Ukraine. But the yield that Belarus has begun marketing its bonds suggests that it is seeking to price inside Ukraine.  Looks tight versus Ukraine,  said a banker away. Ukraine's September 2027s, for example, are bid at 97.024 to yield 8.184%, according to Tradeweb. Belarus last issued a bond in 2011. It has since tried to return a number of times but without success, partly because many banks said they would not touch a deal. The country is one of the more controversial issuers that could try to access the markets. Its outspoken president, Alexander Lukashenko, is on a list of 16 people and nine entities in the country that are subject to US sanctions. However, the sovereign is free to issue international debt as the West tries to re-engage with Belarus. In April, the US extended economic sanctions relief for Belarus for six months, continuing a policy begun during the Obama administration intended to encourage a country traditionally in Russia's orbit to turn to the West. The EU lifted the majority of its sanctions in February 2016, although some restrictive measures are still in place, including an arms embargo. The 144A/Reg S deal is today's business via Citigroup and Raiffeisen Bank International. Belarus is rated Caa1/B-/B-. The bonds are expected to be rated B-/B-.

Barely a week after three members of the central bank's eight-strong rate-setting committee voted to hike record low interest rates, two of the Bank's top officials gave opposing signals on the Bank's stance towards interest rates. Governor Mark Carney in a speech on Tuesday said it was not the right time to raise interest rates, while the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane separately said he expected to vote for a rate rise later this year. Sterling weakened almost 1 percent after Carney's comments, but was bumped higher after Haldane spoke on Wednesday, recovering to as much as $1.2704. It traded 0.1 percent lower on the day at $1.2661 and 88.16 pence per euro on Thursday.  For me the reversal yesterday on the Haldane comments looks overdone,  said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist with CIBC World Markets in London.  I wouldn't be surprised if we were to see sterling drifting lower once again even if Kristin Forbes leaves with another parting shot at the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) in terms of not getting behind the curve.  Outgoing MPC member Kristin Forbes, long an anti-inflation hawk on the BoE committee, is due to speak at London Business School later in the day. Investors were also following political developments, with Prime Minister Theresa May's due to present to EU leaders her approach to giving guarantees to EU citizens over their rights in Britain. After a snap election eroded her Conservative Party's majority in parliament, May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists' Party to form a minority government. Finance minister Philip Hammond said he was confident May would strike a deal with the DUP to gain support for her minority government, and DUP lawmaker Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a  very good  chance of a deal by next Thursday.  Sterling has had its Haldane-inspired lift, and probably has little further upside with the main focus on politics,  Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said in a note.

Exports climbed 13.2 percent in May from a year earlier after April's 8.5 percent increase, commerce ministry data showed on Thursday. A Reuters poll expected an annual rise of 6.3 percent in May.     The jump in exports was the highest annual pace in 52 months.     Exports of electronics jumped 24.2 percent in May from a year earlier while overall vehicle and parts shipments rose 12.5 percent.     In January-May, exports rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier, the highest pace in six years, Pimchanok Vonkhorporn, an official at the Commerce Ministry, said at a briefing.     Overall shipments, worth about two-thirds of Thailand's growth, are just recovering after years of weakness.      The commerce ministry is confident of achieving its 2017 export growth target of 5 percent and sees a strong baht as a short-term factor, Pimchanok said.     The baht has gained more than 5 percent against the dollar this year, competing with the Malaysian ringgit to be Southeast Asia's strongest performer.     Imports in May surged 18.2 percent from a year earlier, above the forecast of a 10.7 percent increase and April's 13.4 percent jump.

The government also raised its view of private consumption - which has been a weak link in the economy - saying that it is picking up gradually. A government official said a pick-up will be sustained on the back of the improving job market and household incomes, which prompted the upgrade of the overall assessment. The upgrade came after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday raised its assessment on private consumption for the first time in six months, describing it as increasingly resilient.  The economy is experiencing a moderate recovery,  the Cabinet Office said in its monthly economic report for June. It dropped a previous reference to delayed improvement in some areas, namely consumer spending, from the overall assessment, which is the first upgrade since December. The BOJ has a slightly rosier view on the economy, which it said has been turning toward a moderate expansion. An official in the Cabinet Office said the underlying economic recovery was not strong enough to be described as expansion. The Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate economic policy, raised its view on capital spending - needed for a sustainable economic recovery - for the first time in four months. Brisk car output and overseas demand for smartphones and IT goods are underpinning capital spending, the official said.  Business investment is picking up,  the Cabinet Office said in the monthly report. The office also raised its assessment on housing construction and public investment. It left unchanged its assessment that exports and output are picking up. Japan's economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter in January-March, led by exports, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly weak despite a tightening job market. The economy is expected to recover moderately, the Cabinet Office said, while sticking to its cautious view on the uncertain global economic outlook and financial market swings.

Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 all slipped 0.3-0.4 percent as trading in Europe got under way. U.S. stock futures were also a touch weaker . Sharp falls in oil prices this week have hurt energy stocks and dampened investors' expectations for higher inflation that would pave the way for tighter monetary policies among major central banks.  As far as the market mentality is concerned, as long as the oil price keeps weakening, this is going to tell us something about the underlying capacity of the global economy to generate inflation on a sustained basis,  said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.6 percent. But Japan's Nikkei ended a touch lower as a stronger yen and a plunge in the shares of auto air bag-maker Takata Corp took a toll on sentiment. Excitement after MSCI included mainland Chinese shares in its emerging market indexes this week further boosted China's stock market, driving the blue-chip CSI300 index to the highest level in 1-1/2 years. Oil prices were subdued as investors' doubts that OPEC-led output cuts would dent a three-year glut offset data showing a drop in U.S. inventories.  The time for contrarian trades in oil is fast approaching, but I would want to see some stability in price and the technicals start to become more convincing,  said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne. U.S. crude futures were a touch weaker at $42.50 a barrel. They closed down 1.6 percent on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Global benchmark Brent was also a tad softer at around $44.78 and within striking distance of seven-month lows hit on Wednesday. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year in the wake of the initial OPEC-led production cut. Subdued inflation and concerns about the outlook for world growth at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates have triggered a flattening in bond yield curves. The gap between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 95 basis points, holding near its narrowest since December 2007. A flattening yield curve is often viewed as a negative economic indicator as it shows concerns about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. In currency markets, the New Zealand dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7257 after the central bank held official cash rates at record lows but sounded less dovish than bears in the market had wagered on. The U.S. dollar eased, falling 0.3 percent to 111.02 yen . The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was roughly flat at 97.54, having retreated from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday. The euro was also flat at $1.1167, after Wednesday's 0.3 percent gain. The weaker dollar lifted spot gold 0.6 percent to $1,253.20 an ounce.

The government also raised its view of private consumption - which has been a weak link in the economy - saying that it is picking up gradually. A government official said a pick-up will be sustained on the back of the improving job market and household incomes, which prompted the upgrade of the overall assessment. The upgrade came after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Friday raised its assessment on private consumption for the first time in six months, describing it as increasingly resilient.  The economy is experiencing a moderate recovery,  the Cabinet Office said in its monthly economic report for June. It dropped a previous reference to delayed improvement in some areas, namely consumer spending, from the overall assessment, which is the first upgrade since December. The BOJ has a slightly rosier view on the economy, which it said has been turning toward a moderate expansion. An official in the Cabinet Office said the underlying economic recovery was not strong enough to be described as expansion. The Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate economic policy, raised its view on capital spending - needed for a sustainable economic recovery - for the first time in four months. Brisk car output and overseas demand for smartphones and IT goods are underpinning capital spending, the official said.  Business investment is picking up,  the Cabinet Office said in the monthly report. The office also raised its assessment on housing construction and public investment. It left unchanged its assessment that exports and output are picking up. Japan's economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter in January-March, led by exports, although wage growth and household spending remain stubbornly weak despite a tightening job market. The economy is expected to recover moderately, the Cabinet Office said, while sticking to its cautious view on the uncertain global economic outlook and financial market swings.

Triggered by Wednesday's sharp fall in oil prices, a key gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations closed in on 1.50 percent for the first time this year, well off its February peak of 1.80 percent. This raises further doubts about the ECB's ability to meet its inflation target of just below 2 percent, analysts said.  It's not good news for the ECB and it maybe reinforces expectations that Draghi can't get inflation back on target, a problem in the U.S. as well at the moment,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  At the end of the day, if inflation is not reviving, the ECB needs to keep a loose policy stance, which helps the periphery in particular.  Lower-rated southern European government bonds are seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's bond buying scheme. Italian and Spanish 10-year borrowing costs were both down 2 basis points on Thursday, both close to multi-month lows. These bonds have also benefited from a reduction of political risk in Italy, after the possibility of a snap election faded and anti-establishment party 5-Star Movement suffered a beating in local votes. But many higher-rated euro zone government bond yields are not far off recent lows either. Germany's 10-year yield , the benchmark for the region, shed a basis point on Thursday to trade at 0.25 percent, not far from a one-month low of 0.225 percent hit last week. French and Belgian 10-year borrowing costs are also close to their lowest levels of 2017.  Central bankers would have thought that after a year weakeness in oil would have been washed away but you can see in the market that market-based inflation expectations move closely with oil prices, for instance the five-year, five-year forward in Europe,  said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Oil turned lower on Thursday after posting gains earlier in the session as traders looked ready to test new lows for crude prices with worries persisting over a global glut.

Two of his last three films (both with actor Salman Khan) were blockbusters, and expectations are high for “Tubelight”, his latest offering which releases this Eid weekend. For all his Bollywood credentials, Khan says he hasn’t left the documentary filmmaker in himself behind, using a smart mix of crowd-pleasing elements and his leading man’s superstardom to convey themes of war, peace and divisive politics.  Khan spoke to Reuters about the narrative in his films, working with the country’s most saleable star, and why he doesn’t think about Khan’s huge fan base while working with him.  Q: After “Tubelight” you are also doing an Indo-China co-production film. Bollywood is also suddenly waking up to the potential of the Chinese market. Business aside, what do you think is the potential for stories from the two countries? A: Despite the language barrier, there is a lot of similarity culturally. There is a certain Asian sensibility that we both have – family values, the way we look at society, gender equality or inequality. In that sense, there can definitely be stories that can work across the two cultures. It can’t just be any story. It has to be carefully thought-out. The potential is huge and that is why people are waking up to it and working towards it. Q: Was the Chinese background crucial for the plot in “Tubelight”? A: Yeah, it had to be the Indo-China war. There are certain issues which come up in the film which would not have come up in any other war, whether 1965 or 1971.  Q: Politics and history is always inherent in your films. How important is it to get authenticity right and also make a mainstream masala film? A: I think authenticity is something you cannot compromise on. You always have to be authentic. How much detail you want to get into and whether you want an academic analysis of issues or not is something you want to balance out. At the end of the day, you want to make sure the film is entertaining. It is only when people are entertained do they come (to see the film) in large numbers and then you can put forth whatever comments on issues. At face value, it should be a film that you should be able to access. The politics should be in the layers underneath.  In “Bajrangi Bhaijaan”, the chicken song is a song that people can easily enjoy at face value, and people do. It is a nice peppy number and Salman is dancing like a chicken. But if you go into the politics of it and you go deeper, you realise it is common to what is happening in our country today. That makes it more profound. That is the trick, right? To be able to slip it in so that it doesn’t look like someone is preaching to you, but it is there and can make you think. Q: Is it important for you to always have a political or social message? A: I think it is important to make a comment on something, otherwise why are you making that film? I agree that a story is a story and you can enjoy it for what it is, but I think inadvertently a filmmaker’s politics will always come through. The way your camera looks at a woman - it can say a lot about you. It doesn’t have to be politics of the political party kind. It could be gender politics. The way you treat the women characters in your film, it gives away your feelings about that topic – whether you treat them frivolously or not. Everything is politics. And everyone has an ideology. Without one, we are animals. Handout picture from 'Tubelight'Q: And when that politics marries the country’s most saleable star, does that make it a more potent combination? A: It definitely makes it more potent because then your word is being carried to more quarters and is being spread to more quarters. What a Salman does to my films is that he gives it a certain reach all across the world that a smaller star would not be able to give. Q: What do you think you bring to Salman’s filmography? A: I would like to believe that I have brought to his filmography a certain sense of coherence in the characters he is playing. (There is) a certain consistency of characters where the same character will not do everything that is in the list book of commercial cinema – he will only do things that his character will allow. That is something audiences are enjoying and that is why ‘Bajrangi’ is his biggest film to date by miles. They enjoyed the consistency of the character and I’d like to believe that’s my contribution. Slideshow (4 Images)Q: Salman’s fan base is a mystery to a lot of us… A: (Interjects) It is a mystery to everybody, even to him.  Q: But don’t you keep them in mind when you are making a film with Salman Khan? Are there dos and don’ts? A: I’ll tell you honestly. We don’t keep them in mind because then (you) do things for people you don’t know. The only person you know is yourself and I believe you have to make a film that you will enjoy watching and then cross your fingers that a larger number of people identify with your vision. If you start succumbing to the pressure of what a star image is, you won’t evolve. For example, if I had given in to the pressure of making an action film with Salman (after “Ek Tha Tiger”), it would have been a safer bet to make another action film with him.  But action was out of my system and I didn’t want to make another action film with him. We took him into a world he has never been in. At that point, everyone said, “this is not what the fans expect… they expect him to beat up people, not to get beaten up, that too by Pakistani police officers.” That was the biggest taboo, but we did it and the audiences lapped it up. By not succumbing to pressure, we did something that turned out better for us. Q: You may not consider the fans, but does Salman Khan have any checklist – things he will or won’t do in films? A: In our first film together he did. He would say, “Kabir, my people expect this and we should do this.” But that changed rapidly. And after ‘Bajrangi’, it never came up. ‘Bajrangi’ was one of those films that did well but also got a lot of love. I don’t know whether we’ll ever get that kind of love again. And that is because people accepted his character for what it was… I believe in “Tubelight”, it will be the same – they will fall in love with his character. Q: You started off as a documentary film-maker but have gone on to make some of India’s most successful mainstream films. Do you think you’ll go back to documentary filmmaking? A: I might. People laugh at this, but ultimately, we are all storytellers and we get our stories from our life experiences. All my life experiences have come from my documentaries. So if I run out of raw material, I might go back (Laughs). It is also the thrill of working with one or two people rather than an invading army that you take when you make a mainstream film. I am still that documentary filmmaker who came to Mumbai to make that one film and go back. Everything else that has happened should be a bonus.

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the 'BBB+' long-term foreign-currency ratings on the following notes issued by CQNA: - USD300 million 2.875% senior unsecured note due 2019 - USD500 million 3.625% senior unsecured note due 2021 - USD200 million 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2026 KEY RATING DRIVERS Linked to Chongqing Municipality: CQNA's ratings are credit-linked to Fitch's internal assessment of the creditworthiness of Chongqing Municipality. The link reflects strong oversight and supervision by the government, mid-range integration with the municipal budget, together with mid-range strategic importance of CQMA's public-sector business to the municipality. These factors indicate the likelihood that CQNA would receive extraordinary support, if needed. CQNA is classified as a credit-linked public-sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Chongqing's Creditworthiness: Chongqing is one of four central-government-controlled municipalities in China and serves as one of the key growth drivers of China's western development. The municipality's gross regional product growth rate was China's fastest in 2016. The strengths are partially offset by its high level of contingent liabilities arising from the state-owned enterprises operating in the municipality, as well as its relatively weak transparency. Strategic Importance Attribute at Mid-range: CQNA is one of the most important urban developers in Chongqing. The company executes the government's urbanisation plan for the Chongqing Nan'an district. Its business focuses on urban infrastructure and primary land development. CQNA also acts as a funding centre for state-owned enterprises within the district. Government Integration Attribute at Mid-Range: Fitch believes support, if required, will ultimately come from the Chongqing municipal government due to the district government's strong fiscal and operational linkage with the Chongqing municipal government, which has provided capital injections and subsidies to monetarily support CQNA's business. Mid-range Legal Status: CQNA is registered as a local state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law and is under the direct supervision of Chongqing Nan'an State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Tight Control and Supervision: The government closely monitors CQNA's financing plan and debt levels. The company regularly reports its budget performance and its board members, except for employee representatives, are appointed by the government. The Control attribute is assessed at Stronger. Weak Standalone Profile: CQNA's standalone credit profile is constrained by the public-service nature of its business of building affordable housing and developing infrastructure projects. The company has some businesses operated on a partly commercial basis, which help make up for losses incurred by its public-service projects. However, these businesses are still far from market-based. The weak standalone credit profile is mitigated by its strategic links with the government. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger or more explicit commitment of support from the municipal government may trigger positive rating action on CQNA. Significant changes to CQNA's strategic importance, dilution of the government's shareholding or reduced implicit government support could lead to a wider rating gap between CQNA and its sponsor. An upgrade of Fitch's credit view on Chongqing Municipality may trigger positive rating action on CQNA. Negative rating action on CQNA could derive from a deterioration of the credit profile of Chongqing Municipality, which could lower Fitch's internal assessment of the municipality's creditworthiness. A rating action on CQNA would also lead to similar action on the ratings on the US dollar notes.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report.

Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The authorities conducted  area clearance operation  over the last two days, uncovering a tunnel, homemade weapons, huts, rations, utensils and other items used by the militants in the training, the newspaper said. More than a million Muslim Rohingya live in apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine, where many majority Buddhists consider them interlopers from Bangladesh. The insurgent group was not immediately available for comment. The insurgents attacked border guard posts in October, provoking a military crackdown in which hundreds were killed, more than 1,000 houses burned down and 75,000 people forced to flee to Bangladesh. The United Nations has established a fact-finding mission to investigate crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the security forces during the counter-offensive. The administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected the allegations and opposes the mission. Photos published on the newspaper's front page showed materials found at the site, in the remote Mayu Mountain range, including 20 black skiing masks, gun powder and long wooden guns believed to have been used during the training. In March, Reuters described how a small group of Rohingya leaders recruited several hundred young men in the run-up to the October offensive, teaching them karate and training them with wooden guns. One man who attacked security forces inside the 80-feet (24.4-metre) tunnel with a machete was  killed in self-defense  on Tuesday, the paper said, while two men were killed on Wednesday.

The authorities appear committed - for now - to containing financial sector risks, which could be positive for system-wide stability if maintained over the medium-term, says Fitch Ratings. However, it remains to be seen if the authorities stay committed should economic growth slow faster than they are willing to tolerate. The authorities are at least likely to tread carefully, given the potential for policy mis-steps - such as the possible triggering of a credit crunch. The latest total social financing (TSF) data point to some migration of credit back on to banks' balance sheets, reversing the trend seen during the second half of 2016. Bank lending growth has held up, while non-loan TSF declined in May (see chart). The main drag on non-loan TSF was a fall in corporate bond issuance, which reflects weaker market liquidity and a rise in bank funding costs that has reduced incentives for banks to invest in corporate bonds and other non-loan financial products. Entrusted loans and bill acceptances also fell in May. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/crackdown_has_cooled_non_loan_financing?sr c=embed  title= Crackdown on Non-Loan Financing  width= 550  height= 647  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > That said, monthly movements in TSF tend to be volatile. A rebound quickly followed on the last two occasions when regulatory tightening caused a monthly decline in non-bank TSF, in July 2014 and May 2016. Moreover, growth in overall TSF stock remains strong in yoy terms, and even rose slightly in April and May. The true test of the new policy stance will come if credit and economic growth start to slow down rapidly. The government is also unlikely to tolerate an extended slowdown in corporate bond issuance, which runs counter to its long-term ambitions to develop China's capital markets. One potential risk involved in trying to contain financial risks is a credit crunch. The slowdown in non-loan activity has already contributed to a tightening of the interbank market, highlighting liquidity pressures. The interbank lending rate averaged 2.88% in May 2017, 23bp higher than in April 2017 and 78bp higher than in May 2016. Deposit growth has also weakened, and M2 growth fell below 10% yoy for the first time in more than 30 years in May. The decision to relax the timeline for banks to conduct internal reviews of their practices, as reported by local media, suggests the authorities will at least be flexible in their implementation of enforcement, even if it does not signal a broad change in approach. They are likely to have been mindful that the original deadline on 12 June could have added seasonal tightness in liquidity. Larger banks have benefitted from tighter liquidity as they are net liquidity providers to the second-tier banks, and we expect an improvement in their net interest margins. Large banks should also be less affected by tighter regulatory enforcement, given their lower exposure in the shadow-banking activities and stronger deposit franchises. In contrast, smaller banks that rely more on the interbank market and shadow-banking activities are facing rising funding costs and capitalisation pressure as assets are brought back on to their balance sheets. Most banks reduced dividend payouts last year, and we expect them to remain low by previous standards. Some banks have plans to issue new capital, in some cases to support growth in on-balance sheet assets.

He also called for maintaining the BOJ's loose pledge to increase its government bond holdings by 80 trillion yen ($721 billion) per year, even though recently the pace of purchases has slowed significantly.  Removing the pledge could cause unnecessary market turmoil,  Iwata told reporters after meeting business leaders in Aomori, northern Japan. Japan's low inflation expectations mean its short-term real interest rate, which is calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates, remains higher than that of the United States, Iwata said. The BOJ must therefore maintain its massive stimulus program, even if global long-term interest rates rise on expectations of stronger world economic growth and steady interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, he said.  Japan is still distant from achieving the BOJ's inflation target and needs support from monetary easing,  Iwata said in a speech.  There is absolutely no need to raise interest rates and diminish the degree of monetary easing, which is not that big compared with that of the United States,  he said. Bond-Buying Pledge Still Necessary Japan's economy expanded at an annualized rate of 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and a boost from private consumption, prompting the BOJ to upgrade its economic assessment in April. But core consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in April from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's target, as companies remain wary of raising prices for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households. The BOJ is set to upgrade its economic assessment but cut its inflation forecast at a quarterly review of its projections in July, sources have told Reuters. Iwata countered the view that recent renewed falls in oil costs could force the BOJ to downgrade again its rosy inflation forecasts at next month's rate review.  I don't think temporary falls in oil costs would affect Japan's inflation trend that much,  he said.  Japan's economy is in a recovery phase and will do very well ahead.  After three years of heavy asset buying failed to drive up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy focus last year to one capping long-term interest rates rather than targeting the pace of money printing. But the central bank maintained a loose pledge to keep buying bonds so its holdings increase at 80 trillion yen per year, partly to appease proponents of aggressive money printing in the nine-member board such as Iwata. Some analysts believe the BOJ will soon abandon the pledge as the pace of bond buying has recently slowed to around 60 trillion yen, making the guidance obsolete and largely symbolic. Iwata dismissed such views, saying that removing the pledge now could cause market turmoil because the BOJ could be forced to ramp up bond buying again if external factors push up Japanese yields.  The BOJ can guide monetary policy more flexibly by keeping the bond-buying pledge and purchasing bonds flexibly under the guidance,  he said. An architect of the BOJ's huge asset-buying program, Iwata has been among board members who place more emphasis on the boost the bank's massive money printing could have on the economy and inflation expectations. Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented the BOJ with a fresh communications challenge, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might dial back its stimulus - even though such action remains a long way off.

It was from this mosque that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced the creation of his  caliphate  on July 4, 2014. Foundation     The mosque is named after Nuruddin al‑Zanki, a noble who fought the early crusades from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The mosque was built in 1172-73, shortly before his death, and housed an Islamic school. Minaret By the time traveler Ibn Battuta visited two centuries later, the mosque's 150-foot (45-metre) minaret was already leaning. Its tilt gave the landmark its popular name - al-Hadba, or the hunchback.   It is several feet out of the perpendicular,  19th-century traveler Grattan Geary wrote,  though it starts fair from the ground, and at the top, before putting on its gallery and dome, it regains an erect posture. Its attitude is that of a man bowing.  It was built with seven bands of decorative brickwork in complex geometric patterns ascending in levels towards the top in designs also found in Persia and Central Asia.  Modern History Both the mosque and its school were dismantled and reassembled in 1942 in a restoration program by the Iraqi government.

JD initially gained popularity as a retail platform for electronics and appliances, but it has since leveraged its extensive in-house logistics network to expand into a range of products including grocery, apparel and on-demand services. Just this month, JD launched its high-end delivery service, JD Luxury Express, where staff in suits and white gloves deliver packages directly to customers' homes using electric vehicles.  The Farfetch deal is in line with JD's push as the online UK fashion retailer is partnered with roughly 700 global luxury brands and boutiques.  This partnership addresses the market's challenges by combining the Farfetch brand and curation with the scale and influence of the foremost Chinese e-commerce giant,  Farfetch CEO Jose Neves said in the statement. In an interview last year, Neves told Reuters he anticipated a possible Farfetch IPO within two or three years.

Go-Ahead, which owns around 5,200 buses transporting more than two million passengers daily, said its regional bus division was delivering revenue growth  slightly ahead  of wider industry trends. The company, which lowered its full-year profit outlook in February blaming repeated strike action on Southern railway, said Southern services had stabilised in the last five months but more strike action was planned. Southern is run by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), in which Go-Ahead has a 65 percent stake.  Disappointingly, the ASLEF union has called for an overtime ban for Southern train drivers which, if it goes ahead, will result in unnecessary disruption for customers,  Go-Ahead said in a trading update.  GTR remains fully committed to resolving these issues to provide improved services for customers and reduce uncertainty for our stakeholders,  it said.  Progress is being made in the ongoing discussions with the DfT (Department for Transport) regarding a number of contractual variations; management's judgement around these discussions and the potential impact on rail profitability remains consistent with previous guidance.  Separately, Go-Ahead said Govia has been short-listed by the UK Department for Transport to bid for the South Eastern franchise, a network it has been operating for over 10 years now. Shares in Go-Ahead were up 0.3 percent at 1,838 pence at 0723 GMT.

With European stock markets set to fall for a third day, investors sought the traditional security of the yen, pushing it around 0.3 percent higher against both the euro and the dollar in the first hour of European trade. Dealers said  short  bets against the kiwi had been squeezed after the central bank sounded several upbeat notes on the outlook for growth and impact of current exchange rates. A number of banks had been calling for more gains for the kiwi around the meeting, arguing that a 3 percent gain since May still leaves it well undervalued compared to long term measures of fair value and others in the commodities currencies bloc more exposed to falling oil prices.  While the RBNZ kept a neutral stance and continued to pledge to keep rates low for a long time, it did not complain strongly about the currency’s recent strength, which caused the New Zealand dollar to rise post the decision,  analysts from Credit Agricole said in a morning note. By 0700 GMT, the kiwi had climbed 0.5 percent to $0.7256. It was also around 0.4 percent higher against both the Aussie and Canadian dollars - both currencies that tend to be closely dependent on the prices of oil and other major commodities. After a dip in the past week, however, there was little sign of more pain for the group, despite a fall in Brent crude to less than $45 a barrel overnight. The Aussie and the Canadian dollar were both roughly steady against their U.S. counterpart . In an updated outlook for the year ahead published on Thursday, Barclays called for the kiwi to gain almost 5 percent against the Aussie over the next year.  The NZD has performed well despite RBNZ trying to dampen expectations of an early rate rise,  the British bank said.  Strong net permanent and long-term migration is helping to support domestic activity and lift business sentiment, but also ... dampening wage pressures. If the RBNZ were to raise rates faster than expected in 2018, the NZD could outperform.  The central bank of another major oil producers, Norges Bank, makes its own regular statement on policy at 0800 GMT. Its crown currency was 0.1 percent stronger in early trade in Europe. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was roughly flat at 97.54, having retreated from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.1 percent, to 3,590.34 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent to 3,147.45 points. However, interest in blue-chips sapped demand for small-caps, which has already waned sharply. The start-up board ChiNext dropped 1.4 percent. Investors continued to pile into stocks that will potentially benefit from inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EMI). The U.S. index provider said on Tuesday it would add 222 China-listed stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion, with the inclusion process starting June 2018. The MSCI inclusion  paves the way for global capital inflows into China's A-shares,  rating agency Moody's said in a report on Wednesday, projecting roughly $11 billion in near-term fund inflows into mainland stocks from funds benchmarked to EMI. Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International, said that the inclusion  bodes well for large-cap blue chips , and enhances investor preference for these stocks amid a slowing Chinese economy. The CSI300 Banking subindex jumped 1.8 percent, while the consumer sector took a breather after surging in the previous session. The sectors would represent the biggest weightings of China stocks in the MSCI EMI. Shares in Wanda Film, a listed arm of Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, halted trading after tumbling nearly 10 percent on speculation about Wanda Group. The group denied as  malicious speculation  rumours that banks had ordered sale of its bonds, and said it was operating normally.

Beijing has promised to draw up new policies and set up a dedicated fund to deal with large stretches of polluted soil caused by overmining, industrial wastewater runoffs or excessive pesticide and fertiliser use.  But it said in an action plan published last year that it would aim to  stabilize  worsening soil pollution by the end of this decade and only start to make improvements by 2030.       Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday, Qiu Qiwen, head of the soil environment department of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), said the cost of cleaning up one mu (0.066 hectares) of polluted farmland in China could reach as much as 20,000 yuan ($2,928.86). According to the last nationwide survey published in 2013, about 50 million mu (3.33 million hectares) of China's farmland - an area the size of Belgium - was too polluted to grow crops. That would put total clean-up costs at 1 trillion yuan.       Soil pollution does not form overnight and the problem cannot be solved overnight,  said Qiu, adding that China  must have patience to fight the long war ahead . Workers row boats as they remove green algae in Qingdao, Shandong province, China June 21, 2017.StringerAnalysts say China's soil clean-up will provide lucrative business opportunities for a growing number of specialist environmental firms, but it is still unclear who will foot the bill, especially in the countryside. Qiu said Beijing has already allocated a budget of 14.6 billion yuan to cover nationwide soil remediation projects from last year until the end of the first half of 2017.  One firm already benefiting from that fund is Beijing Geoenviron Engineering & Technology, which said last month that a 121.9 million yuan project in southwest China to remediate soil contaminated by heavy metals would be financed by the government.     Treating and recovering polluted soil is very difficult and costly, and requires a long cycle,  Qiu said.  He said China would publish the results of its latest survey on soil pollution after 2020. It will also identify polluted farmland and assess its impact on the quality of agricultural products by the end of next year.  Some of the measures being considered to clean up China's soil include rotating crops and turning farmland into forest, Qiu said.

The sixth inning for the longtime Detroit Tigers ace turned out to be anything but. Jarrod Dyson's bunt single sparked a rally as the Seattle Mariners came back from a four-run deficit to defeat the Tigers 7-5 at Safeco Field.  I was just trying to get something started. The guy was having a perfect game on us,  said Dyson, w 3hose one-out bunt to the right side of the infield was just hard enough to get past Verlander yet gave first baseman Miguel Cabrera and second baseman Ian Kinsler no chance at making the play.  That's a big part of what (Dyson) does,  Verlander said.  I didn't really have any issue with it. I didn't get upset.  Verlander walked the next batter, Mike Zunino, and then Jean Segura hit a broken-bat blooper down the left field line that dropped, loading the bases. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at MarinersDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchAfter fouling off three consecutive pitches, Ben Gamel lined a run-scoring single to center to pull Seattle within 4-1.  We didn't have a hit (through five innings), so we weren't feeling great,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  But I felt if we could get (Verlander) in the stretch and out of his comfort zone ...  Verlander caught Robinson Cano looking at a called third strike, but Nelson Cruz lined a two-run double down the left field line -- Justin Upton made a diving attempt but couldn't quite come up with the ball -- to pull Seattle within 4-3 and end the right-hander's night. Detroit reliever Shane Greene (1-1) escaped further damage in the sixth, but Mitch Haniger tied the score with a leadoff homer against him in the seventh. Later in the inning, Cano broke the tie with a two-out, two-run double, and Nelson Cruz followed with a run-scoring single for the Mariners, who won their fourth straight game to reach the .500 mark (37-37). Reliever Tony Zych (3-2) got the victory and Edwin Diaz earned his 12th save despite allowing solo homer to Ian Kinsler in the ninth. Detroit (32-39) lost its fifth consecutive game, including the first three in the four-game series at Safeco Field. In 5 2/3 innings, Verlander allowed three runs on four hits. He walked only one and struck out 11.  I don't know if it did anything in particular,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said of whether Verlander was affected by having his perfect game was broken up by a bunt.  That was the first time he was throwing out of the stretch. He looked really good out of the windup for five innings, he was outstanding. He was throwing the fastball by guys like he did last year, his curveball was much sharper. It was looking like his best outing of the year.  The way Verlander was pitching, striking out 10 of the first 16 batters, it seemed the Tigers had almost put away the game when they took a 4-0 lead in the top of the sixth. Cabrera led off with a single up the middle, then J.D. Martinez hit a soft liner to center. The ball dropped just in front of Dyson, who had a chance to throw out Cabrera at second because the runner had to hold between the bases to see if the ball would be caught. Dyson's throw was errant and skipped all the way into the Detroit dugout, putting runners at second and third. Upton, who had singled home a run in the fourth, then delivered a two-run single to left field to make it a four-run lead. In the third inning, Detroit's James McCann, who entered the game batting just .178, broke a scoreless tie with an opposite-field homer into the first row of seats in the right field corner. It was his eighth long ball of the season. Detroit doubled the lead in the fourth as Martinez led off with a double into the left field corner and scored on Upton's single to center. Seattle starter James Paxton allowed four runs (three earned) on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out eight.  The guys did a tremendous job battling, putting together great at-bats,  Paxton said of his teammates.  It was a great team win.  NOTES: Seattle SS Jean Segura was activated from the 10-day disabled list before the game and batted leadoff, going 1-for-3 with a walk and scoring twice. Segura had been out since June 1 with a right high ankle sprain. ... Mariners LF Ben Gamel went 2-for-4 and extended his hitting streak to 13 games. ... Tigers LF Justin Upton went 2-for-4 and has reached base safely in 19 straight games. ... The Mariners called up RHP Andrew Moore and announced that he is scheduled to make his major league debut Thursday in the finale of the four-game series. That means veteran RHP Yovani Gallardo (3-7, 3.60) is headed for the Seattle bullpen. The Tigers will start RHP Daniel Norris (4-4, 4.42 ERA). ... To make room on the roster for Segura and Moore, the Mariners sent INF Tyler Smith and RHP Christian Bergman to Triple-A Tacoma and designated RHP Tyler Cloyd for assignment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXPL65O"},

The Los Angeles Dodgers' Yasiel Puig gave them one anyway, and they didn't take kindly to it. Puig hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning, and left-hander Rich Hill rebounded from a poor effort to pace the Dodgers to an 8-2 win over the Mets on Wednesday. The Dodgers (47-26) earned their sixth straight win and moved past the Colorado Rockies for first place in the National League West. It was the way the controversial Puig acted after his home run that bothered the Mets (31-40), who have lost six of their last seven and have fallen to a season-low nine games under .500. The right fielder, who is appealing a one-game suspension for an indecent gesture in a game at Cleveland, crushed a 3-1 pitch by rookie Tyler Pill. He flipped his bat, paused to admire the blast and then loped to first base, exchanging words with first baseman Wilmer Flores after rounding the bag and catcher Travis d'Arnaud as he crossed the plate. Between innings, he was met on his way back to right field by Mets left fielder Yoenis Cespedes and shortstop Jose Reyes. The three had a brief, animated conversation near the mound. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at DodgersNew York Mets - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch I don't think he knew what's happening in respect to the game,  said Flores, referring to the Mets' troubles.  We're playing horrible right now. He disrespected us. There are other ways to enjoy a home run.  Puig said,  We're hitting the ball well and a lot of home runs. If that's the way he feels, he should worry about the way they're playing.  (Cespedes) said I should run faster and tried to give me some advice. I just don't look at it that way.  Mets manager Terry Collins declined to discuss Puig:  I don't want to get into it. We have bigger troubles than that.  The Mets have three-fifths of their rotation on the disabled list, forcing Collins to shuffle players in from Triple-A or go to the bullpen for starts. The Mets have allowed 71 runs in their past nine games, 30 to the Dodgers in the past three. The Dodgers improved to 20-6 since May 25, and they are 28-10 in home games this year. Yasmani Grandal hit solo home runs in the sixth and eighth innings, giving him nine long balls this season and the Dodgers 30 in their past 11 games.  We're giving up three to four home runs a game,  Collins said.  That's tough to make up. What we need right now is a well-pitched game. Tyler pitched well, but he left a pitch in the middle of the plate to Puig.  Two of the Dodgers' early runs came thanks to errors by third baseman T.J. Rivera and right fielder Jay Bruce. Hill (4-3) -- coming off a two-inning, seven-run outing -- allowed one run on four hits and three walks while striking out eight in five innings Wednesday. Four relievers struck out seven more Mets in the last four innings. In the first inning, Hill was greeted by Curtis Granderson's home run to center and a double by Flores. Hill struck out two of the next three hitters to escape further trouble. He worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the fourth, striking out Reyes, Gavin Cecchini and Pill with his sweeping curve. The Dodgers got a run in the third thanks to a two-base throwing error by Rivera and Hill's sacrifice fly -- the veteran pitcher's first RBI since 2009. Los Angeles blew the game open in the fourth. Cody Bellinger legged a double to right field, took third when Bruce air-mailed his throw to second and scored on Logan Forsythe's double. Pill walked Joc Pederson intentionally to get to Puig, who slugged a 3-1 pitch to left, his 13th homer of the season, for a 5-1 lead. NOTES: The Dodgers recalled RHP Brandon Morrow from Triple-A Oklahoma City. He was 2-0 in five relief appearances earlier this season, not allowing a run while striking out seven in six innings. He replaces RHP Brock Stewart, who pitched three innings of relief Wednesday and earned a save before being optioned to the minors. ... Dodgers 1B Adrian Gonzalez says he will not rush back from his herniated disk as he did earlier this season, and he may not return until late July. Gonzalez received an epidural injection for the injury after going on the DL and is working to strengthen his back. His two trips to the DL this season were the first in his career ... Mets RHP Zach Wheeler was placed on the 10-day disabled list with biceps tendinitis. New York recalled RHPs Tyler Pill and Erik Goeddel from Triple-A Las Vegas and optioned INF Matt Reynolds (.177) to Las Vegas.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXPJJ5I"},

Sri Lanka's central bank is expected to keep its key interest rates steady at more than three-year highs at a policy announcement on Friday, a Reuters poll showed, to boost faltering growth hit by adverse weather. The spot rupee, which has been trading for four straight sessions after being inactive for six weeks, was at 153.30/45 per dollar at 0645 GMT, largely unchanged from Wednesday's close of 153.30/35. The spot rupee resumed trading on Monday for the first time since May 5 when the central bank had fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  There's normal demand and supply.

Exporters are very relaxed as the spot is trading.  Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan.

The result was Fiers' fourth consecutive victory, a 5-1 win at the Oakland Coliseum.  He made some huge pitches tonight,  Astros catcher Brian McCann said.  He's building off what he's been doing the last four or five starts. He's been really, really big for us. He's stepped up and played a huge role for us.  Fiers has helped fortify a battered Astros rotation while left-hander Dallas Keuchel and righties Lance McCullers Jr. and Charlie Morton recover from injuries. Fiers struck out five, but he walked three and hit two batters. He got off to a rough start in the first inning, hitting Chad Pinder with a pitch and walking Jed Lowrie with one out, but he got Khris Davis to hit into a double play.  I was a little bit off,  said Fiers, who is 4-0 with a 1.72 ERA in his past five starts.  I was trying to do too much, I think, not just letting it go, letting it work, just trusting my stuff really. I felt really good. Just needed to throw in the zone a little bit more. I was able to get back, get back to throwing a lot of strikes.  Fiers (5-2) beat the A's for the first time in seven career starts (1-2). Related CoveragePreview: Astros at AthleticsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchThe Astros defeated the A's for the ninth straight time at the Coliseum and improved to 5-0 in Oakland this season. They have won 14 of their past 15 games against Oakland overall. Houston, which has a major-league-best 49-24 record, has won the first three games of the series and goes for the sweep Thursday afternoon. Carlos Correa went 2-for-5 with his 14th home run, a solo shot in the ninth, and scored twice. He also made a handful of great defensive plays and sparkled on the basepaths.  We take a lot of pride in our defense and our baserunning,  Correa said.  We're an athletic team, so we know we can do that. Every time we can take advantage of the situation, we will.  Evan Gattis and Jake Marisnick each had two RBIs for the Astros. A's left-hander Sean Manaea (6-4) allowed three runs on seven hits over six innings with eight strikeouts and two walks as his career-high five-game winning streak ended. Manaea fell to 0-2 in six career starts against Houston despite allowing a combined eight earned runs.  It's just a really good ballclub and they're playing really good baseball right now, so you know that makes things more difficult,  Manaea said of the Astros.  But at the end of the day, it's up to me to get these guys out. I trust my stuff. I just didn't get the job done tonight.  Fiers and Manaea matched zeros for the first five innings, but Houston broke through to score three runs in the sixth. Jose Altuve lined a leadoff single to right, his first hit off Manaea in 14 career at-bats. Correa sent Altuve to third with a sharp single to center and aggressively took second on Jaycob Brugman's throw to third base. Gattis hit a two-run single to center, driving in Altuve and Correa to make it 2-0. Gattis moved to second on Yuli Gurriel's single to center and scored on Marisnick's two-out single to left, giving Houston a 3-0 edge.  The five singles in an inning continues to be a theme where we can put together innings and score runs without the home run,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  That impressed me that we just took what he gave us, hit the ball hard, got some good results and scored some runs.  A's manager Bob Melvin said Manaea pitched well enough to win on many nights.  When you get four hits and one run, you're not giving him much of a chance, but it's not like he pitched poorly,  Melvin said. Oakland cut Houston's lead to 3-1 in the seventh. Yonder Alonso lined a leadoff double to right and Fiers walked Ryon Healy, the final batter he faced. Left-hander Tony Sipp got Brugman to ground into a fielder's choice. Pinch hitter Stephen Vogt, facing Luke Gregerson, brought Alonso home from third with a groundout. Houston answered with a run in the eighth off Santiago Casilla. Gurriel singled with one out, moved to third on Alex Bregman's double and scored on Marisnick's sacrifice fly. Correa homered with two outs in the ninth inning off Josh Smith, making it 5-1. NOTES: Astros RHP Jandel Gustave underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery on his right elbow Wednesday in Houston. Gustave made the Astros' Opening Day roster but has been on the disabled list since April 19. He had begun a throwing program at the team's facility in Florida and threw a few bullpen sessions but continued to have pain in his throwing arm. ... Athletics 3B Matt Chapman (left knee infection) missed his third straight game but is  feeling better,  according to manager Bob Melvin. He is day-to-day. ... The A's will open a three-game series on the road against the Chicago White Sox on Friday. ... Oakland SS Marcus Semien (right wrist surgery) will begin a rehab assignment with Class A Stockton on Friday night. Semien, who has been on the disabled list since April 15, is expected to start at shortstop and play five to seven innings. ... A's C Stephen Vogt made his fourth career appearance and first since 2014 in left field after pinch-hitting for LF Rajai Davis in the seventh.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXP2V5G"},

Debt Treasury announces sale of CTZ and BTPei bonds, with relative amounts to be auctioned on June 27. Politics (*) Several newspapers said the government would issue a new decree, possibly as soon as this weekend, to widen the scope of the 20 billion euro bank rescue fund it created in December as that covers only a precautionary recapitalisation scenario. Companies Banca Carige The board of Genoa-based lender Banca Carige has appointed former UniCredit top executive Paolo Fiorentino as chief executive, two sources said on Wednesday. In a statement confirming the appointment of Fiorentino, Carige said it would provide clarifications on governance and a bad loan reduction plan by June 23, as requested by the European Central Bank. It will take more time to address the ECB's request about its capital adequacy. (*) The financial strategy of the bank will be reviewed before the start of July, MF said. The bad loan portfolio of 2.4 billion euros will be sold whole or transferred to a vehicle controlled by an investor. A board, expected on July 3 or 4 will set the size of a planned capital increase which will be 600-700 million euros, MF said. The bank is preparing a letter to be sent to the ECB on Friday asking for the issue of non performing loans to be examined in more detail, Il Sole 24 Ore said. Intesa Sanpaolo Italy's biggest retail bank on Wednesday set tough conditions on an offer to buy the healthy assets of two Veneto-based banks, part of efforts to prevent European authorities from stepping in to wind them down. (*) The government had not been previously informed of the details of Intesa's proposal and the strict conditions set by the bank have taken many by surprise at the Treasury, Corriere della Sera reported. (*) The EU Commission fears a sale of the two Veneto banks'  good  assets to Intesa would entail higher costs for taxpayers, possibly above the 6.4 billion euros of the capital shortfall identified by the ECB for the two lenders, La Stampa reported. (*) La Repubblica said the costs for the state could be as much as 10 billion euros. The state would need to inject 3 billion euros into the  good  banks being transferred to Intesa to offset the impact on the lender's capital of the additional risk weighted assets. Intesa would also benefit from 1.4 billion euros in deferred tax assets. The gap between the book value of the two banks' impaired loans and their selling price is estimated to cost another 5 billion euros, the paper said. The government won't be able to inject more than 4.5 billion euros in the banks, Messaggero said. The paper said Intesa's plan includes the stakes of the Veneto banks in Arca, Banca Apulia and Banca Nuova, it said. INTESA SANPAOLO, UNICREDIT, MONTE DEI PASCHI , BANCO BPM, POPOLARE DI BARI Italian tax police seized documents from the offices of five Italian lenders on Wednesday in an investigation over alleged fraud in relation to the distribution of diamonds to bank clients, sources said. Enel Open Fiber, the Italian broadband infrastructure firm owned by utility Enel and state lender CDP, is set to get a 500 million euro bridge loan to help fund the fast internet network it is rolling out in Italy, three sources said on Wednesday. (*) Mediaset The communications regulator is studying the idea of transferring 20 percent of voting capital to a vehicle whose board would be controlled by the watchdog as a way of resolving the Vivendi issue, La Repubblica said. space3 Annual general meeting (0930 GMT).

When spot Asian iron ore prices jumped 81 percent in 2016, the surprise rally was chalked up to stronger Chinese imports and signs that a market that had been oversupplied for several years was back in balance.  China, which buys about two-thirds of seaborne iron ore, certainly did boost imports in 2016, buying more than 1 billion tonnes in a year for the first time, with overseas purchases of the steel-making ingredient rising 7.5 percent.  There has been little let up in the pace this year, with imports from January to May jumping 7.9 percent from the same period in 2016 to 444.6 million tonnes, putting them on track for an annual increase of about 65 million tonnes.  Imports look set to remain robust in June as well, with ship and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts pointing to arrivals of 93 million tonnes.  This number was filtered to show only vessels that have already discharged cargoes or are underway, and may be revised higher as late cargoes get added.  Overall, the picture shows that China's appetite for imported iron ore remains strong, meaning the price decline so far this year isn't driven by weakening demand.  The spot price ended at $56.82 a tonne on Wednesday, down 28 percent from the start of the year and 40 percent from a peak of $94.86 on Feb. 21.  Chinese domestic iron ore futures have fared some better, with Dalian Commodity Exchange contracts slipping 8.1 percent so far this year to Wednesday's close of 426 yuan ($62.37) a tonne, and down 33 percent from their Feb. 21 peak. Steel, Iron Ore Tread Different Paths In contrast, benchmark Chinese steel futures, the Shanghai rebar contract, have gained 15.1 percent since the end of last year to Wednesday's close of 3,060 yuan a tonne.  This divergence between Chinese steel and iron ore prices is a marked change from last year, when they rallied in tandem, with rebar gaining 96 percent to spot iron ore's 81 percent.  China's steel market appears relatively robust currently, with output in May rising 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 72.26 million tonnes, just below April's monthly record of 72.78 million tonnes.  In the first five months of 2017, production was 346.8 million tonnes, up 4.4 percent from the same period last year, according to official figures.  Higher steel output is a response to solid margins for steelmakers, which are being supported by ongoing capacity cuts and a still reasonable outlook for construction and manufacturing.  It's mainly low-quality furnaces that are being targeted for closure by Chinese authorities as part of plans to shut at least 50 million tonnes of capacity this year, which follows on from 65 million tonnes idled last year. Assuming the demand outlook for steel doesn't deteriorate too much in the second half of the year, the capacity closures should help keep steel mills profitable and support prices. But for iron ore the arrival of additional tonnes on the seaborne market from expansion projects by Brazil's Vale and the new Roy Hill mine in Western Australia will keep the market's focus on supply. Citi analysts said in a report received this week that the seaborne market could be oversupplied by 100 million tonnes in 2017, leading them to cut their average price forecast for this year to $61 a tonne from $70 previously. Once again, it appears that the iron ore market is going to play the game of who can survive lower prices the longest. While low-cost major miners such as Vale and Anglo-Australian pair Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are best-placed, smaller Australian players and producers in minor exporters like Ukraine and Canada will struggle to hold on.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) proposed on Wednesday to ease some rules for foreign portfolio investors to steer more funds. It also relaxed open offer rules for investors buying distressed companies from banks to tackle mounting debt. The broader NSE index was up 0.65 percent at 9,696.35 as of 0606 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.76 percent higher at 31,519.97, after hitting a record high of 31,522.87 earlier. On Wednesday, minutes from the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee revealed a less hawkish tone as it welcomed data showing inflation easing below target, but wanted more assurance the trend would continue before deciding whether to lower interest rates.  There's a possibility of a rate cut, not now, but in some time. Rate-sensitive stocks, which include banks and auto, will benefit from the rate cut,  said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. Banking stocks boosted both indexes, with the Nifty Bank index gaining as much as 0.8 percent to hit a record high. Shares of Yes Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd were up more than 2 percent, making them the top gainers on the Nifty Bank Index. IDFC Ltd rose as much as 3.5 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in more than one month, after the RBI allowed foreign investors to resume buying in the company. bit.ly/2sAslkt Auto stocks also climbed, with the Nifty Auto index up much as 0.9 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly two weeks.

The market largely shrugged off comments overnight from Iran's oil minister that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are considering deeper cuts in production. Brent crude futures were 9 cents, or 0.2 percent higher, at $44.91 a barrel at 0018 GMT, after falling 2.6 percent in the previous session to their lowest since November. U.S. crude futures were 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, higher at $42.65 a barrel. On Wednesday, they settled down at $42.53, after touching their lowest intraday level since August 2016. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20 percent, with only brief rallies, completely erasing gains at the end of the year in the wake of the initial OPEC-led production cut. OPEC and other producers agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day from January for six months, subsequently extended for a further nine months. With production rising in Nigeria and Libya, countries exempt from the deal, and output surging in the United States, which was not part of the agreement, the bulls have thrown in the towel. And a bigger than expected cut in U.S. crude stockpiles reported overnight is barely shifting the dial. Crude inventories fell 2.5 million barrels in the week to June 16, surpassing analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.1 million barrels, as imports rose marginally by 56,000 barrels per day, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Gasoline stocks fell 578,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a seasonally unusual 443,000-barrel gain, which had been seen as bearish in the market. Stocks of the motor fuel had also risen unexpectedly by 2.1 million barrels in the previous week, despite the start of the summer driving season.

South Australia, the country's fifth-largest state by population, announced the tax in its budget to help fund job-creation initiatives. It said it will impose a 6 basis point tax on 6 percent of the assets being taxed by the federal government, adding that it had derived that percentage as the state accounts for 6 percent of the national economy. The measure will raise A$370 million ($280 million) over the first four years.  The profits of the big banks are large - in the last year alone the five banks have collectively made profits of about A$30 billion after tax,  South Australian Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said in a statement.  They can and should contribute more to economic growth and job creation in this state.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank and Macquarie Group will be subject to the state levy in addition to the federal tax that was passed into law on Monday. The Australian Bankers Association (ABA), which represents the major banks, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. ABA Chief Executive Anna Bligh said last week that imposing a tax on parts of the banking sector because of its financial success set a  worrying precedent  for other industries. Australia's banks have come under scrutiny by politicians and the public following a series of scandals involving misleading financial advice, insurance fraud and alleged interest-rate rigging.

Last July, the 28-year-old Briton expressed concern over the lack of regular drug testing in golf compared with other Olympic sports and advocated the introduction of blood testing. The PGA tour said on Tuesday that urine tests would still make up a bulk of examinations but blood screening would be introduced to detect human growth hormone. Policies regarding player suspensions for illegal drugs use will also be made more transparent.  If we're not blood testing we're not doing all we can to make sure that golf is a clean sport, so I obviously welcome the news,  McIlroy was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph ahead of Thursday's first round of the Travelers Championship.  If golf wants to be a sport in the Olympics, it needs to get on board with everything that all the other sports do as well.  I really don't think anyone should be fearful as I don't think that golf has any sort of drug problem at all. You have to be so careful about what you take, but that's part and parcel about being an athlete.  McIlroy, who has battled a recurring rib injury since January, has not won a tournament this year and missed the cut at the U.S. Open earlier this month, but hopes he can still finish the season on a strong note.  I always felt 2017 was going to be a bit of a transitional year...,  he added.  It's still got two majors (left) and I'd like to finish it well.  But if I look back over my first 10 years as a pro, am I happy with where my career's at? I would say, 'yes, I guess'. But I definitely feel like in the next 10 years, that I can do better.

The company on Wednesday said it expected to post a net profit of 220 million yen ($1.98 million) for its fiscal year through May 31, compared with its previous estimate of no profit. Shares in Takata Corp changed hands for the first time since sources said last week that the struggling airbag maker was preparing to file for bankruptcy, falling 54.9 percent. The stock had closed down by its daily limit each day this week after being untraded during the day - a forced close in accordance with Tokyo Stock Exchange rules. It has lost more than 75 percent of its value since Friday. Takata will seek bankruptcy protection from creditors on Monday, two sources said.  Obviously, with Takata, someone is now seeing some kind of trading value there,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Ltd.  But ultimately, there needs to be more clarity in quantifying the ultimate liability of this company, because who knows what kind of litigation or claims it will face down the line.  Shares of Toshiba Corp trimmed losses but still ended down 0.3 percent, as the company aims to seal a deal worth some $18 billion by next week for the sale of its chip business needed to cover massive losses. Toshiba has chosen a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as the preferred bidder. The mining sector fell 1.4 percent, while the oil and coal sector slipped 0.5 percent. Oil prices resumed their slid in Asian trade. The broader Topix was 0.1 percent lower on the day at 1,610.38 while the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 was down 0.1 percent at 14,318.08.

Its budget pressured by low oil prices, Riyadh slashed the allowances last September to save money, but announced in April that it was restoring them to stimulate economic growth and because its first-quarter deficit was smaller than expected. A royal order published by state news agency SPA on Wednesday, and which accompanied the announcement of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to the post of crown prince, took the further step of restoring the allowances retroactively back to September.  In an emailed statement in response to questions by Reuters, the ministry said the 5-6 billion riyal cost of the latest step worked out to only about 0.6-0.7 percent of budgeted state spending in 2017 or almost 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, which could easily be covered by contingency funds.  This should not impact the overall budget or the budgeted deficit but we expect that it will contribute toward increased consumer spending and confidence, serving as a boost to economic growth and ensuring stability in consumer demand trends going forward,  Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in the statement. He added that the government remained committed to its goal of balancing the budget by 2020, noting that as a step toward this, a previously announced increase in fees charged on foreign residents of the kingdom would take effect next month.

The rating on the proposed notes includes a one notch of uplift from SMRP BV's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) arising from security over assets in key SMRP BV group subsidiaries, which will be shared equally with existing secured notes and bank debt. SMRP BV intends to use the proceeds to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. The one-notch uplift applied to the proposed euro notes may be removed if the superior secured debt falls below a EUR110 million threshold (upon exercise of call options available for EUR500 million and USD400 million secured notes) and a subsequent amendment to the intercreditor agreement, which will require approval of the existing bank lenders, paves the way for the release of security over the assets - as defined in the bond documentation. This  fall-away  security structure, which could materialise in 2019 at the earliest, may allow up to EUR110 million of secured debt ranking superior to the proposed notes. However, Fitch believes the low secured debt threshold defined as a precondition for the release of security in comparison with SMRP BV's EBITDA (more than EUR300 million in the financial year ended March 2017 (FY17)) will limit the secured debt/consolidated operating EBITDA ratio to below 2.0x-2.5x, which is commensurate with Fitch's guidelines for low structural subordination. As a result, the senior unsecured debt in the resultant debt structure will not face significant subordination. The final rating on the notes is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Linkages to Samvardhana Motherson Group: Fitch analyses Motherson Sumi Systems Limited (MSSL), its largest shareholder Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SMIL) and their 51:49 joint venture, SMRP BV, as a single economic entity, as SMIL effectively controls more than 50% of the economic interest in the MSSL group and because of the companies' senior management overlap. Fitch assesses the operating, financial and strategic linkages between SMRP BV and SMIL as strong and has based SMRP BV's IDR on SMIL's consolidated financial profile, which has been adjusted to include 100% of the businesses of MSSL and SMRP BV to take into account the large minority shareholders in MSSL. Leading Player with Integrated Capability: MSSL's business in India supplies wiring harnesses for a dominant share of passenger vehicles manufactured in the country. The company's acquisition of PKC Group Plc in March 2017 has given MSSL a leading position in the commercial-vehicle wiring harness market across North America, Europe, South America and China. SMRP BV's mirror business under Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec (SMR) is one of the top global suppliers of exterior mirrors, with a 24% market share by sales. Samvardhana Motherson Peguform (SMP), the polymer business, accounts for 20% of global bumper sales, 11% of dashboard sales and 28% of door panel sales in the premium segment. MSSL's market share has increased over the last several years, supported by its ability to provide a full spectrum of solutions, including R&D;, tooling, manufacturing and assembly, to meet customers' complex supply-chain needs with high quality and reliability. Well-Diversified Business Profile: MSSL's businesses serve over 750 vehicle programmes across more than 50 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) globally. Each business is diversified across OEM customers, vehicle programmes within an OEM and geography for each programme. This is an important business strength, given the cyclical and competitive nature of the automotive industry. MSSL has a balanced geographic presence: 20.7% of sales came from the Americas, 53.7% from Europe and 25.7% from Asia-Pacific and Africa in FY17, including full-year revenue from PKC. Customer diversification has improved, with the top-five customers making up 47% of sales in FY17 (including PKC), compared with 53% in FY14. Strong Relationship with OEMs: SMRP BV has decades-long relationships with 14 of the top-15 global OEMs, which underscores its consistent quality and R&D; record. This is important, as global OEMs are increasingly dependent on external auto-component providers and retain only high value-added parts to optimise capital. The company's solid customer relationships are a key business strength and help SMRP BV mitigate sector-specific risks, such as competition and weak negotiating power against large OEMs in pricing and pass-through of volatility in raw material prices. Strong Order Book: SMRP BV had an order book of about EUR12.8 billion at FYE17 (FYE14: EUR7.7 billion), which Fitch believes supports revenue visibility in excess of 90% over the next three to four years, including 60%-70% that comes from models already in production. The order book is diversified across OEMs and vehicle programmes, mitigating uncertainty over the market reception of new launches. The association with top OEMs also reduces this risk, as manufacturers typically try to improvise and relaunch new platforms - which require significant upfront investment - rather than writing-off the initial investment altogether. Low-Risk Growth Strategy: SMRP BV has achieved strong, profitable growth by successfully integrating attractively priced acquisitions and a low-risk organic expansion strategy. The company has been able to improve profitability at SMR and SMP by focusing on cost efficiency and investing to expand in-house manufacturing capabilities. SMRP BV's expansion plans benefit from orders already secured from customers, lowering risk. MSSL is likely to make large acquisitions in line with its strategic vision, but Fitch expects the company to adhere to its announced long-term leverage target. Improving Financial Profile: MSSL has maintained reasonable financial leverage, with an adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR ratio of 2.6x in FY14-FY16, while achieving healthy growth and steady margin improvement. This highlights its disciplined approach in evaluating investment opportunities. The company has low maintenance capex requirements (INR6 billion-7 billion annually) and a dividend policy that pays less than 40% of net income. FCF generation has been negative due to organic expansion of SMR and SMP, but Fitch expects FCF generation to improve once capex normalises over FY18-FY19. Fitch expects MSSL's robust order book to support continued EBITDA increases, which should lower financial leverage to levels commensurate with a low investment-grade rating over the next two to three years. Solid Financial Flexibility: MSSL benefits from a robust liquidity profile, long-dated debt maturities and diversified access to banks and capital markets. MSSL's strong financial flexibility allows it to support customers when they set up production facilities in new markets and be involved in early design and development work. DERIVATION SUMMARY MSSL's large scale, leading market position in its product categories and adequate diversification across OEM customers, geographies and products, positions it well with respect to peers such as Metalsa, S.A. de C.V. (BBB-/Stable), Nemak, S.A.B. de C.V.(BB+/Positive) and Faurecia S.A. (BB/Stable). MSSL appears more leveraged than peers because of its expansion capex, but Fitch's forecasts for the company's FCF profitability and leverage profile in the post-expansion years (FY20 onwards) compare well against peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - High single-digit revenue growth (except FY18, when full-year consolidation of PKC will lead to around 21% growth), supported by a strong order book. -  Gradual EBITDA margin improvement to 10%-11% over the next two to three years, driven by increasing scale and investments to improve in-house value addition. - Capex intensity, measured as percentage of sales, to remain high at around 5.5%-6.0% through to FY18, before declining to around 4.0% in FY19. - MSSL dividend payout to remain below 40% of net income. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - MSSL consolidated adjusted net leverage - defined as total adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR, after Fitch's adjustment for minorities and factored receivables and suppliers' acceptances - improving to below 2.0x on a sustained basis. - MSSL consolidated FCF margin improving to greater than 1.0% on a sustained basis. - MSSL maintaining or improving its business diversification. Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to the Outlook being revised to Stable: - Inability to achieve the positive guidelines above. LIQUIDITY MSSL has a robust liquidity position, with no significant debt maturities before FY22. The company had INR49.9 billion of unrestricted cash and INR32.9 billion of available committed bank facilities at end-March 2017 (MSSL: INR8.9 billion; SMRP BV: INR24 billion). This was more than sufficient to meet INR10.6 billion in near-term debt maturities and the modest level of FCF deficit through to FY18. The liquidity profile is strengthened by Fitch's expectation of positive FCF from FY19 and SMRP BV's access to both bank and international debt capital markets.

Workers started their strike in May after Freeport laid off around 10 percent of its 32,000 workforce while it negotiates a new mining permit with the government. Freeport resumed exports of copper concentrate in April after a 15-week outage related to the negotiations with Jakarta. Earlier this month, Freeport's chief financial officer said the company was on track to reach an agreement with the government.

Despite signs that the insurgents are now on the back foot, Southeast Asian governments are worried that the siege could be just the prelude to further violence as the ultra-radical Islamic State group tries to establish a foothold in their region. Jolted by the May 23 attack on Marawi, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have launched joint patrols to control the movement of militants across their archipelagic region and their foreign ministers gathered in Manila on Thursday for talks. Malaysia is worried that militants who are flushed out of Marawi City by the fighting may try to cross from the Philippines to its eastern state of Sabah.  We fear that they may enter the country disguised as illegal immigrants or foreign fishermen,  said Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) chief Wan Abdul Bari Wan Abdul Khalid, according to state news agency Bernama. It said Esscom had drawn up a  wanted  list that included two militants who spearheaded the attempt to capture Marawi. They are Abu Sayyaf group leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was proclaimed by Islamic State last year as its  emir  of Southeast Asia, and Abdullah Maute, whose followers accounted for a large number of the estimated 400-500 fighters who overran part of the town, killing Christians and taking dozens of civilians hostage. The fighting in Marawi broke out on May 23. Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera said on Thursday the number of militants holding out in Marawi had dwindled to  a little over 100 . Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Tampus said:  Their area has been reduced to 1 km square only.  Tampus' troops are blocking escape routes across bridges spanning a river to the west of the militants.  Our forces are coming from the east and the north and we are blocking the three bridges,  he said. Tampus told reporters that the militants were still using snipers who were firing from  strategic nests  in schools and mosques, and homemade bombs were hampering the progress of Philippine troops as they advanced house by house. He said he had seen at least five civilians dressed in black who appeared to have been forced to stand in the street as human shields. According to official estimates late on Wednesday, 369 people have been killed during the month of hostilities, three-quarters of them militants. The number of security forces and civilians killed stood at 67 and 26, respectively.

Oil prices took heart after data showed U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles fell, however investors remained cautious over whether OPEC-led output cuts would be able to rein in a three-year glut.     Iran's oil minister also commented that members of oil-cartel are considering deeper cuts in production.       Earlier this week (broader) Asian markets shrugged off the inclusion of MSCI's China A share, but today I think markets are focusing on oil prices having tumbled more than 2 percent overnight,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with Manila-based AB Capital Securities.     Singapore shares rose 0.6 percent, leading the gains in the region, ahead of inflation and industrial output data due on Friday.      Singapore's May core inflation likely increased 1.6 percent from a year earlier, slowing slightly from April's 1.7 percent,  a Reuters poll showed.     Industrial production is expected to rise for the tenth consecutive month year-on-year due to strong output in electronics.     Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation gained 1.2 percent and Singapore Telecommunications rose 0.8 percent.      Indonesia shares edged down 0.1 percent with Bank Rakyat Indonesia falling 1.3 percent.      Indonesia on Thursday introduced new rules to allow exports of nickel ore and bauxite and concentrates of other minerals under certain conditions, following a 2014 ban on unprocessed ore exports to spur higher value smelting industries.      The new rules were passed after the economy faced a hefty budget deficit and missed its 2016 revenue target by $17.6 billion.      Philippines shares edged down 0.3 percent, ahead of its central bank policy meeting later in the day, where the Philippine central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, according to a Reuters poll.         Vientnam shares were flat with a downside bias as gains in the energy sector were offset by losses in financial shares. Real estate sector was the second biggest loser.      Vietnam National Petroleum Group gained 1.9 percent while Vingroup JSC lost 1.5 percent.      Indonesia financial markets will be shut on Friday and next week for public holidays.

Local oilseed crushers are struggling to compete with cheaper edible oil imports from Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil and Argentina, reducing demand for local rapeseed and soybeans, even after prices tumbled by a third over the past 14 months due to bumper global production. Politically powerful farm groups want the government to raise import duties, boosting margins for local oilseed crushers like Ruchi Soya and encouraging cultivation for the 2017/18 season.  It's high time to do it. The sowing has started and prices are below the support level,  said Davish Jain, chairman of the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA).  Some farmers have already decided to switch to other crops.  India, the world's biggest palm and soybean oil importer, now relies on imports for 70 percent of its edible oils, up from 44 percent in 2001/02. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had promised to double farmers' incomes over five years, remains a popular leader three years into his term. But unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed. In Madhya Pradesh, the top soybean producing state, five farmers were shot dead during protests earlier this month. Farmers are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra announced a more than $10 billion loan write-off for farmers. Industry body, the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA), has petitioned the government to raise the duty on crude vegetable oils to 20 percent and on refined products to 35 percent, from 7.5 percent and 12.5 percent currently. Trade officials say lower food price inflation in India will make it easier for the government to raise import duties, protecting farmers without hurting consumers.  Raising the import duty can help put a damper on imports as well as encourage domestic crushing and refining,  said Dinesh Shahra, managing director of Ruchi Soya. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik declined to comment. While the government fixes minimum prices for more than two dozen farm commodities, it mainly buys wheat and rice. In the absence of support, local prices move in tandem with overseas prices. Many farmers were forced to sell soybeans at 2,550 rupees per 100 kg in the spot market, below the support price of 2,775 rupees, which has been raised to 3,050 rupees for the 2017/18 season. Meanwhile, India's soybean stocks are likely to hit 1.83 million tonnes at the end of this year, up from 441,000 tonnes at the start of the marketing year on Oct. 1, SOPA estimates, as an appreciating rupee makes soymeal exports unattractive.  The government should try to boost oilmeal exports by giving some kind of incentives for exports. It will help in reducing inventory,  said Ali Muhammad Lakdawala, procurement in charge of Oils & Fats at diversified consumer company ITC Ltd. .

The strategy might turn into a habit after the way the Diamondbacks swung the bats at Coors Field. Brandon Drury had four hits and drove in a career-high six runs, Nick Ahmed homered, and Arizona used a 10-run fourth inning to beat the Colorado Rockies 16-5 on Wednesday night. David Peralta also had four hits, Paul Goldschmidt had three and Taijuan Walker (6-3) went six innings and added an RBI single to help the Diamondbacks (45-27) end Colorado's six-game winning streak. Walker allowed three runs and struck out eight. Arizona looked fresh in finishing with season highs in runs and hits (20). Lovullo's decision to scrap batting practice in 96-degree heat paid off.  I'm sure somebody will do a study on that one day to determine if a team that takes batting practice is going to have a better day, but I just know that we pulled the guys off the field to hit in the cage to keep them rested, keep them strong,  he said.  They were ready.  Mark Reynolds homered and Nolan Arenado doubled for the Rockies (47-27). Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at RockiesArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchThe teams came into the series on a roll and are fighting the Los Angeles Dodgers for positioning in the NL West. The Dodgers won their sixth in a row to move into first place, a half-game ahead of Colorado and 1 1/2 games in front of Arizona. It is the first time since June 3 the Rockies haven't had at least a share of first. Colorado won the first five games of its homestand before Arizona jumped on starter Jeff Hoffman (4-1). The rookie allowed nine runs, all in the fourth, and lasted just 3 2/3 innings. The Diamondbacks blew open the game in the fourth inning after falling behind 1-0. Thirteen batters went to the plate, with Peralta, Goldschmidt and Drury getting two hits each in the frame. Drury had a double and single to drive in three runs, and his first trip to the plate in the fourth was key. He looked at a couple of close two-strike pitches off the outside edge before lining a double to left-center.  That 2-2 was just off, it was a good take,  Drury said.  He hung a breaking ball, and I put a good swing on it.  Hoffman looked frustrated after not getting the call, but he didn't blame the inning on that.  I thought the two pitches to Drury were close, went back on video and they missed,  he said.  I felt I cruised through the first three and in the fourth I couldn't get the ball below thigh-high and they put good swings on bad pitches.  Jake Lamb also had a two-run double in the fourth, and Walker had a run-scoring single after Hoffman intentionally walked Ahmed with two outs to face the pitcher. Walker's hit to center scored Chris Iannetta, and Ahmed came home when Charlie Blackmon bobbled the ball, making it 5-1.  I threw him a cookie, he put the bat on the ball and hit it hard,  Hoffman said of Walker's hit. Jordan Lyles relieved Hoffman after Goldschmidt's second hit and allowed two more hits before retiring Daniel Descalso to end the inning. The 10 runs and nine hits were club records for one inning on the road. The nine runs allowed in one inning by Hoffman are the most by a Colorado pitcher since Mark Redman did it on April 26, 2008, at Dodger Stadium. Colorado got two back on Arenado's two-out double in the bottom of the inning. The Rockies took a 1-0 lead on Reynolds' leadoff homer in the second. It was his team-best 18th of the season. The Diamondbacks added two runs each in the sixth and seventh, and Drury's bases-loaded single in the ninth finished the rout. Plate umpire Andy Fletcher left the game in the middle of the seventh after being struck on the mask with a pitch in the top of the inning. Ron Kulpa moved from second base to home, and the game finished with three umpires. It was announced after the game that Fletcher was placed in the concussion protocol and won't work Thursday's game. NOTES: Arizona signed two draft picks Wednesday, No. 7 overall selection Pavin Smith, a first baseman, and supplemental second-rounder Daulton Varsho, a catcher. ... Rockies RHP Jon Gray (left foot stress fracture) and RHP Chad Qualls (back spasms) threw bullpen sessions on Wednesday. Gray is scheduled to make his third rehab start Saturday, while Qualls could be activated from the 10-day disabled list when he becomes eligible on Monday. ...

The change will take effect from July 1, said the document sent by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and will help utilities manage rising coal prices.  Power generators have been complaining about losses since last year as coal prices increase, so a tariff decrease is much expected,  said Li Rong, power analyst with consultancy SIA Energy. Thermal power companies pay surcharges to provincial governments to cover environmental protection and other programs. According to the document, local authorites, which onsell the power to the national grid, will be able to raise power prices, offsetting the lower surcharge revenues. China last raised on-grid thermal power prices in 2011. Tariffs have since fallen due to years of weakening coal prices, which began to turn around in April last year. In Ningxia, a region suffering from surging coal prices and a glut of overcapacity, the government plans to raise prices by about 0.25 Chinese cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from the current regional benchmark rate of 25.95 cents per kWh, equivalent to 1 percent hike, an official with the regional government said. Top power groups have been lobbying the Ningxia government to curb soaring coal prices. The NDRC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. The reduction of one surcharge by 25 percent and the elimination of another comes as power companies report losses as coal prices hit record highs. Thermal coal futures prices rose more than 40 percent this year to a record high around 580 yuan ($84.90) per tonne on June 20.

Fuel oil, the residue left over after initial crude refining, has become scarce in Asia as refiners make their plants more complex, upgrading them to change the fuel oil into gasoline and diesel.  Fuel oil, for years the junkyard dog of the barrel, is now at the forefront of everyone's minds,  said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai. However, analysts caution that new supply should begin flowing to the region from Europe and South America, eventually driving margins back towards their typical levels. The spread between the 180-centistoke fuel oil swap and Dubai crude for July was at a premium of 27 cents a barrel on Wednesday, the first time the residual fuel has been at a premium to Dubai since January 2012. The margin has averaged a discount of $3.09 in 2017 and averaged minus $5.37 last year. This comes amid falling crude oil prices which have so far recorded their worst first 6-month performance in any year since 1997. The higher margins are bolstering the values for regional crude oil grades that yield a large volume of fuel oil when refined, particularly at less complex plants, said three traders in that market.  The elevated fuel oil cracks could prompt some simple refiners to increase run rates over the near term but the extent of this could be limited in light of relatively lower gains in light and middle distillate cracks,  said Sri Paravaikkarasu, the Head of East of Suez Oil at energy consultancy FGE. While fuel oil margins will remain elevated, they should ease in the coming months. FGE's Paravaikkarasu pointed to rising exports from Latin America and the former Soviet Union in the fourth quarter as refiners there increase run rates and utilities switch away from burning fuel oil to natural gas. Fuel oil is primarily used to power large ships and for electric power generation. Utilities' consumption of the fuel tends to peak in the summer to meet increased cooling demand.  We could potentially see some correction in fuel oil crack values once peak summer demand eases,  said Nevyn Nah, oil products analyst at Energy Aspects. Fuel oil supplies this year have declined after the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries focused their crude cuts on grades that yield the most fuel oil. Investments into refinery upgrades in places like India and Russia also cut supply. Over the first week of June, onshore fuel oil stocks STKRS-SIN in Singapore, the world's biggest fuel oil trading hub, sank to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years while inventories in northwest Europe STK-FO-ARA fell their lowest since October. Refinery outages in Venezuela, a key fuel oil producer, have also helped constrain supplies. Demand for the fuel has also been supportive. Fuel oil sales to power ships in Singapore, the world's biggest ship fuel port, rose to an all-time high in January, while sales from February to March set monthly records.

European stocks were mixed with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE 100 to open up 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX to be little changed and France's CAC 40 to start the day down 0.1 percent. All three closed in negative territory on Wednesday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei rose almost 0.1 percent. Shares in auto air bag-maker Takata Corp plunged 50 percent as they exchanged hands for the first time since sources said last week it was preparing to file for bankruptcy. South Korea's KOSPI added 0.3 percent, while Australian shares jumped 1 percent. Taiwan shares hit a 27-year high. Chinese shares added to gains made on Wednesday after MSCI included mainland shares in its emerging market indexes. The blue-chip index rose 1.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.5 percent. Crude oil was subdued as investors' doubts that OPEC-led output cuts would dent a three-year glut offset data showing a drop in U.S. inventories.  The time for contrarian trades in oil is fast approaching, but I would want to see some stability in price and the technicals start to become more convincing,  said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne. U.S. crude futures slipped almost 0.1 percent, or 3 cents, to $42.50 a barrel. They closed down 1.6 percent on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Global benchmark Brent lost 0.1 percent, or 5 cents, to $44.77. It closed down 2.6 percent on Wednesday after touching a seven-month low. The resulting decline in oil shares hit Wall Street overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 percent, while the S&P; 500 was slightly lower. Nasdaq bucked the trend to end up 0.7 percent, lifted by biotech stocks. Financial stocks also contributed to losses on Wall Street, driven lower by a drop in the Treasury yield curve to its flattest in almost a decade, as investors tried to reconcile a hawkish Federal Reserve with deteriorating inflation measures. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer suggested they are concerned less about raising rates too fast or too high than about keeping them too low for too long. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 95 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007, on Thursday. The dollar eased, falling 0.2 percent to 111.145 yen . The dollar index was about 0.1 percent lower at 97.487, extending Wednesday's 0.2 percent loss. The New Zealand dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7257 after the central bank left its interest rate unchanged at a record low as expected and reiterated it would remain steady for a while. Sterling was steady at $1.2674, holding Wednesday's 0.3 percent gain on comments by the Bank of England's chief economist that he was likely to vote for an interest rate hike this year. Until now, he has been seen as largely supportive of keeping rates low. The euro was flat at $1.117, after Wednesday's 0.3 percent gain. The weaker dollar lifted spot gold 0.5 percent to $1,252.80 an ounce.

With the fighting raging around him, Nixon texted and called throughout, until just over a week ago when the messages stopped abruptly, leaving his wife praying that it was just his cellphone battery that had died.   I'm OK, but I can't go out. The house is safe,  the 41-year-old hardware store owner had told his wife in a message from their home inside the southern Philippines city. He heard gunbattles in the street, he wrote, and hid from black-clad fighters who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State and have occupied the city's commercial district for a month. On June 14, at 9:59 a.m., Nixon texted to ask Carmalia to buy him more credit for his phone, which she did. Then the messages stopped, and his phone stopped ringing.  I've had sleepless nights since then,  Carmalia, 42, told Reuters at Marawi's government compound, where she has been sleeping in a mosque while awaiting word of her husband.  The couple and their children were out of town when fighting erupted in Marawi on May 23, but Nixon went in the next day to check on their home and got trapped. Like most of the city's residents, the family is Muslim. Officials estimate 300 to 500 people are still trapped inside Marawi, fearful of militants accused of using civilians as human shields as much as of government airstrikes and starvation. Some families have sent messages saying they have resorted to eating blankets or cardboard dipped in water to keep hunger at bay. The Philippine military has said it is in the final stages of its operation to oust the insurgents, whose ranks contain local militants and foreign, battle-hardened fighters from Islamic State's campaigns in Syria and Iraq. The fighters have put up tough resistance, exploiting the city's narrow streets, thick concrete walls and basements, and harassing troops with sniper fire and Molotov cocktails. Philippines military aircraft - with technical assistance from U.S. special forces - have pummeled the city with 500-pound bombs, raising fears about the safety of civilians unable to get out. In the early stages of the conflict, many people were texting and calling in their whereabouts.  Their best hope of getting out lies with a  peace corridor  initiative of President Rodrigo Duterte. It comprises Philippine army officers and their former adversaries, fighters from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace deal with the government in 2014. Carmalia Baunto, 42, shows an image of herself and her husband, Nixon Baunto, who is trapped inside the besieged town of Marawi City, Philippines June 21, 2017. Picture taken June 21, 2017.Simon LewisThe team says it has helped to evacuate 270 people since it was set up on June 4. It has also delivered supplies to those who remain behind. Others have escaped by making their own way across the city, dodging sniper fire, to cross the Banggolo bridge over the Agus river and reach the government-controlled area. Batteries Run Down But there is no power and water in the city. Phone batteries have now largely run down and the team has no way to contact most of those inside, including Nixon Baunto. He had used two phones, his wife said, and the power must have run out in both. Families visiting the evacuation team's office on Wednesday provided 15 new names of loved ones they say are trapped in the city, according to Wendell Orbeso, a director at the Office of Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. Later, the team received a text saying 10 or more people were hiding out in a grocery store.  We don't exactly know how many people are still there,  Orbeso told Reuters at the office in a government building now mostly used to house evacuees.  The locations of the beleaguered civilians are passed to military commanders in the hope that soldiers can rescue them. After flushing militants from the city's neighborhoods, troops have moved house-to-house, watching out for booby traps that include cooking gas cylinders rigged to explode, Gen. Ramiro Manuel Rey told reporters in Marawi on Wednesday. Carmalia has been told the army is close to clearing the militants from the area around her home, she said. Nixon was too scared to leave the house, she said. He believed he would likely be captured by the militants or mistaken for a fighter and shot by the military, he told her. He had survived by collecting and drinking rainwater. Earlier in the siege, Nixon ventured out to a mosque, where he reported seeing more than 100 civilians sheltering, including women and children nursing gunshot wounds, he told his wife.  He could not take the shooting, the bombing and the fear of stray bullets,  she said, so he returned home, further from the epicenter of the battle.  I pray to Allah every day, every night, every hour for this war to end so my family can be reunited,  Carmalia said, wiping tears from her eyes. She was desperate to have her husband back for the Eid al-Fitr festival this weekend, she said.  If he's not back, I have no interest in celebrating.

Berkshire will also indirectly buy C$400 million of Home Capital's common shares in a private placement through its unit Columbia Insurance Co, Home Capital said on Wednesday.  Home Capital's strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment,  said Warren Buffett, Berkshire chairman and CEO.Berkshire will hold an about 38.39 percent equity stake in Home Capital after buying 40 million shares at an average price of about C$10.00 per common share. Berkshire will make an initial investment of C$153.2 million to buy 16 million common shares and an additional investment of C$246.8 million to purchase 24 million shares through a private placement.  Related CoverageShort seller Cohodes keeps Home Capital bet despite Buffett dealThe additional investment is subject to shareholder approval, while the initial investment will not require approval from shareholders. Canada's biggest non-bank lender also said it will continue to explore further asset sales and financing deals over the next year, but has concluded its strategic review process that began in April.  This investment from Berkshire not only addresses Home Capital's near-term requirements for additional liquidity and a lower-cost credit agreement, but also facilitates what the Board feels is the best available path to long-term success,  Home Capital's Chair Brenda Eprile said. Berkshire will not be granted any rights to nominate directors to Home Capital board or any governance rights as an equity holder, Home Capital said. The C$2 billion loan facility, expected to be effective on June 29, will replace the existing one for a similar amount between Home Trust Company and a major institutional investor. On Tuesday, the company said it would sell a portfolio of commercial mortgage assets valued at C$1.2 billion to bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in April.  Last week, Home Capital reached a C$30.5 million settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, settled a class action lawsuit and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said.

Kemp hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning off San Francisco Giants reliever Cory Gearrin to give the Braves a 5-3 win Wednesday night. Nick Markakis walked with one out, and Kemp connected on an 0-1 pitch for an opposite-field homer to right field. It was Kemp's 12th homer of the season and his seventh career game-ending blast. The Braves lead the National League with six walk-off wins and have also won six road games with runs in their last at-bat.  Like I keep saying, they never quit,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  They just grind through games. They keep coming at you.  Hunter Pence's fifth homer of the season, over the center field fence on a first pitch from Atlanta closer Jim Johnson with one out in the ninth inning, tied the game and cost Sean Newcomb his first major league victory. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at BravesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch It's another tough loss for us,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  It's our third comeback on the road trip and we've lost them all.  Newcomb allowed three hits and one run over six innings while lowering his ERA to 1.96.  He was really good again. You've got to like what you see out of that kid,  Snitker said.  I wish we could have got him that first win.  A downpour shortly before the scheduled first pitch delayed the start 75 minutes, and the game didn't end until after midnight ET. Monday's series opener began 44 minutes late because of rain. In the second inning, the Giants grabbed a lead when Brandon Belt's two-out triple down the right field line scored Pence, who had singled. The Braves went ahead in the fourth as Matt Adams followed a single by Markakis with a homer to right-center field on a 2-2 pitch from Giants starter Jeff Samardzija. Tyler Flowers connected with the bases empty in the seventh, but a wild pitch in the eighth made it a one-run game. Newcomb, who walked one and struck out three, retired his last 13 batters before being pulled after 80 pitches. The Braves' bullpen couldn't protect the lead, though.  Probably next time he'll go back out,  Snitker said.  I just felt he had done his job.  The left-hander lost his first two starts despite giving up just three runs over 12 1/3 innings. Samardzija allowed three runs on six hits in seven innings. The right-hander walked none and struck out eight, throwing 60 of his 79 pitches for strikes.  He threw a beautiful game,  Bochy said.  Really impressive and another quality start for us. We have three here and one win. That's disappointing.  Flowers' sixth homer, which came on a 2-1 pitch, hit the top of the right field fence and bounced off the foul pole screen. An umpire review confirmed the home run. Adams has hit 11 of his 12 homers since joining the Braves on May 21. He has 29 RBIs in 30 games with Atlanta.  He just keeps going,  Snitker said.  You feel good every time he comes to the plate. He's making the most of a really good opportunity for him.  Arodys Vizcaino threw a wild pitch following a triple by Denard Span to give the Giants their run in the eighth. Luke Jackson, who got the final two outs in the top of the 11th around a walk, got credit for the victory, improving to 2-0. Gearrin is 1-2 with the loss. NOTES: Braves 1B Freddie Freeman, who broke his left wrist when hit by a pitch May 17, is ahead of schedule in his recovery and hopes to return around the All-Star Game, playing third base.  I'm 100 percent go on it,  said Freeman, who suggested the switch that would allow 1B Matt Adams to stay in the lineup. ... Giants 3B Eduardo Nunez sat out for the fifth time in six games and also will miss Thursday's series finale because of a sore hamstring. Manager Bruce Bochy said Nunez is headed to the disabled list if he doesn't show improvement Friday, when the Giants return to San Francisco. ... Braves LHP Jamie Garcia (2-5, 3.59 ERA) will oppose Giants RHP Matt Cain (3-6, 4.99) on Thursday. ... Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner, injured in a dirt-bike accident April 20, threw 35 pitches Wednesday in his second simulated game at Scottsdale, Ariz. He is scheduled to pitch three innings in a rookie-level Arizona League game Sunday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-giants-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXMCJ3E"},

On Wednesday the Riyadh stock index surged 5.5 percent in reaction to the appointment of the architect of the economic reform and privatization plans, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to crown prince. Previously the 31-year old was deputy crown prince. Also investors were happy that index compiler MSCI placed Riyadh on the watch list for an emerging market upgrade. Analysts predict the market may gain between 20-30 percent through to the decision date in June 2018. Any MSCI move to upgrade would take effect in two phases - in May 2019 and August 2019. But the market, which is mainly made up of retail investors, may mildly fall as some traders may choose to cash out and spend money during the Eid holiday, which marks the end of the Islamic month of Ramadan. The market will be closed from June 25 and will resume trade on July 2. Meanwhile Brent crude futures staying near overnight's 10-month low of $44.35 a barrel, may continue to weigh on other Gulf bourses.

The euphoria overwhelmed any worries about Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group. Investors dumped shares of one listed unit and bonds of another, unlisted one amid speculation about the group. The group denied as  malicious speculation  rumours that banks had ordered sale of its bonds, and said it was operating normally. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.0 percent, to 3,624.95 points by the lunch break, a level not seen since January 4, 2016. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent, to 3,180.10 points. Investors continued to pile into stocks that will potentially benefit from inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EMI). The U.S. index provider said on Tuesday it would add 222 China-listed stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion, with the inclusion process starting June 2018. The MSCI inclusion  paves the way for global capital inflows into China's A-shares,  rating agency Moody's said in a report on Wednesday, projecting roughly $11 billion in near-term fund inflows into mainland stocks from funds benchmarked to EMI. Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International, said that the inclusion  bodes well for large-cap blue chips , and enhances investor preference for these stocks amid a slowing Chinese economy. The CSI300 Banking subindex jumped nearly 3 percent, as the consumer sector took a breather after the previous sessions surge.

Berrios allowed two runs and four hits in eight strong innings and Miguel Sano's solo blast in the third inning gave Minnesota the lead for good in the Twins' 4-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. After surrendering runs in the first and third innings, Berrios settled in and was dominant over his final five innings.  He didn't really have a lot of trouble that he had to deal with after that,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  That eighth inning was huge.  Chicago catcher Omar Narvaez led off the eighth with a single, but Berrios struck out Adam Engel and induced Allen Hanson to ground into a double play. Berrios (7-1), who was 3-7 with an 8.02 ERA in 14 starts for Minnesota as a rookie, struck out eight and walked one. Minnesota closer Brandon Kintzler pitched a scoreless ninth for his 19th save in 22 opportunities.  Last year I gave a lot of credit to the hitter so this year I don't think about him,  Berrios said.  I don't care who is hitting. I'm trying to think about my pitches and make them.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at TwinsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchTrailing 2-1 heading to the bottom of the third inning, the Twins jumped on Holmberg for a trio of runs -- only one earned -- beginning with Sano's leadoff home run. Sano turned on Holmberg's 3-0 fastball sending it 414 feet into the second deck in right-center field -- his 18th homer of the season.  You don't see right-handers go up there too often,  Molitor said.  It was impressive for me in that you don't get pull happy even though it's 3-0. I think he knows that his power is anywhere.  After left fielder Robbie Grossman reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson, Kennys Vargas singled him to third and he scored on Max Kepler's single. Vargas advanced to third and scored when Ehire Adrianza beat out a potential inning-ending double-play ball.  (Anderson) probably should've been more aggressive coming toward the bag, but he wasn't, and that didn't give him enough time to recover, reset the ball in his hand and be able to make a better throw,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  That was big -- we needed that double play.  Holmberg (1-1) was lifted in favor of right-hander Gregory Infante with one out in the fourth and Twins second baseman Brian Dozier on first following a leadoff walk. Holmberg allowed four runs (two earned) on seven hits with a pair of walks and four strikeouts. Dozier advanced to second on his 10th stolen base of the season, leading Renteria to intentionally walk Sano. Grossman drew a walk to load the bases, but Vargas grounded into a double play to end the threat.  There were times I had to make a pitch. I labored through a couple innings,  Holmberg said.  I would've liked to get ahead of these guys, get some quick outs and gone a little deeper into the game.  Infante and fellow reliever Michael Ynoa combined to allow Minnesota just three hits over the final 4 2/3 innings.  I thought our relief did a nice job to contain them and keep us within striking distance,  Renteria said.  We just weren't able to get anything going after the two initial runs we scored.  The White Sox got to Berrios early on Avisail Garcia's first-inning RBI single, which drove in Allen Hanson, who led off with a walk and advanced to second on Melky Cabrera's groundout to Dozier. Garcia added a double in the ninth to finish 2-for-4. He has hits in 16 of his last 20 games and his 51st RBI on Wednesday matches his total in 120 games last season. The first-inning earned run was only the second that Berrios has surrendered in eight opening frames this season. Holmberg stranded two Minnesota runners in the first two innings, but the Twins tied the score in the second when Dozier's double scored Byron Buxton. Engel restored the short-lived Chicago lead when he led off the third inning with a double and trotted home from third on Cabrera's double-play ball. Berrios went on to retire six of the next seven batters. Garcia reached on an error by Adrianza to start the fourth, but Berrios struck out the side to end the inning. The 22-year-old Berrios said his mindset changed once his teammates gave him the lead.  I tried to be more aggressive with the hitters and throw quality pitches,  Berrios said. NOTES: The Twins announced plans to play the Cleveland Indians in a two-game series in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on April 17 and 18, 2018, in what will serve as home games for Minnesota. The games mark the fifth time MLB regular season games will be played at Hiram Bithorn Stadium but the first time in San Juan for the Twins and the Indians. ...

Francisco Lindor hit a two-run homer and finished with three RBIs, Carlos Carrasco struck out 10 in six-plus solid innings, and Andrew Miller escaped from a dangerous situation in the seventh inning as the Indians beat the Orioles 5-1 on Wednesday night. Lindor was slumping on the road trip but now has four hits in the past two nights. His average crept back up to .256, and the shortstop is feeling better.  (I'm improving) little by little, slowly,  Lindor said.  Focusing on what I've got to do tomorrow and focusing on what I did well (today) so I can carry on tomorrow.  Jose Ramirez came through again for Cleveland. He went 2-for-5 and now has two or more hits in nine straight games. Roy Hughes did it in 1936 as did Riggs Stephenson (1924) and Tris Speaker (1926). They are the only Cleveland players ever to pull this off. Carrasco struck out 10 without a walk in six shutout innings (plus three batters in the seventh). He scattered seven singles, and the Orioles did little against him. Carrasco (8-3) has won three straight games -- all consecutive starts -- as the Indians (38-32) posted their seventh victory in eight games. He did not allow a walk. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at OriolesCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatch Everything was working,  Carrasco said.  Everything (was) good. What's more important is we won the game.  Miller came on for Carrasco in the seventh with the Indians clinging to a 3-0 lead. The bases were loaded with no outs and the former Oriole went to work. He set down the next three hitters to avoid any trouble, and that stopped the slumping Orioles (35-36) from changing the momentum.  You just try to slow the inning down as much as you can, make a pitch,  Miller said.  A lot of things went right. I felt pretty good out there tonight.  Indians manager Terry Francona agreed.  That's the ballgame,  he said. The Indians took command in the fifth against Baltimore starter Kevin Gausman, scoring three runs for a 3-0 lead. Lindor's hit was the big one, a two-run homer that came right after Roberto Perez lined an RBI double. Gausman (3-7) took the loss despite turning in one of his best starts. He gave up three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings with nine strikeouts and two walks.  Yeah, it's kind of the way things have gone, really, throughout the whole season so far for me,  Gausman said.  Pitching well and it kind of gets away from me.  In the ninth, Lindor added an RBI single as did Jason Kipnis to make it 5-0. That also extended Baltimore's streak of allowing at least five runs to 18 games. The Orioles already set the American League record and now sit just two from the major league mark of 20 (1924 Phillies). Bryan Shaw got the final out for his second save of the season. Closer Cody Allen left to go back home as his wife was having a baby. The Orioles finished with nine hits but did not score until a Jonathan Schoop RBI double in the ninth off Dan Otero before Shaw finished. This game was delayed 44 minutes at the start by rain. Neither team did much offensively in the first few innings before both stranded two in the fourth. The Indians then scored three in the fifth, a rally that began with a one-out single by Bradley Zimmer, who scored when Perez doubled to left-center field. Lindor followed with his two-run homer to center on a 2-2 pitch that gave the Indians a 3-0 lead. Gausman avoided further damage, actually striking out the side, but the Orioles had fallen behind again versus a solid Cleveland team.  I think that's what a lot of people miss about them is, as good as an offensive club and a defensive club, their pitching was good last year and will be again this year,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  That's why they're leading their division. NOTES: RHP Darren O'Day (shoulder strain) felt fine after throwing in a simulated game and Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he could be activated Friday. ...

Iran will almost certainly respond to a more aggressive posture by the United States and its chief Sunni Arab ally in battlefields where Riyadh and Tehran are engaged in a regional tussle for influence. Saudi King Salman made his son Mohammed bin Salman next in line to the throne on Wednesday, handing the 31-year-old sweeping powers, in a succession shake-up. Prince Mohammed, widely referred to as  MbS,  has ruled out any dialogue with arch rival Iran and pledged to protect his conservative kingdom from what he called Tehran's efforts to dominate the Muslim world. In the first meeting between Trump and MbS at the White House in March, the two leaders noted the importance of  confronting Iran's destabilizing regional activities.  But that could have unintended consequences, said some current and former U.S. administration officials. The greatest danger for the Trump administration, a longtime U.S. government expert on Middle East affairs said, was for the United States to be dragged deeper into the Sunni-Shi’ite conflict playing out across the Middle East, a danger that could be compounded by Trump’s delegation of responsibility for military decisions to the Pentagon. If the administration gives U.S. commanders greater authority to respond to Iranian air and naval provocations in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, things could easily spiral out of control, the official said. U.S.-backed forces fighting in Syria are also in close proximity with Iranian-backed forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. military jets twice this month shot down Iranian-made drones threatening U.S. and coalition forces in southeastern Syria. The United States also supports the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen through refueling, logistics and limited intelligence assistance.  If we were to witness an incident at sea between an Iranian and a U.S. vessel in the Gulf, at a time of immense distrust and zero communication, how likely is it that the confrontation would be defused rather than exacerbated?  said Rob Malley, vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group.  If there's a more bellicose attitude towards Iran, Iran is likely to respond,  said Malley, a former senior adviser on Middle East affairs under President Barack Obama. Eric Pelofsky, who dealt with Middle East issues at the White House under Obama, said the administration had  labored pretty hard to avoid a direct clash between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the high seas,  in part because it would expand the Yemen conflict and there were questions  about what the outcome of such an encounter might be.  But Luke Coffey, director of the Foreign Policy Center at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, doubted Iran would retaliate in a major way.  Iran has very limited ability or options to retaliate against U.S. forces in the region without suffering an overwhelming U.S. response,  Coffey said.  I think Tehran knows this so they will stick to low-level tactics like harassing U.S. ships in the Gulf. This will be just enough to be annoying but not enough to be considered 'retaliating,'  he said. Close Relationship MbS was the driving force behind the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen against Iran-allied Houthi rebels, launched in March 2015. He also appears to have orchestrated this month's breach with neighbor Qatar, which was accused by Riyadh and three other Arab states of cozying up to Iran, funding terrorism or fomenting regional instability. Qatar denies the allegations.  There’s a danger that his foreign policy instincts, that do tend to be aggressive, especially toward Iran, but also toward Sunni extremism, might end up distracting from what he wants to get done economically,  said a former Obama administration official, referring to  Vision 2030,  MbS's signature economic and social reform agenda. Malley, who has met MbS, said his attitude toward Iran  stems from his strongly felt conviction that for too long the kingdom has been a punching bag, a passive witness to Iranian action, true or assumed, in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia's own eastern province.   His view is that Saudi Arabia absorbed those blows and now there's no reason to absorb them anymore,  Malley said. That dovetails neatly with Trump who has said Iran promotes evil and is a key source of funding and support for militant groups. MbS has also developed a close relationship with Trump's influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who at 36 is close in age to him.  MbS's  desire to confront or even defeat Iran has appeal in the White House, where the crown prince has done an admirable job forging a relationship with the Kushners, who are of his generation,  said the U.S. official. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had dinner with MbS when the U.S. president visited Riyadh last month, the first stop on Trump's maiden international visit. Another senior administration official told Reuters that while Washington did not have advance warning of MbS's promotion, it could see it coming.  This is why the president has tried to foster good relations with him,  the official said.

So naturally, the baseball spirits felt the need to intervene. The Pirates went 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position and stranded nine on base, wasting an effective effort from Trevor Williams as the Brewers rallied late for a 4-3 victory.  He had five walks early,  Hurdle said of Brewers starter Junior Guerra, who also gave up seven hits but held Pittsburgh to just three runs over six innings.  We had a couple opportunities to get him. ... Bases loaded, one out in the second. We had two on with one out in the fourth. We weren't able to crack him there, so he held his ground.  The three runs Pittsburgh did score off Guerra appeared to be enough for Williams, who struck out a career-high seven batters while working six-plus innings. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at BrewersPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatch He pitched as I said extremely well,  Hurdle said.  I mean, seven punch-outs. Two walks. He continues to grow and develop.  Williams breezed through his first six innings, allowing just an RBI single in the third to Domingo Santana. Josh Bell pushed the Pirates' lead to 3-1 with a solo homer in the top of the sixth. Williams responded with a 1-2-3 effort in the bottom of the inning but opened the seventh by allowing a single to Keon Broxton and a double down the left field line to Orlando Arcia, his second hit of the day.  I saw it play out in my head,  Williams said.  I thought he was going to hit a ground ball to the that side. He's a candidate for a double play. They are two burners out there with Broxton and Arcia. I saw that out of the hand and thought that's what going to happen, he just pulled it a little too much down the line. It's tough. It's a game of inches and sometimes, baseball sucks that way.  With pinch hitter Eric Thames, a left-handed batter, due up, Hurdle turned to lefty Tony Watson. Watson got Thames to bounce into an out at second, though Broxton was able to score and cut the deficit to a run. After Eric Sogard struck out, Watson gave way to Daniel Hudson, whose 2-0 slider to Santana caught just enough of the plate for him to crush it into the right field corner for his 12th home run of the season.  Off the bat, I thought it might go foul,  said Hudson (1-3).  It just stayed fair. He did a good job. He did a good job of sitting on it and shooting it that way.  With the lead in hand, Jacob Barnes struck out the side in the eighth and Corey Knebel worked around a one-out single in the ninth. The Pittsburgh closer clinched his 11th save of the season when Arcia chased down a hard chopper shortstop and threw to Thames, who hauled in the throw at first just in time to catch John Jaso.  I was yelling, 'Don't throw it,'  manager Craig Counsell said.  To myself, that's what I was thinking. That's his play, for sure. It took a great play on Thames' end, too. It is a special play in a big moment.  The victory, coupled with a loss earlier in the day by the Chicago Cubs, increased the Brewers' lead in the National League Central to 1 1/2 games over the defending World Series champs and five games ahead of third-place Pittsburgh.  We were just playing,  Santana said.  We all know our pitching was struggling a little bit, but I'm so glad we passed through that with a win. I knew eventually we were going to be right where we want to be.  NOTES: Milwaukee placed struggling RHP Wily Peralta on the 10-day disabled list Wednesday with a strained left calf and recalled LHP Brent Suter from Triple-A Colorado Springs. ... The Brewers agreed to terms with first-round draft pick Keston Hiura, a second baseman/outfielder. The NCAA batting champ this season, Hiura took batting practice with the big-league club and will report to Phoenix where he will join Milwaukee's rookie-level Arizona League club. ... Pirates C Francisco Cervelli sat out a second straight game with manager Clint Hurdle giving Chris Stewart a start behind the plate. ... Brewers 2B Jonathan Villar (lower back strain) and LF Ryan Braun (strained left calf) will begin rehab assignments Thursday with Class A Wisconsin. Both are expected to remain on assignment through the weekend, manager Craig Counsell said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXJR50U"},

The Banco de Mexico is seen raising its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.00 percent, according to all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters. Analysts say that move, which would match the Fed's quarter-point rate hike last week, would help maintain the appeal of peso-denominated debt to yield-hungry investors. The central bank has raised its main interest rate in its previous six meetings to the highest level since early 2009 as inflation rose to a more than eight-year high. However, a rally in the peso has pushed the market to bet Thursday's action could be the end of the cycle of rate hikes. The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard Garrido The market thinks that the inflation peak is near and that Banxico will end its cycle this Thursday,  Finamex analyst Guillermo Aboumrad said in a note to clients. While yields on interest rate swaps MXNIRSBOMWATCH2 are tilting to bets that the central bank will not hike again after Thursday, the poll showed analysts expected one more increase this year, to 7.25 percent. The Bank of Mexico logo is seen on the facade of an office building in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, June 22, 2017.Edgard GarridoMexico's annual inflation quickened to 6.16 percent in May, well above the central bank's target of 3 percent, plus or minus one percentage point. Consumer prices have risen because of weakness in the peso, which has pushed up the cost of imported goods, and a big increase in gasoline prices by the government in January as the country moves from regulated prices to a free market for fuel.  But the peso has rallied from a record low in January as U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from threats to impose big tariffs on imports from Mexico and toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The central bank will issue its decision at 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Thursday.

The court on Wednesday began debating that topic, and two of the 11 justices voted that the top court should have the right to revise the terms of plea bargains, but only after the defendants in cases in which their testimony was used have been sentenced. As the law now stands, it is up to federal prosecutors to hammer out the details of plea bargains, such as whether a person who turns state witness must serve jail time or not, and if that agreement must be approved by a single judge. Opening the possibility that defense lawyers could ask the badly over-burdened Supreme Court to decide on the terms of plea bargains would likely both severely slow down the speed at which such agreements are made and increase the chances that tougher terms would be forced upon potential whistleblowers, two federal prosecutors with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  This is a signal to those who may wish to strike an accord with prosecutors and turn over substantial amounts of proof of corruption that they may not really benefit from doing so,  one of the prosecutors said.  Without question, this will lessen the numbers of those who will come forward to talk.  Brazil only began allowing plea-bargain agreements in 2013. They have been the key means for federal prosecutors to unravel what has become one of the world’s largest corruption schemes, in which large firms paid billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives of state-run companies in return for winning lucrative contracts. More than 90 high-ranking politicians and top businessmen have been convicted so far in the  Operation Car Wash  investigation. The probe has branched out in the last three years, with President Michel Temer, four past presidents and dozens of sitting lawmakers under investigation. Temer came under investigation after executives at the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA, struck a plea deal with prosecutors and turned over vast amounts of evidence that they claim proves Temer took nearly $5 million in bribes in return for helping the company resolve massive tax issues, win contracts and other political favors. As part of that deal, the billionaire brothers who control JBS, Joesley and Wesley Batista, managed to avoid serving any jail time, though they each had to pay 225 million reais in fines. The fact that the brothers managed to avoid imprisonment despite testifying that they had shelled out 500 million reais in bribes to nearly 1,900 politicians in recent years enraged the public and largely prompted the Supreme Court to examine the plea-bargain issue.

They didn't need many. Toronto jumped on Texas starter Tyson Ross (1-1) for six runs in the first inning and hung on for a 7-5 victory over the Rangers. The Blue Jays, who moved within a game of .500 for the ninth time this year, got all the offense they needed with their six two-out runs. The big first marked the first time in eight games the Blue Jays had scored in the opening frame. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RangersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch It does a lot, obviously,  said second baseman Darwin Barney, who capped the scoring in the first with a two-run homer.  That's how this game works. That's why they have shutdown innings. For some reason in baseball, guys tend to score the inning after a team scores. It was nice to get out in front. Guys could relax a little bit. They made a little run, but our bullpen's been so good.  Justin Smoak got the Jays on the board with an RBI single; and, two batters later, Steve Pearce added an RBI double. Ryan Goins followed with a two-run double before Barney's two-run homer to left. Goins upped the lead to 7-0 with an RBI groundout in the third. Joe Biagini (2-6) made those runs stand up for his first win since May 12 despite a Texas rally. The Rangers got two back in the third on Shin-Soo Choo's homer. Joey Gallo's inside-the-park homer in the fifth trimmed Toronto's lead to four. Texas chased Biagini in the sixth inning with a two-run single from Delino DeShields that made it 7-5. The Toronto bullpen held on from there, though. Danny Barnes, Ryan Tepera and Roberto Osuna kept the Rangers off the board for the final three frames, with Osuna picking up his 19th save. The Rangers had nine hits over the first six innings but were hitless over the final three. Biagini was charged with four runs on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked one while snapping a four-game losing streak.  Biag's record is no indication of how good he's pitched,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  He had a tough one his last outing (seven runs in one inning). He's a ground-ball guy. He got a lot of those and got a good curveball. He was in the strike zone. When he's in the strike zone, he's awfully tough.  Ross, making his second start, lasted three innings and gave up seven runs on seven hits.  I was up in the zone and falling behind hitters,  said Ross, who made his first start for the Rangers last Friday.  Their bats were swinging and I was making mistakes over the plate. I had a long delay (because of offseason shoulder surgery), but I came out the last outing and was effective. I struggled here tonight, but it's a good lesson to learn from.  Texas did get six scoreless innings from its bullpen but couldn't overcome just the fifth start of Ross' career in which he allowed at least seven runs. Pearce went 3-for-3 for the Jays, and Smoak was 2-for-5 with two runs. Kendrys Morales also had a pair of hits for the Jays, who finished with 11. The Rangers had nine hits, as Gallo went 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles in addition to the homer. Gallo (.201 batting average) came into the game with no hits in his last 11 at-bats and hadn't had a multi-hit game in June before giving the Rangers a chance with his big night, which was highlighted by his 19th homer.  I knew I had a little bit on it and it might make it out,  he said.  As soon as it hit the wall and (Pearce) went down, I thought I might have a chance at scoring. It was pretty exciting. I just had my head down running.  NOTES: Toronto LF Steve Pearce left the game in the bottom of the fifth with a right knee contusion after hitting the wall on Joey Gallo's inside-the-park homer. X-rays were negative. ... The inside-the-park homer by Gallo was the eighth in Globe Life Park history and the first by a Texas player since Ryan Rua had one in 2015. ... Toronto put RHP Leonel Campos on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right groin and recalled RHP Cesar Valdez from Triple-A Buffalo.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED6MXK130V"},

Haldane,Cheong Wah Wong,Janet Yellen,Peter Dragicevich,GLOBAL,FOREX/ (UPDATE 1),Americas,Japan,New Zealand,Currencies / Foreign Exchange Markets,Corporate Events,Asia / Pacific,Australia,Euro Zone as a Whole,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"* Dollar eases vs yen, edges back from recent 3-week high * NZ dollar firmer after RBNZ plays down currency's rise * Pound steadies after its rise on BoE Haldane's comments (Updates prices, adds comments) By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - The dollar eased versus the yen on Thursday as a recent rally tied to bets on another U.S. interest rate hike this year lost steam, while the New Zealand dollar rose after its central bank stopped short of aggressively trying to talk down the currency. The New Zealand dollar was the big mover during Asian trade, rising 0.4 percent on the day to $0.7248, edging back in the direction of a four-month peak of $0.7320 set last week. The kiwi rose after New Zealand's central bank played down the recent rise in the currency, while it kept interest rates steady at record lows as analysts had widely expected.  The main takeaways from the statement were pretty much in line with the last statement. They're still optimistic and positive on the medium-term growth outlook,  said Peter Dragicevich, G10 FX strategist for Nomura in Singapore.  It could be some people were looking for the RBNZ to be a little bit more forceful in their rhetoric around the exchange rate given how it's rallied the last few weeks,  he said, adding the absence of such jawboning probably helped give the kiwi a lift. The U.S. dollar eased 0.2 percent against the yen to 111.15, pulling away from a three-week high of 111.79 yen reached on Tuesday.  Risk aversion arising out of ongoing decline in oil prices is one of the factors explaining the move in dollar/yen,  said Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist for Maybank in Singapore. A recent narrowing of the U.S.-Japan 10-year yield differential,  was also weighing on the dollar, Wong said. The U.S. 10-year bond yield is now 209 basis points above its Japanese counterpart, compared to levels around 237 basis points seen in the early part of May.  Yield differentials should continue to drive dollar/yen direction,  Wong said, adding that a pick-up in U.S. inflation data is needed for markets to price in higher U.S. Treasury yields and lift the dollar. Brent crude oil futures eased 0.1 percent after sliding 2.6 percent in the previous session. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was marginally weaker at 97.504, having retreated from a one-month high of 97.871 set on Tuesday. The euro was little changed at $1.1168 Last week, the Federal Reserve, as expected, raised key borrowing costs by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent, while Fed Chair Janet Yellen downplayed recent signs of inflation softening. Sterling held steady at $1.2670, after having risen 0.3 percent on Wednesday when the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he expected to back a British rate increase this year.

The king was not hurt. The unidentified youth, together with a 13-year-old who is too young to be investigated, is suspected of having fired the gun from a garden or house window at a group of cyclists that included King Maha Vajiralongkorn, a regular visitor to Bavaria, and his entourage.   A toy pistol, a soft air pistol, was used. First it was fired at a group of cyclists, one of whom was the King of Thailand,  said Thomas Rauscher, prosecutor in the southern town of Landshut. Neither the king nor any of his entourage was hurt. The palace in Bangkok, when contacted by Reuters on Thursday, said it did not know about the incident.  We have no details,  said an official at the palace's news division who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter in Thailand. Prosecutors said the king's household said they had no interest in charges being brought in the case.   Reuters was unable to contact the youth, who has not been identified, or representatives for him. It was not clear who had drawn the incident to the attention of the police. Representatives at the Thai Embassy in Berlin were not available for comment. Later, more shots were allegedly fired at the king's car in the small, historic town of Erding, some 35 kilometers (22 miles) from Munich, the prosecutor said.  The 14-year-old is being investigated for attempted grievous bodily harm and it was unclear whether the boys knew who they were shooting at, said the prosecutor.  His office will decide whether to charge the teenager with a criminal offenSe. The shooting happened on June 10 at about 11 p.m. (2100 GMT).

Guy Philippe, 49, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga in Miami after pleading guilty to conspiring to commit money laundering in connection with his receipt of cash payments tied to narcotics sales in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Prosecutors said Philippe, a former high-ranking official in the Haitian National Police, received more than $1.5 million in bribes to ensure the safe transit of drug shipments. His sentence was confirmed by court records. Philippe has been in custody since his arrest early this year. A lawyer for Philippe did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Philippe pleaded guilty in April as part of a deal in which two counts were dismissed against him, including one for drug trafficking that could have resulted in a life sentence, and in which the parties agreed to recommend a nine-year prison term. He was arrested in Haiti on Jan. 5 in Haiti after giving a radio interview and then extradited to the United States. He had avoided capture for more than a decade in connection with a November 2005 indictment. The arrest came four days before Philippe was scheduled to join Haiti's parliament as a senator, following his November election from the country's southwestern Grand Anse region. U.S. prosecutors accused Philippe of conspiring from 1997 to March 2001 to import more than 5 kg (11 pounds) of cocaine into the United States, and to launder money to conceal illegal activity from June 1999 to April 2003. He was also accused of having transferred a $112,000 check that included sums from drug trafficking in late 2000.

The production from Romine was evident. But when Sanchez returned, the at-bats and productivity diminished for the backup catcher. At least until Wednesday night when Romine tied a career high with three hits, including a two-run double in the sixth inning, and the New York Yankees snapped a seven-game losing streak with an 8-4 victory over the Los Angeles Angels. Romine began his 29th start with a .218 average. He batted .314 during the first month of the season but since then was batting .136 (8-for-59) in his previous 20 games.  My job first and foremost is to catch, and any time I do something with the bat, it's a bonus,  Romine said. Romine posted his fifth career game with three hits and first since May 28, 2016, at Tampa Bay. He raised his average 19 points, but more important, his production helped the Yankees end their longest losing streak since April 2007 and avoid dropping an eighth straight game for the first time since Aug. 19-26, 1995. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at YankeesLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatch He's been great,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of Romine.  He stepped up big in Gary's absence. He does a great job with our pitching staff. He's contributed offensively. He's done a really good job.  And it's not easy because he was playing every day and he was having a lot of success offensively playing every day and then he went back to the playing once every three or four days. It was good to see him have a good night.  Romine's biggest hit was the two-run double to deep center field off Mike Morin with one out in the sixth inning. The hit occurred an inning after Matt Holliday broke a 2-2 tie with a solo homer off Ricky Nolasco and pushed the lead to 5-2. The Yankees added a run on an infield single by Aaron Hicks. The hit prevented Girardi from using Dellin Betances for more than three outs. Betances was warming up when Romine doubled but only pitched the eighth after Chad Green registered four outs and the Yankees added their final runs on RBI singles by Starlin Castro and Chase Headley in the eighth.  Romine's always been a good player,  Betances said. Didi Gregorius hit a two-run homer in the second for the Yankees and starter Jordan Montgomery (5-4) allowed two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. The only blemish for New York's first win since June 12 was struggling reliever Tyler Clipaprd allowing a two-run homer to Martin Maldonado without getting an out in the ninth. After Clippard was booed off the mound, Aroldis Chapman quickly secured the win. While the Yankees halted their skid, the Angels were unable to go above .500 after reaching the break-even mark for the 18th time. Maldonado hit a game-tying homer in the fourth and had his first career multi-homer game. Andrelton Simmons was 3-for-4. The Angels struck out 10 times and their top five hitters were a combined 3-for-16. It also continued to be a struggle for Nolasco, who dropped a career-high seventh straight start. Nolasco allowed five runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings and is winless in his last 10 starts.  It's a tough lineup, tough park, tight zone,  said Nolasco, who has allowed a league-leading 23 homers.  This is one of those parks where you can't sit there and just pound, you know, because then you'll get the fly balls. You kind of pitch to the park.  It matched the team record set by George Brunet, who dropped seven straight starts in 1967. His skid is three shy of the team record set by Andy Hassler in 1976.  He's kept us in games and given us chances to win a lot of games, tonight included,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He got us to a certain point. Unfortunately, it unraveled a little bit in the sixth, but he got us to a certain point and he definitely gave us a chance. We just didn't get anything going offensively early enough.

St. Louis overcame a five-run deficit for a 7-6, 10-inning victory over Philadelphia on Wednesday night at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies built a 5-0 lead through four innings, but the Cardinals chipped away, hitting four homers to tie the score. Tommy Pham had a multi-homer game and evened the score 5-5 in the ninth with a solo shot off Phillies closer Hector Neris.  We talk about how dangerous a hitter he is at any point to any part of the field, too,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of Pham.  He went and picked the deepest part in center. He's an exciting player when he's hitting the ball well.  The homer off Neris was Pham's ninth of the season. It came on a 1-1 pitch that was the second consecutive fastball he saw on the outside corner. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PhilliesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatch The first one I felt like he made a good pitch, the second one was just a little more over the plate,  said Pham, who also had a multi-homer game against the Atlanta Braves on May 7. St. Louis tied the game with the long ball, then took the lead in an unconventional fashion. Jose Martinez led off the 10th with a double and advanced to third on a balk by Edubray Ramos (0-6). Martinez scored when Ramos made an errant pickoff throw to first base. Yadier Molina added an RBI single to pad the lead. Seung-Hwan Oh allowed an RBI single to Cameron Perkins in the bottom of the 10th but still picked up his 16th save of the season. The Phillies, who have lost 13 of their last 14 games, had a chance to win in the ninth when Freddy Galvis doubled down the left field line with two outs and Odubel Herrera at first base. Herrera, however, ran directly through a stop sign from third base coach Juan Samuel and was easily thrown out at the plate by Pham.  His emotions got the best of him,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said of Herrera.  He just wanted to score so badly, he put his head down and ran, which is a mistake. He's just an emotional guy and wanted to win the game.  The Cardinals' comeback overshadowed a solid outing from Phillies right-hander Nick Pivetta. In his eighth career major league start, the rookie puzzled Cardinals hitters and struck out a career-best 10. Pivetta, a rare bright spot in 2017 for the Phillies, has been especially impressive in his last two starts. He allowed three runs in six innings Wednesday. The 24-year-old Canadian struck out nine in seven scoreless innings in his previous start against the Boston Red Sox. Pivetta made two mistakes against the Cardinals, giving up homers to Pham and Jedd Gyorko, who belted a two-run shot to right field in the sixth inning. Martinez made it a one-run game in the eighth, smacking his first career pinch-hit homer on the first pitch of the night from reliever Joaquin Benoit.  The entire offense slowly got us back into that,  Matheny said of the comeback.  By the fourth inning, we had a couple of bloop hits, and that was about it at that point. Maybe only one hard-hit ball.  St. Louis starter Michael Wacha struggled again. The right-hander lasted four innings and gave up five runs (two earned). Wacha dealt with baserunners all night, allowing nine hits to the 22 batters he faced. He has failed to go more than 4 1/3 innings in five of his last six starts and has an 8.17 ERA in that span. The Phillies struck for three runs in the first inning against Wacha. Maikel Franco started the scoring with an RBI groundout, and Herrera followed with a two-run double. None of the first-inning runs charged to Wacha were earned after an error by second baseman Greg Garcia, who committed two errors in the game. Philadelphia recorded 16 hits in all but scored only once after the fourth. The Phillies put a runner on third with less than two outs in the sixth and seventh innings, but Cardinals reliever Tyler Lyons -- who had five strikeouts in three shutout innings -- got out of both jams.  You got to win when you get 16 hits. We just couldn't push any more runs across until that 10th inning,  Mackanin said.  Very disappointing.  NOTES: Cardinals CF Dexter Fowler left the game in the 10th inning due to left quad tightness. ... The Phillies announced they came to terms with first-round draft pick, OF Adam Haseley. The 21-year-old was picked eighth overall after hitting .390 with 14 homers and 56 RBIs for the University of Virginia in 2017. ... Wednesday marked the second straight night the Cardinals and Phillies played extra innings.

The first two fatalities recorded in the three-day heatwave  took place on Monday in Santa Clara County, California, south of San Francisco, and included a homeless person found in a car, the San Jose Mercury News reported.  The victims were identified only as a 72-year-old man and an 87-year-old woman.  It is tragic when someone dies of hyperthermia since in most every case it could have been prevented,  Dr. Michelle Jorden of the Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office told the newspaper.   Hyperthermia and heat stress happen when a body's heat-regulation system cannot handle the heat. It can happen to anyone, which is why it is so important to be in a cool location, drink plenty of water and take a cool bath or shower if you are getting too hot,  Jorden said. The extreme heat, brought on by a high-pressure system parked over the Four Corners region where Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet, has boosted temperatures well above normal across much of the Southwest. The bodies of a 57-year-old father and his 21-year-old son from Corpus Christi, Texas, were found earlier this week in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, where they were hiking, media reported.  New Mexico State Police told an NBC affiliate in New Mexico that the scorching temperatures, which were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), contributed to the deaths of the men. The National Weather Service and local authorities issued heat advisories and warnings, urging residents to stay indoors and to drink plenty of water if they were outdoors. Power grid operators encouraged customers to use electricity sparingly to avoid a shutdown or blackout. The sizzling weather forced the cancellation of more than 20 flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and delays at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Aviation experts say the hotter, thinner air saps power from airline engines. The heat can also create issues for ground crews, where pavement temperatures can reach more than 150 degrees F (66 C), a life-threatening condition if workers are exposed to it too long. Temperatures reached 127 F (52.8 C) in California's Death Valley at the peak of the heat wave on Tuesday afternoon but cooler weather was expected across the region by the end of the week.

The forecast for strong driving numbers will be welcomed by U.S. refiners, which are banking on summer driving season to draw down high product inventories and resurrect margins from seasonal lows. Oil prices have sagged in recent weeks because of  a glut of supply worldwide, and refiners have also been hurt by heavy gasoline inventories. That has pushed gasoline prices lower, which could boost driving activity. The American Automobile Association projects a record 37.5 million people will drive 50 miles (80 km) or more from home during the holiday period that stretches from June 30 to July 4.  That would break last year's record of 36.5 million, and mark a fourth consecutive year of increased motor travel for the Independence Day holiday, AAA said.  Driving activity in the United States is closely watched since the country accounts for about 10 percent of global gasoline demand. The average U.S. price for regular gasoline was $2.28 per gallon on Wednesday, down slightly from $2.32 a year ago, according to AAA. Average weekly prices have fallen by roughly 5 percent since the end of May, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  It's almost a shock that we're seeing lower oil prices in the summer than the winter,  said Patrick DeHaan, petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy.  Anecdotally, the lower gas prices go, the more people are gonna make those spontaneous trips. There's more stations under $2 a gallon today than there were in winter.  U.S. gasoline demand has rebounded in the past month after a slow start to the year, with two of the past five weeks recording the highest demand numbers on record. Motorists logged 1.2 percent more miles on U.S. roads and highways in April compared with the same month last year, according to U.S. government data released on Tuesday, putting drivers on pace to break last year's record volumes. U.S. vehicle miles traveled were up 1.5 percent year-over-year through the first four months of 2017. Despite the strong driving figures, U.S. gasoline demand was down 2.7 percent from a year ago for the first three months of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Aya is one of more than 1,200 female refugees from Syria that have been trained through an informal beauty school in Lebanon, learning blow-drying techniques, basic cutting, hair dying, make-up and eyebrow threading skills.   I hold my head high that I know this,  said Aya, who did not want to give her real name for security reasons.  Lebanon hosts more than 1 million registered Syrian refugees, a quarter of its population. Many have no legal right to work, and families are forced to find other ways to pay for food and shelter. Aya counts herself lucky, having escaped the Syrian war and finding a new home and - eventually - informal work after moving in 2013 to Tyre, a coastal city in southern Lebanon, a region that hosts more than 117,000 Syrian refugees.  Half Way to Her Dream Aya has been running a beauty salon out of her home for the past six months after completing a course at the beauty school, set up by aid agency the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). It is a dream come true for the 27-year-old mother of four.  I feel (that) hair is like a painting you are drawing ... You have to determine what looks best on her, what works for her face,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. After moving to Lebanon Aya wanted to prove herself and show  women are not just there for cooking and taking care of children. She longed to learn how to do hair.  I feel like I am living my dream, but half of my dream. My bigger dream is that I open a salon,  said Aya with a smile on her face. Her beauty salon is a modest set-up, with just a plastic chair that she places in the middle of her living room armed with her tools by her side - hair clips, a round brush, comb, and her trusted hairdryer. She usually gets two to three customers a week from the neighborhood, including some family and friends.  Even though she does not get much money from her customers, she is confident her skills will support her.   I am okay with the little I get ... what's important to me is it's what I love to do,  said Aya, who used to work as a seamstress near the Syrian capital Damascus, a job she did not enjoy, but the work helped her family. The training also has given her a sense of independence.  If God forbid my husband dies, who will take care of me? No, I will have a job to benefit myself and my kids, and I wouldn't rely on anyone,  said Aya.  Skills for Life The beauty school is part of the NRC's Youth Education Pack, (YEP), a program set up currently in 11 centers across Lebanon to help Syrian and Palestinian refugees.   The objective of this program is to provide (them) with the skills they need to use them in the future ... whether in Lebanon or when the come back to Syria, or maybe if they want to travel outside the Middle East,  said Aline Sfeir, education project manager at the NRC.   The free program includes communication skills, problem-solving skills and English training as well as beauty skills, barbering for men, basic mobile phone maintenance and sewing and tailoring.  Local experts teach the refugees for around two to three months. When they complete their training they get a certificate and a blow-dryer or hair straightener.   When they learn these skills they don't need a big investment in money to start working in it,  said Sfeir.  Aya is also proud that as refugee she pushed herself to learn new skills even though her circumstances are difficult.      I want to show that here in Lebanon yes we migrated, but we are making our dreams real although it's little,  said Aya. Reporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert.

Most of the 55 percent of teens who have had sex by 18 used some type of protection, typically a condom, the study of more than 4,000 teenagers by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics showed. Some 80 percent of teenagers employed a contraceptive method during their first sexual encounters, according to the study. The study measured sexual activity, defined as vaginal intercourse between a female and a male, by teens aged 15 to 19 from 2011 to 2015. The greater use of protection helped lower the rate of births by teenagers to 22 per 1,000 females in 2015 from 62 per 1,000 in 1991.  Teen pregnancy rates peaked in 1990 and have since fallen more than 50 percent, said Joyce Abma, researcher at the National Center for Health Statistics, who co-authored the report with Gladys Martinez. In a phone interview, Abma said the level of sexual activity among teenagers fell sharply until about 2002 and had since gradually declined, while the use of contraceptives had steadily increased. The study found that among males aged 15 to 19, about 44 percent have had sex, down from 60 percent in 1988. For females, that rate was 42 percent in the recent study compared with 51 percent in 1988.  Teenagers are generally more responsible than most parents think when it comes to when and if to have sex, said Bill Albert, spokesman for the nonprofit National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.  Adults, when they think of teen sexual culture, they see little more than a blur of bare midriffs,  Albert said. Among the teen females who have had sex, 74 percent had intercourse for the first time with someone with whom they were  going steady,  compared with 51 percent of the males, the study found. Twenty percent of the females and nearly 40 percent of the males said their first experiences were with someone they considered  just friends  or  going out (with) every once in a while.  About 2 percent of females and 7 percent of males said they had sex for the first time with someone they just met, the study showed.
