Mr. Spicer thanked his team and said he would help with the transition, as the team gave him a round of applause, the official said. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff who clashed with Mr. Scaramucci during the campaign, then introduced the new communications director to the full team.Mr. Scaramucci leaned in to hug Mr. Spicer, who awkwardly put his arms around Mr. Scaramucci without touching him, said two people who witnessed the exchange. Messrs. Scaramucci and Priebus also shared a handshake, the people said.In a meeting with the communications team, many of whom only know their new boss from his TV appearances, Mr. Scaramucci spoke about his family and his middle-class upbringing, people familiar with the meeting said. He promised not to micromanage the office and described his preference for a more collaborative press shop.\u201cEveryone is a little surprised, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014it\u2019s not a complete shock,\u201d one White House official said.Mr. Scaramucci is the founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital and a hedge-fund conference known as SALT. Mr. Scaramucci, who is known as \u201cthe Mooch,\u201d previously hosted a financial TV show on             Fox Business Network                   and has been a frequent guest on cable news shows advocating for Mr. Trump.In an afternoon tweet, Mr. Spicer said it was an \u201chonor and privilege\u201d to serve Mr. Trump and the country. He said he would continue to work through August.Mr. Scaramucci, speaking at Friday\u2019s White House briefing, said that reports of tension among senior staff has been overplayed.\u201cI would love to have Sean [Spicer] here. Sean decided that he thought it would be better to go,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cI\u2019m used to dealing with friction,\u201d he said, adding he doesn\u2019t have any personal animosity toward Mr. Spicer or Mr. Priebus.Mr. Scaramucci said that Ms. Sanders would take the lead role in briefing the press, with him likely taking a more behind-the-scenes role. \u201cI\u2019m up here today, only because I think it\u2019s the first day,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said.The White House has been seeking a communications director since Mike Dubke resigned from the role at the end of May, \u200bas the president aimed to reset his administration amid expanding probes into his associates\u2019 ties to Russia.Mr. Scaramucci suggested that the communications team would continue its policy of deferring most questions related to the special counsel investigation on Russia to Mr. Trump\u2019s private legal team, an effort to isolate the probe from the White House\u2019s policy goals. He said he is \u201cclose personal friends with Jay Sekulow,\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, but when asked about the president\u2019s strategy for dealing with Special Counsel       Robert Mueller,        Mr. Scaramucci said, \u201cThat\u2019s sort of in that ZIP Code of like, you know, the legal team, and not really in Sarah or my ZIP Code.\u201dThe president has complained privately that the press team has been at times too slow or ineffective in defending him, most notably following his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. But some White House officials counter that the West Wing has a problem with decision-making, not public relations. Several people approached by White House officials have turned down offers to join the team, people familiar with the conversations said.Since Mr. Dubke resigned, Mr. Spicer had been filling in for the role of communications director, while Ms. Sanders, previously the deputy press secretary, has taken over at the podium for most White House briefings, which have been off-camera since late last month.Mr. Spicer, a veteran Republican communications operative in Washington, was praised by Mr. Trump for his ability to attract viewers to the daily news briefing, which cable networks often carried from start to finish. But Mr. Spicer also suffered from uneven performances: In one instance, as he condemned the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, he said even Adolf Hitler didn\u2019t \u201csink to using chemical weapons\u201d during World War II and didn\u2019t use \u201cgas on his own people.\u201d He later apologized and said he had let the president down with the comments.The high-profile role made Mr. Spicer one of the most recognized faces in the Trump administration, and one of the first on the new White House team who was parodied on Saturday Night Live. The Spicer character, played by Melissa McCarthy, became a recurring bit on the late-night comedy show.Mr. Trump has told associates that he personally liked Mr. Spicer, but blamed the White House press corps for being too tough on him. But at times the president\u2019s own statements undercut his chief spokesman. After Mr. Spicer said the president\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Comey was based on a recommendation from the Justice Department, the president then said he fired Mr. Comey because he was a \u201cshowboat,\u201d telling NBC News, \u201cI was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\u201dMr. Spicer, one of the few practicing Catholics among Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides, was also cut out of a meeting with Pope Francis during the president\u2019s first foreign trip. Those close to Mr. Spicer said he was surprised and hurt that he wasn\u2019t included: He had brought along several religious items for his children for the pope to bless. Mr. Spicer never publicly complained about the snub.Write to Michael C.

MGI -1.66%       by Ant Financial Services Group, controlled by Chinese billionaire and             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.14%       co-founder Jack Ma, some of the people said.The committee, known as CFIUS, didn\u2019t green-light the deal by a recent deadline, the people said. Ant refiled its application, and Mr. Ma has continued a charm campaign that included a meeting Tuesday with 20 U.S. and Chinese executives at the U.S. Department of Commerce.The backers of at least four other Chinese deals have recently refiled or said they would refile applications to the committee after failing to get approval within the roughly two-and-a-half-month review period, according to public disclosures.At least two of them have taken the unusual step of refiling twice to try to address the committee\u2019s concerns\u2014            China Oceanwide Holdings                   Group Co., which last year announced a $2.7 billion takeover of Richmond, Va.-based insurer             Genworth Financial Inc.,       and Chinese-government backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which last year announced a $1.3 billion plan to take over Portland, Ore.-based             Lattice Semiconductor Corp.Though refiled deals can still be approved, delays can be symptomatic of committee concerns, said people familiar with the process. At least one smaller Chinese deal to buy a U.S. Wi-Fi hotspot business collapsed last month after failing three times to get approval.Reviews are stretching on for many deals, including one by Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. to buy a controlling stake in hedge-fund investing firm SkyBridge Capital from financier       Anthony Scaramucci,        who on Friday was named White House communications director. People involved in the CFIUS process say many of their deals are facing monthslong delays.Deal makers say CFIUS\u2014a multiagency committee led by the U.S. Treasury whose task is to screen foreign investments for national-security concerns\u2014is growing increasingly wary of Chinese companies. A recent buying spree pushed China\u2019s announced overseas investments to a record $221\u00a0billion last year, including $66 billion in the U.S., according to Dealogic.Critics in Congress and some government agencies say Chinese investment poses disproportionate risks to national security because it may be directed and subsidized by the government of China, a chief U.S. rival both economically and militarily.The concerns began growing under the previous administration as investment surged, with then-President       Barack Obama       taking the rare step of blocking a Chinese technology deal on his way out of office, and have only continued to intensify during the current administration.Lawmakers and the Treasury are considering changes to the review process that could further tighten scrutiny on Chinese investment. Chinese deal makers are battling similar concerns from European regulators as well.Rising trade tensions between China and the U.S. also could be contributing to increased hesitation by the committee, lawyers and bankers say. High-level trade talks between the two countries ended Wednesday without any concrete agreements, and President       Donald Trump       has said he would consider leveraging trade to get China\u2019s help reining in North Korea.\u201cA deal that might not otherwise raise much concern could raise serious concern if it\u2019s being done by a Chinese company,\u201d said Peter Alfano, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs who maintains a database of publicly disclosed CFIUS activity.The committee is also receiving record numbers of filings while still lacking key personnel, including political appointees, as well as clear direction from Mr. Trump. Career professionals see no reason to risk recommending a Chinese deal that could later prompt the ire of administration officials or members of Congress, say people familiar with the process.A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe Treasury is fully engaged in the CFIUS process and provides guidance and discusses the issues with the capable career staff whose job it is to protect national security.\u201dJohn Reynolds, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, a law firm that handles CFIUS cases, estimates the committee is on track to review more than 250 cases this year, versus around 170 in 2016 and over 150 in 2015. Chinese deals are expected to comprise around 30% of the committee\u2019s reviews this year versus a typical maximum of around 10% in the past, estimates another person familiar with the process.Reviews take a maximum of 75 days, including an investigative period in which the committee may ask for more information. If companies don\u2019t get approval in that period, they can tweak their deals to address concerns and refile their submissions. Preliminary discussions with the committee are dragging on too, lasting as long as six weeks, said a person familiar with the process.For the Ant and China Oceanwide deals, the committee is concerned about the prospect of giving Chinese companies access to Americans\u2019 personal data, said people familiar with the discussions. In the past, the committee likely would have approved such deals without much disruption, but it has grown more sensitive to personal data issues after a cyberattack on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management that U.S. intelligence said in 2015 they suspected China was behind, these people said. China has denied the accusation.Ant and MoneyGram officials have said MoneyGram would continue storing what little personal data it collects at a secure facility in Minneapolis.Most sensitive are Chinese investments in technology, particularly semiconductors\u2014seen by the U.S. as a potential economic and military threat. In December, Mr. Obama nixed the purchase of German semiconductor-equipment supplier             Aixtron SE                   by a Chinese investment fund, following an investigation by CFIUS, which was looking into the deal because Aixtron has U.S. assets.That doesn\u2019t bode well for Canyon Bridge\u2019s deal for Lattice, even though Lattice has said it doesn\u2019t make military-grade technology. After recently failing again to win CFIUS approval, the companies discussed taking the deal to Mr. Trump to test his views on Chinese investment, according to people familiar with the matter. They ultimately decided to refile their application.\u2014Peg Brickley  contributed to this article.Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com"}, {"news_title": "U.S. to Ban Tourist Visits to North Korea ", "keywords": "north korea, north korea travel ban, tourism, travel ban, u.s.,U.S. government,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,state department", "news_time": "2017-07-21 12:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-ban-tourist-visits-to-north-korea-travel-agencies-say-1500627560", "content": "The U.S. will ban American citizens from traveling to North Korea starting next month, the State Department said Friday, citing growing risks to Americans who venture into the country.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       authorized the decision \u201cdue to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea\u2019s system of law enforcement,\u201d State Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said.The travel ban comes just weeks after U.S. college student       Otto Warmbier,        who was detained while on a tour in Pyongyang last year, died after he returned home in June with a severe brain injury.Mr. Tillerson had told lawmakers after Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death that he was considering a ban. The State Department said Friday those seeking to travel to North Korea for limited humanitarian or other purposes could apply for an exception by using so-called special validation passports. Otherwise, American passports will be considered invalid for use in traveling to or through North Korea.The ban will take effect in late August, 30 days after the State Department publishes public notice, which Ms. Nauert said will occur next week.The ban was signaled earlier Friday by tour operators. The two largest travel companies involved in taking Western tourists to the isolated country, China-based Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, said they learned of the impending ban from the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which handles U.S. diplomatic affairs in North Korea and had contacted them separately by phone to inform them of the U.S. decision.Officers at both companies said the Swedish Embassy told them the U.S. would make the announcement on Thursday next week. Violating the ban would lead to the U.S. government invalidating the traveler\u2019s passport, Young Pioneer said it was told.Young Pioneer stopped bringing U.S. tourists to North Korea last month following the death of Mr. Warmbier, who went to North Korea in late 2015 on a tour organized by the company.At least three Americans are being held in North Korea, though none was a tourist. Two are tied to a Christian university in Pyongyang. At least 16 American citizens have been detained in North Korea over the past decade, according to the State Department.About 5,000 Western tourists visit North Korea each year, with roughly one-fifth of them U.S. citizens, according to Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, which has been bringing visitors to North Korea since 1993.Tourists visiting North Korea aren\u2019t typically allowed to travel independently and generally join group tours, where they are closely chaperoned by representatives of official state entities.Tourism companies catering to the demands of tourists with less-conventional tastes have sprung up in recent years in the U.S., Europe, China and Australia. Most tours to North Korea last between three days and two weeks and are focused on Pyongyang, though some have included activities such as train travel, skiing and surfing.Mr. Cockerell said Friday that the travel ban would be \u201ca big blow to us,\u201d and it would likely reduce the willingness of other Western nationals to travel to North Korea.U.K.-incorporated Koryo Tours accounts for about 40% of the overall volume of Western tourists to North Korea, he estimates. Mr. Cockerell criticized the U.S. decision.\u201cAll interactions between North Koreans and Americans, who are very much demonized in the country, will grind to a halt, and the North Koreans will only be left with their own media to portray Americans as they like,\u201d he said.Some travelers in the U.S. said they thought a ban would be unfair to Americans curious to learn about the closed society.\u201cI think it\u2019s an overreach on the part of the American government,\u201d said Stacy Stone, 28, of Chattanooga, Tenn., who spent two weeks in North Korea in October, traveling with U.K.-based tour operator Secret Compass. \u201cThey need to allow American citizens to make their own choice.\u201d\u2014Kris Maher contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com"}, {"news_title": "Meet Your New Landlord: Wall Street", "keywords": "american homes 4 rent,b. wayne hughes,barry sternlicht,colony starwood homes,home buyers,home investors,home sales,home values,nashville,progress residential,single-family home market,spring hill,streetlane homes,thomas barrack,American Homes 4 Rent,AMH,Colony Starwood Homes,SFR,Progress Residential,Streetlane Homes,Blackstone Group,BX,Invitation Homes,INVH,Michael Cook,Thomas Barrack Jr,Barry Sternlicht,B.

American Homes 4 Rent,        AMH 0.52%       a public company that had been scooping up homes in the neighborhood, offered the same amount\u2014but all cash, no inspection required.Twelve hours after the house went on the market in April, the Agoura Hills, Calif.-based real-estate investment trust signed a contract. About a month later, it put the house back on the market, this time for rent, for $1,575 a month.A new breed of homeowners has arrived in this middle-class suburb of Nashville and in many other communities around the country: big investment firms in the business of offering single-family homes for rent. Their appearance has shaken up sales and rental markets and, in some neighborhoods, sparked rent increases.On Jo Ann Drive alone, American Homes 4 Rent owns seven homes, property records indicate. In all of Spring Hill, four firms\u2014American Homes,             Colony Starwood Homes,        SFR 0.06%       Progress Residential and Streetlane Homes\u2014own nearly 700 houses, according to tax rolls. That amounts to about 5% of all the houses in town, a 2016 census indicates, and roughly three-quarters of those available for rent, according to       Lisa Wurth,        president of the local Realtors\u2019 association.Those four companies and others like them have become big landlords in other Nashville suburbs, and in neighborhoods outside Atlanta, Phoenix and a couple dozen other metropolitan areas. All told, big investors have spent some $40 billion buying about 200,000 houses, renovating them and building rental-management businesses, estimates real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors LLC. Still, they own less than 2% of all U.S. rental homes, according to Green Street.The buying spree amounts to a huge bet that the homeownership rate, which currently is hovering around a five-decade low, will stay low and that rents will continue to rise. The investors also are wagering that many people no longer see owning a home as an essential part of the American dream.\u201cThe rental stigma has really subsided,\u201d says       Michael Cook,        operations chief at closely held Streetlane Homes, which owns about 4,000 houses. \u201cPeople are realizing that houses are not necessarily the best places to store wealth.\u201dFor many years, the rental-home business was dominated by small businesses and mom-and-pop investors, most of whom owned just a property or two. Big investment firms concentrated on other real-estate sectors\u2014apartment buildings, office towers, shopping centers and warehouses\u2014reasoning that single-family homes were too difficult to acquire en masse and unwieldy to manage and maintain.That all began to change during the financial crisis a decade ago. Swaths of suburbia were sold on courthouse steps after millions of Americans defaulted on mortgages. Veteran real-estate investors raced to buy tens of thousands of deeply discounted houses, often sight unseen. The big buyers included investors       Thomas Barrack Jr.       and       Barry Sternlicht      \u2014who later merged their rental-home holdings to create Colony Starwood\u2014            Blackstone Group                   LP, the world\u2019s largest private-equity firm, and self-storage magnate       B.

Shares of the Boston-based conglomerate fell nearly 3%, leaving the stock 18% below where it started the year.GE, its profits under pressure, improved its cash flow and ramped up cost-cutting efforts\u2014two areas of investor concern\u2014in Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt\u2019s       last quarter at the helm. The bad news from investors\u2019 point of view was that GE tempered profit expectations for the current year and said investors would have to wait until mid-November for CEO-designate       John Flannery       to discuss the outlook for 2018.It is unusual for a big company, especially one such as GE that is being pressured by an activist investor to improve its performance, to ask shareholders and customers to wait so long to learn about its gameplan.\u201cThis is a strange situation,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, analyst with William Blair & Co. \u201cThis increases the duration of the period of uncertainty.\u201dOn a conference call Friday, analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets asked if GE would be in \u201climbo\u201d until November. Mr. Flannery said the financial framework for 2017 is set and that he is \u201cnot worried that we\u2019re going to be, you know, dead in the water in the meantime.\u201dMr. Immelt will step down at the end of this month after 16 years as CEO.GE is under increasing pressure to show that its pivot away from financial services, big bets on the oil industry and a renewed focus on making jet engines and power turbines would be good for investors.Shares fell 2.9% to $25.91 each in Friday trading.Mr. Flannery, who formerly ran GE\u2019s health-care unit, is meeting with small groups of investors and visiting the business units of the roughly 300,000-person company.Jeffrey Bornstein,        GE\u2019s chief financial officer, defended the timeline in an interview and said the company would have to \u201cplay through\u201d any uncertainty created by a review that includes \u201ctesting everything we believe.\u201d\u201cThe notion that [Mr. Flannery] is going to get his arms around this in a month is a fallacy,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think asking for four or five months to do this is asking a lot.\u201dOn Friday, GE backed its prior 2017 projection of earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share and organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, but it warned that profit would be on the weak side. \u201cGiven our outlook on oil and gas and power, we are trending to the bottom end of the range,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said on the conference call.Analysts are skeptical that GE will reach a goal of delivering $2 a share in profit in 2018, but the company said an updated target wouldn\u2019t come until after Mr. Flannery\u2019s review.\u201cThis was almost like a funeral dirge today. There was nothing positive,\u201d said Brian Langenberg, industry strategist at Langenberg & Co. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything in November that is going to make me thrilled.\u201dMeanwhile, industrial conglomerate             Honeywell International Inc.        HON 1.04%       on Friday reported a stronger quarterly profit and raised the low end of its 2017 earnings outlook. The company is also conducting a review of its portfolio under new CEO       Darius Adamczyk       which it expects to complete in late September or early October.\u201cWe are very conscious of not letting this slow us down,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer       Tom Szlosek       in an interview. \u201cWe think we do a good job of keeping our businesses out of it.\u201dStrength in its aerospace division as well as its home and building-technologies business helped Honeywell\u2019s latest results. The company\u2019s profit rose 6% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, while revenue climbed about 1% to $10.08 billion.Honeywell shares gained 1% to $136.35 Friday, leaving it up 18% on the year.Both GE and Honeywell are facing pressure from activist investors. GE pledged to boost its cost-cutting program earlier this year after discussions with Trian Fund Management LP, which has been frustrated by missed profit goals at GE. Third Point LLC has called on Honeywell to explore selling or splitting off its aerospace business.On Friday, GE said it cut $593 million in annual industrial costs in the second quarter and is on track to meet or beat its $1 billion savings goal by the end of the year. It has eliminated $670 million in spending so far this year.Despite re-examining its spending, GE said it won\u2019t consider reducing its dividend payout, which Mr. Bornstein called the company\u2019s \u201csingle most important capital allocation item.\u201dCash flow in GE\u2019s industrial segment was a positive $1.5 billion after a shocking negative $1.6 billion for the first quarter. The company backed its full-year cash-flow target of $12 billion to $14 billion but said it would also be at the low end of the projected range.In all, GE\u2019s second-quarter earnings fell less than expected, with much of the drop reflecting a year-earlier boost from the sale of its home-appliances business. The company reported a profit of $1.19 billion, or 15 cents a share, down from $2.76 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 12% to $29.56 billion.\u2014 Imani Moisecontributed to this article.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'GE, Its Outlook Hazy, Asks Investors to Wait.'"}, {"news_title": "Joseph Rago, Wall Street Journal Editorial Writer, Dies at 34", "keywords": " editorial board, editorial page, editorial writer, obituary, pulitzer prize winner,wall street journal,New York Police Department,awards,political,general news,obituaries,routine general news", "news_time": "2017-07-21 16:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/joseph-rago-wall-street-journal-editorial-writer-dies-at-34-1500666198", "content": "Joseph Rago, a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial writer at The Wall Street Journal who was known for his richly reported pieces and influence on policy makers, was found dead Thursday evening at his home in Manhattan. He was 34 years old.The New York Police Department found Mr. Rago dead in his apartment at 7:40 p.m., according to a police official. The authorities went to check on Mr. Rago after he didn\u2019t show up for work on Thursday. Paul Gigot, the editor of the Journal\u2019s editorial page, had alerted the paper\u2019s security officials, who then contacted the police.Mr. Rago was found with no obvious signs of trauma and emergency responders declared him dead at the scene, the police said. The cause of death was still being determined by the medical examiner on Friday.\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we confirm the death of Joseph Rago, a splendid journalist and beloved friend,\u201d Mr. Gigot said in a statement. \u201cJoe and his family are in our thoughts and prayers, and we will be celebrating his work in Saturday\u2019s paper.\u201dMr. Rago made his biggest mark writing about health care. In 2011, he captured the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing for what the Pulitzer organization called his \u201cwell crafted, against-the-grain editorials challenging the health care reform advocated by President Obama.\u201d\u201cNo matter where you fall in the debate of health care reform, the arguments advanced by Joseph Rago in his series of editorials in The Wall Street Journal were impossible to ignore,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cNot paying attention to these editorials was not an option for policymakers.\u201dMr. Rago gained credibility with the policy community and with politicians because he did his homework, becoming one of the most well-sourced people around on health care, with sources throughout Washington and among academics on the left and right, Mr. Gigot said in an interview on Friday.\u201cThrough his editorials, he had enormous impact on events in Washington,\u201d he said.The last editorial Mr. Rago wrote, on Wednesday, was titled \u201cThe ObamaCare Republicans,\u201d Mr. Gigot said.After coming to the Journal as a summer intern in 2005, Mr. Rago stood out for his thoughtful reporting and flair for prose. \u201cI immediately hired him,\u201d Mr. Gigot said. \u201cHe was just too good not to hire.\u201dMr. Rago rose from an assistant editor on the op-ed page to editorial writer to a member of the editorial board. Friends and colleagues say he was modest and serious, but with a sardonic sense of humor that made him a pleasure to be around.\u201cHe was the kind of person you liked to have a beer with\u2014I know that\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s actually true,\u201d Mr. Gigot said.Along with health care, Mr. Rago\u2019s topics ranged from energy regulation to antitrust issues to the debate between privacy and national security. He was the Journal\u2019s main editorial writer during the 2016 presidential campaign and did interviews with many of the candidates as well as filed colorful opinion pieces from the campaign trail.A native of Falmouth, Mass., Mr. Rago graduated with a degree in history from Dartmouth College in 2005. While there, he was a member of the Phi Delta Alpha fraternity and wrote for the Dartmouth Review, an independent conservative student newspaper. He served on the paper\u2019s board of directors at the time of his death.He remained active with the campus and in a 2011 videotaped interview there said he tried to stay in touch with students from all over the country and offer his advice.\u201cJournalism is a hard field to get into, and I caught a break and try to help other people,\u201d he said.In an interview, Peter Robinson, a former speechwriter to President       Ronald Reagan       and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said that attitude was typical of Mr. Rago, a longtime friend and 2010 media fellow at Hoover.\u201cJoe was an intellectual fighter but there was also just a wonderful sweetness about him,\u201d he said.He praised Mr. Rago\u2019s rigorous approach to opinion writing, saying Mr. Rago always presented the information readers needed to have to assess his conclusions.\u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cJoe was never just mouthing off. He was doing the hard work of real journalism.\u201d\u2014Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Joseph Rago was a member of the Phi Delta Alpha fraternity at Dartmouth College.

Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, expecting to repurchase them at lower prices and collect the difference as profit.Bearish investors say they are scaling back on these bets not because their view of the market has fundamentally changed, but because it is difficult to stick to a money-losing strategy when it seems stocks can only go up.They believe the market moves are at odds with an economy that remains lukewarm as it enters its ninth year of growth, stock valuations that are historically high and a delay of business-friendly policies in Washington like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\u201cThere seems to be an overall view that people are invincible, that things will always go up, that there are no risks and no matter what goes on, no matter what foolishness is in play, people don\u2019t care,\u201d said Marc Cohodes, whose hedge fund focused on shorting stocks closed in 2008.Mr. Cohodes is now a chicken farmer based in California who is looking to get into goat herding in Canada. He shorts a handful of individual stocks personally, but isn\u2019t focused on the broader market.The practice of shorting companies is also going by the wayside as stocks continue to notch records. Short-biased hedge funds had $4.3 billion in assets at the end of March, down from $7.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to HFR Inc.The difficulty for stock-market bears stems from a Goldilocks-like market environment, in which the economy is expanding fast enough to support corporate earnings, but slow enough for the Federal Reserve to keep rates relatively low. Years of low rates and easy-money policies have boosted stocks, defying forecasts for a steep, prolonged downturn.\u201cThe shorts have been frustrated now for quite a while,\u201d said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, which has $260 billion in assets under management. The scenarios that might lead to a payout for market bears\u2014an economic recession or a sharp rise in interest rates\u2014don\u2019t seem imminent, either, Mr. Minerd added.In one sign of capitulation among the bears, stock pullbacks have been getting shorter.This year, there have been two times when the S&P 500 has closed down 1% or more. After these two selloffs, it has taken stocks an average of 14.5 days to recoup losses. That is well below the 25.5 days it took on average to bounce back from stretches of 1%-plus selloffs in 2016 and the 80 days it took to rebound in 2015, according to an analysis by WSJ Market Data Group.The share of individual investors who are either bullish or bearish has also fallen in recent months, according to a weekly survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, while the share of those who are neutral has risen. As of the end of June, 43% of investors said they were neutral\u2014the most since last August.\u201cThe danger is that you\u2019re too early getting out,\u201d said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management, which has $246 billion under management.The issue for investors, Mr. Ramos said, is that there remain few compelling alternatives to stocks.Bond yields have remained stubbornly low this year, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Friday at 2.232%, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.Central banks around the world in recent weeks have signaled they will move toward normalizing monetary policy, nudging bond yields higher. But few investors believe inflation will pick up so much that the Fed will be pressured into lifting rates faster than it has forecast\u2014a scenario that could lead to sharp market losses.At the same time, many who are invested in stocks are wary of signs that the bull market\u2019s days are numbered.Valuations have risen to levels many investors say are stretched, with the S&P 500 trading this week at 17.86 times the next 12 months of expected earnings, according to FactSet, above its 10-year average of 14.06 times forward earnings.Still, some who believe excesses are growing in the financial system say it is hard to convey those concerns to average investors. While signs of a housing bubble in the middle part of the last decade were abundant, indications that borrowing by companies will lead to a wave of defaults are more nuanced, said Albert Edwards, a strategist at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA      . Mr. Edwards has been bearish for most of the bull market and believes a corporate-debt binge will ultimately lead to a deeper bear market than in the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s much harder this time to see the corporate-debt excesses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a headline catcher. You have to be a bit geeky to pull apart the data and analyze it.\u201dDespite persistent concerns that investment-grade corporate bonds and junk debt are pricey, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of credit investors found that none of the respondents were significantly underweight either sector.In the week ended July 19, investors piled $4.6 billion into global equity funds, marking the eighth consecutive week of inflows for such funds, according to EPFR data.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of worry out there, but the market just keeps going up,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cWhen everyone agrees that it\u2019s time for this bull market to keep going, that\u2019s exactly the right time for the market rally to stop.\u201d\u2014Peter Levin  and Charley Grant  contributed to this article.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Short Sellers Retreat Amid Rally.'"}, {"news_title": "From Fort Knox Clerk to Insurance Kingpin: The Rise of AIG\u2019s New CEO ", "keywords": "aetna,aig, aig ceo,brian duperreault, catholic,chubb,cigna, faith,hank greenberg, insurance, insurance ceo, jesuit,American International Group,AIG,St. Joseph's University,Brian Duperreault,insurance,financial services", "news_time": "2017-07-21 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-fort-knox-clerk-to-insurance-kingpin-the-rise-of-aigs-new-ceo-1500629400", "content": "It would be hard to find anyone in insurance with a longer resume than             American International Group Inc.\u2019s        AIG -0.05%       new chief executive       Brian Duperreault.Mr. Duperreault started as an actuarial trainee at AIG in 1973, straight out of a postcollege stint in the U.S. Army. He rose through the company\u2019s ranks to become a senior executive, before leaving in 1994. Over the past 23 years, he has turned one niche offshore insurer into a large and diversified company, become CEO of a big industry brokerage and co-founded his own insurance firm.In returning to AIG, his plan is straightforward: Grow AIG.He thinks the company has shrunk enough after unloading a series of businesses to help repay a nearly $185 billion U.S. government bailout, and then selling more assets to finance share buybacks. Mr. Duperreault wants to expand in part through acquisitions as well as AIG\u2019s life and personal lines insurance businesses, particularly internationally.\u201cI [was] looking at my alma mater having issues,\u201d the 70-year-old said in his first extensive interview since taking the AIG job in May. \u201cMy head was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 because I had a great job. But my heart was telling me otherwise.\u201dOver the past few weeks, Mr. Duperreault has brought in executives from outside the company and plans to increase use of data science and predictive analytics, particularly as a way to expand sales to midsize businesses.Many of AIG\u2019s 56,400 employees are now meeting Mr. Duperreault for the first time through town halls in New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Dublin, so far. Among things they are learning: Their new boss has deep faith. A Roman Catholic who was educated by nuns in Trenton, N.J., he later attended the Jesuit-run St. Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia, Pa.\u201cFaith and family are the two things I wanted them to understand about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important element of running a company is doing the right thing, and faith gives one the courage to do that.\u201dMr. Duperreault said he speaks publicly of his religious side \u201cwhen I am being asked about who I am.\u201d He has publicly thanked God for his successes, and keeps a Bible in his office for \u201cwhen I feel that I have to read it.\u201dMr. Duperreault didn\u2019t initially aim for an insurance career. He went to St. Joe\u2019s to study chemistry, but \u201cI just wasn\u2019t any good at lab work.\u201d He majored in math, then after college he enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War and spent three years doing clerical work at Fort Knox, Ky.Upon discharge, job choices were limited with a stalled U.S. economy. Actuaries were in demand.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about actuarial science,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is, I needed a job.\u201dHe was hired at AIG, then a midsize property-casualty insurer, in the early stages of its transformation into one of the world\u2019s largest financial-services firms by its CEO, Maurice R. \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault\u2019s first assignment was to create divorce insurance that would guarantee income should a marriage fail. While that product wasn\u2019t launched, he eventually became a key lieutenant of the legendarily hard-charging Mr. Greenberg.Mr. Duperreault said he left AIG in 1994 to determine if he had \u201cthe wherewithal to stand alone and succeed\u201d without Mr. Greenberg.In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he is pleased to see Mr. Duperreault back at AIG, calling him \u201ca good choice.\u201d Mr. Greenberg left AIG in 2005 and now runs insurance and investment firm Starr Cos.Mr. Duperreault replaced       Peter Hancock,        who lost his hold on the CEO job earlier this year after delaying profit-improvement deadlines. Mr. Hancock had been narrowing AIG\u2019s focus through divestitures.\u201cI think Brian is wise in getting rid of that liquidation strategy,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, referring to Mr. Hancock\u2019s divestitures. Turning around AIG \u201cwill take time, and you have to have a strategy to differentiate AIG from other companies. He\u2019s had a lot of training, been in the industry a long time. But time will tell.\u201dMr. Duperreault\u2019s first job outside of AIG was as CEO of             ACE Ltd.      , which back then was a liability-insurance specialist. The job returned him to his birthplace: Bermuda, where he was born to American parents. Over the next decade, he diversified and expanded ACE through acquisitions. In 2004, he stepped down as CEO and became nonexecutive chairman.In 2008, he became CEO of then-struggling brokerage and consulting firm             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. He cut costs, strengthened management and acquired smaller firms to bolster growth. He left in 2012.The following year, while on a dinner cruise in Hamilton, Bermuda, he mentioned still having \u201cgas in the tank\u201d to insurance executive David Brown. Mr. Brown knew that hedge fund Two Sigma Investments, a leader in quantitative analysis, was looking to get into insurance, and he put Mr. Duperreault in contact with them.That led to Mr. Duperreault co-founding Hamilton Insurance Group in 2013 with Two Sigma\u2019s principals. As part of Mr. Duperreault\u2019s new job, a Two Sigma affiliate aims to work with AIG on an insurance platform.AIG today is far different than the one Mr. Duperreault left in 1994. Gone to repay its bailout are Asian life-insurance operations, aircraft leasing and other crown jewels. Also gone are some former rivals such as             Aetna Inc.       and             Cigna Corp.      , which divested property-casualty units. New competition has emerged, including             Chubb Ltd.       That insurer is the former ACE and is run by Hank Greenberg\u2019s son Evan, who succeeded Mr. Duperreault at ACE.\u201cYou need to have great rivalries to make you better,\u201d Mr. Duperreault said. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually a wonderful thing, in a way, that they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re so good because it\u2019s going to make us better.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com"}]
