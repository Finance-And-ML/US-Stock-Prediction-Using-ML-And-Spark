The scheme, launched on 3 July, is part of broader government reforms to open up China's onshore bond market, the third largest in the world after the US and Japan. Since February 2016 foreign institutional investors approved by the regulator have had access to CIBM through the CIBM Direct scheme which imposes no quota limitations or restrictions on repatriation, unlike previous schemes. Foreign participation in China's bond market has risen in response to this liberalisation, but remains low by regional standards. Foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds had increased to 3.9% by end-May 2017, up from 3% a year earlier, while external holdings of policy financial bonds had risen to 2.3% from 1.7%. Foreign participation in the total onshore market is even lower. In comparison, the share of government bonds held externally was 25.6% in Malaysia, 10.5% in Korea and 10.5% in Japan, according to the Asian Development Bank. The Bond Connect scheme should facilitate higher foreign ownership of onshore bonds over the medium term. Bond Connect's main advantage over CIBM Direct is that regulatory approval is not required to invest in fixed-income products in CIMB. Foreign institutional investors only need to set up a Bond Connect account with a participating Hong Kong bank. Investors will convert foreign currency to offshore yuan (CNH) to invest in onshore bonds. The scheme will also allow investors to use a familiar online platform to trade in the CIBM. Improved foreign access to the onshore bond market may encourage wider inclusion of Chinese bonds in major indices, which could further boost foreign investment. Bond Connect should also bolster growth of fixed-income professionals capable of selling Chinese securities to foreign investors, which will be important in expanding foreign participation. However, the government is likely to continue to tread carefully over broader capital account liberalisation, given the potential risks that net outflows could pose to financial stability. Accordingly, Bond Connect does not yet allow Chinese investors to buy overseas bonds - it is north-bound only - which is in keeping with our view that the authorities will remain cautious towards removing outflow restrictions, while loosening those on inflows only gradually. Bond Connect also limits foreign investors' ability to engage in onshore currency arbitrage, restricting access to onshore rates and FX derivatives. Bond Connect investors can instead hedge Chinese treasury rates through the Hong Kong Exchange and offshore FX rates via the OTC market. However, trading costs associated with offshore instruments can be high, and will be influenced by investors' views on CNH. Portfolio liquidity management will be important to Bond Connect investors as repurchase agreements cannot yet be conducted through the scheme. As such, we expect funds to be invested primarily in liquid instruments, such as government bonds, policy bank bonds and negotiable certificates of deposit. Bond Connect investors will have access to state-owned unlisted 'enterprise bonds' traded on the CIBM, but not to corporate bonds issued in the exchange markets. Hong Kong banks participating in Bond Connect are likely to generate additional fee and FX income, but could also face increased operational risks and costs, owing to compliance, reporting and trade-settlement obligations. Larger banks could purchase and sell bonds via Bond Connect as part of their balance-sheet management, but we do not expect this to result in a significant increase in system-wide mainland China exposure.

Although passive smoking kills thousands of Japanese each year, the Health Ministry's watered-down proposal - which would have allowed indoor smoking in smaller establishments with adequate ventilation - could not make it to a vote in parliament this spring.

The SDF's media office said four of its fighters were killed in fighting in the Old City. The coalition said on Monday the SDF fighters had breached the Old City after the coalition targeted two 25-meter sections of the 2,500-meter wall. Slideshow (2 Images)SDF fighters had seized an ancient palace, Qasr al-Banat, in the eastern part of the Old City, the SDF said in a statement. An official in the SDF media office said Islamic State had heavily mined the old quarters of Raqqa with devices set off by motion sensor. Islamic State fighters were doing most of their fighting at night and not moving much in the daytime. The coalition said Islamic State fighters were using the wall as a firing position and had planted  mines and improvised explosive devices at several of the breaks in the wall , forcing it to open the new breaches in the wall.  SDF fighters would have been channeled through these locations and were extremely vulnerable as they were targeted with vehicle-borne IEDs (car bombs) and indirect fire as well as direct fire from heavy machineguns, rocket-propelled grenades and snipers as they tried to breach the Old City,  it said. The SDF launched its assault to capture Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria, last month after gradually closing in on the city.

Danny Duffy, making his first start in more than a month, pitched 5 2/3 effective innings as the Royals defeated the Seattle Mariners 7-3 Tuesday afternoon at Safeco Field. Duffy (5-4), who had been sidelined since May 29 with a strained right oblique, allowed two runs on five hits. The left-hander struck out four and walked two.  Duff is such a huge part of what we do in the clubhouse and on the field, it gives us another boost of confidence,  Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said.  I mean, he's our No. 1 guy. It's a lift for the entire team.  Added second baseman Whit Merrifield:  He's one of the elite pitchers in the American League. To have him back in the rotation is big for us.  Merrifield and Moustakas hit home runs for Kansas City (43-40), which won its third game in a row and remained tied with the Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Rays for the American League's second wild-card berth. Felix Hernandez (3-3) took the loss for the Mariners (41-44), who absorbed their sixth consecutive home defeat. Hernandez went six innings, allowing six runs (five earned) on six hits, including the two home runs. He walked four and struck out five.  The Royals have got some momentum going, are playing some good ball ... and we're not,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  I thought we'd put a little more pressure on Duffy, his first game back. We got a couple of runs early, but he settled in.  Related CoveragePreview: Royals at MarinersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchThe fireworks started early, as both teams scored in the first inning. Merrifield led off the game by hitting Hernandez's first pitch into the Seattle bullpen in left-center field, his seventh homer of the season.  As a leadoff hitter, every once in a while you've got to swing at the first pitch just to keep it in the scouting report,  Merrifield said.  I've done it two or three times this year with no success. It was good to put a barrel on it and watch it go out.  The Mariners responded in the bottom of the inning as Jean Segura and Danny Valencia singled, then advanced to second and third on Robinson Cano's groundout. Designated hitter Nelson Cruz, making his first start since Saturday in Anaheim, when he injured his right knee sliding into second base against the Los Angeles Angels, lined a two-run single off the wall in right-center field to make it 2-1.  It was probably not the pitch to throw to Cruz right there,  Duffy said.  I just wasn't thinking, and he was probably sitting dead red. He's got some thump.  After the shaky first, Duffy allowed just two more hits.  I felt like I fell right back into place,  he said.  I knew if I could put up some zeros after (the first inning), we could win.  Said Royals manager Ned Yost:  He looked great, just like Danny. We were cautiously optimistic knowing how he looked in his rehab starts and simulated games.  The Royals regained the lead in the fourth, as Eric Hosmer led off with a single and Moustakas hit a one-out homer 401 feet midway up the lower deck in right field. The two-run shot, Moustakas' team-leading 24th of the season, also came on the first pitch of the at-bat against Hernandez.  Against a guy like that, you've got to have a good plan,  Moustakas said.  He's been one of the best pitchers in the game for a long time. I was just fortunate to put some good wood on it.  Moustakas homered for the second consecutive game in the series.  He's amazing to watch, to get on a streak like that, a homer streak,  Yost said.  You've just got to ride that as long as you can. He's having a special year.  Brandon Moss followed with a double off the center field wall, moved to third on a groundout by Alcides Escobar and scored when second baseman Cano bobbled a grounder by Alex Gordon for an error. That gave the Royals a 4-2 lead. Kansas City added two more runs off Hernandez in the fifth. Following walks to Jorge Bonifacio and Hosmer, All-Star Salvador Perez lined a one-out double down the left field line, scoring both runners to make it 6-2. The Mariners put two runners in scoring position in both the sixth and seventh innings but came away with just one run. With runners at second and third in the sixth, Peter Moylan relieved Duffy and struck out pinch hitter Ben Gamel to end the inning. Seattle scored once in the seventh to pull within 6-3. With one out, Carlos Ruiz walked and pinch hitter Boog Powell hit a grounder to first base. Hosmer tried to get the force at second, but his throw hit Ruiz in the shoulder and ricocheted into left field, allowing the runners to advance to second and third. Segura grounded a run-scoring single to left field, with Powell held at third. Moylan got out of the jam by getting Valencia to ground into a double play. The Royals closed the scoring in the ninth, as Bonifacio hit a two-out triple off Yovani Gallardo and scored on a wild pitch. That was the only hit Gallardo allowed in three innings of relief. NOTES: Kansas City turned three inning-ending double plays. ... Seattle dropped to 3-31 this season when scoring three or fewer runs. ... Mariners SS Jean Segura went 4-for-5 and is batting .650 in his career (13-for-20) on July 4. ... The Royals sent RHP Miguel Almonte back to Triple-A Omaha to make room on the roster for Tuesday's starter, LHP Danny Duffy. Almonte had been recalled between games of a doubleheader Saturday against the Minnesota Twins, pitching a scoreless inning in the nightcap. ... The finale of the three-game series Wednesday will feature left-handers who lead their teams in wins. Royals All-Star Jason Vargas (12-3, 2.22 ERA) will oppose the Mariners' Ariel Miranda (7-4, 3.82).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED75LHBU2M"},

North Korea said it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead.  The rhetoric we heard from those guys (North Korea) is certainly a little bit more aggressive with the fact that they are looking to have a warhead that can reach the U.S,  said Chris Weston, an institutional dealer with IG Markets.  I think it is a step up in their aggressive rhetoric, and the market is keen to respond with a wave of risk aversion.

Real estate stocks also pressured the benchmark, with Westfield Corp sliding 2.2 percent and Scentre Group down 1.2 percent. The Australian central bank on Tuesday cautioned against record high household debt in the country's red-hot property market. Materials were one of the few bright spots on a day that saw most of the sectors slipping into the red. China's steel rebar futures on Tuesday rose to their highest in more than three years, before retreating at the close of trading, as worries over tighter supply fuelled bullish bets.

The Latvian, who shook up women's tennis when she won the title at Roland Garros last month, will wield her fearsome forehand against Canadian qualifier Francoise Abanda in the second round on Wednesday. Ostapenko already equaled her best showing at the All England Club with a see-saw 6-0 1-6 6-3 first round win over Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich and is now looking to further refine her brutal game. In Paris, she hit almost as many unforced errors (271) as cleanly hit winners (299) over the course of seven matches. Those on the receiving end of those destructive groundstrokes might find it implausible, but Ostapenko says she will be taking the aggression levels up a notch as she looks to make further inroads on Wimbledon's slick turf.    Just maybe to stay more aggressive and serve and return better, because it's very important on grass,  she said when asked what she needs to do to adapt her game from clay. Abanda, ranked 142 in the world, booked her spot in the second round with a straight sets win over Kurumi Nara.

The arrival of sport's oldest trophy came two days after New Zealand's government promised NZ$5 million in funding to keep the team together in order to prepare for the title defense, likely to be in 2021. A parade through central Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city, is planned for Thursday. A similar parade in 1995, when the country won the America's Cup for the first time, drew an estimated 350,000 people. The victory is expected to provide a boost to New Zealand, with early estimates putting the contribution at NZ$1 billion in economic growth.  Thank you for all the support, it means the world to us and being a proud Kiwi, growing up here and watching teams race for the America's Cup and then to actually bring the Cup home is something that has blown us away,  helmsman Peter Burling told the crowd at the airport. The plane carrying the team and the trophy, which occupied two seats in first class, was drenched by fire rescue trucks as it taxied onto the runway apron. The local Maori tribe Ngati Whatua also performed an official welcome for the team. Skipper Glenn Ashby said the victory had buried some ghosts from 2013 when Team New Zealand held an 8-1 lead over Oracle, only for Jimmy Spithill to engineer one of the greatest comebacks in sport to win the next eight races and retain the trophy.  It's largely redemption, for the whole team and the country, from San Francisco,  said Ashby, the only remaining member of the 2013 sailing team on the boat in Bermuda.  The group of guys we went through this journey with are an absolutely special set of people and to have them all standing here with me now is a wonderful feeling. I'm very, very proud.

The Nikkei share average was down 0.7 percent at 19,899.69 after plumbing 19,888.90, its lowest since June 16. Bereft of Wall Street leads as U.S. markets were closed on Tuesday for a national holiday, the Nikkei stuck to a relatively narrow range.  U.S. Secretary of State (Rex) Tillerson mentioning North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) early this morning has caused the market to remain cautious,  said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist t Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.  At the same time, the domestic market is retaining a fair degree of calm regarding the situation, while waiting to see how the United States responds to North Korea's actions.  Tillerson called for global action after North Korea tested a newly developed ICBM, calling it a new escalation of Pyongyang's nuclear threat. Defence industry-related firms slipped after surging the previous day in response to Pyongyang's ICBM launch. Ishikawa Seisakusho Ltd, a maker of defence equipment including landmines, fell 4.4 percent after rallying roughly 20 percent the previous day. Howa Machinery, a manufacturer that supplies firearms and mortars to Japan's military, was down 1.4 percent after rising 2.9 percent on Tuesday. Defence system equipment maker Nippon Avionics Co shed 3.2 percent following the previous day's rise of 5.6 percent. Automakers extended gains from Tuesday, when they rose on data pointing to stronger-than-expected June U.S. vehicle sales. Subaru Corp rose 2.1 percent and Nissan Motor Co edged up 0.8 percent. Toyota Motor Corp was up 1 percent after it announced late on Tuesday that its June China vehicle sales rose 10 percent from a year earlier, compared to an increase of 9.6 percent in May. Oncolys Biopharma Inc rose as much as 8.4 percent after the biopharmaceutical developer announced that OBP-1101 (TelomeScan F35), a tumour cell detection adenovirus agent the company is developing, received a U.S. patent grant.

The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' VFACTS report out on Wednesday showed 134,171 new vehicles were sold in June, up 4.4 percent on the same month last year. Both months had the same number of selling days. June is typically a strong month as dealers clear stock for the end of the financial year. Sales of sports utilities alone surged 11.7 percent in June, with the upper large segment rising almost 21 percent. Sales of light commercial vehicles climbed 12.2 percent while the heavy vehicle market gained 9.2 percent. The willingness to splash out on big-ticket items follows upbeat reports on retail sales for both April and May and points to a likely rebound in consumption for the second quarter after a muted start to the year. Toyota Motor Corp retained first place on the sales ladder with 18.3 percent of the market, while Mazda Motor Corp had another strong month taking 9.3 percent.

The world's largest memory chip maker is the among the biggest beneficiaries of soaring demand for processing firepower on smartphones and servers, which has fueled an industry super-cycle amid limited supply growth. Underscoring its dominant position, Samsung said on Tuesday it plans to invest some $18.6 billion in South Korea as it seeks to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays for smartphones. The South Korean tech giant, Asia's third-largest company by market capitalization, is now poised to knock Intel off the top of the global semiconductor market-share rankings for the first time since 1991.   From the second quarter, Samsung will become No. 1 in market share due to the recent increase in data centers and demand for solid-state drives,  NH Investment & Securities analyst Peter Lee wrote in a note to clients.   Samsung's April-June operating profit is expected to leap 67 percent from a year earlier to 13.1 trillion won ($11.4 billion), a new high, according to the average forecast from a Thomson Reuters survey of 18 analysts.  The same survey expects July-September profit to be even higher at 13.8 trillion won.  Solid sales of the Galaxy S8 smartphone launched in April likely provided an additional boost, keeping the firm ahead of rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the world's top smartphone maker. The S8's performance has reassured investors whose nerves were shaken last year by the costly withdrawal of Samsung's premium Galaxy Note 7 due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung shares are trading at a near-record high of 2.35 million won each as of Tuesday. They have gained 30 percent so far this year on top of a 43 percent surge in 2016.  In the Pipeline  The Galaxy S8 series has been out for more than 2 months now and we see similar traction as the Galaxy S7 series,  Counterpoint analyst Tom Kang said.  Samsung would sell about 49 million S8s by the end of its first full-year release, in line with first-year sales of the Galaxy S7, he said.  Samsung is also preparing to unveil the Galaxy Note 8 in August, a source told Reuters, restoring the company's schedule of market-moving gadget releases after the interruption of the Note 7 debacle.  The company will issue earnings guidance early on Friday but will not disclose details on its performance until late July.   Nomura has predicted DRAM chip prices will continue to rise in the second half of 2017 due to limited supply and strong demand driven by servers. Demand for solid-state drives (SSD) and smartphones would maintain profits for producers of NAND semiconductors, despite an easing of a production bottleneck, it said.

Korea missile tests, Qatar crisis seen as security threats * But ample oil supplies keep lid on prices * OPEC supplies are climbing despite its pledge to cut output By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Oil markets were firm on Wednesday on worries over geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East, although prices were capped as supply remains ample despite an OPEC-led drive to rein in production. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $49.63 per barrel at 0155 GMT, virtually unchanged from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were also steady, at $47.06 per barrel. Both markets have recovered around 12 percent from recent lows on June 21. Traders said that firm prices came on the back of a sense of rising global security risk following North Korea's repeated missile tests and the political crisis between Qatar and an alliance of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  Rising geopolitical risks should provide some support to gold and oil prices,  ANZ bank said on Wednesday. Despite this, crude prices seem locked below $50 per barrel. Traders said that is because of ample supplies despite a pledge led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold back production between January this year and March 2018 to prop up prices. Despite that move, OPEC's oil exports rose for the second month in a row in June, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research. OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, 450,000 bpd above May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier.  The market remains sensitive to reports of higher supply,  ANZ said.

The findings reinforced analyst views that the world's second-largest economy is cooling after a strong start to the year, as Beijing cracks down on easy credit to contain a dangerous build-up in debt and defuse financial risks. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 51.6 in June from 52.8 in May, when a surprise rebound broke four straight months of declines. The June figure marks the second-lowest business activity level for service providers in over a year. Subdued demand was behind the latest slowdown, as the new business sub-index weakened to 51.9 in June from May's 53.5, hitting its lowest since May 2016.  Analysts remain convinced that as deleveraging efforts persist, China's economy will take a hit. They expect quarterly economic growth to have slowed in the second quarter from 6.9 percent in January-March. The government has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for this year.  Even though the impact of slowing expansion in China's services sector was cushioned by a slight rebound in manufacturing activity, the downward trend in the economy remains entrenched,  said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group in an accompanying note to the data.      Profit margins also appeared to be under pressure, with services companies only able to pass on a marginal portion of their input costs to consumers, although the rate at which costs are rising slowed in June. As a result, the rate of job creation in the services sector  fell further in June to its slowest in 10 months. China is counting on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to lessen the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment. The sector accounts for more than half of China's gross domestic product. The Caixin findings contrast with an official survey last week which pointed to accelerated growth and stronger demand in services, supported by robust expansion in financial services and construction sectors. The divergence suggests the environment facing large parts of China's service providers who dominate sectors such as catering and accommodation are less rosy, as they have entered the most challenging funding environment in years.  A similar Caixin survey on Monday showed the manufacturing sector unexpectedly expanded in June as new orders and production rose in a sign of a modest recovery. It suggested much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, benefiting mainly large state-owned firms. Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, fell to 51.1 in June from 51.5 in May, signaling the lowest overall growth momentum since June 2016.

A Peruvian judge in February had ordered Toledo to be jailed for 18 months while prosecutors prepare corruption charges against him. But the United States declined to detain him immediately when Peruvian authorities said he was in California, prompting the South American nation to refile its request.  In a bid to bolster its case against Toledo, who has denied wrongdoing, the attorney general's office asked a court in April to issue a second arrest warrant for Toledo in connection with a separate money laundering probe, said prosecutor Rafael Vela. But Judge Abel Concha has not yet signed off on the new arrest warrant, said Vela, who heads the attorney general's money laundering unit.  We don't know what the legal justification is for not doing so,  Vela told a news conference with other prosecutors and the attorney general.  I'm making this public because it's something that has really surprised us.  A spokeswoman in Concha's office said the judge is waiting for clarity on whether the two criminal probes into Toledo will become a single, broader investigation. It was unclear how long that might take. The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment and previously declined to say why it has declined to arrest Toledo. Toledo has said he is a victim of political persecution and has accused Peru's justice system of denying him due process by seeking his arrest before he is tried. Prosecutors have accused Toledo of asking for $20 million in bribes from Brazilian builder Odebrecht, citing the testimony of a company executive who turned state witness and bank records that allegedly show millions of dollars were transferred to an associate of Toledo's. Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001-2006, rose to power denouncing graft in the government of his predecessor, now-imprisoned ex-President Alberto Fujimori. Odebrecht, which late last year acknowledged distributing millions of dollars in bribes across Latin America, has spurred investigations into public officials from Argentina to Panama.

Despite running into a high pitch count, Taillon battled every batter the Phillies sent to the plate, striking out a career-high nine in five scoreless innings and improving to 5-2 with a team-best 2.73 ERA. He extended his scoreless streak to 11 1/3 innings in his fifth start since recovering from surgery to treat testicular cancer.  Very gritty,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Taillon's performance.  It's rare where he's under 50 percent first-pitch strikes. It's also been rare that he gets nine punchouts, so his stuff was playing. The curveball got better as the game went on and the two-seam fastball location, execution, and I think he worked with a tight strike zone. ...  He had to power through five innings and (102) pitches and kept them off the plate, to his credit, which he's showing an uncanny ability to do for a guy in his second year in major league starting pitching.  Pirates left-hander Felipe Rivero notched his fourth save of the season, allowing the tying run to reach the plate in the ninth inning but finally getting Freddy Galvis to strike out looking to end the game. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at PhilliesPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchPittsburgh rebounded after being blanked Monday night for the first time since May 30. The Pirates opened the scoring in the third with a sacrifice fly by John Jaso. Pittsburgh loaded the bases with one out after Phillies starter Mark Leiter Jr. walked Adam Frazier, hit Josh Harrison and gave up a line-drive single to McCutchen. Jaso popped out to center, scoring Frazier, but Harrison was caught trying to reach third to end the inning. McCutchen, the reigning National League Player of the Month whose name keeps popping up in trade rumors, continues to swing a hot bat. He sent a pair of solo home runs over the left field fence in the sixth and the eighth for his 14th career multi-homer game. He has 16 homers on the year. After overcoming his early-season struggles, McCutcheon is in a groove.  I love it, I think about it all day,  McCutchen said.  You go through these stretches, but for me, I'm just trying to remain consistent with where I'm at. ... I'm cool. I'm good with it. I think about it all night, why not?  Leiter, making his first career start at Citizens Bank Park, fell to 1-1 this season but lowered his ERA to 4.08. He worked 5 1/3 innings, allowing two runs, striking out five and giving up four hits and two walks. He was lifted in the sixth in favor of Luis Garcia after serving up the first solo home run to McCutchen and plunking David Freese, his second hit batter of the game.  Leiter pitched well enough to win,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He knows how to pitch. I like him a lot.  The Phillies stranded three runners on third base in the first four innings, constantly threatening but not capitalizing on their opportunities in leaving 11 on base.  From my perspective, you've got to be ready to hit early in the count so you don't get to two strikes,  Mackanin said.  You get a pitch early in the count you can put in play, you're going to drive in runs. You don't want to get behind when the pitcher can expand the strike zone on you. Plus, in my opinion, we take too many good pitches to hit, especially with two strikes and men in scoring position.  Philadelphia threatened a comeback in the seventh, loading the bases with one out for Aaron Altherr. Pirates reliever Juan Nicasio entered and got Altherr to ground into an inning-ending double play. The game entered a rain delay as a quick, heavy burst swept through in the bottom of the eighth inning. Play resumed 22 minutes later. NOTES: Pirates OF Andrew McCutchen earned his NL monthly honor after hitting .411 with six home runs and 23 RBIs in June. ... Phillies RHP Pat Neshek was selected to the NL team for the All-Star Game. Thirty-three of his 35 appearances this season have been scoreless. ... This is the first time the Pirates played on July 4 in Philadelphia since the teams played a doubleheader in 1963. ... The rubber match is set for Wednesday night. Pirates RHP Gerrit Cole (6-7, 4.51 ERA) will take the mound against Phillies rookie RHP Ben Lively (1-3, 3.72 ERA).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-pirates-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED75LCNGZI"},

Beachgoing, baseball and fireworks, Fourth of July traditions, were embraced throughout the country, along with family cookouts that favored hot dogs and hamburgers. An informal peace-and-love festival in an Oregon forest drew more than 13,000 people, including two men who died of apparently natural causes.The United States commemorated the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the 13 American colonies on July 4, 1776. The document proclaims unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In Philadelphia, where the Declaration was adopted, there was a ceremonial tapping of the Liberty Bell at Independence Hall. In many cities, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, crowds gathered under now-usual security precautions for concerts and fireworks displays. New York's display, billed as the largest, was set to go off over the East River where it could be seen from the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.  New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the holiday. A deal between Governor Chris Christie and legislative leaders allowed New Jersey to reopen parks and beaches, including Island Beach State Park, where the Star-Ledger newspaper on Sunday captured photos of Christie with family and friends. Related CoverageFactbox: Trump on Twitter (July 4) - Gas prices, 4th of JulyThe beach had been otherwise deserted because of the shutdown, prompting a barrage of internet satires placing Christie in his beach chair at famous beach scenes from D-Day to the movie  Planet of the Apes.

A 72-year-old man died on Monday and a 20-year-old man collapsed and died on Tuesday, forest spokeswoman Traci Weaver said. A doctor administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the 20-year-old for 15 to 20 minutes but could not revive him, Weaver said. There were 15 arrests, mostly for driving under the influence, drugs or disorderly conduct, in addition to 108 violations and 432 warnings. Visitors were both rowdy and respectful, Weaver said, and the large crowd inevitably degraded the forest with trash, waste and trampling.  We're concerned about redband trout that are spawning in the creeks nearby,  Weaver said.  Our big concern is what the long-term impact will be.

Authorities in the city-state said last month they had detained the first Singaporean for suspected Islamist radicalism as concern grows about the spread of the Islamic State group in Southeast Asia. The government has reiterated over the past year that the small, wealthy island nation is a target for Islamist groups and has urged the public to be alert. Minister Desmond Lee told parliament on Tuesday the two maids, aged 25 and 28, did not have plans to carry out any violence in Singapore and were not known to have influenced their friends in the country.  Similar to the earlier cases, both of them were ISIS supporters, radicalized through social media,  Lee said after  lawmakers asked for an update on the threat posed by radicalized foreigners in Singapore. Singapore said late last year it had deported nearly 70 foreigners, including five maids, for suspected radicalism over the previous two years. Authorities in neighboring Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, said last year they had arrested six Indonesian suspects with links to Islamic State who were plotting an attack on Singapore. Worries over the rise of Islamic State were heightened by the capture of Marawi City in the southern Philippines island of Mindanao by Islamist militants in May. Security forces are still trying to recapture the town, seized by a local militant group that had drawn foreign fighters to its ranks.

There have been a few false alarms since the Indonesian government banned all exports of unprocessed minerals, including nickel, at the start of 2014. China's trade figures have shown the occasional import of what has been classified as nickel ore but which was in all probability iron ore with high nickel content. But May's 264,000 tonnes seem the real deal. Not only was it the largest monthly total in three years but it tallies with plans by Indonesia's Aneka Tambang (Antam) to make its first 150,000-tonne shipment at the start of the month. It's still a fraction of what Indonesia used to send every month to China before 2014. The export ban remains in place but with a growing number of exemptions for companies that have committed to building processing plants. For the Chinese nickel pig iron (NPI) producers that depend on such ore, it marks a dramatic turnaround from what looked like an existential crisis when Indonesia first cut off their supply. Famine, however, has now turned to feast. Indonesian ore will add to a growing number of nickel raw materials flows into China. And that spells trouble for the rest of the world's producers. Full breakdown of China's nickel trade in May: Doubling Up in Indonesia Indonesia is not going to be supplying the same volumes of nickel ore to China as it did in 2012 or 2013, when imports reached 34 million and 41 million tonnes respectively. The government is granting only a limited number of exemptions with limited tonnage quotas. Antam, for example, has around five million tonnes of low-grade ore available for immediate shipment but so far has got approval to export only 2.7 million tonnes over the 12 months to March 2018. But it is pushing for more. And others are joining the list of approved exporters. The latest is PT Ceria Nugraha, which has received government permission to export 2.3 million tonnes through July 2018. The quid pro quo for getting the official nod to export is construction of value-add processing plants within the country. This was the whole point of the export ban and to some extent it has been achieved with the number of plants constructed now in excess of 20. Many of them, not entirely surprisingly, have been built by Chinese companies looking to off-shore NPI production. There has been a steadily increasing flow of Indonesian intermediate material into China since the start of 2015. May's imports of 158,130 tonnes were a fresh all-time high. China's customs department classifies this stuff as  ferronickel  but it's not. The give-away is the price, an average $1,362 per tonne in May, compared with over $3,000 per tonne for imports from conventional ferronickel suppliers such as Colombia and Brazil. Philippines Down but Far from Out While China doubles up on Indonesian supply, it can now also feast on the alternative ore sources that arose after the 2014 export ban. The Philippines emerged as the main source of replacement supply for Indonesian ore. It was another part of China's supply chain that seemed in imminent danger of collapse until a few weeks ago. However, Regina Lopez, the Philippine firebrand environment secretary who wanted to close just about all the country's nickel mines, has now gone. Her replacement, Roy Cimatu, has taken a much more conciliatory approach and many of the targeted mines have continued operating anyway after filing appeals against Lopez' closure orders. China's imports of Philippine ore looked to have fallen off a cliff in the first quarter of this year, plummeting by 20 percent to 2.3 million tonnes. But they recovered strongly over the course of April and May with the cumulative year-to-date tally of 6.7 million tonnes down by a modest 7 percent on last year's equivalent figure. A particularly severe monsoon season and normal mine depletion have had a more significant impact than Ms Lopez. Nor has the Philippines been the only country to have benefited from Indonesia's shipping absence. New Caledonia has redirected its ore shipments from the bankrupt and now shuttered Queensland Nickel refinery in Australia to China. Chinese imports of New Caledonian material have more than tripled so far this year to 346,000 tonnes. Other new ore suppliers now regularly appearing in China's trade figures include Guatemala and Turkey with imports this year of 147,200 tonnes and 91,700 tonnes respectively. Refined Nickel Imports Slide China's massive NPI sector has survived two potentially killer supply blows in the form of the original Indonesian ban and last year's threat of widespread mine closures in the Philippines. It has emerged with a more geographically diverse nickel raw materials supply chain than ever before. Rumours of its imminent demise, which have been plentiful in recent years, appear to have been seriously exaggerated. But the flip side of its survival is a steady slide in China's appetite for nickel in refined metal form. Imports slumped by 57 percent to 83,400 tonnes in the January-May period from 195,000 tonnes in the same period of 2016. Exports, meanwhile, jumped by 45 percent to 7,400 tonnes. All of which is bad news for everyone else. There are 446,000 tonnes of refined nickel sitting in London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses. There is almost certainly a lot more hiding in the off-exchange statistical shadows. Lacking a bull narrative since the political demise of Ms Lopez in the Philippines, the London price is looking bombed out again just above $9,000 per tonne. Which means it's back to the cost-curve drawing board. Brazil's Vale confirmed on Tuesday it is reassessing its loss-making New Caledonian operations. It won't be the only nickel producer to be running the numbers again. Editing by Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-nickel-ahome-idUSL8N1JV3O2"},

The talks over a  basic set of patterns and parameters  to negotiate fines are at a very early stage, two of the people said. Federal prosecutors who serve on a body that validates leniency deals are leading the talks, the people added. A framework could speed up approval of the accords which allow companies to avoid a ban on doing business with Brazil's  government and usually follow a plea deal admitting guilt. A key condition is the rules should not curb prosecutor's independence to negotiate the best possible deal, the people added. With more potential plea bargains under negotiation in Brazil's biggest corruption probe,  Operation Car Wash,  the public has grown concerned that a lack of clear rules could jeopardize equal justice for all. The billionaire Batista family's 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency deal sparked anger in Brazil over what many saw as lax penalties and a lack of transparency. Many Brazilians questioned Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot's plea deal by which he decided not to jail brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista - who admitted to bribing nearly 2,000 politicians.  The implementation of a pre-defined framework to enter leniency negotiations would help enhance transparency,  said one of the people.  It could also help validate prior accords, which could be used as a benchmark.          A unit of the public prosecutor's office is expected to discuss the Batista leniency deals within the next two weeks, before the deal is analyzed at a district court in the capital Brasilia, one of the people said.     Janot's office declined to comment, as did Brazil's federal public prosecutor, which approves the fines. A public relations firm representing the Batistas and their holding company J&F; Investimentos SA declined to comment. Related CoverageFactbox: Brazil's J&F, Odebrecht plea and leniency dealsThough prosecutors said their fine for the Batistas and J&F; were a world record, lawyers questioned why that accord's terms differed so much from other leniency deals. Prosecutors gave the family 25 years to pay the fine and pegged it to Brazil's consumer price index, sharply reducing the penalty's net present value. According to Thomson Reuters calculations, the fine's net present value  is 5.45 billion reais - about 47 percent less than in nominal terms.  By contrast, a 3.9 billion-real fine that engineering group Odebrecht SA agreed to pay over 22 years will be adjusted by the benchmark overnight Selic interest rate, currently running well above annual inflation. A state attorney is investigating whether the Batista-J&F; leniency fine harmed taxpayers' interests. Other prosecutors investigating the family's dealings with state banks have complained that the leniency fine is too low, one of the people said.   The logo of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA is seen in the city of Jundiai, Brazil June 1, 2017.  Picture taken June 1, 2017.Paulo Whitaker The reputation and credibility of future leniency deals greatly hinge on implementing clear rules guiding prosecutors through a fair negotiation,  said Modesto Carvalhosa, a São Paulo-based lawyer who specializes in corruption issues. President Temer The Batista brothers built JBS from a small slaughterhouse in Brazil's midwestern plains into the world's No. 1 meatpacker in over a decade, helped by political connections allowing them to access cheap state loans for acquisitions. Between 2008 and 2015, JBS participated in about 74 mergers and acquisitions totaling $30 billion, Thomson Reuters deals intelligence data showed. Simultaneously, J&F; diversified into fashion brands and footwear, dairy production, pulp processing and banking. Janot has defended his plea deal with J&F; and lauded the strength of the evidence the Batistas brought - including documents, tapes and photographs. One of the people, who worked on prior leniency deals, said financial penalties are based on qualitative criteria such as the volume, depth and timeliness of evidence. The brothers' decision to provide evidence ahead of any attempt to prosecute them counted, the people said.  The Odebrecht deal was markedly different. Family scion Marcelo Odebrecht had been jailed for a year when he agreed to cooperate - after a police operation uncovered an entire department dedicated to bribery within his firm. In his testimony, Joesley Batista accused President Michel Temer of working to obstruct a corruption probe, and handed over recordings backing that allegation. Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   Bringing evidence against a sitting president is a big thing, a powerful incentive to cut a beneficial deal,  one of the people said. However, the lack of pre-defined rules to calculate a fine might have given the brothers an  unwanted upper hand during leniency talks,  the person said.  J&F; and the Batistas are involved in five different investigations. The accusations against Temer have put at jeopardy the passage of much-needed legislation to revamp Brazil's outdated pension, labor and tax codes.

The rookie himself.  I made really good contact,  Barreto said after his moon shot barely cleared the wall for a walk-off home run that lifted the Athletics to a 7-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox. All-Star Yonder Alonso hit two homers and Matt Joyce added a two-run shot for the A's, who won on the Fourth of July for the sixth consecutive year. Oakland snapped a six-game losing streak, its longest of the season.  That was cool,  A's starting pitcher Daniel Gossett said of Barreto's second career homer.  It's always in the back of your mind that it can happen. Then to see it happen like that, it's awesome.  The White Sox rallied to tie the game at 6-6 on Melky Cabrera's two-out, two-strike single to left field in the top of the ninth, scoring Tim Anderson from second base. A's closer Santiago Casilla blew the save. However, one out into the bottom of the inning, the 21-year-old Barreto, playing in only his 10th game since a promotion from Triple-A on June 24, hit his fly ball that seemed to peek over infamous Mount Davis at the Oakland Coliseum before disappearing behind a leaping Cabrera. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at AthleticsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch I didn't know,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of his initial thoughts after seeing the ball leave Barreto's bat.  I was watching him. He seemed to like it.  The homer came off Chicago's fifth pitcher, Tommy Kahnle, on a full count.  It's been my dream to help the team win,  Barreto said.  It finally happened today.  Casilla (2-3) was credited with the win after blowing his fourth save of the season. Kahnle (0-3) took the loss.  He put together a pretty good at-bat, fighting off pitches, fouling them off,  Kahnle said of the eight-pitch duel.  I thought I'd get him on the 2-2 changeup. He gave that check-swing. But the next pitch ... he hit it. I mean, good for him.  The game featured three lead changes, all the result of home runs. After Cabrera and Joyce traded two-run shots in the third inning, Alonso's first homer leading off the fourth gave the A's their first lead at 3-2. Oakland added a second run in the inning on a triple by Barreto, but Jose Abreu countered with a three-run blast for the White Sox in the fifth, putting Chicago back on top 5-4. The homer was Abreu's 16th of the season, 14 of which have come on the road. Alonso put Oakland back on top with his second homer in the bottom of the fifth. It also scored Khris Davis, who had singled with two outs.  It's exciting to see the young guys succeed,  said Alonso, who said he had given Barreto some advice after the rookie struck out in the third inning.  I'm not taking none of the credit. I saw something, and then he went out and did it. He's just a special kid.  There was no further scoring until Cabrera's game-extending hit in the ninth. Neither starter got a decision. Gossett left with a lead despite allowing five runs in five innings for the second consecutive start. He gave up nine hits and no walks while striking out three. The first three Oakland home runs came off Chicago starter James Shields, who surrendered three or more homers in a game for the 22nd time in his career. He allowed six runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings, walking two and striking out four. Cabrera, Adam Engel, Matt Davidson and Omar Narvaez had two hits apiece for the White Sox, who had won eight of their previous nine games in Oakland.  All in all, I thought we battled our rear ends off today,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  It was nothing they should be ashamed of.  The White Sox outhit the A's 13-8.

Federal spending on infrastructure works and other projects this year sponsored by congressmen for their constituencies jumped to 1.49 billion reais ($451 million) in June, up from 959 million reais the month before, the data showed. The increase in spending comes at a time when Temer is facing charges with taking bribes in connection with a graft scheme involving the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA . Company executives said in plea-bargain testimony that the president took bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters. Temer also allegedly arranged to receive a total of 38 million reais from JBS in the next nine months. The president has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Brazil is grappling with record-high budget deficits and the recent splurge illustrates Temer's efforts to keep his fragmented coalition united despite growing calls for his resignation more than one year before general elections. Temer's office declined to comment on the increase in spending in the past month. Under Brazilian law, it is now up to the lower house of Congress to decide if the president will be tried by the Supreme Court. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote to approve the charge for that to happen. Spending Flurry Brazilian legislators can earmark the federal budget for local works, but the federal government must authorize that spending. Brazil's budget deficit before interest payments soared to 30.736 billion reais ($9.30 billion) in May, the largest-ever for the month. The gap in the 12 months through May reached 157.7 billion reais, above the official target for a deficit of 143.1 billion reais for this year. Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot last week said he would likely level new charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks. Each charge would require lawmakers to vote on whether or not to defend the deeply unpopular president from being tried. Lawmakers within Temer's coalition are confident they have the votes to block the two-third majority required to proceed with a trial. But they also acknowledge that if forced to vote on repeated charges against the president, support for the leader could unravel as lawmakers worry about their own reelection next year. $1 = 3.3035 reais Reporting by Ricardo Brito in Brasilia; Writing by Silvio Cascione; Editing by Brad Brooks and Diane Craft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-politics-idUSL1N1JV0GR"},

The dollar shed 0.3 percent in early trade to fetch 112.95 yen, slipping further from Monday's 1-1/2-month high of 113.48. The yen tends to be bought back at times of heightened global uncertainty because of expectations Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign investment, despite the country's proximity to North Korea. Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead, triggering a call by Washington for global action to hold the isolated nation accountable for its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon condemned the missile test and said it was prepared to defend the United States and its allies against the growing threat from North Korea. The Canadian dollar also held firm, trading at C$1.2934 per dollar after having hit a 10-month high of C$1.2912 to the dollar on Tuesday. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told a German newspaper that Canada's inflation should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018, adding that policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target. His comments prompted markets to price in a more than 50 percent chance of a rate hike at the central bank's next meeting on July 12, a dramatic turn from less than two weeks ago when barely anyone had bet on a tightening. The euro was also supported by expectations the European Central Bank is edging towards winding back its stimulus following hawkish comments from its President Mario Draghi last week. Although the common currency slipped early this week after rallying 2.1 percent last week, it has stabilised around $1.1359 .

A clear break of the $1.15-16 area would signal a major departure from its trading range since early 2015. The Australian dollar licked wounds at $0.7612 after the nation's central bank stuck to a neutral stance on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday, disappointing many traders who had expected a more hawkish tone.

We were on the same page, and that was the first time he caught me. That is pretty impressive. He blocks everything, he is tough as nails back there.

Vocus had received an indicative, non-binding proposal from KKR for A$3.50 per share in cash on June 7. The stock has taken a hit since May after the firm slashed annual profit guidance. Vocus shares have lost about 4.9 percent since the launch of KKR's offer. They closed on Tuesday at A$3.31 a share.  We believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to grant KKR due diligence to explore whether a potential whole of company proposal is available that takes into account the benefits that the plan delivers,   Vocus Chairman David Spence said in a statement. Vocus said in Wednesday's statement that its shareholders do not need to take any action at this time.  The Vocus Board notes that there is no certainty that granting due diligence based on the Indicative Proposal will result in an acceptable offer for Vocus, nor what the terms of any such offer would be, or whether there would be a recommendation by the Vocus Board,  the company said. While Telstra Corp Ltd dominates Australia's telecommunications and internet markets, smaller rivals such as Vocus are jostling for exposure to a government-led A$40 billion ($30.44 billion) broadband network that is being built around the country.

Ahmedabad, in the western state of Gujarat, has among the worst air pollution in the country. But it is the first to install an air monitoring and warning system. The Air Information and Response (AIR) plan, launched in May, involves the creation of an air quality index that measures daily pollution levels in eight locations. Giant LED screens display five color-coded alerts of the levels, and their related effects. An early warning system also alerts people to days when pollution is likely to reach the  very poor  or  severe  level.  Air pollution is a major risk, and unless we have data we cannot devise ways to control it and minimize its effect,  said Chirag Shah, a deputy health officer at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.  But what good is collecting data if we just keep it in the office and don't use it?  India and China account for more than half of global deaths due to air pollution. The increase in people dying in India from such pollution is forecast to outpace the rate of such deaths in China. India is home to four of the 10 cities in the world with the worst air pollution, measured by the amount of particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms found in every cubic meter of air, according to the World Health Organization. Tiny particulate matter can cause lung cancer, strokes and heart disease over the long term, as well as triggering symptoms such as heart attacks that kill more rapidly.  Too Many Cars The main causes of air pollution in Ahmedabad include diesel-fueled vehicles, construction, cooking fires and the burning of trash. Air quality is particularly bad in the cooler months of November to January. Other Indian cities - Delhi, Mumbai and Pune - also have an air pollution index, but only Ahmedabad has a warning system.   We must invest in measurement and response, or we can't fight it,  said Dileep Mavalankar, head of the Indian Institute of Public Health, which was involved in the AIR plan as well as the Heat Action Plan.  It has to be a collaborative effort with the government, non-profits and experts,  he said. In neighboring Maharashtra state, officials last month launched a star-rating program that uses smokestack emission data to rate industries based on the density of fine particulate pollution. The WHO says more than 7 million premature deaths occur every year due to air pollution, 3 million of them due to outdoor air quality. In Ahmedabad, the response to severe pollution days could include curtailing certain activities, Shah said.  This is about protecting health and saving lives. With data and warnings, we are better able to address it,  Shah said. Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Laurie Goering.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Pyongyang's test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on the eve of Tuesday's U.S. Independence Day a global threat, as experts cautioned that Alaska may now be within range. Most options for cracking down on Pyongyang fall into four categories: economic sanctions, covert action, diplomatic negotiations and military force.      Economic Sanctions North Korea is already among the most heavily sanctioned nations, facing numerous strictures to limit its ability to conduct commerce, participate in international finance and trade in weapons and other contraband. Despite those measures,  most analysts agree that U.S. and multilateral sanctions have not prevented North Korea from advancing its fledgling nuclear weapons capability,  said a report last year from the U.S. Congressional Research Service. Reuters has reported that Trump is focusing his North Korea strategy for now on tougher sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, banning its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. U.S. officials have expressed doubt about how much further China is willing to go to pressure its defiant North Korean ally - despite Beijing's increasing frustration with Pyongyang's missile launches and nuclear tests. Beijing has long feared that economic collapse in North Korea would flood China with refugees and leave it to deal with chaos on the Korean peninsula. In a statement on Tuesday, Tillerson said:  Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime    Covert Action The United States, with help from Israel, temporarily set back Iran's nuclear program via a computer virus called Stuxnet, which destroyed thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium. The United States tried, but failed, to deploy a version of the Stuxnet virus to attack North Korea's nuclear weapons program in 2009 and 2010, Reuters reported in 2015. One former high-ranking intelligence official briefed on the program said the effort was stymied by North Korea's utter secrecy and extreme isolation of its communications systems. That same secrecy is responsible for what U.S. officials have consistently described as limited U.S. intelligence about the North Korean government's inner workings. Another semi-covert approach would be for Washington to use electronic warfare or cyber attacks to disable North Korean missiles during or shortly after their launch. The high failure rate of the North's missile tests has prompted speculation that the United States is already doing so. The New York Times reported earlier this year that the U.S. military was working hard on missile defenses that would involve sabotage rather than traditional anti-missile interceptors. Diplomacy The Trump administration has said it is open to diplomatic negotiations with North Korea, but only under the right conditions. The talks need to be aimed at denuclearization, Washington has said. There have been no official negotiations for seven years. In February 2012, the United States and North Korea announced an agreement in which the North would suspend operations of its Yongbyon uranium enrichment plant, allow international inspectors to verify the suspension, and implement moratoriums on nuclear and long-range missile tests. In return, North Korea would get badly needed food aid. In April of that year, the North attempted to launch a satellite on a three-stage rocket, in what Washington said was a violation of the agreement because of the rocket's potential military uses. While Pyongyang denied it had breached the agreement, the deal was suspended. While China has responded to previous North Korean tests of suspected ICBM technology by agreeing to tougher U.N. sanctions, it emphasized on Tuesday its call for a return to talks with North Korea by signing a joint statement with Russia. Under a plan devised by Beijing, North Korea would suspend its ballistic missile program in return for a moratorium on large-scale military exercises by the United States and South Korea, which Washington and Seoul say are essential to maintain defense readiness. Military Force Military options available to Trump range from a sea blockade aimed at enforcing sanctions to cruise missile strikes on nuclear and missile facilities to a broader campaign aimed at overthrowing leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea has threatened to  ruthlessly ravage  the United States if Washington chooses to attack. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned the consequences of any military action would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale.  Any U.S. military action brings severe risks for U.S. ally South Korea. On the same program, Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster has indicated military force is a last resort.  It's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully,  he said.

Ramsey County District Judge William Leary told the jurors in a letter that, notwithstanding widespread criticism, they applied the law fairly when they acquitted officer Jeronimo Yanez last month for the killing of Philando Castile during a traffic stop last July, the Star Tribune said.  As we discussed when we met shortly after the verdict, I cannot convey my own opinions as to guilt or acquittal, but your verdict was fully supported by a fair interpretation of the evidence and the law you were obligated to apply,  the newspaper quoted Leary as saying. Leary's office was closed for Tuesday's Independence Day holiday, but when the Star Tribune reached him on Monday he declined any further comment.  The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights was among a wave of high-profile police killings of black men, which sparked street protests in cities across the United States. It drew additional attention because Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was sitting in the car's passenger seat, broadcast the bloody aftermath of the incident on Facebook Live. Yanez, 29, the son of a Mexican immigrant, testified that he had feared for his life after Castile, 32, told him that he was carrying a firearm and reached for his wallet when Yanez asked to see identification. Reynolds testified that Castile never reached for the handgun he was licensed to carry. Shortly after the June 16 verdict, authorities released a video from the dashboard of his Yanez's police cruiser showing him firing seven shots into Castile's car, five of which struck Castile, including two in the heart. Leary, in his letter dated June 23 and filed with the courts on June 28, told the jurors that criticism of their decision was based on  a failure to understand what you were asked to do,  the Star Tribune said. Rather than determine whether there was racism, the newspaper quoted the judge as telling the jurors,  You were simply asked to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether a crime had been committed.   The jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and two black, found Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter and other charges, sparking street protests.  Castile's family and the city of St. Anthony, Minnesota, last week said they reached a $3 million settlement in the case.

The Rays' right-hander threw a season-high 116 pitches, allowed three runs and eight hits, and collected an RBI with his first career base hit as Tampa Bay held on for a 6-5 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday. He also shut down a sixth-inning rally after the Cubs had two runners on with none out and then came up empty.  We needed a good start from Arch today and he provided that on the mound and at the plate so that was a pretty special day for him,  Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said.  We really like Arch battling through that sixth inning to find a way to get out after first and second with no outs. That's pretty telling, a big moment in his season for us.  Archer (7-5) worked six innings, walked three and struck out eight and has 139 strikeouts for the season, second in the American League. Tim Beckham went 2-for-4 and ignited a five-run fourth inning with a two-run homer while Steven Souza Jr. also had two hits to help Archer to his third victory in his last four tries. Chicago starter Jon Lester (5-5) allowed six runs (five earned) and nine hits while striking out six in five innings. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at CubsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses,  Lester said.  It just seems like balls are just getting outside of guys' reach. As a starting staff, as a bullpen I feel like when we do make mistakes we pay for it. Whereas last year when we made mistakes, guys just popped them up.  The defending World Series champions claimed a 1-0 lead in the second after Ian Happ tripled to right with one out and scored on Jason Heyward's sharp single to right. Happ's long drive went in and out of Souza's glove for his second three-base hit of the season. Heyward, back after a two-plus week stay on the disabled list, delivered his RBI grounder on a 1-2 pitch. The Rays forced a 1-1 tie in the third as Evan Longoria's one-out sacrifice scored Souza from third after Souza reached on a bunt single, stole second and went to third on catcher Willson Contreras' throwing error. Beckham started the big fourth inning with his blast to left-center that also scored Trevor Plouffe, who led off with a single. It was Beckham's 11th homer of the season. Adeiny Hechavarria and Peter Bourjos reached base and Archer helped his own cause -- still with none out -- with his first major league hit to bring home Hechavarria from second for a 4-1 lead.  That felt good,  Archer said.  I talked with Cash before the game and he said if (first baseman Anthony) Rizzo's in your face and you feel comfortable, do it. I got fortunate that they had that super shift on and the ball trickled through.  Souza's double to center then drove in Bourjos and Archer to make it 6-1. The Cubs hit Archer for two runs in the fifth. John Jay advanced to third on a bunt single and a throwing error by Longoria with two out and scored on Kris Bryant's infield single. Bryant moved to second on a Rizzo walk and scored on Ben Zobrist's single to make it 6-3. Chicago put two on with none out in the sixth inning before Archer struck out the next three batters.  One swing of the bat could have tied the game and I'm very, very happy I got the opportunity to work through it,  Archer said.  I want the ball in those situations and going forward I hope to have the opportunity to get through it again.  The Cubs scored twice in the ninth as Rizzo delivered a one-out single to right-center off closer Alex Colome, scoring Albert Almora Jr. from second and leaving runners at first and third. Zobrist hit a fielder's choice that brought home Jay to trim the Rays lead to 6-5. Colome walked Happ but got Heyward to pop out to left to end the game and give Colome his 22nd save. Jay and Contreras each had two hits for Chicago.  I don't have the definitive answer,  said Bryant, who went 1-for-4 and is batting .262.  It would be nice if start hitting and scoring more runs. Our pitchers have been great. It just feels like we're not clicking at the same time.  NOTES: 1B Logan Morrison seeks to become the first Tampa Bay player since Evan Longoria in 2008 to win the All-Star Game final vote. He would join DH Corey Dickerson, who won a starting spot in tallies announced Sunday. ... Tampa Bay has hit 129 home runs, second in the majors behind the Astros, and have 24 in their last 13 games. ... The Rays send out LHP Blake Snell (0-5, 5.36 ERA) against Cubs RHP John Lackey (5-9, 5.24) on Wednesday. ... The Cubs activated OF Jason Heyward off the 10-day disabled list and recalled LHP Jack Leathersich from Triple-A Iowa. Chicago also optioned INF Jeimer Candelario and RHP Felix Pena to Triple-A. ... Cubs 3B Kris Bryant is among the NL Final Vote candidates for next week's All-Star Game.

Shkreli's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, asked the judge that day to reject the request on the grounds that his client had a First Amendment right to speak freely, according to the filings. Shkreli last week told reporters outside the court that an alleged victim of his was not actually a victim because she made money from his investments, attorneys for the U.S. government told U.S. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in a letter on Monday. He also directly spoke on camera to a journalist and appeared to be commenting on the case on social media platform Twitter under the handle @BLMBro, they added. Brafman said Shkreli was in a delicate emotional state, and believed that the press focuses unfairly on some of his negative characteristics.  His comments are the somewhat natural, though unfortunate consequence of a young man with a demonstrated history of significant anxiety being at the center of a supremely difficult time in his life,  Brafman wrote in the filing. Dubbed the  pharma bro,  Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent. The charges he faces stem from his management of pharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O) and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management from 2009 to 2014. Prosecutors have claimed that Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which he defrauded investors in MSMB and took $11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to charges that include securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Federal prosecutors have asked Judge Matsumoto sequester the jury in the event that the court does not issue the gag order. In their letter, federal prosecutors said Shkreli visited reporters in a court breakroom last week and remarked on the credibility of witnesses who testified.  Prosecutors also wrote that Shkreli on YouTube had identified himself as BLMBro. The BLMBro Twitter account has posted stories critical of witnesses and evidence in the trial, they added. Shkreli in January was suspended from Twitter for harassing a female journalist.  Brafman has argued that Shkreli is a misunderstood genius who earned his wealthy investors millions of dollars.

The two showed on Tuesday the type of spark they could provide in the second half for a club surprisingly in contention. Gibson pitched into the seventh inning, giving Minnesota another quality start, and Buxton homered among three hits as the Twins beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-4.  I think we've been seeing steps with him as well,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said of Buxton.  You talk about Gibson, you talk about Buxton, these guys that are trying to find ways to become more consistent players and pitchers at the highest level. When (Buxton) gets good feedback like he did today, stayed back on the changeup in his last at-bat, I think he just has to remember during the game all the work he puts into his practice.  When you get in the game, you can't be overthinking that thing. You just kind of have to let it fly. We saw some good results today.  Buxton entered the day hitting .195 but raised his average to .204 by matching his career high with three hits. He homered for the first time since June 14, stole his 15th base of the season and made a highlight-reel, leaping catch at the wall on the very first play of the game. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TwinsLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchGibson (5-6) also spoke to changes in his mentality, leading to a 3.91 ERA in his last nine starts. Gibson was optioned to Triple-A in May after an 8.20 ERA in his first six starts. Gibson had his longest outing of the season, pitching 6 2/3 innings with two runs allowed on five hits.  It's just been mostly about my mindset,  Gibson said.  I don't feel like my stuff is that much different. I think my mindset has allowed me to execute better. I've gotten in situations where in the first six starts, I ended up caving in and not making it out of the third, fourth, fifth inning. I think with my mindset change of looking at what I'm doing, I think it's been able to help a lot and just clearing up my mind.  Brandon Kintzler yielded a run on a hit and walk in the ninth but secured his 22nd save in 25 chances. Ehire Adrianza drove in two runs on sacrifice flies in his first game back from the disabled list for the Twins, who took the first two games of the series and have beat Los Angeles in nine of the past 12 meetings. JC Ramirez (7-7) gave up four runs on seven hits in five innings for the Angels, who have lost five of their past six games. Kole Calhoun and Albert Pujols homered for Los Angeles. For Pujols, the deep shot above the bullpens in left-center field was estimated at 456 feet and was the 603rd of his career.  It doesn't matter to me, as long as they don't catch it,  Pujols said.  It can go 405 or 500 feet, it doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is putting good swings. It's cool to hit it far, but it's also cool if you just barely hit it out, too. It's a home run at the end of the day.  Minnesota has been desperate for rotation improvement behind standouts Ervin Santana and Jose Berrios. Adalberto Mejia finished seven innings in Monday's victory and Gibson used his ground ball-heavy approach to stay out of trouble. Luis Valbuena's double in the second inning scored Yunel Escobar and gave the Angels the early lead. Gibson retired 10 of the next 11 batters. The right-hander got nine ground-ball outs and struck out four batters.  I think that's what we're all looking for is if he keeps incrementally finding ways to trust himself and stay aggressive,  Molitor said of Gibson.  It seems when he does that, the results reflect it. He's going to examine every pitch and go back and look. Hopefully, he finds some positive that once he attacked, he got good results.  Buxton hit his fifth homer of the season in the sixth off reliever Blake Parker, who entered the game having allowed one run in his previous 23 1/3 innings. Ramirez had his five-game road winning streak snapped. He had allowed nine runs in 30 innings in his previous five starts on the road.  We've got a lot of confidence in JC,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  We see him going against some really, really good teams that are hitting the ball well and shut them down.

Shkreli's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, asked the judge that day to reject the request on the grounds that his client had a First Amendment right to speak freely, according to the filings. Shkreli last week told reporters outside the court that an alleged victim of his was not actually a victim because she made money from his investments, attorneys for the U.S. government told U.S. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in a letter on Monday. He also directly spoke on camera to a journalist and appeared to be commenting on the case on social media platform Twitter under the handle @BLMBro, they added. Brafman said Shkreli was in a delicate emotional state, and believed that the press focuses unfairly on some of his negative characteristics.  His comments are the somewhat natural, though unfortunate consequence of a young man with a demonstrated history of significant anxiety being at the center of a supremely difficult time in his life,  Brafman wrote in the filing. Dubbed the  pharma bro,  Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent. The charges he faces stem from his management of pharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O) and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management from 2009 to 2014. Prosecutors have claimed that Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which he defrauded investors in MSMB and took $11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to charges that include securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Federal prosecutors have asked Judge Matsumoto sequester the jury in the event that the court does not issue the gag order. In their letter, federal prosecutors said Shkreli visited reporters in a court breakroom last week and remarked on the credibility of witnesses who testified.  Prosecutors also wrote that Shkreli on YouTube had identified himself as BLMBro. The BLMBro Twitter account has posted stories critical of witnesses and evidence in the trial, they added. Shkreli in January was suspended from Twitter for harassing a female journalist.  Brafman has argued that Shkreli is a misunderstood genius who earned his wealthy investors millions of dollars.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into the global sex market, bringing with it a revolution in robotic  sextech  designed to offer sexual gratification with a near-human touch. In a report on the growing market in sex robots, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics said rapidly advancing technologies have already led to the creation of  android love dolls  capable of performing 50 automated sexual positions.  They can be customized down to the nipple shape and pubic hair color, and can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. The increasingly life-like robots raise complex issues that should be considered by policymakers and the public, the report said -- including whether use of such devices should be encouraged in sexual therapy clinics, for sex offenders, or for people with disabilities. Catalan nanotechnology engineer Sergi Santos holds the head of Samantha, a sex doll packed with artificial intelligence providing her the capability to respond to different scenarios and verbal stimulus, in his house in Rubi, north of Barcelona, Spain, March 31, 2017.Albert GeaNoel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Britain's University of Sheffield, said it was difficult to predict how far or fast the market would grow, or what its effect on societies might be in years ahead.  Will these robotic dolls be niche? Or will they change societal norms and become widespread?,  he asked at a news briefing.  How would (sex with a robot) equate to a truly human intimate relationship?      The report looked at some of the most contentious issues, asking academics, members of the public and the sex industry for their views on whether, for example, sex robots might be helpful in reducing sexual crimes. It found  major disagreement  on this question, with some arguing that having sex with a robot would reduce attackers' desires to harm fellow humans, and others arguing that allowing people to live out their darkest fantasies with robots would have a pernicious effect on societal norms. On the issue of  meaningful  relationships, the report said that with current AI technology, and even in the foreseeable future, no human-to-robot feelings would ever be mutual.  The best robots could do is 'fake it',  it said.  Robots cannot feel love.  Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-robots-sex-idUSKBN19P2M6"},

Overall shop prices declined 0.3 percent year-on-year in June, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in May. The food price component rose 1.4 percent, however.  The Bank of England is watching gauges of inflation pressure in Britain's economy closely as it considers whether to raise interest rates from their record low level.  The fact that the headline number, minus 0.3 percent, shows that prices are still down on last year should not be misunderstood,  Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive said in a statement.  The year on year numbers belie the fact that prices have been heading upwards for the last six months; it’s just that significant deflation in the second half of 2016 means there has been considerable ground to make up in the year on year figures.  The reality is that cost pressures faced by retailers continue to mount,  she said.   Over the last four years the BRC price index has shown a deflationary trend, caused by supermarkets engaging in a price war as well as falling global oil and food prices. Last month the BoE said consumer price inflation, which stood at 2.9 percent in May, could exceed 3 percent by the autumn.

Cavendish broke his shoulder blade in the crash and has withdrawn from the Tour, his Dimension Data team told Reuters. Sagan's German team Bora-Hansgrohe has appealed against the decision of the race jury to throw the Slovak out of the Tour.   French champion Arnaud Demare won the stage, a 207.5-km ride from Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg, but all the drama took place just behind him in the final stretch of the race. Sagan appeared to knock Cavendish off balance with an extended elbow as the Briton was trying to force his way between him and the safety barrier, and Cavendish was sent crashing heavily to the ground. The Briton went to hospital for checks on his wrist and collarbone. Despite the fracture, the team doctor said no surgery was required and there was no nerve damage. Race jury president Philippe Marien had earlier told reporters Sagan would play no further part in the Tour.  Peter Sagan is disqualified from the 2017 Tour de France after today's tumultuous sprint in Vittel,  he said.  Marien cited Article 12 of the International Cycling Union (UCI) rules, which says any rider making a wilful obstruction  against one of the 1st 10 riders placed  faces elimination.

Peter Sagan rejected to have caused, or in any way intended to cause, the crash of Mark Cavendish on the final 200m of the stage. Peter stayed on his line in the sprint and could not see Cavendish on the right side.  The team applied for a redress of Peter Sagan's result in stage 4.

I’m not a fan of him putting his elbow in me like that.  Sagan, who went to Cavendish's team bus to apologize, later said in a team statement: “In the sprint I didn’t know that Mark Cavendish was behind me. He was coming from the right side, and I was trying to go on (Alexander) Kristoff’s wheel.   Mark was coming really fast from the back and I just didn’t have time to react and to go left. He came into me and he went into the fence.   German John Degenkolb, the 2016 Paris-Roubaix champion, also crashed as he ran into Cavendish on the ground.  Cavendish eventually got back on his bike and crossed the line after being attended to by race medics. Slideshow (4 Images)After pulling out of the race Cavendish said in a team statement:  I'm obviously massively disappointed to get this news about the fracture.  I feel I was in a good position to win and to lose that and even having to leave the Tour, a race I've built my whole career around, is really sad.  The race's yellow jersey holder, Britain's Geraint Thomas, hit the deck in a separate pile-up near the end, but as the incident occurred within the final three kilometers he will be credited with the same time as the winner. Thomas and defending champion Chris Froome, who was held up behind the crash and is 12 seconds behind his compatriot in the overall classification, are fine, Team Sky said.  I went to the ground, but no serious damage,  said Thomas, who was also brought down in a crash on Sunday. Norway's Kristoff (Katusha) came home third, but moved up to second after Sagan's expulsion, as FDJ rider Demare, who has been in impressive form lately, had time to raise his arms in celebration before crossing the line. Demare, the 2011 under-21 world champion, burst into the limelight when he won the 'Monument' classic Milan-San Remo last year but he said Tuesday's victory was more special. The Frenchman took the green jersey for the points classification and is now favorite to take it to Paris, a feat Sagan was looking to achieve for a record-equalling sixth time.  Wednesday's fifth stage should see the top guns in action as the 160.5-km ride from Vittel will finish up La Planche des Belles Filles, a lung-busting 5.9-km climb at an average gradient of 8.5 percent.

Steve Brown, a spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, gave no time frame on possible House votes, though some House Democrats posted on their social media accounts that voting would take place on Thursday. “We’re still assessing when the best day will be for the people who supported passage of the legislation to return and deal with the veto message,” Brown said in an interview.  In an action-packed Fourth of July holiday session, the Democratic-led Senate gave final legislative approval to a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax increase package passed by the House Sunday and Monday.  Within hours, Governor Bruce Rauner vetoed the trio of budget and revenue measures. The Senate then quickly overrode the vetoes, moving the final override to enact the bills over the governor's vetoes to the House.  A stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two fiscal years. While fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, lawmakers have been scrambling to piece together a spending and revenue plan to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois at Baa3, one notch above junk, said on Tuesday a continuation of the state's budget impasse would not bode well from a credit standpoint.  That's going to be a negative for the state's credit position not reflected in its (current) rating,  he said. In his veto message, the governor lashed out at lawmakers for passing budget measures that he said would make Illinois’ fiscal woes worse.  The package of legislation fails to address Illinois’ fiscal and economic crisis – and in fact, makes it worse in the long run. It does not balance the budget. It does not make nearly sufficient spending reductions, does not pay down our debt, and holds schools hostage to force a Chicago bailout,” Rauner said. The House on Tuesday adjourned until Wednesday without taking action on the override resolutions, a result of diminished ranks on a national holiday. Only 54 of the chamber’s 118 members were present on Tuesday afternoon - too few to conduct business under House rules. Among the missing were five of 15 House Republicans who had been vital for the tax increase piece of the budget package to pass on Saturday with 73 votes. Seventy-one votes are necessary to block Rauner’s vetoes. The House speaker's spokesman, Brown, said he did not foresee any danger that previous votes in support of the budget - including from the 15 Republicans - would flip toward the governor, endangering the override push.

Happ became the latest pitcher to allow a long home run to Aaron Judge when his full-count fastball drifted over the plate and wound up traveling 118.4 mph and 456 feet over the left-center field wall. An inning later, Happ encountered Judge again but this time in a more dangerous situation -- with two on and the slugger representing the tying run. At this point, Happ just let the adrenaline kick in and it worked as the left-hander highlighted six solid innings by striking out Judge as the Toronto Blue Jays snapped a five-game losing streak with a 4-1 victory over the New York Yankees on Tuesday afternoon.  It's hard not to,  Happ said.  It's a huge situation in the game. If he gets a hold of one it's a tie ballgame. I was frustrated I put myself in that position.  Happ (3-5) continued to pitch well against the Yankees as he allowed one run and four hits and improved to 7-2 lifetime against them. He twice struck out Judge, recorded six strikeouts overall, walked one and threw a season-high 114 pitches. None were as significant as the final one to Judge. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at YankeesToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatch It could've been the game right there,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  You know he's dangerous. I mean we saw him hit that one, I think that ball was sitting on the corner, ball leaked over the middle of the plate a little bit, the one that he did hit out.  Happ allowed a one-out infield single to Ronald Torreyes and then walked Brett Gardner with two outs. Following a mound visit with pitching coach Pete Walker, Happ got ahead in the count before it went full. He then ended the at-bat by fanning Judge on a 95 mph fastball that was tipped into catcher Russell Martin's glove.  I think he's got great leverage, he's able to get his arms extended,  Happ said of Judge.  He's really good at hitting the ball on the plate down.  He's just obviously seeing the ball really well now. He's on some kind of a streak.  Everything Happ described occurred when Judge opened the fourth with his major league-leading 28th homer. It was his third-longest homer in terms of distance this season and he moved to within one shy of Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio's franchise rookie record set in 1936. Still, it was only a solo homer as Happ made key pitches before and after Judge's latest blast. He stranded a runner on second after the homer and finished his outing by striking out the side in the sixth after issuing a leadoff walk to Gary Sanchez.  That was a big out with the way Judge has been swinging the bat and how he's seeing the ball and what-not,  Toronto catcher Russell Martin said.  He made some big pitches and ended up getting the big out. Happ just kind of threw a little extra cheese on it. He got a piece of it, just not enough and I was able to hang on to it.  Happ was not the only Toronto pitcher to get a key out against Judge. After Jeff Beliveau ended the seventh with a strikeout of Gardner, Ryan Tepera opened a scoreless eighth by striking out Judge with another fastball. Roberto Osuna easily recorded his 20th save in the ninth as Toronto won for only the third time in nine games. Toronto scored all the runs in the third inning against CC Sabathia. Jose Bautista started his three-hit game with an RBI single, Justin Smoak drew a bases-loaded walk and Kendrys Morales hit a two-run single for a 4-0 lead. The Yankees were hoping Sabathia (7-3) could provide at least five innings or 75 pitches in his return from missing three weeks with a strained left hamstring. Sabathia did neither, allowing four runs and three hits in 2 1/3 innings in a 63-pitch outing as New York lost for the 15th time in 21 games. Sabathia lost for the first time in six starts and it was his shortest start since Aug. 23, 2015, against the Cleveland Indians.  He just kind of lost the zone,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  It seemed maybe he was overthrowing a little bit. He was just missing with some sliders, just missing and that's really what led to the issues.  NOTES: New York activated RHP Adam Warren, who missed 17 games with right shoulder inflammation. To get Warren and LHP CC Sabathia on the roster, RHPs Bryan Mitchell and Domingo German was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Toronto activated C Miguel Montero after acquiring him from the Chicago Cubs Monday. To get Montero on the roster, C Luke Maile was placed on the disabled list with right knee inflammation. ... Toronto manager John Gibbons said RHP Joe Smith (right shoulder inflammation) is not likely going to be activated until after the All-Star break.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED74L2U7G0"},

In an action-packed Fourth of July holiday session, the Democratic-led Senate gave final legislative approval to a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax increase package passed by the House Sunday and Monday.  Within hours, Governor Bruce Rauner vetoed the trio of budget and revenue measures. The Senate then quickly overrode the vetoes, moving the final override to enact the bills over the governor's vetoes to the House.  A stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two fiscal years. While fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, lawmakers have been scrambling to piece together a spending and revenue plan to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois at Baa3, one notch above junk, said on Tuesday a continuation of the state's budget impasse would not bode well from a credit standpoint.  That's going to be a negative for the state's credit position not reflected in its (current) rating,  he said. In his veto message, the governor lashed out at lawmakers for passing budget measures that he said would make Illinois’ fiscal woes worse.  The package of legislation fails to address Illinois’ fiscal and economic crisis – and in fact, makes it worse in the long run. It does not balance the budget. It does not make nearly sufficient spending reductions, does not pay down our debt, and holds schools hostage to force a Chicago bailout,” Rauner said. The House on Tuesday adjourned until Wednesday without taking action on the override resolutions, a result of diminished ranks on a national holiday. Only 54 of the chamber’s 118 members were present on Tuesday afternoon - too few to conduct business under House rules. Among the missing were five of 15 House Republicans who had been vital for the tax increase piece of the budget package to pass on Saturday with 73 votes. Seventy-one votes are necessary to block Rauner’s vetoes. The House speaker's spokesman, Brown, said he did not foresee any danger that previous votes in support of the budget - including from the 15 Republicans - would flip toward the governor, endangering the override push.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into the global sex market, bringing with it a revolution in robotic  sextech  designed to offer sexual gratification with a near-human touch. In a report on the growing market in sex robots, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics said rapidly advancing technologies have already led to the creation of  android love dolls  capable of performing 50 automated sexual positions.  They can be customized down to the nipple shape and pubic hair color, and can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. The increasingly life-like robots raise complex issues that should be considered by policymakers and the public, the report said -- including whether use of such devices should be encouraged in sexual therapy clinics, for sex offenders, or for people with disabilities. Catalan nanotechnology engineer Sergi Santos holds the head of Samantha, a sex doll packed with artificial intelligence providing her the capability to respond to different scenarios and verbal stimulus, in his house in Rubi, north of Barcelona, Spain, March 31, 2017.Albert GeaNoel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Britain's University of Sheffield, said it was difficult to predict how far or fast the market would grow, or what its effect on societies might be in years ahead.  Will these robotic dolls be niche? Or will they change societal norms and become widespread?,  he asked at a news briefing.  How would (sex with a robot) equate to a truly human intimate relationship?      The report looked at some of the most contentious issues, asking academics, members of the public and the sex industry for their views on whether, for example, sex robots might be helpful in reducing sexual crimes. It found  major disagreement  on this question, with some arguing that having sex with a robot would reduce attackers' desires to harm fellow humans, and others arguing that allowing people to live out their darkest fantasies with robots would have a pernicious effect on societal norms. On the issue of  meaningful  relationships, the report said that with current AI technology, and even in the foreseeable future, no human-to-robot feelings would ever be mutual.  The best robots could do is 'fake it',  it said.  Robots cannot feel love.  Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/science-robots-sex-idUSL8N1JV3JK"},

Overall shop prices declined 0.3 percent year-on-year in June, compared with a 0.4 percent drop in May. The food price component rose 1.4 percent, however.  The Bank of England is watching gauges of inflation pressure in Britain's economy closely as it considers whether to raise interest rates from their record low level.  The fact that the headline number, minus 0.3 percent, shows that prices are still down on last year should not be misunderstood,  Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive said in a statement.  The year on year numbers belie the fact that prices have been heading upwards for the last six months; it’s just that significant deflation in the second half of 2016 means there has been considerable ground to make up in the year on year figures.  The reality is that cost pressures faced by retailers continue to mount,  she said.   Over the last four years the BRC price index has shown a deflationary trend, caused by supermarkets engaging in a price war as well as falling global oil and food prices. Last month the BoE said consumer price inflation, which stood at 2.9 percent in May, could exceed 3 percent by the autumn.

Crops covering almost 36 million hectares - an area roughly the size of Germany - are irrigated with water from rivers and lakes used by cities within 40 km (25 miles) upstream to discharge sewage, according to an international team of researchers. About 80 percent of these crops - 29 million hectares - are in countries with very limited wastewater treatment, such as China, India, Pakistan, Mexico and Iran, according to the paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The study was the first to use remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) for its data analysis, improving on earlier estimates based on case studies and guesswork, researchers said. Untreated wastewater, even when diluted, poses health risks for both farmers and consumers, said Pay Drechsel, one of the authors.  In wastewater we have a lot of faecal contaminants from excrement,  Drechsel, a scientist at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Farm workers can get skin infections from contact with contaminated water, while consumers are at risk of contracting worms, diarrhoea and even cholera from vegetables eaten raw, he said. Pollution from human and animal waste affects nearly one in three rivers in Latin America, Asia and Africa, and some 3.4 million people die each year from diseases associated with pathogens in water, according to the United Nations. The threat will get worse as the global population grows and informal settlements not supported by proper infrastructure spring up in rapidly expanding cities in developing countries.  As long as investment in wastewater treatment lags far behind population growth, large numbers of consumers eating raw produce will face heightened threats to food safety,  said the study's lead author Anne Thebo, of the University of California, Berkeley. In March U.N. experts said governments should see treating wastewater not as a costly problem but a valuable resource that could be used to meet growing demand for freshwater, energy and raw materials. Wastewater contains nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates which can be turned into fertiliser while treated sludge can be turned into bio gas.

The world's largest memory chip maker is the among the biggest beneficiaries of soaring demand for processing firepower on smartphones and servers, which has fueled an industry super-cycle amid limited supply growth. Underscoring its dominant position, Samsung said on Tuesday it plans to invest some $18.6 billion in South Korea as it seeks to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays for smartphones. The South Korean tech giant, Asia's third-largest company by market capitalization, is now poised to knock Intel off the top of the global semiconductor market-share rankings for the first time since 1991.   From the second quarter, Samsung will become No. 1 in market share due to the recent increase in data centers and demand for solid-state drives,  NH Investment & Securities analyst Peter Lee wrote in a note to clients.   Samsung's April-June operating profit is expected to leap 67 percent from a year earlier to 13.1 trillion won ($11.4 billion), a new high, according to the average forecast from a Thomson Reuters survey of 18 analysts.  The same survey expects July-September profit to be even higher at 13.8 trillion won.  Solid sales of the Galaxy S8 smartphone launched in April likely provided an additional boost, keeping the firm ahead of rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the world's top smartphone maker. The S8's performance has reassured investors whose nerves were shaken last year by the costly withdrawal of Samsung's premium Galaxy Note 7 due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung shares are trading at a near-record high of 2.35 million won each as of Tuesday. They have gained 30 percent so far this year on top of a 43 percent surge in 2016.  In the Pipeline  The Galaxy S8 series has been out for more than 2 months now and we see similar traction as the Galaxy S7 series,  Counterpoint analyst Tom Kang said.  Samsung would sell about 49 million S8s by the end of its first full-year release, in line with first-year sales of the Galaxy S7, he said.  Samsung is also preparing to unveil the Galaxy Note 8 in August, a source told Reuters, restoring the company's schedule of market-moving gadget releases after the interruption of the Note 7 debacle.  The company will issue earnings guidance early on Friday but will not disclose details on its performance until late July.   Nomura has predicted DRAM chip prices will continue to rise in the second half of 2017 due to limited supply and strong demand driven by servers. Demand for solid-state drives (SSD) and smartphones would maintain profits for producers of NAND semiconductors, despite an easing of a production bottleneck, it said.

LOUIS -- The Miami Marlins, headed for a second half in which the only notable things they'll do as an organization are host the All-Star Game and probably trade a few established players for prospects, aren't totally without bright spots. One of them took the mound at Busch Stadium on Tuesday and continued a breakout season that has given the team some sorely needed starting pitching. Jose Urena fanned seven over five innings to earn his seventh victory of the year as Miami rallied from a two-run deficit to dump the St. Louis Cardinals 5-2.  Guys like playing behind him,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  He works quick, he's aggressive and he's pitched well. They seem to have energy behind him.  Urena (7-3) gave up three hits, none until the fifth inning, and two runs while walking a pair of hitters. He probably could have lasted longer, but his pitch count hit 96 when he concluded the fifth. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at CardinalsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchCoupled with St. Louis' 2-0 lead, courtesy of Greg Garcia's two-run homer to right in the fifth inning, Mattingly had to pull Urena. But Urena was still the pitcher of record when Miami (37-45) put together the rally that changed the game in the sixth. Dee Gordon doubled off Lance Lynn with one out. Giancarlo Stanton laced an 118-mph liner at second baseman Matt Carpenter, who knocked it down and then threw wide of first for an error. Christian Yelich worked a full count and then jumped on a fastball that veered to the middle of the plate, ripping a three-run homer 406 feet to left-center. It was his eighth of the year, giving the Marlins the lead for good.  A pitch that didn't get to where he wanted it,  said Cardinals manager Mike Matheny of Lynn's 20th homer allowed in 95 1/3 innings.  He tried to execute a sinker on the inside part that stayed up out over and Yelich made him pay.  Lynn departed one batter later after Marcell Ozuna's single, but reliever Tyler Lyons couldn't close the wound. Martin Prado doubled Ozuna to third with two outs and JT Riddle knocked both home with a two-run single off a hanging 0-2 slider for a three-run cushion. Given a lead to protect, the front end of Miami's bullpen got the job done. Four relievers combined for the last 12 outs, with AJ Ramos cruising through a 1-2-3 ninth for his 14th save in 15 chances. St. Louis (40-43) had one opportunity to do damage late. Back-to-back singles by pinch-hitter Jose Martinez and Carpenter put men at the corners in the seventh. But reliever Kyle Barraclough whiffed Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty to end the threat. A day after collecting 15 hits and scoring a season-high 14 runs in a rout of the Marlins, the Cardinals managed only seven hits. Pham and Piscotty, who combined for five hits, four runs and three RBIs on Monday night, went 0-for-8 with seven strikeouts in this one. It all came back to Urena, who mixed a sinker that touched 97 mph with a slider and changeup that led to a spate of awkward-looking swings and fairly soft contact.  Except for one pitch, he probably has a shutout,  Riddle said.  But we were able to get a lead and the bullpen shut it down for us.  Lynn (6-6) gave up four runs (two earned) and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked one and fanned five.  I actually threw the ball pretty well,  he said.  Just one bad pitch cost me three runs. That will happen, and he's a good hitter. He put a pretty good charge into it to the opposite field.  NOTES: Miami Tuesday designated LHP Jeff Locke for assignment and recalled RHP Drew Steckenrider from Triple-A New Orleans. Locke started Monday night's 14-6 loss to St. Louis, tying a franchise record by allowing 11 runs over 2 2/3 innings as his ERA rose to 8.16 to go with an 0-5 record. ... Cardinals 3B Jedd Gyorko (left leg cramp) didn't start Tuesday's game after leaving Monday night in the bottom of the fifth inning. Greg Garcia got the call at third base Tuesday, batting eighth. ...

Latin America's No. 3 economy is seen growing 2.7 percent this year, a tick above the 2.6 percent rate seen last month but below government expectations for growth of around 3 percent, according to the survey.  Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is seeking to show signs that the economy is rebounding and that inflation - which totaled more than 40 percent last year - is under control ahead of mid-term elections in October that will help determine the fate of his open market reform agenda.  Cuts in subsidies for utilities like gas and electricity, necessary to reduce a wide fiscal deficit, have resulted in higher consumer prices. A weakening peso currency and wage hikes above the central bank's target range also threaten to complicate the monetary authority's goal.  On Tuesday, Buenos Aires province - Argentina's largest - reached a deal with public school teachers' unions to raise salaries by 24 percent in 2017, ending a months-long impasse.  When negotiations began in February, the deal the union would ultimately reach was seen as a benchmark for the rest of the public sector, meaning a pay hike well above inflation goals could embolden other unions to demand a similar deal. But it has lost that bellwether status since many other sectors have already reached deals.   The impact is reduced in this context given the delay,  said Federico Furiase, an economist with consultancy Estudio Bein & Asociados in Buenos Aires, adding that the fast-depreciating peso currency was now the most influential factor for inflation. The teachers' wage hike was similar to a 24.3 percent deal reached earlier this year by bank workers, seen as a reference for the private sector. Central bank President Federico Sturzenegger has said wage hikes  slightly above  the target inflation range would not jeopardize the goal.   The peso currency ARS=RASL fell 3.1 percent against the dollar during the month of June and on Tuesday fell to as low as 16.97 per dollar, a historic trough.

Parliament passed the bill unanimously, the state-run Tanzania Information Services said. This followed two other laws passed on Monday giving the resource-rich East African nation the right to tear up and renegotiate contracts for natural resources like gas or minerals, and removing the right to international arbitration. The bills were introduced on Thursday and rapidly passed, despite pleas for more time from an association representing mining companies.  In any mining operations under a mining license or a special mining license, the government shall have not less than 16 (percent) non-dilutable free-carried interest shares in the capital of a mining company,  the text of the new law says. The government also left itself scope to further increase its stake in the companies.   In addition to the free carried interest shares, the government shall be entitled to acquire, in total, up to 50 percent of the shares of the mining company commensurate with the total tax expenditures incurred by the government in favor of the mining company.  There was no further explanation from the government, but industry sources said they believed the bill meant the government might take further shares in companies that it accused of owing taxes, in lieu of the money owed.  Government officials were not available for comment. President John Magufuli has accused large mining companies of evading taxes, charges they deny. At a public rally on Tuesday, he said Tanzania was fighting an economic war.  We couldn't wait to pass the laws because of the large scale theft taking place in the mining sector,  he said. Rising Royalties The new law also raises royalties from gold, copper, silver and platinum exports to six percent from four percent. It increases the royalty on uranium exports from five percent to six percent.  The law also allows the government to reject a company's valuation if it believed the price was too low. The government would be entitled to buy the consignment of minerals at the price quoted.   For the purposes of calculating the amount of royalties payable, the government shall be entitled to reject the valuation,  the text of the new law said.   Where the government rejects the valuation, it shall have the option to buy the minerals at the low value.   Tanzania's largest miner Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold, said on Tuesday that notices of arbitration were served on behalf of companies that own its Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines, which have been hit by an export ban.  The serving of the notices at this time is necessary to protect the Company,  Acacia said.

If confirmed as an ICBM, it would mark a milestone for North Korea's missile program and would heighten concern in Washington about Pyongyang's declared pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump vowed in January that North Korea would never achieve that goal. Officials declined to speculate on how Trump might respond. The United States has requested a meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council about the launch, a session likely to be scheduled for Wednesday, a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations said on Tuesday. The launch, on the eve of Tuesday's U.S. Independence Day, took place days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations were due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons program, which it has pursued in defiance of Security Council sanctions. North Korea's state media said the launch was ordered and supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and sent the Hwasong-14 933 km (580 miles), reaching an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles) over a flight time of 39 minutes. Some analysts said the flight details suggested the new missile had a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles), which would put significant parts of the U.S. mainland in range, representing major advances in its program. David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said the flight time and distance suggested the missile could travel about 6,700 km (4,163 miles), bringing all of Alaska into range. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the missile was believed to be an intermediate-range type, but the military was looking into the possibility it was an ICBM. The Pentagon and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Monday night, the U.S. military described the missile as an intermediate-range type that traveled for 37 minutes, and the United States has not yet officially changed that assessment. The two U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity about the ongoing review of data on the test launch, said no conclusion had yet been reached. But the evidence increasingly suggested a two-stage ICBM, as opposed to an intermediate-range missile, they said. North Korea's official news agency said the launch successfully tested stage separation, warhead re-entry and late-stage control. It quoted Kim Jong Un as saying that the United States would  have to be displeased  by the missile test on its national holiday. U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North, said the launch was both earlier and  far more successful than expected.  He said it would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved  minimal operational capability  and it was likely the initial test did not perform as well as an operational missile would.  Still, this missile demonstrated a degree of performance that is beyond what is needed to reach Anchorage - or Pearl Harbor - but not quite sufficient to reliably reach targets on the U.S. West Coast,  he said. Schilling said the U.S. national missile defense system was  only minimally operational  and would take more than two years to upgrade to provide more reliable defence. North Korea said its missiles were now capable of striking anywhere in the world. Officials from South Korea, Japan and the United States said the missile landed in the sea in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone after being launched on a high trajectory. Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Seoul's Kyungnam University, said that if launched on a standard angle, the missile could have a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles). Trump Frustration With China Trump has been urging China, North Korea's main trading partner and only big ally and the current chair of the U.N. Security Council, to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. In an apparent reference to Kim Jong Un, Trump tweeted:  Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?   Hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer,  he added.  Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!  Trump has indicated he is running out of patience with Beijing's efforts to rein in North Korea. His administration has said all options are on the table, military included, but suggested those would be a last resort and that sanctions and diplomatic pressure were its preferred course. The United States has responded to some previous North Korean weapons tests by sending more military hardware, including nuclear-capable bombers, to the Korean peninsula in shows of force. While China has responded to previous North Korean tests of suspected ICBM technology by agreeing to tougher U.N. sanctions, it emphasized on Tuesday its call for a return to talks with North Korea by signing a joint statement with Russia. Under China's plan, North Korea would suspend its ballistic missile program in return for a moratorium on large-scale military exercises by the United States and South Korea, which Washington and Seoul say are essential to maintain defense readiness. Trump is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G20 in Germany this week. Japan said on Monday it would have a trilateral summit with the United States and South Korea on North Korea at the G20. Its prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he would ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles. North Korea was a major topic in phone calls between Trump and the leaders of China and Japan this week. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called on Tuesday for calm and restraint, and reiterated China's opposition to North Korea's violation of U.N. resolutions on missile tests. Geng said China had been working hard to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.  China's role is indispensable,  he told a daily news briefing.  We hope all sides can meet each other halfway.  North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, two since the beginning of last year, and the pace of missile tests has risen significantly. It says it needs to defend itself against U.S. aggression.

The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) Price Index dipped 0.4 percent, with an average selling price of $3,303 per tonne, in the auction held in the early hours of Wednesday. The index had slipped 0.8 pct at the previous sale.     After two years of declining prices, farmers and analysts had been concerned that a 50 percent rebound during 2016 could be temporary, but prices got back on track the past few months as global supply tightened.     Losses were lead by anhydrous milk fat, which fell 3.5 percent, while butter milk powder fell 10.8 percent.      There has been concern that buyers would no longer be able to absorb the record prices that these two commodities have been hitting, though it is too early to tell whether this is the start of a longer term downward trend,  AgriHQ analyst Amy Castleton said in a research note.

Khalifa Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) says it is close to concluding a three-year campaign for control of Libya's second city, having surrounded rival fighters in a strip of the seafront district of Sabri little more than two km (1-1/4 miles) wide.  The campaign has been halting, with the LNA suffering high casualties even after gaining the upper hand early last year.   A medical source said at least 17 troops had been killed and at least 50 wounded in fighting since Monday. The LNA said it had killed 19 of its opponents.  The special forces and supporting units from the army advanced today and tightened the grip on the terrorist groups on the Sabri front, gaining control over important sites,  said special forces spokesman Milad al-Zawi. He said one of the sites was a building that contained a large number of snipers. Parts of Benghazi have been left in ruins since Haftar launched his  Dignity Operation  against Islamists and other opponents in May 2014.  Many of the buildings in Sabri and the neighboring historic neighborhood of Souq al-Hout have been wrecked by street fighting, shelling and air strikes. Much of the area was heavily mined.  Three years ago Libya split into two broad and shifting rival alliances based in the east and west of the country, loyal to competing governments, worsening the turmoil that followed a 2011 uprising that ousted veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Haftar's LNA has gained ground in Benghazi and other parts of eastern and southern Libya while rejecting a United Nations-backed government that arrived in the capital, Tripoli, in March 2016.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index , which had been closed for a public holiday on Monday, ended down 51.58 points, or 0.34 percent, at 15,130.61, its lowest since Dec. 6. Volumes were the lightest since May 29. The most influential movers on the index included major gold miners Barrick Gold Corp, which fell nearly 3 percent to C$20.02, and Goldcorp, which lost 3.1 percent to C$16.20. Gold got a bump from safe-haven buying after a North Korean missile launch. But the precious metal had slumped on Monday to a seven-week low after U.S. manufacturing data boosted expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again this year. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.7 percent, with First Majestic Silver Corp down 6.1 percent at C$10.10. The technology sector also fell 1.7 percent. Losses for the group were consistent with the  recent rotation to value from growth,  said Ben Jang, portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth Management. Investors have worried recently about high valuations attached to sectors such as technology, whose earnings are expected to grow faster than higher yielding stocks. Still, fixed-income like equities such as telecoms, utilities and real estate investment trusts  could get hurt  by higher domestic interest rates, Jang said. Those groups all lost ground after comments by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz supported the view that the central bank would hike rates as early as next week. Inflation in Canada should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018, Poloz told German newspaper Handelsblatt, adding that policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target.

Inflation in Canada should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018, Poloz told German newspaper Handelsblatt, adding that policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target.                   That was another chance that the bank didn't take to push back against the idea that they might be raising rates next week,  said Bipan Rai, director of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets, who expects two hikes this year.     Top Bank of Canada officials' recent assertions that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts did their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices appear to be paving the way for a tightening move as soon as July 12.                   The discount at which Canadian two-year bonds trade versus U.S. Treasuries have also narrowed sharply since late June.     The two-year            price fell 6.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.137 percent and the 10-year             declined 60 Canadian cents to yield 1.832 percent on Tuesday.     The two-year yield is at its highest since October 2014.     Chances of a rate hike next week are nearly 65 percent, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                At 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2930 to the greenback, or 77.34 U.S. cents, up 0.6 percent.     At one point the loonie touched C$1.2912, its strongest since Sept. 9.     CIBC's Rai said the currency could strengthen further in the near term, but would struggle to push beyond C$1.2830 unless the central bank convinces investors that a third hike is on the cards.     On Friday, the loonie was helped by data showing Canada's economy grew for a sixth consecutive month in April, while a central bank survey of business sentiment showed firms were feeling more upbeat.                  Speculators have cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a fifth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.  What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.  There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement,  he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.  The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.   We hope others will respond in a similar spirit. Qatar says it is ready to meet any  reasonable  demands.  But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty. Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible. Related CoverageArab intelligence chiefs meet in Cairo day before Qatar decision: MENAQatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said. The decision will have international ramifications. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects  still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere (LNG.A) exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbors. FILE PHOTO: People sit on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon/File PhotoThe Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end  in the coming hours  with the Qatari response to demands.  We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses,  he said.  We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures.  Iranian Question The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Slideshow (2 Images)Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.   Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co (8031.T) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,   said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell.  For Qatar, LNG is everything.

The Iraq Oil Ministry has also filed a claim against commodity trading house Vitol S.A. and subsidiaries including Mansel Ltd, the charterer of the ship, and affiliate Finaval SpA di Navigazione, the owner of the ship, for $32.5 million. Iraq claims the cargo was unlawfully misappropriated by the Kurdistan Regional Government and sold to Vitol to be loaded onto the  Neverland.  Vitol declined to comment. The court action, dated June 29, is the latest step in a long-running battle between the federal government in Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government over who has the right to export and market crude from the semi-autonomous region. The  Neverland  loaded in Ceyhan in Turkey, according to the court documents and Reuters shipping data last showed it off the coast of Nova Scotia in the western North Atlantic. It was not immediately clear where the cargo was headed. Last week Kurdistan's natural resources minister told Reuters its crude buyers had said they were not taking crude to the United States to avoid upsetting the central government in Baghdad. In its claim the Iraq Oil Ministry said it had advised Vitol before it bought the cargo that any purchase of crude from the Kurdistan Regional Government would violate the rights of the people of Iraq. Vitol went ahead and bought and loaded the crude anyway, and has refused demands to discharge the cargo into the control of the Iraq Oil Ministry, the court documents allege. The documents were signed and dated in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Iraq is asking the case be tried there.

Outside Greece, Europe has not seen such big state bailouts since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, raising political concerns  about the continued use of public funds to mop up losses at badly run banks despite the introduction of new EU rules designed to prevent this. In a statement on Tuesday, EU state aid regulators said Rome could inject the 5.4 billion euros aid into Monte dei Paschi after the bank agreed to a drastic overhaul, including the transfer of bad loans to a special vehicle and a salary cap for senior managers.  The bank's overall capital shortfall is 8.1 billion euros, an Italian Treasury official said, down from the 8.8 billion euros previously calculated by the European Central Bank. Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank, turned to the state for a bailout after failing to raise 5 billion euros on the market to shore up its capital. Barely a week ago Italy pledged up to 17 billion euros, mostly in guarantees, to prevent senior bondholders, depositors and staff from being hit by the winding up of two regional banks, Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. That deal also involved Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), acquiring the two banks' best assets for a token euro. The Italian government believes a profit can still be made from the bailouts.  I am confident state money will be recouped, perhaps at a premium,  finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Tuesday, referring to Monte dei Paschi. Viable Monte dei Paschi's five-year restructuring plan, due to be presented on Wednesday, will ensure the Tuscan bank's long-term viability, EU state aid regulators said on Tuesday. As part of the overhaul Monte Paschi will transfer 26.1 billion euros to a privately funded special vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by Italian bank rescue fund Atlante II. It will also change its business model to focus on retail customers, and small- and medium-sized companies. Finance minister Padoan, who expressed full confidence in the lender's top management, said bad debts at the bank would be eliminated by the first half of next year. Monte dei Paschi said late last year it would be seeking a  precautionary recapitalization  under EU state-aid rules after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed. According to Padoan, the state will take a 70 percent stake in the Tuscan bank while the lender's chairman said the state would exit in 2021, but added that nothing ruled out an earlier withdrawal.  This capital injection could only be approved after junior bondholders and shareholders have contributed to the costs of restructuring, in line with 'burden-sharing' requirements under EU state aid rules,  said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.  Besides the state capital injection, junior bondholders and shareholders will contribute 4.3 billion euros from the conversion of junior bonds into equity. At the same time Monte dei Paschi has earmarked 1.5 billion euros to compensate retail junior bondholders who are the victims of mis-selling, it added. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has been at the forefront of Italy's slow-moving banking crisis. It emerged as Europe's weakest lender in stress tests last July.

Outside Greece, Europe has not seen such big state bailouts since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, raising political concerns  about the continued use of public funds to mop up losses at badly run banks despite the introduction of new EU rules designed to prevent this. In a statement on Tuesday, EU state aid regulators said Rome could inject the 5.4 billion euros aid into Monte dei Paschi after the bank agreed to a drastic overhaul, including the transfer of bad loans to a special vehicle and a salary cap for senior managers.  The bank's overall capital shortfall is 8.1 billion euros, an Italian Treasury official said, down from the 8.8 billion euros previously calculated by the European Central Bank. Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank, turned to the state for a bailout after failing to raise 5 billion euros on the market to shore up its capital. Barely a week ago Italy pledged up to 17 billion euros, mostly in guarantees, to prevent senior bondholders, depositors and staff from being hit by the winding up of two regional banks, Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. That deal also involved Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), acquiring the two banks' best assets for a token euro. The Italian government believes a profit can still be made from the bailouts.  I am confident state money will be recouped, perhaps at a premium,  finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Tuesday, referring to Monte dei Paschi. Viable Monte dei Paschi's five-year restructuring plan, due to be presented on Wednesday, will ensure the Tuscan bank's long-term viability, EU state aid regulators said on Tuesday. As part of the overhaul Monte Paschi will transfer 26.1 billion euros to a privately funded special vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by Italian bank rescue fund Atlante II. It will also change its business model to focus on retail customers, and small- and medium-sized companies. Finance minister Padoan, who expressed full confidence in the lender's top management, said bad debts at the bank would be eliminated by the first half of next year. Monte dei Paschi said late last year it would be seeking a  precautionary recapitalization  under EU state-aid rules after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed. According to Padoan, the state will take a 70 percent stake in the Tuscan bank while the lender's chairman said the state would exit in 2021, but added that nothing ruled out an earlier withdrawal.  This capital injection could only be approved after junior bondholders and shareholders have contributed to the costs of restructuring, in line with 'burden-sharing' requirements under EU state aid rules,  said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.  Besides the state capital injection, junior bondholders and shareholders will contribute 4.3 billion euros from the conversion of junior bonds into equity. At the same time Monte dei Paschi has earmarked 1.5 billion euros to compensate retail junior bondholders who are the victims of mis-selling, it added. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has been at the forefront of Italy's slow-moving banking crisis. It emerged as Europe's weakest lender in stress tests last July.

The unusual story of the Afghan all-girl team of robotics students emerged as the United States grapples with the legality of President Donald Trump's order to temporarily ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries. Afghanistan itself is not on the list and Team Afghanistan's robot, unlike its creators, has been allowed entry to the United States. Asked by Reuters on Tuesday why the girls were banned, a U.S. State Department spokesperson cited regulations prohibiting the agency from discussing individual visa cases. So the six team members will watch the ball-sorting machine compete in Washington D.C. via video link during the July 16-18 event from their hometown of Herat, in western Afghanistan, according to the FIRST Global contest organizers.  We still don't know the reason why we were not granted visas, because other countries participating in the competition have been given visas,  said 14-year-old Fatemah Qaderyan, part of the team that made two journeys to the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul to apply for their papers.  No one knows about the future but ... we did our best and we hope that our robot could get a position along other robots from other countries,  Qaderyan said. Most of the female team members were either infants or not yet born at the time of the U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 that toppled the Taliban regime – whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned girls from school, women from working outside the home and all females from leaving home without a male relative. More than 15 years later, around 10,000 U.S. and allied international troops remain in Afghanistan to support an elected government in Kabul that constitutionally guarantees women's rights but is increasingly losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory. Members of Afghan robotics girls team which was denied entry into the United States for a competition, work on their robots in Herat province, Afghanistan July 4, 2017.Mohammad Shoib Clear Insult  Qaderyan's teammate from Herat, 17-year-old Lida Azizi, was less forgiving of the U.S. visa decision.  All of the countries can participate in the competitions, but we can't. So it's a clear insult for the people of Afghanistan,  Azizi said. FIRST Global's president, Joe Sestak, said in a post on the organization's Facebook page that he was  saddened  by the U.S. decision but the Afghan team would be able to connect with the competition via a live Skype video link.  That is how we must now honor our fellow teammates, those brave girls from Afghanistan,  he said. He added that the teams of 156 countries – including from Iran and Sudan, which are on Trump’s list of countries whose citizens are banned from entry – had received their visas.  The support of the U.S. State Department (including its embassies) has been simply nothing short of amazing,  Sestak said in the post, adding that one other team, from Gambia, had been also denied visas.  Also approved for visas was  Team Hope,  a group of Syrian refugees, he said. Syria is among the Muslim-majority countries named in Trump's executive order prohibiting all citizens from entry for 90 days. The other countries, apart from Iran, Syria and Sudan, are Libya, Somalia and Yemen. In a June 26 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order that had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity.

A Canadian citizen, Khadr was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 at age 15 after a firefight with U.S. soldiers. He pleaded guilty to killing a U.S. Army medic and became the youngest inmate held at the military prison in Cuba. Khadr later recanted and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated. In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Canada breached his rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him and sharing the results with the United States. The case proved divisive: defenders called Khadr a child soldier while the then-Conservative government dismissed calls to seek leniency, noting he had pleaded guilty to a serious crime.  Meet Canada's newest multi-millionaire – Omar Khadr,  said the Conservatives as they unveiled a protest petition. Tony Clement, the Conservative Party's public safety spokesman, said  it is one thing to acknowledge alleged mistreatment, but it is wrong to lavishly reward a convicted terrorist who murdered an allied soldier who had a wife and two children . FILE PHOTO: Omar Khadr leaves a news conference after being released on bail in Edmonton, Alberta, May 7, 2015. Khadr, a Canadian, was once the youngest prisoner held on terror charges at Guantanamo Bay.Todd Korol/File PhotoKhadr spent a decade in Guantanamo before being returned to Canada in 2012 to serve the rest of his sentence. He was released on bail in 2015 and lives in Edmonton, Alberta. The Canadian government and Khadr's lawyers agreed on the compensation deal, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity. Canada has reached a series of expensive settlements with citizens imprisoned abroad who alleged Ottawa was complicit in their mistreatment.  Khadr, 30, had sued Ottawa for C$20 million on grounds of violating his human rights. News of the settlement was broken  by the Globe and Mail newspaper. A spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale declined to comment. Khadr's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy was closed for the July Fourth holiday.  Khadr was taken to Afghanistan by his father, an al Qaeda member, who apprenticed the boy to a group of bomb makers. The father died in a battle with Pakistani forces in 2003.  It is the right decision in light of the callous and unlawful treatment meted out to Mr. Khadr with the complicity of Canadian officials,  said Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims.

The hard-hitting 25-year-old former quarter-finalist cracked down several deliveries near the 120 mph mark as she powered past Germany's Mona Barthel 7-5 6-2. Jack Sock, the 17th seed, followed suit in the men's singles and was joined in round two by John Isner, Jared Donaldson, Ryan Harrison and 19-year-old Frances Tiafoe who chalked up his maiden Wimbledon victory. Vandeweghe, working with Australian former men's champion Pat Cash, said her win was a special way to mark the day.  I had to make sure I had an American flag T-shirt, the only one that I brought,  the 24th seed told reporters.  I was talking about what's the most American thing we can do today to celebrate the fourth? Unfortunately, couldn't find any fireworks online or sparklers or anything like that.  I think it's for the patriotic bunch that are here, it's special for us.  Reduced Hopes Eight years ago on July 4 Serena Williams beat sister Venus to win Wimbledon and, with the 23-times grand slam champion absent on maternity leave, American hopes of a winner this year have been reduced. Vandeweghe, who also reached the fourth round last year, used her aggressive style to great effect when she reached the Australian Open semi-finals this year, losing to Venus. Her build-up to Wimbledon was marred by a split with coach Craig Kardon, but she has since recruited Cash who won the Wimbledon title 30 years ago.

Obviously, we know the history of American tennis and the accomplishments and achievements and legends we have had in this sport coming out of the U.S.,  Sock said after a 6-3 4-6 7-6(4) 6-3 defeat of Chilean youngster Christian Garin.  Trying to focus on doing our best and keep pushing each other to hopefully get that standard back to what the fans expect from us. But it's a rough sport.  Sock will be confident of at least matching his 2016 run as he plays Austrian qualifier Sebastian Ofner next. Isner, seeded 23, beat fellow American Taylor Fritz is straight sets but pride of place went to Tiafoe who recorded only his second victory in grand slam play, beating experienced Dutchman Robin Haase in four sets. German 10th seed Alexander Zverev is next for Tiafoe - one of eight American men through to the second round.

Timochenko, who in November signed a peace agreement with the government, suffers from heart problems and had surgery in Cuba while negotiating the accord.   Cuba will cover the costs of medical treatment and security, the high peace commissioner's office said. Colombia's government authorized his trip. Last week the leader oversaw the disarmament of his 7,000 or so Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels at a ceremony with President Juan Manuel Santos.  We'll return to continue giving the fight for peace and for the agreement to be fulfilled. Thank you all for your good vibes,  Timochenko said in a tweet. Timochenko, 59, on Sunday suffered an ischemic stroke, a cerebrovascular accident caused by a blockage that deprives part of the brain from receiving blood and oxygen. FARC, which was founded as a peasant rebellion in 1964, has fought more a dozen governments in a war that has killed more than 220,000 and displaced millions. A doctor who also trained in irregular warfare in Cuba and politics in Russia, Timochenko took over as head of the Marxist FARC in 2011 after troops killed the drug-funded group's former boss, Alfonso Cano.

Djokovic, a three times Wimbledon champion, had taken the first set 6-3 before Klizan called the trainer onto Centre Court to treat a leg injury.

Shares of Tencent, one of Asia's most valuable firms with a market value of HK$2.6 trillion ($333 billion), ended 4.1 percent down on Tuesday, its biggest one-day fall in 17 months, after it announced restrictions for some users of the world's top-grossing mobile game, responding to complaints that children were getting addicted. Regulatory control on such  social games  is imminently needed, the People's Daily said on its website on Tuesday, after calling the game  poison  on Monday, alluding to a similarly pronounced nickname in Chinese that players jokingly use to describe the addictive nature of the game.  Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Honour of Kings, a multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users - more than Pokemon Go at its peak. It is the world's top-grossing mobile game according to analysts, with estimates of its monthly revenue ranging from 1 billion to 2 billion yuan.   The state media attack comes amid a crackdown on content and entertainment from China's internet censors.  The state media commentary calling for tighter industry regulation is a cooling signal for gaming stocks that could cause short-term declines, but whether there would be revenue impact depends on what regulatory measures would follow,  said Connie Gu, analyst at BOCOM International Securities.  Gu estimates the game, with 200 million users, contributes around 7 percent to Tencent's total revenue. While Tencent's official website for the game says it is  for 16 and above , it does not ban younger users and the game is popular among teenagers. Tencent said it introduced the play time and spending curbs for minors and those under 12 effective from Tuesday out of social responsibility.  China Merchants Securities International analyst Richard Ko estimates the game accounts for around a third of Tencent's mobile gaming revenue - which grew to 12.9 billion yuan in the first quarter. Ko estimates that assuming 25 percent of its players are under 18, Tencent's play curb could cost around 5 percent of the game's 2017 revenue, or 0.5 percent of Tencent's total revenue which he estimates to be 224 billion yuan.

Senator Romero Jucá, the whip of Temer's support base in the Senate, told reporters in Brasilia that the government coalition will propose the passage of a fast-track motion later on Tuesday to facilitate passage of the bill. The labor reform bill, the first major overhaul of labor rules in seven decades, has already been approved by the lower house. Trade unions allege Temer's plan calls for more temporary work contracts and outsourcing, while weakening their power by eliminating mandatory union dues and other measures. Temer has heralded labor reform as one of his main initiatives to pull Brazil from its worst recession since the early 1900s. However, passage has fallen behind schedule after he was ensnared in a major corruption scandal last month. The bill is widely expected by officials and analysts to be approved by a simple majority in the Senate, despite efforts by opposition parties to obstruct the vote.

The 15,000-strong crowd drew a collective gasp as within the space of 70 minutes Martin Klizan and Alexandr Dolgopolov called it quits in their first round matches against Djokovic and Federer, respectively -- leaving the Centre Court schedule done and dusted by 4:50 p.m. local time. Since Klizan and Dolgopolov appeared to have carried  injuries into their matches, which meant they must have known they might not last the distance on Tuesday, many observers accused them of being selfish as they short-changed fans and denied fully-fit players a place in the draw.  There's got to be a rule for guys who come out clearly not giving or able to give 100 percent. It's no good for anyone,  tennis great John McEnroe said while commentating on the BBC.  There are guys waiting in there, the lucky loser will be looking ... and thinking he could have played on Centre Court at Wimbledon.  Before day two of the championships had even been completed, seven players had thrown in the towel. Australian Nick Kyrgios was the first to pull out on Monday after failing to recover from a hip injury he aggravated at London's Queen's Club two weeks ago. Denis Istomin and Viktor Troicki followed suit before Klizan, Dolgopolov, Janko Tipsarevic and Queen's Club champion Feliciano Lopez also quit.  Biggest Check For many of the fringe players on the tour, featuring in the first round of a grand slam allows them to pick up what could be their biggest pay-cheque of the year. With first-round Wimbledon losers banking 35,000 pounds  ($45,216.50) this year, some wondered if the sums of money at stake were the deciding factor on why unfit players turned up.  It's a lot of money. For some it's more, for some it's less,  said seven-times Wimbledon champion Federer.  The Swiss, whose first round workout lasted a mere 43 minutes before Dolgopolov retired while trailing 6-3 3-0 30-30, felt the grand slams should look into adopting a financial compensation system that is in place on the ATP Tour. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 4, 2017   Slovakia’s Martin Klizan reacts during his first round match against Serbia’s Novak Djokovic after sustaining an injuryMatthew Childs On the ATP level... if you can't play, you still get your prize money twice in the year. Maybe the grand slams should adopt some of that, then maybe we would eliminate half of the players (who turn up injured),  said Federer, the favorite to win a record eighth title.  A player should not go on court if he knows he could not finish. The question is, did they truly believe they were going to finish? If they did, I think it's okay that they walk on court. Otherwise, I feel they should give up the spot.      Favorite Tournament Kyrgios said he had gone against medical advice and chose to play as  it's my favorite tournament . Federer said Dolgopolov decided to cut his losses after he  felt too much pain on the serve . On each occasion, the trainer was called to aid the two players but the treatments offered -- be it massages or pain killers -- could not salvage the situation.  I'm sure the players that retired... this tournament has a special place in players' careers. In this sport, there's so much weight behind it and significance about it,  said Djokovic.  Federer added that players might come out in the hope that  miracles happen.  You never know if you hang around, you start drop-shotting the (other) guy, (he) twists his ankle, you move on.   Maybe a big cloud's coming in. We're here in Britain, so... You never know what the player's motives are.  Federer said the rate of dropouts would fall if the slams switched to best-of-three-sets rather than best-of-five as it would mean matches were more like  a sprint to the finish line  rather than being  a marathon  but the people he really felt sorry for on Tuesday were the fans.  There was a letdown for the crowd. They couldn't believe that it happened again. I feel for the crowd. They're there to watch good tennis, proper tennis.

Hedge funds and other money managers held short positions in the five major contracts on crude, gasoline and heating oil amounting to 510 million barrels on June 27, according to regulatory and exchange data. Fund managers have added 200 million barrels of extra short positions since the end of May and 377 million barrels since crude prices peaked in the middle of February (tmsnrt.rs/2tIamvF). Hedge funds were even more pessimistic than in January 2016, with more short positions than when oil prices were touching their cyclical lows below $30 per barrel. Overall, fund managers were running net short positions of 20 million barrels in gasoline and 32 million barrels in heating oil on June 27 (tmsnrt.rs/2sEiw3l and tmsnrt.rs/2sEoUHL). Funds still had a net long position of 357 million barrels in crude but it had been cut from 589 million barrels on May 30 and a record 951 million barrels on Feb. 21 (tmsnrt.rs/2uhe8Ju). Growing doubts about the effectiveness of OPEC’s production cuts, coupled with increases in crude output from Libya, Nigeria, Canada and the United States have prompted a wave of short-selling. And concerns about the health of gasoline demand and high level inventories in the United States have added to the bearishness within the hedge fund community. Fund managers have ramped up short positions in NYMEX WTI by 86 million barrels over the last four weeks, in the most aggressive short-selling cycle since the start of 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/2t8NQuy). But the sheer number of short sales left the market looking imbalanced and vulnerable to a short-covering rally (“Hedge funds hold near-record short positions in petroleum”, Reuters, June 27). Crude prices have now risen for seven consecutive trading sessions as the pace of short sales slows and some hedge fund managers have been emboldened to start adding long positions in anticipation of a rally. Hedge funds quietly added 3 million barrels of extra long positions in gasoline, 0.7 million in heating oil and 9 million in WTI in the week to June 27 (though this was offset by a continued reduction of 20 million in Brent). Fund managers are likely to have closed out at least some of their short positions as prices have risen consistently over the last week. The U.S. oil rig count fell slightly last week for the first time since early January which accelerated the short covering and provided a boost to oil prices at the end of the week. The critical question for the market is how many of those short positions have been closed out and how many more are still open. If many of the extra short positions have been closed, prices are likely to stabilize around current levels, but if most remain open, upward pressure is likely to continue.

But dry conditions lurk in the forecast as crops begin pollination and reproduction, the beginning stages of yield formation. Recent weather model runs suggest the first half of July will be drier than normal across the Corn Belt. This is not necessarily ideal, but the concern is mitigated by the fact that temperatures are unlikely to be excessively warm. Either way, the weather forecast is questionable enough to have corn market-watchers on edge, and the TR Crop Watch farmers will help decipher the impact of the weather on their pollinating crops in the weeks to come. TR Crop Watch has been following the progress of the same three corn fields and soybean fields in Minnesota and Illinois since the beginning of June. The producers - known as Farmers A, B and C – assign condition scores every week to each field, similar to the system used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ratings are: excellent – 5, good – 4, fair – 3, poor – 2, very poor – 1. They also give their best estimation of yield potential. The yield ratings are: yields well above average – 5, slightly above – 4, average – 3, slightly below – 2, well below average – 1. This week’s TR Crop Watch update arrives two days ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s crop progress report, which is scheduled for publication on Wednesday at 3 p.m. CDT. The normal Monday release was scrapped due to the Fourth of July holiday. Farmer a – East Central Illinois Farmer A corn, June 25 versus June 30: (tmsnrt.rs/2ui3Zwr) Farmer A soybeans, June 25 versus June 30: (tmsnrt.rs/2t9xlyo) Farmer A’s Champaign County, Illinois, corn and soybeans experienced excellent weather conditions last week as all of his fields received 1 inch (25 mm) of rain on Friday. This recent event has curbed A’s concerns for now as his crops head into pollination and reproduction. A’s corn reached 7 feet (2.1 m) in height as of July 2, an increase of 1 foot (0.3 m) on the week. This specific corn field is the best one that A has this year and represents one of the better fields in his area. Local farmers believe that chances for top-end yield have already faded based on the challenging weather early on. A’s soybeans are 18 inches (0.46 m) tall to begin July – a growth of 4 inches (0.1 m) on the week – and are very representative of the average soybean field in his area. A notes that hard-to-kill weeds are becoming a problem for local soybean farmers this year, and thin soybean stands are also a theme in the area. With the favorable weather of late, Farmer A maintains his corn and soybean condition rating of 4 for the week. He also leaves his yield outlook of 3 for both crops unchanged as of July 2. Farmer B – South Central Minnesota Farmer B corn, June 25 versus July 2: (tmsnrt.rs/2t9lBf3) Farmer B soybeans, June 25 versus July 2: (tmsnrt.rs/2sF53br) Farmer B was very pleased with last week’s weather, as his Freeborn County, Minnesota, crops received the warmer weather they have needed along with 1.5 inches (38 mm) of rain.  He maintains a condition rating of 5 and a yield score of 4 on both his corn and soybean fields as of July 2. The stage of growth on both crops is a bit behind the pace of the previous two, high-yielding years, which prevents B from assigning a 5 to yields at this time. B’s corn is now 48 inches (1.2 m) tall versus 30 inches (0.76 m) in the week prior, reflecting just how much of a difference the warmer weather can make. His corn is very representative of other fields in his area, and he says that local farmers are generally happy with the corn right now and consider it a typical crop for early July. The warm weather also added height to B’s soybeans, which stood 13 inches (0.33 m) tall on July 2 versus 7 inches (0.18 m) the week before. B’s bean field is among the best in the area and farmers are also pleased with soybean progress considering the date.  Now that it is July, Farmer B will want rain for his corn and soybeans on a weekly basis. He says corn is using up a lot of water now and at least 1 inch (25 mm) of rain per week would be ideal, but the weather models suggest that B’s neck of the woods could be dry through mid-July. Farmer C – Southeastern Illinois Farmer C corn, June 25 versus July 2: (tmsnrt.rs/2t9vhWZ) Farmer C soybeans, June 25 versus July 2: (tmsnrt.rs/2t9ok8o) Farmer C’s Crawford County, Illinois, crops have been in need of rain for more than a month now, and last week they finally got a nice drink. About 1.4 inches (36 mm) of rain fell over C’s corn and soybean fields, but given their moisture deficit entering this month, more will be needed very soon. C’s corn is now 7 feet (2.1 m) tall versus 6 feet (1.8 m) the week prior. Silks are starting to appear now and pollination is just around the corner. He is glad the weather forecasts lack extreme heat going forward into pollination but notes the crops have been stressed a lot already because of the dryness.  Despite the recent rain, June's taxing weather prompted Farmer C to maintain his corn yield rating of 2 and condition rating of 3 for the week. Last week’s rains were encouraging enough for C to raise his yield outlook on his soybeans to a 4 from a 3, and he has left his condition rating unchanged at 4. C’s soybeans are now 22 inches (0.56 m) tall from knee-high last week. He notes his beans may look a little better than other fields in the area because of his earlier planting date, but it is still far too early to tell how yields will turn out as rainfall – especially in August – will be critical.

As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on gold has jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously, with traders and buyers saying the move will likely force more transactions into the black market.  Three percent is too much. I preferred to buy without receipts. The jeweler did not have any problem,  said a middle-aged buyer, who declined to be identified after making purchases on Monday at the country's biggest bullion market, Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai. Smaller shops could be more inclined to sell without receipts, potentially hitting sales at big jewelers that keep to the rules, said Harshad Ajmera, the proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city Kolkata.    Just to save 1 percent, some customers were earlier buying gold without receipts. With the 3-percent GST, now many more will be tempted to make unofficial purchases from small jewelers,  Ajmera said. The tax hike could also encourage more smuggling into the world's second biggest gold consumer, which buys almost all its bullion abroad. Gold smuggling has been rife since India raised import duties on the metal to 10 percent in a series of hikes to August 2013, looking to curb demand to narrow a gaping current account deficit. The World Gold Council estimates smuggling networks imported up to 120 tonnes of gold into India in 2016.  The GST rate has increased the incentive to bring in smuggled gold. The government should reduce import duty and make smuggling unviable,  said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai. The country's legal imports typically stand at around 800 tonnes a year, with the metal used in everything from investment to religious donations and wedding gifts.  A lower import duty would increase legal imports and ultimately legal sales. Tax revenue would go up instead of going down,  said Daman Prakash Rathod, director at wholesaler MNC Bullion in the southern city of Chennai.

The international benchmark LCOc1 settled down 7 cents at $49.61 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were trading up 1 cent at $47.08 a barrel. Both contracts traded lower earlier in the session as many traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, while Brent also faced technical resistance as it approached $50, traders said. Despite this, the market's outlook has shifted somewhat. Late May and most of June were overwhelmingly bearish as U.S. output rose and doubts grew over the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold back enough production to tighten the market. But sentiment began to shift toward the end of June, when data showed a dip in U.S. oil output and a slight fall in drilling for new production. RIG-OL-USA-BHI C-OUT-T-EIA  The fact that prices have not come under any noticeable pressure of late points to a shift in sentiment,  Commerzbank said on Tuesday.   This may be related to the fact that most of the 'shaky hands' have withdrawn from the market by now,  the bank added.  Prices rose in recent days despite OPEC production hitting a 2017 high of 32.72 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, according to a Reuters survey. The group's efforts to rebalance the market have been undermined by rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from an output-cutting agreement. Libya is pumping around 1 million bpd of crude, a four-year high.    OPEC exports rose for a second month in a row in June to 25.92 million bpd, up 1.9 million bpd from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said, although it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year on year in 2018 .

Parliament passed the bill unanimously, the state-run Tanzania Information Services said. This followed two other laws passed on Monday giving the resource-rich East African nation the right to tear up and renegotiate contracts for natural resources like gas or minerals, and removing the right to international arbitration. The bills were introduced on Thursday and rapidly passed, despite pleas for more time from an association representing mining companies.  In any mining operations under a mining license or a special mining license, the government shall have not less than 16 (percent) non-dilutable free-carried interest shares in the capital of a mining company,  the text of the new law says. The government also left itself scope to further increase its stake in the companies.   In addition to the free carried interest shares, the government shall be entitled to acquire, in total, up to 50 percent of the shares of the mining company commensurate with the total tax expenditures incurred by the government in favor of the mining company.  There was no further explanation from the government, but industry sources said they believed the bill meant the government might take further shares in companies that it accused of owing taxes, in lieu of the money owed.  Government officials were not available for comment. President John Magufuli has accused large mining companies of evading taxes, charges they deny. At a public rally on Tuesday, he said Tanzania was fighting an economic war.  We couldn't wait to pass the laws because of the large scale theft taking place in the mining sector,  he said. Rising Royalties The new law also raises royalties from gold, copper, silver and platinum exports to six percent from four percent. It increases the royalty on uranium exports from five percent to six percent.  The law also allows the government to reject a company's valuation if it believed the price was too low. The government would be entitled to buy the consignment of minerals at the price quoted.   For the purposes of calculating the amount of royalties payable, the government shall be entitled to reject the valuation,  the text of the new law said.   Where the government rejects the valuation, it shall have the option to buy the minerals at the low value.   Tanzania's largest miner Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold, said on Tuesday that notices of arbitration were served on behalf of companies that own its Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines, which have been hit by an export ban.  The serving of the notices at this time is necessary to protect the Company,  Acacia said.

The international benchmark LCOc1 settled down 7 cents at $49.61 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were trading up 1 cent at $47.08 a barrel. Both contracts traded lower earlier in the session as many traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, while Brent also faced technical resistance as it approached $50, traders said. Despite this, the market's outlook has shifted somewhat. Late May and most of June were overwhelmingly bearish as U.S. output rose and doubts grew over the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold back enough production to tighten the market. But sentiment began to shift toward the end of June, when data showed a dip in U.S. oil output and a slight fall in drilling for new production. RIG-OL-USA-BHI C-OUT-T-EIA  The fact that prices have not come under any noticeable pressure of late points to a shift in sentiment,  Commerzbank said on Tuesday.   This may be related to the fact that most of the 'shaky hands' have withdrawn from the market by now,  the bank added.  Prices rose in recent days despite OPEC production hitting a 2017 high of 32.72 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, according to a Reuters survey. The group's efforts to rebalance the market have been undermined by rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from an output-cutting agreement. Libya is pumping around 1 million bpd of crude, a four-year high.    OPEC exports rose for a second month in a row in June to 25.92 million bpd, up 1.9 million bpd from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said, although it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year on year in 2018 .

Daniel Murphy continues to torment his former team, as he had four straight RBI hits as the Washington Nationals crushed the Mets 11-4 on Tuesday afternoon. Murphy tied a career high with five RBIs and is hitting better than .400 against the team that drafted him out of Jacksonville University in 2006.  I've seen it. He's an outstanding hitter,  said Collins, his former skipper. Murphy is now hitting .341 with 26 doubles and 60 RBIs this season for the Nationals.  The guy is good. That is all you can say. You have to make good pitches to him,  said Seth Lugo, the Mets starter on Tuesday. Murphy, as usual, deflected praise and gave credit to his teammates, including starting pitcher Joe Ross and right fielder Bryce Harper. Batting third and ahead of Murphy, Harper went 3-for-4 with three runs scored and two RBIs to raise his average to .324.  It was a great start for him -- working all quadrants of the zone,  Murphy said of Ross.  What can you say about Bryce?  National League East leading Washington (50-34) is 11 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Mets (38-45), who fell to 3-9 against the Nationals this season. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at NationalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchThe Mets starting lineup was without veteran outfielders Yoenis Cespedes (leg cramp) and Curtis Granderson (hip), who was used as a pinch hitter. But that might not have mattered since Washington had 14 hits and drew five walks.  We have to make better pitches,  Collins said.  They have a good lineup. They can do damage.  Ross (5-3) gave up just two runs on eight hits in seven innings with six strikeouts. The right-hander, who got off to a shaky start Tuesday, has given up just seven earned runs in his last four starts after allowing five runs on June 13 against the Atlanta Braves.  I had runners on in the first few innings,  Ross said.  We made a lot of great defensive plays. I have just been trying to throw the ball down in the zone.  Jose Reyes led off the game with a homer to give the Mets the early lead. The homer came on an 0-2 pitch and was the 25th leadoff homer in the career of Reyes. But the Nationals took a 2-1 lead in the third on two-out RBI singles by Harper and Murphy. The Mets tied the game at 2 with a solo homer in the fourth by Rene Rivera. Washington responded by scoring four runs in the fifth to grab a 6-2 advantage while getting five hits in a row. Wilmer Difo (two hits, three runs) led off with a single, went to third on a single by Harper and scored on an error as the ball got past Mets right fielder Jay Bruce.  He has made some adjustments in his swing, in his approach,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said of Difo. Murphy had a single off the glove of third baseman Wilmer Flores to score Harper. Adam Lind followed with a single and Ryan Raburn added a two-run double to score Murphy and Lind for a 6-2 edge. Murphy had a two-run single off reliever Josh Edgin in the sixth and Lind drove in a run with a groundout for a 9-2 lead. Harper drove in a run in the eighth with a single to make it 10-2. Harper has eight RBIs in his last 10 games and is hitting better than .400 during that stretch. Murphy then had an RBI double off Chase Bradford for an 11-2 lead. Bruce hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Oliver Perez to make it 11-4. Lugo (3-2) gave up 10 hits and six earned runs in five innings.  I left my cutter up a lot,  he said. Brandon Nimmo was a career-best 3-for-4 and T.J. Rivera was 2-for-4 for the Mets before he left the game after limping to first on a groundout in the seventh. But by then Ross, who gave up two solo homers, had set the tone by using an effective change up.  I feel a lot more comfortable throwing it,  he said. NOTES: Mets OF Yoenis Cespedes did not play after he sustained a cramp while trying to make a catch in the ninth inning Monday. Manager Terry Collins hopes he can start Wednesday ... Mets OF Curtis Granderson (hip) was a late scratch from the starting lineup and then was retired as a pinch-hitter in the sixth ...

Consumer prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index likely fell 0.17 percent in June, according to the median of 22 estimates that ranged between a drop of 0.26 percent and an increase of 0.13 percent. BRCPI=ECI The annual inflation rate probably slowed to 3.06 percent from 3.60 percent in May, according to the median of 21 estimates that ranged between 2.96 and 3.37 percent. Statistics agency IBGE will publish the June inflation rate on Friday at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT). Inflation has plunged from nearly 11 percent in early 2016, leaving the central bank comfortable to cut interest rates by 400 basis points since October in a bid to help the economy emerge from a two-year-long recession. The bank signaled last month that rising market uncertainty in the wake of a scandal implicating President Michel Temer would probably prompt the central bank to slow down the pace of interest rate cuts. However, with inflation falling more than expected, an increasing number of traders and economists have placed bets on another 100 basis-point cut at the bank's next meeting on July 26. BCBWATCH Lower fuel and electricity prices were the likely causes of last month's expected deflation rate, according to economists at Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA). The government targets inflation at 4.5 percent for this year and next, 4.25 percent for 2019 and 4.00 percent for 2020. The lower targets for the years ahead were the first reduction in the official goal in more than a decade.

Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies  From Here to Eternity  and  Planet of the Apes.

Iraqi commanders have predicted final victory in Mosul this week after a grinding eight-month assault on the once two-million-strong city pushed Islamic State into a rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters beside the Tigris river. In Raqqa, Islamic State's headquarters in northern Syria from where it plotted attacks around the world, U.S.-backed militia were fighting inside the historic Old City after coalition air strikes breached its walls in two places. Victory over the hardline militants in both cities would mark the effective end of the three-year-old caliphate, although a few towns and large rural areas of Iraq and Syria remain under their control. But their centers are a maze of narrow alleyways packed with civilians and planted with multiple explosive devices by the militants, who are also using drones and suicide bombings.  The presence of civilians has affected the troops' advance a lot,  said a commander in Mosul from the Rapid Response Division, an elite Interior Ministry unit, estimating there were 10,000 civilians, including some brought in as human shields. Iraqi commanders called in air strikes on targets just 50 meters away from them and fighting got close enough at one point for the militants to throw a hand grenade at the troops.  The directions from the commander-in-chief of the armed forces are to advance slowly to preserve civilians' lives and this is what we are doing,  the officer said on Iraqi state TV without being named. A member of the Emergency Response Division carries his weapon during the fight with the Islamic State militants in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 4, 2017.Ahmed JadallahMines and Drones  The U.S.-led international coalition supporting the Iraqi military and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighting Islamic State in Raqqa said it had been forced to bomb the Old City's ancient wall because the militants were controlling the existing breaches.  SDF fighters would have been channeled through these locations and were extremely vulnerable as they were targeted with vehicle-borne IEDs (car bombs) and indirect fire as well as direct fire from heavy machineguns, rocket-propelled grenades and snipers as they tried to breach the Old City,  it said. Slideshow (12 Images)The assault on Raqqa, which began last month, was going to plan, though Islamic State's use of motion sensor-triggered mines and drones that drop bombs had slowed down operations a little, an SDF spokesperson said by telephone. SDF fighters had seized an ancient palace, Qasr al-Banat, in the eastern part of the Old City, an SDF statement said. On Thursday, Iraqi forces retook Mosul's mediaeval Grand al-Nuri mosque from where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the caliphate, prompting Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to declare an end to what he called a  state of falsehood . Baghdadi is believed to be hiding near the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources and the number of Islamic State militants fighting in Mosul and Raqqa has dwindled from thousands to hundreds. Iraqi authorities are planning a week of nationwide celebrations to mark the end of the offensive and Abadi is expected to visit Mosul to formally declare victory.  Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Mosul and Raqqa, which have been devastated by the fighting, creating the  challenges of rebuilding and preventing revenge attacks on suspected Islamic State sympathizers that could sow the seeds of a new ultra-hardline movement.

Turkey's foreign ministry, whose relationship with Berlin has soured in the past year over disagreements on a range of political and security issues, said the matter was made graver by the failure of German police to intervene. A Reuters TV video of the installation showed a black car draped with a black-and-white banner printed with pictures of Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz. The banner was emblazoned with the phrase,  Do you want this car? Kill dictatorship.  Critics in Turkey and overseas accuse Erdogan of increasing authoritarianism, citing a purge of thousands of state officials and many arrests following a failed military coup last July. Erdogan says the actions are necessary to ensure stability following the putsch attempt that killed more than 240 people.

The siblings -- the first to both be seeded in the Wimbledon men's singles since Americans Gene and Sandy Mayer in 1982 -- eased into round two on Tuesday using vastly different methods. While 20-year-old 10th seed Alexander bludgeoned Evgeny Donskoy with his powerful baseline game, Mischa, nine years his senior and seeded 29, dispatched Australian Bernard Tomic with an old-school serve-and-volley masterclass.  I followed my serve in 99.9 percent of the time today,  Mischa said in an interview with Reuters.  I can only remember one second serve that I stayed back. I come in on every serve.  He said his Russian father Alexander, a former professional player, had taught him the skills of serve and volley -- a tactic only a handful of Tour players still employ.  When did I realize (I could serve and volley)? When I realized my baseline game wasn't good enough,  he said.  I had to come up with a Plan B.

It was a style that completely flummoxed world number one Andy Murray at this year's Australian Open when left-hander Zverev pulled off a massive fourth-round upset. That result reminded the tennis world that there were, in fact, two Zverevs in the highest echelons of the game after several injury-plagued years had seen Mischa, a top-50 player in 2009, slide outside the top 1,000. Low Point The low point came in 2014 when he needed surgery to his left wrist, but thanks to his brother's emergence it also represented something of a turning point too.  For four or five years I was not in my best shape,  Zverev, who claimed his first Wimbledon main draw victory for eight years on Tuesday, said.  A lot of injuries and you start not to be as motivated and not to train as hard as you should.  I remember when my wrist was in a cast, it was the low point. But a week after that Alex got to the semis in Hamburg as a 17-year-old. That moment gave me positive energy, positive emotions to come back and train hard and still believe.  With him next to me he was always like -- you can do it, you can be there, you're unbelievable, don't worry you're going to be top 100, top 50 again, believe in yourself.  There is the possibility that the Zverevs could meet in the quarter-final.  Our mum told us that, but I've not looked at the draw,  Mischa said.  There are a few hard matches left yet.  A major obstacle would be seven-times Wimbledon champion Roger Federer, who Mischa could play in the third round and who ended his run at the Australian Open. But he must first get past Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in the second round.  The brothers share a strong bond and enjoy playing doubles together, including in the Davis Cup, although they are living in separate houses at Wimbledon. Mischa said he was always willing to offer some advice to his younger sibling though.  Now it's the grass season there are a few things here and there that I can show him,  Mischa said.  He listens to people and doesn't listen to people! He's in his own little world most of the time and he has certain goals that he wants to achieve and he is so focused on that.

Turkey's foreign ministry, whose relationship with Berlin has soured in the past year over disagreements on a range of political and security issues, said the matter was made graver by the failure of German police to intervene. A Reuters TV video of the installation showed a black car draped with a black-and-white banner printed with pictures of Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz. The banner was emblazoned with the phrase,  Do you want this car? Kill dictatorship.  Critics in Turkey and overseas accuse Erdogan of increasing authoritarianism, citing a purge of thousands of state officials and many arrests following a failed military coup last July. Erdogan says the actions are necessary to ensure stability following the putsch attempt that killed more than 240 people. The Foreign Ministry statement said it expected German authorities to act against the display.  The expression on the banner ... makes a direct call to violence,  it said. The Turkish protest came a day after the German government urged Erdogan to respect its request that he not address Turks living in Germany when he attends this week's Hamburg summit of the world's 20 largest economies. Erdogan was infuriated by what he called  Nazi era tactics  when some local German authorities, citing security concerns, barred Turkish politicians from campaigning in Germany ahead of Turkey's April referendum on expanding the president's powers.

World champion Sagan was kicked out of the race after elbowing his British rival off balance in a hectic sprint in the fourth stage, the race jury saying the Slovak wilfully obstructed Cavendish some 100 meters from the line.  It is too harsh, I think , American LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily chat with Reuters.  Some riders hold on to a car on the Tour and they are not kicked out.  Overhead TV footage shows Sagan clearly elbowing Cavendish but LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990, noted that some of the action could not be seen.  There is a part of the overhead shot under a tree... You can't tell if Cav' tried to lean on him. However his (Sagan's) response was way too severe,  he said.  In a sprint, when you're in front you try to close the door a little but sprints are very dangerous.  Riders often reach 70 kph in a sprint and any change of line or contact can have dramatic consequences.  What Sagan did was wrong but was it intentional? Did he purposely send Cavendish into the barriers? I don't think so,  said LeMond.  I don't think Cav' would want him out. It's a loss for the Tour, Peter Sagan is not an angry person or a poor sportsman.  LeMond explained that Sagan, not being a pure sprinter, was bound to make errors.  He's an aggressive rider, but he's not a pure sprinter, he is trying to take wheels,  the American said, referring to the practice of jumping from wheel to wheel to benefit from the slipstream of the pure sprinters.

TIM has been at loggerheads with Rome over rolling out superfast internet in so-called non-economically viable areas for weeks, after the government alleged the telecoms firm had jeopardized state tenders in the same regions. In a statement TIM said it had acted in compliance with rules and would prove so at the appropriate time, adding it was confident its actions would turn out to be proper and correct.   The watchdog said it would look into whether TIM had tried to obstruct the process, including by changing its own investment plans in the areas and appealing against the tenders. By slowing down the tenders  TIM could obstruct the development of infrastructure competition and the entry of new rivals , the authority said in a statement.  The watchdog is also looking into whether TIM tried to pre-emptively capture clients in those areas, using anti-competitive commercial practices, locking them into long-term contracts and applying prices alternative players are unable to match.  TIM, a former state phone monopoly, had initially said it would not invest in areas where it could not guarantee a return on its investment, forcing Rome to step in to ensure it made good on its promise to connect all Italians to superfast internet and kick-start a stagnant economy.  But in March the phone group, whose main shareholder is French media giant Vivendi (VIV.PA), said it would be investing its own money in developing a network in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed and justified the investment. That decision came after TIM lost out in the first of the tenders to Open Fiber (OF), a broadband unit owned by power utility Enel (ENEI.MI) and state lender CDP.  The development of ultrafast internet is a top priority for the government, which last year drafted in Enel to help bridge the digital divide between Italy and the rest of Europe after claiming TIM was dragging its feet.  The two firms have since been embroiled in a race to roll out their networks across Italy, in a contest experts said could lead to a mutually damaging war where both lose money and infrastructure is duplicated.

The unusual story of the Afghan all-girl team of robotics students emerged as the United States grapples with the legality of President Donald Trump's order to temporarily ban travel from six Muslim-majority countries. Afghanistan itself is not on the list and Team Afghanistan's robot, unlike its creators, has been allowed entry to the United States. Asked by Reuters on Tuesday why the girls were banned, a U.S. State Department spokesperson cited regulations prohibiting the agency from discussing individual visa cases. So the six team members will watch the ball-sorting machine compete in Washington D.C. via video link during the July 16-18 event from their hometown of Herat, in western Afghanistan, according to the FIRST Global contest organizers.  We still don't know the reason why we were not granted visas, because other countries participating in the competition have been given visas,  said 14-year-old Fatemah Qaderyan, part of the team that made two journeys to the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul to apply for their papers.  No one knows about the future but ... we did our best and we hope that our robot could get a position along other robots from other countries,  Qaderyan said. Most of the female team members were either infants or not yet born at the time of the U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 that toppled the Taliban regime – whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned girls from school, women from working outside the home and all females from leaving home without a male relative. More than 15 years later, around 10,000 U.S. and allied international troops remain in Afghanistan to support an elected government in Kabul that constitutionally guarantees women's rights but is increasingly losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory. Members of Afghan robotics girls team which was denied entry into the United States for a competition, work on their robots in Herat province, Afghanistan July 4, 2017.Mohammad Shoib Clear Insult  Qaderyan's teammate from Herat, 17-year-old Lida Azizi, was less forgiving of the U.S. visa decision.  All of the countries can participate in the competitions, but we can't. So it's a clear insult for the people of Afghanistan,  Azizi said. FIRST Global's president, Joe Sestak, said in a post on the organization's Facebook page that he was  saddened  by the U.S. decision but the Afghan team would be able to connect with the competition via a live Skype video link.  That is how we must now honor our fellow teammates, those brave girls from Afghanistan,  he said. He added that the teams of 156 countries – including from Iran and Sudan, which are on Trump’s list of countries whose citizens are banned from entry – had received their visas.  The support of the U.S. State Department (including its embassies) has been simply nothing short of amazing,  Sestak said in the post, adding that one other team, from Gambia, had been also denied visas.  Also approved for visas was  Team Hope,  a group of Syrian refugees, he said. Syria is among the Muslim-majority countries named in Trump's executive order prohibiting all citizens from entry for 90 days. The other countries, apart from Iran, Syria and Sudan, are Libya, Somalia and Yemen. In a June 26 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order that had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity.

In 2017, the French people told us that they wanted how France once again finds itself: confident, courageous and conquering.  Judicial Reforms: * Constitutional reform to strengthen independence of magistrates * Five-year plan to simplify and re-organize justice system * Construction of 15,000 extra prison spaces  It is essential not to transform prisons into the breeding grounds of the violence of tomorrow, and it is essential because it is our dignity that is at stake.  Health:  Prevention will be the pivot of our national strategy in the autumn.   * Vaccinations for young children will become compulsory by next year. * Price of a packet of cigarettes will go up gradually to 10 euros, government will fight again illegal cigarette smuggling * Disability allowance to increase in 2018 Local Government:   We are proposing a local government pact to accompany the ecological transition and to accompany  the digital transition, notably to guarantee access to high-speed internet by 2022.   Military/Security   We will give the (military) the means to defend us.   We will fight terrorism with the great firmness.  * Five-year military program to be adopted in 2018 confirming that defense will make up 2 percent of GDP by 2015. * Will leave state of emergency by latest Nov. 1 and a new law will be put in place to strengthen anti-terrorism arsenal. Asylum/Immigration:  France has been incapable of meeting its legal and moral obligations.  * Average time to process asylum requests will fall from 14 months to 6 months. Education:  All the studies show that we train the very good students extremely well, but inequalities are being reinforced, and the average level of our students is not up to what our country should offer.  * Complete review of the baccalaureat by 2018, with a view to implementing a reform for 2021. French Social Model:  So that the system is more fair and transparent so that one euros worth of contributions, leads to the same rights for everybody.  * Draft law to be presented by Spring 2018 to reform professional training, opening up unemployment insurance to those who resign and independent workers.  * Review of the retirement system by end 2018.  Public Spending/Rising Public Debt:  We are dancing on a volcano that is rumbling louder and louder.   The French are hooked on public spending. Like all addictions it doesn't solve any of the problems it is meant to ease. And like all addictions it requires willing and courage to detox.  * Budget deficit to be below 3 pct of GDP in 2017 from 3.4 pct in 2016 * French tax burden to be cut by 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 5 years *Public spending to be cut by three percentage points of GDP over next 5 years * Social security budget to balanced by 2020 Making France an Attractive Business Venue:  Companies must want to set themselves up and develop on our soil rather than elsewhere.  * Corporate tax to be gradually cut to 25 pct from 33.3 pct by 2022 * Transformation of  CICE  company tax credit to permanent cut in payroll charges to take effect on Jan 1, 2019 * Exemption of non-housing wealth from special wealth tax to take effect in 2019 Brexit:  Conducting orderly negotiations over the United Kingdom's exit will be a pre-requisite for the future relationship's framework.  * Any talks with Britain over its future relationship with the European Union would come only after  orderly  talks over its exit from the bloc have been conducted Energy/Climate Change:  Those who, through selfishness or a lack of conscience, turn their backs on the Paris climate change agreement, show more than just a simple misunderstanding of the world that is coming.

The ostrich is without doubt a nice animal, but putting your head in the sand has never prepared a person to face the future.    * Will bring taxes on diesel in line with those on gasoline by the end of five-year mandate * No new hydrocarbons permits * Carbon tax efforts to be accelerated      Reporting by John Irish, Michel Rose, Ingrid Melander; Editing by Richard Lough and Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-politics-pm-highlights-idUSKBN19P1UH"},

New president Emmanuel Macron regards taming spending and reducing its budget deficit as key to winning the trust of European Union partner Germany and persuading Berlin to embark on reforms to shore up the bloc.  The French are hooked on public spending. Like all addictions it doesn't solve any of the problems it is meant to ease. And like all addictions it requires willpower and courage to detox,  Philippe told the National Assembly to applause.  Philippe said that for every 100 euros Germany raised in taxes it spent 98 euros, while France spent 125 euros for every 117 euros levied in taxes.  Who really believes this situation is sustainable?  The government and its program comfortably won a vote of  confidence. The lower house, dominated by Macron's Republic on the Move party, voted 370 in favor of the government with only 67 voting against - mostly far-left and far-right lawmakers. Some 129 people abstained, with a large number of conservatives from the Republicans party not opposing the government. In total, 566 lawmakers voted. Philippe's talk of austerity comes just as other major economies such as Germany, the United States and even Britain are signaling an easing of fiscal policy to underpin growth.

Philippe, a relatively unknown conservative before he was picked by Macron, said his objective was still to haul the deficit below the EU's cap this year and he would target cuts in spending by three percent of national income over five years. However, in a sign of how Macron and his government are having to re-adjust the timing of tax cuts after the extent of the budget overshoot was revealed, Philippe announced a year's delay to a key campaign promise.  He said the centrist government would convert the last Socialist government's flagship  CICE  tax credit for companies into a permanent reduction in payroll charges in 2019.  Reforms to exempt non-property related assets from France's wealth tax will also take effect in 2019, he said.

In a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of this week's G20 summit, Philippe said that people who turn their backs on the Paris climate change deal showed  more than just a simple misunderstanding of the world that is coming .   The ostrich is without doubt a nice animal, but putting your head in the sand has never prepared anyone for the future.  On Europe, Philippe stressed Macron's stance that any talks with Britain over its future relationship with the EU would only come after orderly negotiations over its exit from the bloc.  Conducting orderly negotiations over the United Kingdom's exit will be a prerequisite for the future relationship's framework,  Philippe said. Macron on Monday made clear his impatience to complete the reshaping of France's political landscape. He wants to reform institutions, including cuts to the number of parliamentarians and introducing a degree of proportional representation.

Ortega, the main challenger to Maduro from within the ruling socialist movement during three months of opposition protests, said she would not recognize legal proceedings against her by an  unconstitutional and illegitimate  Supreme Court. The internal fissure has emboldened anti-Maduro protesters, who have been staging near-daily demonstrations since April to demand early elections amid a devastating economic crisis that has millions struggling to eat properly.   We already know they're going to remove me today,  said Ortega in a speech at her office, slamming what she said was a  spurious  case designed to silence her.   They've frozen my bank account, they've frozen my assets, and they've banned me from leaving the country. It appears that defending the constitution constitutes a crime,  she said, waving a small blue book of the charter written under Maduro's predecessor and mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, in 1999. The Supreme Court said, however, that it would issue a decision within five days on the charge brought by socialist lawmaker Pedro Carreno of  grave offense  against Ortega. Officials have leveled a plethora of accusations against the a 59-year-old lawyer, from  insanity  and encouraging  terrorists  to misusing a confiscated plane.  She has attacked the democratic institutions of the country,  Carreno told the Supreme Court hearing. In recent weeks, Ortega has accused security forces of excessive violence, opposed pro-Maduro decisions by the Supreme Court and National Election Council, and said the president's plan for a new congress threatens democracy. Speaking at her office in Caracas to applauding staff, Ortega said the case against her was rife with procedural errors and signs of collusion between the Supreme Court and the ruling party. She wryly remarked that the case was being handled with unusual speediness by Venezuela's infamously slow legal system.  Earlier on Tuesday, the court's constitutional chamber said her designation of a vice prosecutor was  absolutely null  and instead named its own vice prosecutor.  Venezuela's chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz makes declarations during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela, July 4, 2017.Carlos Garcia RawlinsThe court's appointee, Katherine Haringhton, was one of seven officials sanctioned by the United States in 2015 for alleged corruption and rights abuses. Ortega condemned the parallel appointment as illegitimate. And in a swipe at first lady Cilia Flores, Ortega also mentioned the  narco-nephews  in her speech, an allusion to two relatives of Maduro's wife found guilty in the United States of trying to carry out a multimillion-dollar drug deal.  Zero Hour   Protesters across the oil-rich South American nation of 30 million set up road blockades  against the dictatorship  on Tuesday afternoon. Some played dominoes and football in the streets, while others chanted slogans, waved banners saying  No More Dictatorship  and stood under the sun.  Slideshow (4 Images)The opposition wants to ramp up pressure ahead of Maduro's planned vote on July 30 to elect members of a new, controversial legislative superbody with powers to rewrite the constitution.  Maduro, a 54-year-old former union leader, says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela after the deaths of 90 people in and around anti-government unrest since April. His opponents counter it is a ruse designed to avoid free and fair elections the Socialist Party would lose, and possibly consolidate one-party rule in the mold of communist ally Cuba.  Warning that Venezuela is approaching  zero hour,  lawmakers on Monday announced that the opposition would hold its own referendum on July 16 to let Venezuelans have their say on Maduro's plan and their alternative push for an election to replace him.   I'm blocking the road for a better future. We're doing this to stop the Constituent (Assembly) election,  said lawyer Ritza Quintero, 32, protesting with a banner.  Even if we don't stop it, we're not going to recognize it.  Opposition protesters also want solutions to the crushing economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and independence for the opposition-led National Assembly. Maduro, a former foreign minister who was narrowly elected in 2013 after Chavez's death from cancer, says protesting opponents are seeking a coup with U.S. support.  Many are seeking ... little 'Rambos' in the armed forces, but you're not going to find them,  Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said in a video published on Monday, alluding to speculation of a military coup.

TIM has been at loggerheads with Rome over rolling out superfast internet in so-called non-economically viable areas for weeks, after the government alleged the telecoms firm had jeopardized state tenders in the same regions. In a statement TIM said it had acted in compliance with rules and would prove so at the appropriate time, adding it was confident its actions would turn out to be proper and correct.   The watchdog said it would look into whether TIM had tried to obstruct the process, including by changing its own investment plans in the areas and appealing against the tenders. By slowing down the tenders  TIM could obstruct the development of infrastructure competition and the entry of new rivals , the authority said in a statement.  The watchdog is also looking into whether TIM tried to pre-emptively capture clients in those areas, using anti-competitive commercial practices, locking them into long-term contracts and applying prices alternative players are unable to match.  TIM, a former state phone monopoly, had initially said it would not invest in areas where it could not guarantee a return on its investment, forcing Rome to step in to ensure it made good on its promise to connect all Italians to superfast internet and kick-start a stagnant economy.  But in March the phone group, whose main shareholder is French media giant Vivendi (VIV.PA), said it would be investing its own money in developing a network in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed and justified the investment. That decision came after TIM lost out in the first of the tenders to Open Fiber (OF), a broadband unit owned by power utility Enel (ENEI.MI) and state lender CDP.  The development of ultrafast internet is a top priority for the government, which last year drafted in Enel to help bridge the digital divide between Italy and the rest of Europe after claiming TIM was dragging its feet.  The two firms have since been embroiled in a race to roll out their networks across Italy, in a contest experts said could lead to a mutually damaging war where both lose money and infrastructure is duplicated.

Researchers examined data from 2011-2015 on 20,519 emergency room visits for facial fractures associated with recreational activities among adults 55 and older. During that time, the annual incidence of facial fractures rose 45 percent, from 3,174 in 2011 to 4,612 in 2015.  “The rate of facial fractures from recreational activities in the 55 and older population rose quite significantly over a relatively short period of time,” said study co-author Dr. Peter Svider of Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan.  “Part of it likely has to do with our aging population, in which people are living longer and living healthier lives longer,” Svider said by email.  As the U.S. population ages, doctors have encouraged aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening exercises to help maintain mobility, flexibility and cognitive ability.  People treated for facial fractures in the current study were 67 years old, on average. Roughly 20 percent were 75 or older, researchers report in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery.  The most common causes of facial fractures were cycling, team sports like baseball and softball, and activities such as hiking, fishing or camping and gardening. Walking and jogging also caused a small proportion of injuries.  Most facial fractures were to the nose. The next most common site was the eye socket.  Men and women injured themselves differently. About 36 percent of men sustained facial fractures from cycling, compared with 15 percent of women, for example. Gardening, however, accounted for 16 percent of facial fractures among women and just 6 percent among men.  The study only captured injuries treated in emergency departments, and not cases when people went to urgent care clinics or other places, the authors note.  The results are also difficult to interpret because researchers didn’t account for how much time people spent on various recreational activities or how often they did these things, both of which are typically included in calculating injury rates in sports, said Jean-Michel Brismee, a physical therapy researcher at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock.  Even so, the findings highlight a trade-off in encouraging older adults to be more active, Brismee, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “We advise people to participate in recreational activities,” Brismee said. “If you do, you will decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attack and improve your overall health profile, but you will increase the risk of injuries including facial injuries from falls.” Common sense can help make injuries less likely.  “Wear your helmet when you ride the bicycle, wear laced shoes when you walk the dog or garden, but for sure keep bicycling, walking the dog and gardening if you feel you are up to it,” Brismee said. “People should not just stop one activity and do nothing, otherwise their health will decline faster!” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tJXF3x JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery, online June 15, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-face-injury-idUSKBN19P2B0"},

The head of Ukraine's Cyber Police, Serhiy Demedyuk, told Reuters the servers of M.E.Doc - Ukraine's most popular accounting software - had been seized as part of an investigation into the attack.  Though they are still trying to establish who was behind last week's attack, Ukrainian intelligence officials and security firms have said some of the initial infections were spread via a malicious update issued by M.E.Doc, charges the company's owners deny. The owners were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. Premium Service, which says it is an official dealer of M.E.Doc's software, wrote a post on M.E.Doc's Facebook page saying masked men were searching M.E.Doc's offices and that the software firm's servers and services were down.  Premium Service could not be reached for further comment. Cyber Police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko said investigative actions were continuing at M.E.Doc's offices, adding that further comment would be made on Wednesday. The police move came after cyber security investigators unearthed further evidence on Tuesday that the attack had been planned months in advance by highly-skilled hackers, who they said had inserted a vulnerability into the M.E.Doc progamme. Ukraine also took steps on Tuesday to extend its state tax deadline by one month to help businesses hit by the malware assault. Researchers at Slovakian security software firm ESET said they had found a  backdoor  written into some of M.E.Doc's software updates, likely with access to the company's source code, which allowed hackers to enter companies' systems undetected.  Very Stealthy and Cunning   We identified a very stealthy and cunning backdoor that was injected by attackers into one of M.E.Doc's legitimate modules,  ESET senior malware researcher Anton Cherepanov said in a technical note.  It seems very unlikely that attackers could do this without access to M.E.Doc's source code.   This was a thoroughly well-planned and well-executed operation,  he said.      Ukrainian Cyber Police Chief Serhiy Demedyuk speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine June 23, 2017. Picture taken June 23, 2017.Valentyn OgirenkoESET said at least three M.E.Doc updates had been issued with the  backdoor vulnerability , and the first one was sent to clients on April 14, more than two months before the attack. ESET said the hackers likely had access to M.E.Doc's source code since the beginning of the year, and the detailed preparation before the attack was testament to the advanced nature of their operation. Oleg Derevianko, board chairman at Ukrainian cyber security firm ISSP, said an update issued by M.E.Doc in April delivered a virus to the company's clients which instructed computers to download 350 megabytes of data from an unknown source on the internet. The virus then exported 35 megabytes of company data to the hackers, he told Reuters in an interview at his office in Kiev. Slideshow (2 Images) With this 35 megabytes you can exfiltrate anything - emails from all of the banks, user accounts, passwords, anything.   Little known outside Ukrainian accounting circles, M.E.Doc is used by around 80 percent of companies in Ukraine. The software allows its 400,000 clients to send and collaborate on financial documents between internal departments, as well as file them with the Ukrainian state tax service. Ukraine's government said on Tuesday it would submit a draft law to parliament for the country's tax deadline to be extended to July 15, and waive fines for companies who missed the previous June 13 cutoff because of the attack.  We had program failures in connection to the cyber attack, which meant that businesses were unable to submit account reports on time,  Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman told a cabinet meeting.  Separately, Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said it had discussed cyber defense with NATO officials and had received equipment from the alliance to better combat future cyber attacks. Ukraine is not in NATO but is seeking closer ties. On Saturday Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian security services of being behind the attack, and cyber security researchers linked it to a suspected Russian group who attacked the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016. A Kremlin spokesman dismissed charges of Russian involvement as  unfounded blanket accusations .      Derevianko said the hacker's activity in April and reported access to M.E.Doc's source code showed Ukraine's computer networks had already been compromised and that the intruders were still operating inside them.  It definitely tells us about the advanced capabilities of the adversaries,  he said.  I don't think any additional evidence is needed to attribute this to a nation-state attack.

Turkey's foreign ministry, whose relationship with Berlin has soured in the past year over disagreements on a range of political and security issues, said the matter was made graver by the failure of German police to intervene. A Reuters TV video of the installation showed a black car draped with a black-and-white banner printed with pictures of Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz. The banner was emblazoned with the phrase  Do you want this car? Kill dictatorship . Critics in Turkey and overseas accuse Erdogan of authoritarian government, citing a purge of thousands of state officials and many arrests following a failed coup last July. Erdogan says the actions are necessary to ensure stability following the putsch attempt that killed more than 240 people. The foreign ministry statement said it expected German authorities to act against the display.  The expression on the banner...makes a direct call to violence.  The Turkish protest came a day after the German government urged Erdogan to respect its request that he not address Turks living in Germany when he attends this week's Hamburg summit of the world's 20 largest economies.

New president Emmanuel Macron regards taming spending and reducing its budget deficit as key to winning the trust of European Union partner Germany and persuading Berlin to embark on reforms to shore up the bloc.  The French are hooked on public spending. Like all addictions it doesn't solve any of the problems it is meant to ease. And like all addictions it requires willpower and courage to detox,  Philippe told the National Assembly to applause.  Philippe said that for every 100 euros Germany raised in taxes it spent 98 euros, while France spent 125 euros for every 117 euros levied in taxes.  Who really believes this situation is sustainable?  The government and its program comfortably won a vote of  confidence. The lower house, dominated by Macron's Republic on the Move party, voted 370 in favor of the government with only 67 voting against - mostly far-left and far-right lawmakers. Some 129 people abstained, with a large number of conservatives from the Republicans party not opposing the government. In total, 566 lawmakers voted. Philippe's talk of austerity comes just as other major economies such as Germany, the United States and even Britain are signaling an easing of fiscal policy to underpin growth.  Related CoverageHighlights: French Prime Minister Philippe's key comments to lawmakersFrench PM: progress in Brexit talks are pre-requisite to future EU-UK dealsBut last week France's independent auditor revealed a more than 8 billion euro funding shortfall in this year's budget, forecasting a deficit once again above the EU cap of 3 percent of national income.  Philippe, a relatively unknown conservative before he was picked by Macron, said his objective was still to haul the deficit below the EU's cap this year and he would target cuts in spending by three percent of national income over five years. However, in a sign of how Macron and his government are having to re-adjust the timing of tax cuts after the extent of the budget overshoot was revealed, Philippe announced a year's delay to a key campaign promise.  He said the centrist government would convert the last Socialist government's flagship  CICE  tax credit for companies into a permanent reduction in payroll charges in 2019.  Reforms to exempt non-property related assets from France's wealth tax will also take effect in 2019, he said.

Mr Macron ... won't kid anyone that he wasn't responsible too,  said Christian Jacob, head of conservative party The Republicans in parliament. Slideshow (6 Images)Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the far-left party France Unbowed, and far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen accused Philippe of ignoring the anger of voters with measures they said would hurt their spending power.  You're setting off fireworks in a powder keg,  Melenchon said.  We didn't elect (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.  Philippe acknowledged that a record high abstention rate in June's parliamentary election meant his government would have to tread carefully with its social and economic reform agenda, but that France could not ignore its problems.  No one takes this majority as a blank cheque,  the prime minister said in a more than hour-long speech that ranged from climate change to Britain's planned departure from the EU and was peppered with applause. In a dig at U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of this week's G20 summit, Philippe said that people who turn their backs on the Paris climate change deal showed  more than just a simple misunderstanding of the world that is coming .   The ostrich is without doubt a nice animal, but putting your head in the sand has never prepared anyone for the future.  On Europe, Philippe stressed Macron's stance that any talks with Britain over its future relationship with the EU would only come after orderly negotiations over its exit from the bloc.  Conducting orderly negotiations over the United Kingdom's exit will be a prerequisite for the future relationship's framework,  Philippe said. Macron on Monday made clear his impatience to complete the reshaping of France's political landscape. He wants to reform institutions, including cuts to the number of parliamentarians and introducing a degree of proportional representation.

The $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion) hedge fund firm will move European trading operations to New York, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter, becoming the second U.S. fund firm to do so this year after Goldman Sachs Investment Partners. The reason for Saba Capital's move was not clear although it comes at a time of uncertainty for fund firms based in Britain as talks begin on the country's exit from the European Union. It is also not clear whether the three individuals at the London office currently registered with the British regulator  will relocate to the U.S. office or find new jobs. Saba founder Boaz Weinstein made his name from the bet against JPMorgan, linked to corporate default rates. That helped assets at the firm - housed in New York's art deco Chrysler Building - peak in 2012 at $6 billion. A subsequent period of underperformance saw a number of investors pull their money, only for Saba to bounce back and attract fresh capital with a market-beating 3 percent gain in 2015 and returns of 22 percent in 2016, one of the sources said. The source also said the firm's performance was flat in the in the first four months of this year.

According to one of the people, the heirs of Teuto founder Walterci Melo will pay Pfizer 1 real ($0.30) for the stake acquired by the U.S. pharmaceutical company seven years ago for $240 million. The other person said the price tag for the stake was  small enough  for the Melos to avoid spending their cash substantially. In a statement, Pfizer confirmed the transfer  after careful consideration,  but said the terms of the deal were confidential. In a separate statement, the Melos confirmed the deal, without elaborating. Pfizer's exit comes as Teuto's management is negotiating the refinancing of 600 million reais in loans, two of the people said. The people did not comment on Teuto's ongoing refinancing. The sources requested anonymity because terms of the deal remain private. The situation underscores challenges facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where a weaker currency has lifted raw material costs and the harshest recession on record has slowed sales. It puts an end to a year-long process that produced no firm bidders despite initial interest from private-equity and several pharmaceutical firms. Backpedaling Pfizer backpedaled on previous plans to exit the generic drugs segment late last year. Still, performance of the business in Brazil, the world's No. 3 market for generics, has been mixed. Rivals including France's Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) have recently dealt with excess inventory at their local units. The recession has put the brakes on the sale of generic medicines, which expanded by 12 percent last year, compared with 15 percent growth two years ago. Pfizer's Teuto decision was reported earlier in the day by O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. Both the Melos, who owned 60 percent of Teuto, and Pfizer had hired the investment-banking units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Grupo BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11.SA) to find a buyer. The failure to sell the company to a third party rekindled a dispute between both partners over the venture, the sources added.  The rift stems from an option held by Pfizer to buy out the family between 2014 and 2016. The Melo family tried unsuccessfully to force Pfizer into exercising the option, the people said.

Michael Saunders told the Guardian newspaper that households should prepare for higher rates at some point and there was no sense that they had to stay on hold due to uncertainty around Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union in 2019.  I think households should prepare for interest rates to go higher at some point. But if rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling,  Saunders said in an interview. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 5-3 last month to keep rates on hold with supporters of a hike, who included Saunders, saying investment and exports would make up for the hit to domestic consumption that has been caused by rising inflation and weak wage growth. One of the three other dissenters who voted for a hike has since left the committee, further clouding the possibility of a vote for a rate increase in August or later this year. Last week, Governor Mark Carney said a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity and the BoE would debate when to do so  in the coming months . Other policymakers have stressed the need for patience, including Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe. On Tuesday, external MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe repeated his warning that a premature rate hike would be more costly than a late one. By contrast, Saunders said the BoE could be caught out if it fails to act quickly enough.  The risk that you run with maximum stimulus is that the jobless rate keeps falling, then at some point, if pay growth picks up, you have to reverse course very sharply,  he said.  It would then be much harder for tightening to be limited and gradual. You'd be having to play catch-up.  Saunders also said companies were finding it harder to hire staff from overseas, which could push up wage growth - something that has disappointed badly against the BoE's forecasts of late.   There has been this extra pool of labor which firms can call on and most of the rise in employment, the overwhelming part of the rise in employment of the last five years, has been from people born outside the UK,  he said.  It's clear from talking to firms that it's getting harder to persuade people to come to the UK.

The BoE, which can force curbs on lending, said last week it had spotted weaknesses in the way firms have been ramping up offers of credit to consumers who are the main driver of Britain's economy. Consumer borrowing is growing at more than 10 percent a year, while the household savings rate has hit an all-time low, raising concerns that some Britons are overstretching and could struggle to make repayments if interest rates rise.  The BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) did not set out any new rules on Tuesday, but its move was the first time it has ordered firms to apply consumer credit rules more conservatively and think harder about lending assumptions. It is also making company boards directly responsible for acting on its recommendations.  The BoE has previously announced measures to tighten standards in mortgage lending. The PRA requested evidence from providers of consumer credit, such as credit cards and personal loans, of how they will ensure they are not taking too much risk after years of low interest rates. Related CoverageBoE's Saunders tells UK households: prepare for higher rates - GuardianSome interest rate-setters at the BoE want to raise borrowing costs to control Britain's fast-rising inflation rate, suggesting a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching more quickly than had been expected until recently. Lenders will have until September to respond to the PRA and could then be asked to fix any specific areas of weakness. As well as any follow-up action by the PRA, the BoE could introduce sector-wide measures. Incentive Rule Separately on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's lead regulator for smaller consumer credit providers, proposed a new rule to stop incentives from encouraging staff at lending firms to loosen standards for granting credit.  We expect firms to understand the effects their staff incentives might be having,  said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA. Virgin Money (VM.L) said in April it wants to grow its credit card balances to 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) this year, up from 2.65 billion pounds at the end of March. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, said on Tuesday the bank would continue to prioritize asset quality over balance growth in its credit card business. Credit Card, Motor Lending The PRA said it did not believe that growth in lending had been driven primarily by significantly lowering credit rules or scoring. But the growth plans of lenders might only be achievable with some loosening of underwriting standards. Lenders seemed to be assuming Britain's economy will remain healthy and low arrears rates will continue, it said. The PRA cited credit card firms offering long-term zero percent offers and providers of motor finance that rely on generous assumptions about the future value of used vehicles. Lenders will have to show how they are protecting themselves against risk, including in their credit-scoring, at a time when many borrowers have not been put to the test of higher rates. Tuesday's statement is the third leg of the PRA's response to concerns about consumer credit. Last week, the BoE said banks would have to start building a supplementary buffer of capital to ensure they can absorb any losses from defaults in credit. Also last week, the BoE brought forward to September from November the assessment of stressed losses in consumer credit lending in this year's annual  stress test  of top banks.

According to one of the people, the heirs of Teuto founder Walterci Melo will pay Pfizer 1 real ($0.30) for the stake acquired by the U.S. pharmaceutical company seven years ago for $240 million. The other person said the price tag for the stake was  small enough  for the Melos to avoid spending their cash substantially. In a statement, Pfizer confirmed the transfer  after careful consideration,  but said the terms of the deal were confidential. In a separate statement, the Melos confirmed the deal, without elaborating. Pfizer's exit comes as Teuto's management is negotiating the refinancing of 600 million reais in loans, two of the people said. The people did not comment on Teuto's ongoing refinancing. The sources requested anonymity because terms of the deal remain private. The situation underscores challenges facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where a weaker currency has lifted raw material costs and the harshest recession on record has slowed sales. It puts an end to a year-long process that produced no firm bidders despite initial interest from private-equity and several pharmaceutical firms. Backpedaling Pfizer backpedaled on previous plans to exit the generic drugs segment late last year. Still, performance of the business in Brazil, the world's No. 3 market for generics, has been mixed. Rivals including France's Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) have recently dealt with excess inventory at their local units. The recession has put the brakes on the sale of generic medicines, which expanded by 12 percent last year, compared with 15 percent growth two years ago. Pfizer's Teuto decision was reported earlier in the day by O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. Both the Melos, who owned 60 percent of Teuto, and Pfizer had hired the investment-banking units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Grupo BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11.SA) to find a buyer. The failure to sell the company to a third party rekindled a dispute between both partners over the venture, the sources added.  The rift stems from an option held by Pfizer to buy out the family between 2014 and 2016. The Melo family tried unsuccessfully to force Pfizer into exercising the option, the people said.

The European Commission announced 35 million euros ($40 million) in extra cash for Rome in response to Italian demands that its neighbors share more of the burden of handling thousands of people coming by boat every week. It also set out a list of other measures for EU ministers to discuss on Thursday. Among the proposals was that Italy draft a code of conduct for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) running rescue services off Libya. Frans Timmermans, the Commission's deputy head, told reporters after the commissioners' weekly meeting, that this was in part because their activities might be a  pull factor  -- encouraging people to risk their lives in flimsy dinghies in the hope of being picked up and then ferried over to Italy. The Commission plan calls for beefing up Libya's coastal rescue services -- something Europeans hope may curb the number of people picked up close to shore by international charities. Despite criticism of abuses by coastguards employed by Libya's shaky, U.N.-backed government, European officials argue that better local rescue services would mean more migrants being taken back to Libya or perhaps to neighboring Tunisia or Egypt.  Abusive Conditions  Human rights groups have been critical of EU governments, noting a jump in the death rate and more than 2,000 drownings so far this year off Libya; many want Europe to give safe passage to refugees, though some governments fear this would boost their anti-immigration opponents.

Santander's comments were included in a document sent to investors in connection with a 7 billion-euro ($7.94 billion) rights issue flagged in June when it bought Popular. The share issue was launched on Monday. The warning marks a shift in Santander's stance on the deal, which has been broadly positive until now. Spain's largest bank said legal claims over a Popular rights issue last year and its rescue last month, as well as risks attached to a soured 30 billion euro real estate portfolio, could harm its earnings.  An estimate of the legal claims shows they could affect the acquisition of Popular, including possible compensation payments that could have a significant adverse effect on the results and financial position of the Santander Group,  the bank said. On Monday, Santander said it expected a profit of 3.6 billion euros for the first half of 2017. Santander said there was an  indeterminate  number of legal claims related to the takeover of Popular, which it bought in early June for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse.  A banking source with knowledge of the deal said the total claims could reach 2 billion euros. Santander also said that because the deal was done quickly it had had limited access and a reduced period of time to analyze Popular's books. As a result, Santander said it could have overestimated the benefits of the deal, which it calculated then at close to 500 million euros per year from 2020. Keep the Clients To make the deal a success, Santander said the key would be to retain Popular's more than 4 million clients.  It's going to be an integration that is going to be done by putting the client above all other considerations,  Santander's chief financial officer, Jose Garcia Cantera, told Reuters in an interview last month.  What is important is that it makes strategic and financial sense, and it fits in with our public objectives to have a return above the cost of capital,  he said. Santander said it now holds a 25 percent share in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending in Spain after absorbing Popular's SME business. The SME sector offers higher returns for shorter loan periods in contrast to the more sluggish mortgage market.  A Santander statement in June said that Popular's market share of the SME sector was not the 17.7 percent publicly stated by Popular at the end of March but 13.8 percent, as a result of inaccuracies in Popular's accounting and client flight. Santander also said on Tuesday it did not yet know the scope of Popular's property loan troubles and it still could find more deteriorated assets, unknown risks and hidden debts, than it had initially expected. Popular's non-performing loan ratio had reached 20 percent from around 15 percent at the end of March, Santander said on Monday. As part of the transaction, Santander set aside around 8 billion euros to cover Popular's non-performing assets, which are the highest among Spanish banks.

Germany is concerned that the U.S. administration's push to fix the causes of U.S. trade deficits and to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules could hurt its exporters.  We live in a world where a trade war cannot be ruled out,  said Volker Treier, who heads DIHK's foreign trade unit.  Divisions on trade are expected to cloud the G20 summit that Chancellor Angela Merkel will host in Hamburg this week, attended by Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, whose cheap steel exports the U.S. administration wants to target. U.S. officials have lamented their country's trade deficit with the United States which has nearly doubled in the past 10 years from some 28.8 billion euros in 2006 to 49 billion euros in 2016. Trump has warned he will impose a border tax of 35 percent on cars that German carmaker BMW plans to build at a new plant in Mexico for export to the U.S. market. Merkel has said she would seek a compromise with Trump on trade but major differences remain, notably over Trump's decision to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris global agreement to fight climate change. DIHK said on Tuesday a record high of 50 percent of the 4,000 firms operating abroad named political risks as a top threat to their business over the next 12 months in a new survey. Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union, U.S. trade policies and protectionism were seen as major risks. Still, some 56 percent said they expected better business over the next 12 months and more than a third said they expect the economies in their host countries to improve.

The pound, which at the start of the week was trading less than half a cent away from nine-month highs on bets the Bank of England could raise interest rates by the end of the year, dipped to a six-day low of $1.2918 after the data.  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey showed activity falling to 54.8 in June, still above the 50 level that denotes growth but down from May's 18-month high of 56.0 and slightly below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.     The equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector, released on Monday, had shown activity grew much more slowly than forecast in June. But MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman said these surveys should be taken  with a pinch of salt , as they reflected political uncertainty last month, when the ruling Conservative party unexpectedly lost its majority in parliamentary elections.  We had heightened political uncertainty last month, and that could have weighed on business confidence,  he said.  That's potentially why the data is coming in weaker than expected, but I suppose one of the key tests going forward will be whether that loss of confidence will be sustained.  Still, the weak data rippled through the bond markets posing fresh headwinds for sterling. Government bond yields are down by 2-3 basis points across the board since the start of the week. The BoE is pondering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, and is watching for signs that other areas of growth can offset a consumer spending slowdown, caused by a rise in inflation and a slowing in pay growth. One of the BoE's interest rate-setters, Gertjan Vlieghe, said late on Monday he favoured keeping borrowing costs at their historic lows, despite a shift among some of his peers at the central bank in favour of a first hike in a decade. But that seemed to have no impact on sterling, which recorded its best week in eight months last week after BoE Governor Mark Carney said a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months.   The BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited. This means downside room for sterling is also more limited,  wrote Nomura strategists in a morning note to clients.

Africa's top copper producer has been hit hard by low commodity prices in recent years. It has only enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports and its franc currency has lost half its value in the past year. The government is discussing possible assistance with the International Monetary Fund but Western donors are reluctant to aid the government of President Joseph Kabila, who refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired last December. Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala's office said in a statement late on Monday that VTB representatives, including Managing Director and Head of African Origination Raymond O'Leary met with Tshibala on Monday to discuss a possible $1 billion investment fund to finance  strategic projects . The statement cited Albert Yuma, chairman of Congo's state mining company and president of its chamber of commerce - who organized the meeting with Tshibala - as saying it would be  up to the government to decide how the funds are used . In remarks broadcast on state television, Yuma, standing alongside O'Leary and another VTB representative, said the financing could begin within 10 weeks. Neither Yuma nor the statement from the prime minister's office provided additional details about the possible terms of the investment. VTB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Congo has tried to cultivate closer diplomatic ties to Russia amid growing strains in its relationship with the European Union and United States over its failure to organize elections on time and alleged human rights abuses. In March, Congo's foreign minister Leonard She Okitundu met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, where he offered Lavrov  a box of rare minerals  as a birthday gift, according to the Congolese ministry's Twitter feed. VTB, Russia's second-largest bank, is one of several Russian financial institutions the United States sanctioned in 2014 over Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. It was also at the centre, along with Switzerland's Credit Suisse, of $2 billion of loans taken out in secret by the Mozambique government, which has since defaulted on repayment. VTB has denied any wrongdoing relating to the transactions, which IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde described as  clearly concealing corruption  on the part of the Mozambique government.

Chairman Isidre Faine has contacted his counterpart at Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP) about a 35 billion euro ($40 billion) deal to create Europe's fourth biggest utility firm by market value, according to sources. While the companies denied on Tuesday there were talks, bankers and analysts say a new Iberian power champion would threaten the dominance of France's EDF (EDF.PA) and Italy's Enel (ENEI.MI) and could unleash a wave of European mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) in a sector ripe for consolidation. The impetus for change is partly coming from the growing shift to green energy sources. Supplies of ever-cheaper wind and solar power are surging in Europe, forcing down wholesale electricity prices and posing a threat to the traditional model of centralized power generation and distribution from large coal, gas and nuclear plants. Utility companies are fighting back by joining the shift to renewables, as well as offering customers digital devices to keep closer tabs on their power consumption. As one banker puts it, power companies need to develop a  Utility 2.0 strategy , focused on renewables, networks and retail customers. Getting bigger through acquisitions would help utilities manage the transition better, and the impending loss of public subsidies and preferential access to power networks that have cushioned utility revenues is also spurring consolidation. The new rush to merge comes after some tough years. Several utilities had to swallow hefty writedowns after a wave of acquisitions a decade ago as the traditional power generation model, and nuclear power in particular, came under pressure. Now, companies such as Gas Natural and Germany's RWE (RWEG.DE) have cleaned up their up balance sheets to make it easy to carry out acquisitions or share swaps, analysts say.  A lot of mistakes have been made with respect to big ticket M&A; in the past. Everyone is keen to avoid new missteps,  said one banker specializing in utility companies.  The Stoxx Eurozone utilities index .SX6E lost as much as 60 percent of its value over the past decade but has rallied strongly in 2017, helped by outages at EDF reactors pushing winter power prices up and a German court declaring a nuclear fuel tax to be illegal, triggering repayments to companies.   Over the past six months, the index has gained more than 15 percent, while the broader index  is 7 percent higher.  The sector is finally getting to the point where it can move on from a decade of value destruction ... Confidence around utilities' sustainable cash-flow generation could grow,  said Deutsche Bank in a research note.  Germany at the Heart Spain may have fired the starting gun but Germany is at the heart of the current takeover speculation. The country's largest utilities, E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE, have separated their faster-growing green energy and retail operations from their struggling centralized power businesses. E.ON has retained the renewables business and put its old power plants in a company called Uniper (UN01.DE). RWE, on the other hand, kept its traditional plants and put the green and retail businesses in a new company called Innogy (IGY.DE).  But with market capitalizations of about 19 billion euros, E.ON and Innogy are less than half the size of southern European renewable energy giants Enel and Iberdrola (IBE.MC), at 56 billion euros and 50 billion euros respectively. The Italian and Spanish firms started their switch to higher-earning activities such as solar power and transmission and distribution grids a decade ago.  Activity is heating up in France too, where Engie (ENGIE.PA) Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher is pushing the former monopoly gas utility to focus more on grids and renewables. Several investment banks are trying to engineer a share swap between Engie and RWE which could create a Franco-German energy giant, sources said in May.   Enel and Engie are really active, analyzing everything. German companies are ready to do a domestic merger, or to be bought by a foreigner,  said one utilities investment banker.  Enel has renewables capacity of 37 gigawatts (GW), of which 27.4 comes from hydro plants and 6.5 GW from wind power. Innogy has a green energy capacity of just 3.7 GW, mainly in wind.  Everybody is talking to everybody. But there are only few deals which really make sense. Iberdrola-Innogy may be one of them. But mainly it's about smaller asset disposals, about streamlining at times of more competitive markets and increasing cost pressures,  another utilities banker said.      Iberdrola, Europe's second-largest utility by market value, is working with U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley to study opportunities while Gas Natural has turned to Citigroup for advice, according to people close to the situation. Enel has repeatedly denied any interest in Innogy and that big deals tend to destroy value.  All this M&A; talk in Europe, it is just cinema,  Enel CEO Francesco Starace told Reuters. Potential bidders are also circling Uniper, bankers say. Finland's Fortum (FORTUM.HE) is said to be interested in the German company's Scandinavian assets but may be hesitant to add to its carbon emissions by acquiring Uniper's coal and gas plants, which account for the bulk of its operations.  Banking sources said Uniper was also a target for Czech rivals CEZ (CEZP.PR) and EPH, but they cautioned that its 6.2 billion euro value, boosted by a 70 percent rise in its shares since it was spun off in September, might cool suitors' ardor. Infrastructure Funds Besides the strategic shifts shaping the sector, demand for deals is also coming from infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds. They are all hunting for assets to generate steady, reliable yields as the low returns from fixed-income securities they have traditionally held are making it increasingly difficult for them to fund their liabilities. But rather than buying companies focused on green energy, funds are increasingly buying a minority stake in the renewable energy assets themselves, leaving the developer as the main operator with a majority ownership. BlackRock's (BLK.N) renewable infrastructure investment platform launched in 2012, for example, now manages more than $4 billion in client assets, mostly wind and solar projects.  Infrastructure funds are among five bidders expected to place binding offers in September for the Italian assets of Gas Natural, which is working with Rothschild on the sale. Funds are also expected to bid for Steag's municipal heating activities, which the German utility, owned by seven local municipalities, is selling with the help of Rothschild, people close to the matter said.

The 27-km (17-mile) line is designed to speed up freight traffic between the city of Divaca and Slovenia's state-owned Adriatic seaport at Luka Koper. The lobby group Taxpayers Don't Give Up and the main opposition party, the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party, had pushed for the referendum, arguing that the line, as projected by the government, was too expensive. The centre-left government has already won 44.3 million euros of European Union funds for preparation of the track, while landlocked Hungary had said it is ready to invest about 200 million euros as it relies on Koper for much of its sea freight. A rejection by voters would put the project on hold for at least a year, and most likely longer as a parliamentary election is due in mid-2018. However, for a rejection to be valid, it needs not only a majority of those voting, but also the backing of at least 20 percent of the 1.7 million or so eligible voters.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.  What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.  There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement,  he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.  The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.   We hope others will respond in a similar spirit. Qatar says it is ready to meet any  reasonable  demands.  But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty. Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible. Related CoverageArab intelligence chiefs meet in Cairo day before Qatar decision: MENAQatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said. The decision will have international ramifications. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects  still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere (LNG.A) exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbors. FILE PHOTO: People sit on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon/File PhotoThe Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end  in the coming hours  with the Qatari response to demands.  We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses,  he said.  We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures.  Iranian Question The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Slideshow (2 Images)Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.   Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co (8031.T) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world.

Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, and Russian lender VTB have come under scrutiny after negotiating loans totalling some $2 billion with three firms owned by Mozambique - one of the poorest countries in the world. Discovery of the loans to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM) led the International Monetary Fund and Western donors to halt support for Mozambique, triggering the collapse of its currency and leading to a default on debt. In an audit released last month, risk management firm Kroll Inc said officials in the southern African country had given inconsistent answers about how $500 million earmarked for the tuna fishing company had been spent. It also showed Credit Suisse and VTB Capital were paid a total of $199.7 million in fees. Credit Suisse disputed the report's findings, saying banking fees charged to arrange loans for Mozambique's state-owned companies amounted to $23 million. FINMA, Credit Suisse's main supervisory body, first said last year that it had spoken to the bank about the issue.

The pan-European STOXX 600  fell 0.3 percent, in line with a dip in euro zone stocks .STOXXE and Britain's FTSE .FTSE index. On Monday, European shares had their strongest day since April 24, when Emmanuel Macron won the first round of France's presidential election.  The closure of the U.S. market for the July 4 national holiday also meant volumes were lower than usual.  Today is a consolidation day after gains yesterday, as we don't have a U.S. market,  said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor Capital. But dealmaking was back with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. Payments company Worldpay shares soared 27.7 percent to a record high after it received rival takeover approaches from credit card tech firm Vantiv (VNTV.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N).  This came after Danish rival Nets (NETS.CO) said on Monday it had received offers. Nets and another German rival Wirecard (WDIG.DE) rose more than 4 percent.  This is one of the most intriguing sub-sectors in the financials space. There are a lot of companies still, and we are probably going to have only one or two big leaders in the payments space,  said Meda. EDP (EDP.LS) was a top gainer, up 1.6 percent after Spain's Gas Natural (GAS.MC) was re[ported to have approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalization.     Gas Natural shares fell 0.6 percent. EDP denied negotiations were taking place.  Shares in French rival EDF (EDF.PA) also dropped 4 percent after HSBC downgraded the stock to  reduce .  Clariant (CLN.S) shares gained 3 percent after two activist investors upped their stake in the Swiss chemicals firm in opposition to a planned merger with U.S. firm Huntsman (HUN.N). Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely. And the prospect of suitors Bain and Cinven getting regulatory approval for a renewed offer for Stada (STAGn.DE) sent the generic drugmaker's shares up 2.2 percent. Italian stocks outperformed as banks .FTIT8300 rallied more than 1 percent to a 15-month high after the country's ninth-biggest lender Carige (CRGI.MI) approved a 500 million euros cash call to beef up its balance sheet.  This was the last piece of the puzzle which we needed to fix, in order to have a recovery in credit and profitability in banks... It's not yet in the prices, because the market still wants to see non-performing loans problems being solved,  said Meda.  A further boost to the sector came from news that the European Commission gave its blessing to a state bailout of  Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), paving the way for a deep restructure of the troubled lender.

The 17 men, who authorities said were armed with 24 guns, were killed by police near the coastal city of Mazatlan in the  state of Sinaloa on Friday night. Another two people died nearby in what appeared to be related shootings, the state attorney general's office said. None of the suspects in the gun battle were found wounded or arrested.     Genaro Robles, Sinaloa's head of police, attributed the outcome to better police training and said there was no excessive force or extrajudicial killing in the exchange. Five of 11 police officers suffered gunshot wounds. None died. Relatives said the dead men were victims of a heavy-handed response by security forces that has stained Mexico's human rights record. Three relatives told Reuters they believed the victims were killed in cold blood. Two of them said their relatives had   been shot in the back.  They murdered them,  said the sister of one victim as she waited outside a funeral home in Mazatlan. She declined to give her name for fear of reprisals.  They didn't have a chance. This wasn't a gun battle, like they say in the news.  Local municipal police rejected the allegation, though human rights officials were investigating possible abuses. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's office referred questions to prosecutors in Sinaloa state and the federal attorney general's office.  The federal attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the Sinaloa prosecutor's office said it was not investigating any rights abuses, adding it could if human rights officials found evidence of wrongdoing.   Drug smugglers have been fighting for control in the state after a power vacuum emerged following the deportation of feared drug boss Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman, a native of Sinaloa. Police chief Robles said officers were alerted to two people injured behind a mall in the small town of Villa Union on Friday evening, and chased down the suspected assailants, sparking a gun battle. Joel Ernesto Soto, head of the Mazatlan municipal police, speaks during a news conference in Mazatlan, Mexico, July 3, 2017.Jesus BustamanteBlood was visible on the road when a Reuters reporter visited the scene over the weekend. Night-time footage later posted on social media, purporting to show victims, revealed bodies piled in the back of pickup trucks, with more scattered along a road. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the videos. The nephew of one victim said his uncle had worked for a drug cartel.  When I saw my uncle's body it had gunshots in the back,  said the man, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. One local policeman, who did not want to be identified, described the shootings as  butchery,  unlike other recent gun battles. 'Nothing Untoward' Miriam Hernandez of the Sinaloa state Commission for Human Rights said it had opened an investigation into whether the killings involved human rights abuses. Joel Ernesto Soto, head of the municipal police in Mazatlan, whose men fought in the gun battle, welcomed the probe.  They can come and ask and speak to us. We'll be here waiting,  he said.  This event was completely fortuitous. There was nothing untoward.  In 2015, police executed nearly two dozen suspected gang members in an ambush near the western town of Tanhuato, the national human rights commission found. It was one of the worst abuses by security forces in a decade of drug violence. Police killed 17 people for every officer lost in gun battles in 2014, a university study found. The ratio was consistent with excessive use of force, experts said. There were 619 murders in Sinaloa in the first five months of 2017, up more than 75 percent from 2016. Family members gathered outside the Mazatlan funeral home said the violence was making police more corrupt.  These killings were dirty,  said the mother of one victim, who declined to give her name.  This wasn't a fight. It was something else, but what can you do?

Santander's comments were included in a document sent to investors in connection with a 7 billion-euro ($7.94 billion) rights issue flagged in June when it bought Popular. The share issue was launched on Monday. The warning marks a shift in Santander's stance on the deal, which has been broadly positive until now. Spain's largest bank said legal claims over a Popular rights issue last year and its rescue last month, as well as risks attached to a soured 30 billion euro real estate portfolio, could harm its earnings.  An estimate of the legal claims shows they could affect the acquisition of Popular, including possible compensation payments that could have a significant adverse effect on the results and financial position of the Santander Group,  the bank said. On Monday, Santander said it expected a profit of 3.6 billion euros for the first half of 2017. Santander said there was an  indeterminate  number of legal claims related to the takeover of Popular, which it bought in early June for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse.  A banking source with knowledge of the deal said the total claims could reach 2 billion euros. Santander also said that because the deal was done quickly it had had limited access and a reduced period of time to analyze Popular's books. As a result, Santander said it could have overestimated the benefits of the deal, which it calculated then at close to 500 million euros per year from 2020. Keep the Clients To make the deal a success, Santander said the key would be to retain Popular's more than 4 million clients.  It's going to be an integration that is going to be done by putting the client above all other considerations,  Santander's chief financial officer, Jose Garcia Cantera, told Reuters in an interview last month.  What is important is that it makes strategic and financial sense, and it fits in with our public objectives to have a return above the cost of capital,  he said. Santander said it now holds a 25 percent share in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending in Spain after absorbing Popular's SME business. The SME sector offers higher returns for shorter loan periods in contrast to the more sluggish mortgage market.  A Santander statement in June said that Popular's market share of the SME sector was not the 17.7 percent publicly stated by Popular at the end of March but 13.8 percent, as a result of inaccuracies in Popular's accounting and client flight. Santander also said on Tuesday it did not yet know the scope of Popular's property loan troubles and it still could find more deteriorated assets, unknown risks and hidden debts, than it had initially expected. Popular's non-performing loan ratio had reached 20 percent from around 15 percent at the end of March, Santander said on Monday. As part of the transaction, Santander set aside around 8 billion euros to cover Popular's non-performing assets, which are the highest among Spanish banks.

Moscow hopes to sign the final documents with Ankara and Tehran on Wednesday, he told reporters after a series of meetings in the Kazakh capital, Astana. Russia and Iran, which back President Bashar Assad's government, and Turkey, which supports some of the rebels, agreed in principle to create four  de-escalation zones  in Syria in a previous round of talks in May, but put off a planned June meeting where they were supposed to work out the details. Since the May agreement was announced, the rebel-held stronghold of Idlib province in the northwest of Syria has been mostly calm. But fighting has continued on other frontlines in western Syria, including Eastern Ghouta of Damascus and the southwestern city of Deraa, where government forces and their allies are trying to crush remaining pockets of rebellion. Lavrentyev told reporters that Moscow and its partners were still discussing detailed maps and other conditions related to the Idlib and southern zones, while the borders of two other zones, in Homs province and near Damascus, had been agreed.  Overall, (the agreement) provides for the presence of Russian military police in the buffer zones, but once again this matter has not been agreed yet,  he said.  Depending on when the documents on safe zones are signed, I think one should expect concrete measures on the deployment of forces within 2-3 weeks.  Opposition Skeptical The Syrian opposition, some of whose delegates walked out of the previous round of talks in protest against Iran's participation, has routinely criticized Russia for failing to enforce the ceasefire and was skeptical of Moscow's plan. Armed opposition leader Muhammad Alloush, who led the opposition delegation in earlier rounds of the Astana process, is not attending the current talks. A Syrian opposition official said the aim of Astana  is to set out the areas of influence between the three states that sponsor it, and it embodies the interests of these states and their areas of influence on the ground, unfortunately with an intended American absence and suspicious European silence .  It will succeed in the north because the desire of the states and their interests dictate that, and if we want to interpret it on the Syria-wide level, it represents the strengthening of Russian and Iranian influence on the ground.” Riyad Nassan Agha, a member of the opposition Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee, told Reuters the opposition feared the Astana talks aimed to undermine the U.N.-backed peace talks in Geneva, reiterating the opposition’s view that Iran could not act as a guarantor of any deal because  it is a hostile state .  What they are talking about (de-escalation) did not happen. So the Syrian people no longer have faith in these agreements that happened in Astana,  he said. Lavrentyev, who earlier on Tuesday met Stuart Jones, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Near East, said he would meet Syrian opposition delegates on Wednesday.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.  What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.  There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement,  he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism. The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.  We hope others will respond in a similar spirit. Qatar says it is ready to meet any  reasonable  demands. But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty. Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, Kaabi said. The decision will have international ramifications. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end  in the coming hours  with the Qatari response to demands.  We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses,  he said.  We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures.  Iranian Question The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.  Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil.  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,   said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell.

Chairman Isidre Faine has contacted his counterpart at Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP) about a 35 billion euro ($40 billion) deal to create Europe's fourth biggest utility firm by market value, according to sources. While the companies denied on Tuesday there were talks, bankers and analysts say a new Iberian power champion would threaten the dominance of France's EDF (EDF.PA) and Italy's Enel (ENEI.MI) and could unleash a wave of European mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) in a sector ripe for consolidation. The impetus for change is partly coming from the growing shift to green energy sources. Supplies of ever-cheaper wind and solar power are surging in Europe, forcing down wholesale electricity prices and posing a threat to the traditional model of centralized power generation and distribution from large coal, gas and nuclear plants. Utility companies are fighting back by joining the shift to renewables, as well as offering customers digital devices to keep closer tabs on their power consumption. As one banker puts it, power companies need to develop a  Utility 2.0 strategy , focused on renewables, networks and retail customers. Getting bigger through acquisitions would help utilities manage the transition better, and the impending loss of public subsidies and preferential access to power networks that have cushioned utility revenues is also spurring consolidation. The new rush to merge comes after some tough years. Several utilities had to swallow hefty writedowns after a wave of acquisitions a decade ago as the traditional power generation model, and nuclear power in particular, came under pressure. Now, companies such as Gas Natural and Germany's RWE (RWEG.DE) have cleaned up their up balance sheets to make it easy to carry out acquisitions or share swaps, analysts say.  A lot of mistakes have been made with respect to big ticket M&A; in the past. Everyone is keen to avoid new missteps,  said one banker specializing in utility companies.  The Stoxx Eurozone utilities index .SX6E lost as much as 60 percent of its value over the past decade but has rallied strongly in 2017, helped by outages at EDF reactors pushing winter power prices up and a German court declaring a nuclear fuel tax to be illegal, triggering repayments to companies.   Over the past six months, the index has gained more than 15 percent, while the broader index  is 7 percent higher.  The sector is finally getting to the point where it can move on from a decade of value destruction ... Confidence around utilities' sustainable cash-flow generation could grow,  said Deutsche Bank in a research note.  Germany at the Heart Spain may have fired the starting gun but Germany is at the heart of the current takeover speculation. The country's largest utilities, E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE, have separated their faster-growing green energy and retail operations from their struggling centralized power businesses. E.ON has retained the renewables business and put its old power plants in a company called Uniper (UN01.DE). RWE, on the other hand, kept its traditional plants and put the green and retail businesses in a new company called Innogy (IGY.DE).  But with market capitalizations of about 19 billion euros, E.ON and Innogy are less than half the size of southern European renewable energy giants Enel and Iberdrola (IBE.MC), at 56 billion euros and 50 billion euros respectively. The Italian and Spanish firms started their switch to higher-earning activities such as solar power and transmission and distribution grids a decade ago.  Activity is heating up in France too, where Engie (ENGIE.PA) Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher is pushing the former monopoly gas utility to focus more on grids and renewables. Several investment banks are trying to engineer a share swap between Engie and RWE which could create a Franco-German energy giant, sources said in May.   Enel and Engie are really active, analyzing everything. German companies are ready to do a domestic merger, or to be bought by a foreigner,  said one utilities investment banker.  Enel has renewables capacity of 37 gigawatts (GW), of which 27.4 comes from hydro plants and 6.5 GW from wind power. Innogy has a green energy capacity of just 3.7 GW, mainly in wind.  Everybody is talking to everybody. But there are only few deals which really make sense. Iberdrola-Innogy may be one of them. But mainly it's about smaller asset disposals, about streamlining at times of more competitive markets and increasing cost pressures,  another utilities banker said.      Iberdrola, Europe's second-largest utility by market value, is working with U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley to study opportunities while Gas Natural has turned to Citigroup for advice, according to people close to the situation. Enel has repeatedly denied any interest in Innogy and that big deals tend to destroy value.  All this M&A; talk in Europe, it is just cinema,  Enel CEO Francesco Starace told Reuters. Potential bidders are also circling Uniper, bankers say. Finland's Fortum (FORTUM.HE) is said to be interested in the German company's Scandinavian assets but may be hesitant to add to its carbon emissions by acquiring Uniper's coal and gas plants, which account for the bulk of its operations.  Banking sources said Uniper was also a target for Czech rivals CEZ (CEZP.PR) and EPH, but they cautioned that its 6.2 billion euro value, boosted by a 70 percent rise in its shares since it was spun off in September, might cool suitors' ardor. Infrastructure Funds Besides the strategic shifts shaping the sector, demand for deals is also coming from infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds. They are all hunting for assets to generate steady, reliable yields as the low returns from fixed-income securities they have traditionally held are making it increasingly difficult for them to fund their liabilities. But rather than buying companies focused on green energy, funds are increasingly buying a minority stake in the renewable energy assets themselves, leaving the developer as the main operator with a majority ownership. BlackRock's (BLK.N) renewable infrastructure investment platform launched in 2012, for example, now manages more than $4 billion in client assets, mostly wind and solar projects.  Infrastructure funds are among five bidders expected to place binding offers in September for the Italian assets of Gas Natural, which is working with Rothschild on the sale. Funds are also expected to bid for Steag's municipal heating activities, which the German utility, owned by seven local municipalities, is selling with the help of Rothschild, people close to the matter said.

The pan-European STOXX 600  fell 0.3 percent, in line with a dip in euro zone stocks .STOXXE and Britain's FTSE .FTSE index. On Monday, European shares had their strongest day since April 24, when Emmanuel Macron won the first round of France's presidential election.  The closure of the U.S. market for the July 4 national holiday also meant volumes were lower than usual.  Today is a consolidation day after gains yesterday, as we don't have a U.S. market,  said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor Capital. But dealmaking was back with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. Payments company Worldpay shares soared 27.7 percent to a record high after it received rival takeover approaches from credit card tech firm Vantiv (VNTV.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N).  This came after Danish rival Nets (NETS.CO) said on Monday it had received offers. Nets and another German rival Wirecard (WDIG.DE) rose more than 4 percent.  This is one of the most intriguing sub-sectors in the financials space. There are a lot of companies still, and we are probably going to have only one or two big leaders in the payments space,  said Meda. EDP (EDP.LS) was a top gainer, up 1.6 percent after Spain's Gas Natural (GAS.MC) was re[ported to have approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalization.     Gas Natural shares fell 0.6 percent. EDP denied negotiations were taking place.  Shares in French rival EDF (EDF.PA) also dropped 4 percent after HSBC downgraded the stock to  reduce .  Clariant (CLN.S) shares gained 3 percent after two activist investors upped their stake in the Swiss chemicals firm in opposition to a planned merger with U.S. firm Huntsman (HUN.N). Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely. And the prospect of suitors Bain and Cinven getting regulatory approval for a renewed offer for Stada (STAGn.DE) sent the generic drugmaker's shares up 2.2 percent. Italian stocks outperformed as banks .FTIT8300 rallied more than 1 percent to a 15-month high after the country's ninth-biggest lender Carige (CRGI.MI) approved a 500 million euros cash call to beef up its balance sheet.  This was the last piece of the puzzle which we needed to fix, in order to have a recovery in credit and profitability in banks... It's not yet in the prices, because the market still wants to see non-performing loans problems being solved,  said Meda.  A further boost to the sector came from news that the European Commission gave its blessing to a state bailout of  Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), paving the way for a deep restructure of the troubled lender.

He led off with a double in the second inning and scored, then hit a two-run double in the third. Frazier is batting just .217, but he has 13 doubles, 15 homers and 42 RBIs. RHP Gregory Infante was recalled Monday from Triple-A Charlotte and took the roster spot of RHP David Robertson, who was placed on the paternity list. Infante has made 19 relief appearances for the White Sox this season, posting a 4.79 ERA with 18 strikeouts over 20 2/3 innings. He is 0-1 with a 1.80 ERA and 18 strikeouts over 15 innings in 12 appearances for Charlotte. RF Avisail Garcia (left knee soreness) missed his fifth consecutive game Monday against Oakland, but manager Rick Renteria said he expects him to be available to play at some point in the three-game series.  (Garcia's) doing very, very well,  Renteria said before the series opener.  Actually he ran yesterday with tennis shoes on the field. Took batting practice in the cages. Did some things with our strength and conditioning guy. For me, I want to have him go through the whole routine today -- BP, be on the bases, take fly balls, do all those things so I can have a sense of security about where he's at.  Garcia was named to the American League All-Star team on Sunday for the first time in his career. LHP Carlos Rodon allowed two runs and struck out 10 over 6 1/3 innings, leading the White Sox to a 7-2 victory at Oakland on Monday. Rodon (1-1) made just his second start of 2017 after missing nearly the first three months of the season with left biceps bursitis. He walked three, allowed four hits and came within one strikeout of matching his career high. In his season debut in a 12-3 loss to the New York Yankees on Wednesday, Rodon gave up three unearned runs but walked six. Last year, Rodon won his final two starts, striking out a combined 21 batters and allowing just two earned runs on five hits.  It's just one start, but that's closer to where I was, and hopefully I can build off that in the next start in Colorado,  Rodon said.  It felt good.  INF Tyler Saladino (back spasms) began a rehab assignment Monday with Triple-A Charlotte, going 1-for-3. He has been on the disabled list since May 27. Saladino is batting .200 with four doubles, two triples and four RBIs in 30 games for the White Sox. LF Melky Cabrera went 3-for-6 with a double, an RBI and a run Monday  night in the White Sox's 7-2 victory against Oakland. In his last 39 games, Cabrera is batting .346 with seven home runs and 28 RBIs. He has 13 multi-hit games during that stretch. Cabrera raised his batting average to .289 and has 48 RBIs overall. RHP David Robertson, Chicago's closer, was placed on the paternity list on Monday and is expected to miss the entire three-game series against Oakland. Robertson remained in Chicago with his wife for the birth of their second child. Robertson is 4-2 with a 3.00 ERA and has a team-high 12 saves in 27 games. No other reliever on the White Sox's roster has a save this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-playerwatch-idUSMTZED74KSLQAW"},

He was assigned to Omaha May 24 and posted a 6.75 ERA in five appearances for the Royals this season. LHP Danny Duffy (4-4, 3.54 ERA) is scheduled to come off the 10-day disabled list to start Tuesday in Seattle. Duffy has been out since May 28 with a strained right oblique.  When they told me six to eight weeks, my goal was to come back in four,  Duffy said.  They've been holding down the fort. Now it's my job to come in and not screw it up.

He feels good, went through a rehab start of 90 pitches ... that's good enough for us.  LF Alex Gordon hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot in the fifth inning. Gordon broke his bat on the swing, with the ball just reaching the first row of seats in right-center field.  It takes a strong guy to be able to do that,  Royals manager Ned Yost said. RHP Ian Kennedy (3-6) won his third consecutive decision Monday, allowing just one run on four hits in 6 2/3 innings against Seattle. Kennedy walked two and struck out seven.  Kennedy had the little blip in the second inning where he walked a couple of guys and gave up the one run, but after that he was great in every inning,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He had a really good curveball, commanded his stuff extremely well and just pitched a great game.

I'm really excited. It's going to be an awesome experience,  he said.  I've never been to Miami, so I'm excited to go there and have some fun in the Home Run Derby.  Moustakas won the final vote in 2015 to make his first All-Star Game.  Hopefully that still happens,  Moustakas said. 1B Eric Hosmer went 2-for-4 Monday to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. He's batting .375 during the streak, with three home runs and eight RBIs.

Holland set a franchise record for the most saves before the All-Star break, surpassing Huston Street, who had 26 saves in 2011 before the break. Holland is 1-0 with a 1.44 ERA in 33 games with 14 walks and 42 strikeouts in 31 1/3 innings. RHP Chad Bettis (cancer) will face hitters in a simulated game Tuesday for the first time as he continues his comeback from testicular cancer. Bettis said he was told he'll have 30 pitches to warm up before facing hitters and expects to then throw about 25 pitches.  It's a big step,  Bettis said.  It's exciting to be so close (to beginning a minor league rehab assignment), honestly. I think everything's falling into place well. My strength and my lungs, being able to recover the way I am right now is big.  On Nov. 29, Bettis underwent surgery to remove cancerous cells. He was told by doctors on Dec. 22 that the surgery was a success and he would not need radiation or chemotherapy and continued to prepare for spring training. However, during spring training, a checkup revealed the cancer had spread. Bettis left came March 20 to undergo chemotherapy and rejoined the Rockies on June 6. At the time, he said he was hopeful of returning to the Rockies rotation around the All-Star break. Bettis soon discovered that timetable was premature when he rejoined the team early last month.  Honestly, when I started this whole thing,  Bettis said,  I ran those first agilities (drills), and I was like, 'All-Star break might be a little early.'   RHP Jeff Hoffman pitched a career-high tying seven innings. It was the first time he went that distance at Coors Field. He also pitched seven innings this season at Philadelphia on May 22 and at San Diego on June 4. His previous high at Coors Field was 5 1/3 innings on May 11 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hoffman had allowed three homers in 42 1/3 innings entering the game but gave up two homers in a game for the first time this season and third time in his career. He last yielded two homers on Sept. 14, 2016, at Arizona, OF Carlos Gonzalez (right shoulder strain) was reinstated Monday when he was eligible to come off the 10-day disabled list and went 0-for-4 with one RBI after missing nine games. Gonzalez's shoulder had bothered him for a couple days and on June 22 worsened to the point where he was lifted for a pinch hitter in the ninth inning. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list June 26. It was the first time Gonzalez has been on the disabled list since 2014. OF Gerardo Parra (right quadriceps strain) is scheduled to begin a three-game rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque and play five innings Tuesday, seven innings Wednesday and nine innings Friday. Parra said he will also play first base during his rehab assignment. He never played the position before last year when he joined the Rockies and made 21 appearances, 17 starts at first. If all goes well, Parra expects to be reinstated Friday when the Rockies begin a three-game series with the Chicago White Sox leading to the All-Star break. Parra was injured June 6 on a stolen base attempt, pulling up before he reached second base. In 49 games this season, Parra is hitting .318 with six homers and 28 RBIs. 1B/OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. He pulled up in discomfort in the fourth inning at Arizona after catching a fly ball hit by Brandon Drury and had to leave the game. It is the second time on the disabled list this season for Desmond, who signed a five-year, $70 million contract with the Rockies as a free agent in the offseason. Desmond underwent an MRI on Monday. Manager Bud Black said  calf strains are dicey  and the prudent move was to put Desmond on the disabled list and let him rest through the All-Star break in hopes he can return July 14, when the Rockies resume play at the New York Mets rather than let him rest a few days and risk aggravating the injury before the break. Desmond didn't make his Rockies debut until April 3, because he suffered a broken left hand when hit with a pitch thrown by Cincinnati's Rookie Davis in a Cactus League game on March 12. In 57 games with the Rockies, Desmond is hitting .283 with five homers, 26 RBIs, a .709 OPS and a team-leading 10 stolen bases in 14 attempts. In his past seven games, Desmond is 9-for-23 (.391).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED74KSLQAP"},

Those guys hit the ball like a joke,  Castro said.  I'm going to root for Judge and Gary all day.  As of Monday, Castro said he was unsure if the injury would keep him from next Tuesday's game. The All-Star Game would mark the two-week point from when Castro was initially injured running out a ground ball in Chicago. RF Aaron Judge announced officially Monday he was taking part in next week's Home Run Derby in Miami. Judge held off on announcing his decision to focus on games but made the declaration in a Twitter video where he also announced C Gary Sanchez was joining him in the contest.  I'm excited,  he said during a press conference Monday.  We've got a good group of guys going. Getting a chance to go up against Gary is going to be fun, so I think we're both looking forward to that.  Asked if there was any concern about Judge's swing negatively impacted by participating, GM Brian Cashman said:  My job is to make sure I find more that can qualify for the home run hitting contest.  Judge was 2-for-4 and reached base safely for the 34th straight start Monday. RHP Masahiro Tanaka won his second consecutive start and has a 1.29 ERA in his past three outings after allowing one run and five hits in seven innings Monday night. He also did not allow a home run for the third straight start. His past two wins occurred after he was winless in eight straight starts from May 14-June 23.

He will start the second game of the series against the Blue Jays. Sabathia was very encouraged it only took three weeks for the injury to heal. He is returning after throwing only a 35-pitch bullpen session June 25 and a three-inning simulated game last Thursday in Chicago. Sabathia is 16-9 with a 3.47 ERA in 28 career starts against Toronto.

Shaw stayed in the game and went on to score later in the inning but was replaced in the third and underwent x-rays, which were negative, according to manager Craig Counsell. Shaw has been Milwaukee's most consistent offensive threat this season and leads the team's qualifiers with a .291 batting average, 81 hits and 59 RBIs. LHP Brent Suter will get another start next weekend when the Brewers travel to New York to face the Yankees. Taking the spot of injured starter Chase Anderson on Monday, Suter struck out a career-high eight batters while allowing just an unearned run and four hits in six innings against Miami, becoming the first Brewers left-handed starter to post a victory since Randy Wolf in 2012. RHP Paolo Espino was optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs on Monday. In his third big league stint this season, Espino appeared in three games and allowed seven runs in seven innings. Overall, Espino has a 6.11 ERA in six outings, including two starts. SS Orlando Arcia continued his offensive surge Sunday, collecting three hits in an 8-1 Milwaukee win over Baltimore.

Romano will take the turn of right-hander Jackson Stephens, who made his major league debut Saturday and gave up three runs in five innings against the Chicago Cubs and earned the victory in Cincinnati's 5-3 win. The Reds then added a reliever for their trip to Colorado and Denver, a move manager Bryan Price said was going to be made regardless of Stephens' performance. Romano is 1-3 with a 3.06 ERA in nine starts at Louisville, where a shoulder injury sidelined him for five weeks. He gave up three earned runs in six innings June 24 and topped out in his most recent outing June 29. Price said,  His last start was a complete game at 89 pitches with 15 ground ball outs. It made sense to do it. I was really anxious to get him back after that first start. He didn't have great success in his first start in Cincinnati, but leaving spring training, I fully anticipated that we would see him at some point in time this year.  Romano, 23, made his major league debut April 16 against Milwaukee in a 4-2 loss and gave up three runs (two earned) in three innings with four walks and two strikeouts, throwing more balls (43) than strikes (39) in his 82-pitch outing. SS Zack Cozart was not in the lineup but pinch hit and grounded out to end the seventh. He had been on the 10-day disabled list with a strained right quadriceps since June 19 until he was reinstated Friday. At that time, the Reds, with an eye toward the second half, mapped out a playing schedule for Cozart through Sunday when the All-Star break arrives. Cozart said he is scheduled to play Tuesday and Wednesday but not Thursday in the series finale with the Rockies. CF Billy Hamilton did not play after being removed from Sunday's game in the eighth inning with lower back stiffness. Manager Bryan Price said before Monday's game that Hamilton's back was felt better than when he left Sunday's game.  But I really hope to avoid exacerbating the pre-existing issue to where it could set him aside for several more days,  Price said.  I'm hoping that he's ready in the next day or two to take on his full-time, regular responsibilities, but today he's not a full-go.  RHP Luis Castillo pitched a season-high-tying 5 2/3 innings in his third career start after being promoted from Double-A Pensicola -- without pitching at the Triple-A level -- on June 23 to make his major league debut. He allowed a season-high two homers, something he also did June 23 at Washington. Charlie Blackmon homered off Castillo to five the Rockies a 3-1 lead in the fourth, and Raimel Tapia gave the Rockies a 4-3 lead in the sixth after the Reds tied the game with back-to-back homers in the top of the inning.  Really good stuff again,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  Really paid the price for pitching behind. Most of their hitters, when they did their damage, he was behind in the count. He was ahead of Tapia 1-2, ends up going to a full count. The kid sits on a fastball and he ends up missing his location and he hits it out to give them a 4-3 lead. That being said, this kid's jumping from Double A. I think he's got a little bit of trepidation on pounding the strike zone right now, which is not unusual for young pitchers. When he gets on the plate and turns those counts around from 1-0 to 0-1, I think he has a chance to be sensational.  1B Joey Votto recorded career hit No. 1,500 with his 24th homer. He surpassed Ted Kluszewski for sole possession for the 10th most hits in Reds franchise history. This season, Votto is hitting .317 with 24 homers, 61 RBIs, a .427 on- base percentage and a .628 slugging percentage.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-playerwatch-idUSMTZED74KSLQAK"},

RHP Lance Lynn takes the ball for St. Louis in its July 4th day game with Miami at Busch Stadium. Lynn delivered a quality start at Arizona Thursday, giving up three runs over six innings and scoring a 10-3 win when the Cardinals' bats came alive after he left for a pinch-hitter. Lynn is 4-0 with a 3.82 ERA in seven career outings, five of them starts, against the Marlins, including a no-decision on May 10. 3B Jedd Gyorko (left leg cramp) departed the game in the bottom of the fifth inning for pinch-hitter Alex Mejia. Gyorko went 2-for-2 with two runs and an RBI, upping his average back over the .300 mark at .301, and reached base in all three plate appearances. There was no update on Gyorko's status after the game, so it's fair to consider him day-to-day. RHP Luke Weaver was recalled Monday from Triple-A Memphis to fill a spot in the bullpen. Weaver was dominant in 11 starts this year for the Redbirds, going 7-1 with a 1.93 ERA over 56 innings with 60 strikeouts and only 19 walks. Weaver made his big league debut last year, pitching nine games and going 1-4 with a 5.70 ERA over 36 1/3 innings. He worked a scoreless sixth inning Monday night. RHP Adam Wainwright cruised for four innings and then hacked up a six-spot in the fifth, but managed to qualify for the win with his team still ahead 11-6 at the time. He gave up eight hits and six runs in five frames, walking one and striking out eight, including Giancarlo Stanton three times.

He threw 30 pitches. He will throw a 40-pitch bullpen session -- with a break after 20 pitches -- on Thursday in Arizona. If all goes well, Graveman will then face hitters in the next step in his rehabilitation. This is Graveman's second stint on the DL for a strained right shoulder.  He got after it pretty hard,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Graveman's bullpen session Monday.  It was a normal bullpen for him, like he would during the course of the season, so that's good. At this point, he feels good, better than the last time we were trying to get him back.  Graveman, who was Oakland's Opening Day starter, is 2-2 with a 3.83 ERA in eight starts. RHP Ryan Dull (strained right knee) threw his second bullpen session Monday since going on the disabled list May 20. He threw 25 pitches, all fastballs and changeups. Dull said he is optimistic that he will be ready to be activated by the end of July.  That would be great,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  We miss him in the bullpen for sure. This guy last year was about as good as you get.  3B/1B Ryon Healy (upper back spasms) was out of the starting lineup Monday night against the White Sox, and he remains day-to-day. He left Oakland's game Sunday against Atlanta after the bottom of the second inning.  He's a little bit better,  A's manager Bob Melvin said Monday.  I knew yesterday, with how he was feeling, that it would be a long shot today.  Melvin said he expects Healy to avoid a trip to the disabled list.  It had been bothering him off and on the last couple days, and he's the kind of guy that doesn't really want to say much,  Melvin said.  He'll play through some things. But it got to the point yesterday that he just couldn't play through it.  Healy is batting .275 with 18  doubles, 19 home runs and 51 RBIs in 81 games. RHP Jharel Cotton (5-8) allowed four runs on seven hits over five innings with five strikeouts, two walks, a wild pitch and a balk Monday night in Oakland's 7-2 loss to the White Sox. He made his first start since a 3-0 victory against the White Sox on June 23 when he threw five shutout innings but had to leave in the sixth with a blister on his right thumb.  They got the big hits with two strikes,  Cotton said of the Monday outing.  I got to get better at that. Something I'll work on and get better at for sure. I need to bear down in those situations.  1B/OF Matt Olson was optioned to Triple-A Nashville on Monday. In 16 games over four stints with the A's this season, Olson batted .184 with four home runs and nine RBIs. He hit .225 (9-for-40) with four home runs and eight RBIs in 10 games in his most recent stint with Oakland, which began on June 22. Olson has 17 home runs and 43 RBIs in 58 games with Nashville.  I thought he did well,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  The average doesn't look great, but he had some big hits for us, he had some good at-bats. He's playing a little bit out of position, even though he didn't look like it. We feel like he is in the future our guy at first base and does a great job there but filled in nicely in right field. I have nothing but positives to say about Matt Olson.  3B Matt Chapman (left knee cellulitis) was reinstated Monday from the 10-day disabled list and went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in Oakland's 7-2 loss to the White Sox. Chapman, however, made a few stellar defensive plays. Chapman went on the DL on June 22, retroactive to June 19. He spent four nights in a hospital receiving antibiotics intravenously. He went hitless in seven at-bats in two rehab games for Class A Stockton on Saturday and Sunday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED74KSLQAB"},

Danny's going to have a long career, but it's just growing pains right now.  INF James Lovett was traded from the Phillies to the Mariners. Signed by the Phillies in March, Lovett was assigned to Class A Williamsport June 19 and was 0-for-2 in his one appearance. RHP Andrew Moore was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma to make his second major league start Monday against Kansas City. Moore went eight innings, allowing three runs on five hits. He didn't walk a batter and struck out four.  For his second major league start, Moore was very impressive,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  He made some good in-game adjustments.  Moore has faced 55 batters in two starts without a walk to begin his career, a franchise record. DH Nelson Cruz, the Mariners' lone All-Star Game representative, didn't start for the third consecutive game after suffering a right knee injury sliding into second base Saturday against the Los Angeles Angels.  He's better but not (good) enough to the point we can put him out there,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.

You look at Robby's numbers ... he missed (11) games dealing with a leg injury,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Robby's had a really good first half. I'm disappointed (he didn't make the AL team).  RHP Felix Hernandez (3-2, 4.66 ERA), who spent nearly two months on the disabled list this season with inflammation in his right shoulder, got an extra day of rest before starting Tuesday against Kansas City.  That's the way it lined up,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  I don't know any pitcher in his 30s who doesn't appreciate an extra day (off).  In each of his two starts since coming off the 10-day DL, Hernandez has allowed three runs in six innings. LF Ben Gamel, who started the season in Triple-A Tacoma, finally got enough plate appearances to qualify for the league leaders. He leads the American League with a .330 batting average.

Uber played down the non-binding opinion from an advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), saying it applied only to a service using unlicensed drivers known as UberPOP, which it had already discontinued in France. Judges will make a final ruling later this year. However, they generally follow the advice of their advocates general and the comments come two months after another opinion, which rejected Uber's argument that it was only a digital platform and so subject to less regulation than a transport firm. The European court battles are being fought as Uber struggles with last month's departure of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick following a string of scandals that have hit a global star of the U.S. tech industry. The latest case before the ECJ was referred to it by a French court in Lille and concerns a 2014 French law on taxis and chauffeured services which makes it a criminal offense to organize illegal taxi services and sets restrictions on the use of software to find customers in the street. Uber had argued that it was not a taxi company and that the criminal fines imposed on two of its French managers were not valid because the French taxi law infringed EU rules under which limitations on digital services in the bloc require prior approval from Brussels. Advocate General Maciej Szpunar, who also provided the opinion in the Spanish case in May, disagreed and upheld France's right to prohibit and punish illegal transport activities like UberPOP without seeking EU approval of its law. The logo of Uber is seen on an iPad, during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei, Taiwan April 13, 2017.Tyrone Siu - Member states may prohibit and punish, as a matter of criminal law, the illegal exercise of transport activities in the context of the UberPOP service, without notifying the Commission of the draft law in advance,  he said in statement. Uber said it now only operates in France with licensed cab drivers, as it does in many of its main European markets. Uber was fined 800,000 euros ($908,000) last year and two of its executives were also fined for running an illegal taxi service with UberPOP. The case is currently being appealed and an outcome is expected at the end of the year. Notably, Szpunar also said that member states remained free to punish illegal transport activities provided by intermediaries such as Uber without asking for Brussels' green light regardless of whether Uber was considered a transport or an information society service. Damien Geradin, a professor of competition law and economics at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, said the impact of a potential ruling along the lines of Tuesday's opinion would have little impact on Uber's operations in France, but would have wider ramifications for how it is regulated across Europe.  More generally, the significance of the opinion is that it shows once again that Szpunar resists any qualification that Uber’s services can be considered as information society services,  Geradin said.  This is a missed opportunity as these provisions would protect Uber against discriminatory or disproportionate rules adopted in the member states, while still allowing member states to regulate the underlying services (provided by the drivers) to protect riders, drivers and third parties.

Quotable Value's (QV) residential property price index rose 8.1 percent in the year to June, the slowest since March 2015, compared with an annual rate of 9.7 percent in the previous month. The index is now 54.2 percent above the market's previous peak in late 2007. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has raised concerns about the nation's soaring home prices and has talked up the systemic risk posed by high mortgage debt in the event of a collapse in the property market. The central bank reiterated its worries last month, saying the moderating price growth could be temporary. The latest slowdown was driven by stricter lending rules introduced by the RBNZ last year, including loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) limits, to insulate banks from any housing downturn, QV said. In the previously red-hot city of Auckland, prices grew 7.2 percent on an annual basis, the slowest since September 2012, and compared with 9.3  pct annual rise of in May.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs and Support Ratings factor in the likelihood of support the three banks may receive from their Russian shareholders. BPS is 98.4%-owned by Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank; BBB-/Stable), BelVEB 97.5%-owned by Vnesheconombank, (VEB; BBB-/Stable), and BGPB is jointly owned by PJSC Gazprom (BBB-/Stable) and JSC Gazprombank (BB+/Stable), with a 49.7% stake each. Fitch's view of potential support is based on the majority ownership, continued strong commitment of the Russian owners to the Belarus market, common branding (implying high reputational risks in case of a subsidiary default), parent-subsidiary integration (including board representation and operational controls), the track record of support to date and the low cost of any support required (given that each subsidiary accounts for a small part of parent entities' consolidated assets). BPS's and BGPB's regulatory capitalisation was supported in 2015-1Q16 by the provision of subordinated debt, while BPS also benefitted from risk-sharing arrangements with the parent group since 2014, resulting in significant capital relief (transferred risky exposures were equal to 2.8x of the bank's end-1Q17 Fitch Core Capital (FCC)). While there are no plans for equity injections in the near term, we believe that parental capital support will be available for all three banks, in case of need. Funding support, mostly in foreign currency, is available for the banks, with the parents contributing 33%-38% of subsidiary liabilities at end-2016. The banks' 'B-' Long-Term IDRs reflect the constraint of Belarus's 'B-' Country Ceiling, which captures transfer and convertibility risks and limits the extent to which support from the foreign shareholders of these banks can be factored into the ratings. The Stable Outlooks on the banks' Long-Term IDRs are in line with that on Belarus's. Viability Ratings (VRs) The banks' VRs  of 'b-' factor in risks from a challenging operating environment, and the linkage between the banks' credit profiles and that of the Belarusian sovereign due to the large direct exposure of the banks to the authorities and, more generally, the public sector. This makes the banks' asset quality dependent on the state of government finances and the ability of the authorities to support macroeconomic stability and the public sector. At end-2016, direct exposure to the sovereign (including claims on the government and the central bank) relative to FCC was 2.4x at BPS, 1.5x at BGPB and 2.1x at BelVEB. Loans issued to public sector corporates contributed a further 0.8x at BPS, 1x at BGPB and 2.8x at BelVEB. In contrast with Belarusian state-owned banks, these banks are not involved in new government programme lending, although  BPS has a residual exposure at below 10% of gross loans. More broadly credit risks remain high as the economy is sluggish and borrower performance remains constrained by generally significant leverage in the corporate sector and high loan dollarisation (BPS: 70%; BGPB: 75%; BelVEB: 84% of loans), while the share of hedged borrowers is limited. Asset quality metrics have weakened across the board during 2015-2016. We expect this trend to continue through 2017 as operating conditions remain challenging. BPS's asset quality is somewhat worse than peers'. Its individually impaired loans (as per IFRS accounts) grew to a high 57% of end-1Q17 loans (36% at end-2015), reflecting deterioration in borrowers' financial performance and/or collateral value. The bank's own assessment suggests that about 38% of loans are of higher-risk, on top of  non-performing loans (NPLs, loans over 90 days overdue) of 21% of loans at end-1Q17 (end-2015: 10%), of which many are in the construction and real estate segment (CRE). BPS's asset quality ratios were helped by the transfer of high-risk loans in 2Q17 (5% of total loans at end-1Q17) to the parent bank, which also guaranteed some of the high-risk exposures (a further 40% of loans at end-1Q17). BGPB's and BelVEB's individually impaired loans were also high at respectively, 51% and 32% of gross loans at end-2016 (end-2015: 49% and 34%). At the same time, reported NPLs were small at 1.6% at BGPB and 0.3% at BelVEB, helped by loan restructuring/rollovers and also reflecting both banks' more limited exposure to the troubled CRE segment. However, judging by the high volume of impaired loans, we believe, that asset quality is vulnerable. Fitch views capitalisation as modest given the banks' risk profiles and high levels of individually impaired loans, which net of reserves, stood at 1.7x FCC at BPS, 2x at BGPB and 1.5x at BelVEB. At end-5M17, all three banks' regulatory Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy ratios were above the required minimums of 7.25% and 11.25%  (including buffers): BPS at 12.8% and 21%, BGPB at 9.7% and 17.4%, and BelVEB at 8.3% and 15.5%. These capital cushions allowed only limited loss absorption capacity equal to 6% of loans at BPS, 5% at BGPB and 1.7% at BelVEB, without breaching regulatory minimum levels (including buffers). Pre-impairment profitability (net of accrued interest not received in cash) was solid at 6.8% of average gross loans at BPS, 7.9% at BGPB and more moderate at 4.9% at BelVEB in 2016. However, in Fitch's view there is some uncertainty about the ability of some borrowers to service loans out of their own cash flows rather than through receipt of new credit. Provisioning requirements remained high at all three banks in 1Q17, wiping out 61%-79% of their annualised pre-impairment profits. The majority of funding is from domestic customers, but is highly dollarised (over 65% of customer accounts at the three banks). Deposits have been stable recently, limiting immediate liquidity pressure and banks' liquidity is also supported by limited third-party wholesale repayments and availability of undrawn committed liquidity lines from the parent institutions. At end-5M17, liquidity cushions (cash and equivalents, net of short third-party interbank exposures, securities eligible for refinancing with the central bank and unused credit lines from parents) accounted for over 100% of customer funding at BPS, 62% at BGPB and 20% at BelVEB. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs could be upgraded or downgraded if a change in Belarus's sovereign ratings results in a change in the Country Ceiling, although this is currently unlikely given the Stable Outlook on the sovereign rating. VRs Downgrades of VRs could result from capital erosion due to further marked deterioration in asset quality without sufficient and timely support being made available by parents. Upgrades of VRs above the sovereign rating are extremely unlikely given the high sovereign exposure/dependence of many borrowers on some form of sovereign support.

In the first phase, India's biggest power producer, NTPC (NTPC.NS), plans to build three new plants with a combined capacity of more than 5 gigawatts (GW), nearly double the capacity of those currently being phased out, five senior company officials said. The company has not made the investment public because it has not yet received government approval. If approved, the plan could set back efforts by the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter to control carbon output and raise questions about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vow to stand by commitments under the Paris climate accord. The proposal also comes as several coal-fired stations built in the last power boom a decade ago are standing idle due to softer-than-expected demand. State-controlled Coal India (COAL.NS) is struggling to sell its stockpile as a result.     But other indicators indicate demand will pick up, a top NTPC executive said, asking not to be named because the plan had not yet been announced.  I don't think (the current) electricity surplus will be there for a long time,  he told Reuters.  We should not fool ourselves.  More than 300 million of India's 1.3 billion people are still not hooked up to the grid, according to NITI Aayog, which makes policy recommendations to the government. As connections improve, the panel reckons, the country's per-capita power consumption could jump around a third to up to 2,924 kilowatt-hours by 2040 from 2012 levels. In the next decade, the around 50 GW of capacity from thermal plants due to come online by 2022 will meet demand, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said. Additional supplies will come from sources such as solar and wind, it said. Asked about NTPC's plan, CEA chairman RK Verma said the commercial decisions of the company were its own affair.  NTPC is a commercial organization and they must be having their own commercial considerations,  Verma said. For its part, a spokesperson at NTPC would say only:  NTPC takes decisions after consulting both the CEA and the ministry of power.  Thermal vs Renewable Solar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in three years to more than 12 GW since Modi targeted raising energy generation from renewable sources to 175 GW by 2022, against total installed capacity at the end of May of 330.3 GW.     Around 78 percent of generated power in India at the moment still comes from coal-fired plants, however, making it one of the biggest users of the dirty and cheap fuel in the world. Carbon dioxide emissions from India's thermal plants are expected to jump to 1,165 million tonnes by 2026/27 from 462 million tonnes in 2005, the CEA estimates. Emission intensity, measured in carbon dioxide emissions versus GDP, is likely to fall, however. India is undergoing a program to retrofit several coal-fired plants to reduce emissions. (bit.ly/2tBpNFI) The plants planned by NTPC are  supercritical , meaning they are 2-3 percent more efficient than conventional plants and therefore have lower emissions. NTPC's proposal is likely to be greeted with alarm by environmental activists who are already worried by the CEA's statement that existing power plants are unlikely to meet India's emission norms before the Paris deadline of December this year.  Adding more power plants would aggravate health impacts even further,  said Sunil Dahiya, an energy activist with Greenpeace in New Delhi, when asked about the possibility of new coal-fired plants.  NTPC's proposal is to build plants of two 660 megawatt (MW) units each at Singrauli in central India's Madhya Pradesh and Talcher in Odisha in the east.  The biggest plant, with a capacity of 2.4 GW in the eastern state of Jharkhand, was close to getting clearance from the environment ministry, one of many steps in the process of getting government approval, one of the senior company officials said.  A plan announced by NTPC last year to generate 10 GW of energy from renewable sources by 2022 was making slow progress due to land acquisition issues, another company official said.

Korea intercontinental missile lands in Japanese waters * S. Korea won drops, safe-haven yen strengthens * Oil ends run of gains on US supply drop as traders take profits * Risk aversion, dollar moderation boosts gold, bonds By Marc Jones LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - World shares pulled back and bonds and gold regained favour on Tuesday as a long-range ballistic missile test by North Korea and July 4 holidays for U.S. markets dampened risk appetite. Asian shares were pushed lower and South Korea's won slid to a 16-week low after the North's missile landed in Japanese territorial waters amid assertions from Pyongyang that it could now strike  anywhere in the world . Europe saw a modest drop too as the pressure to lock in profit after Monday's biggest jump in over two months outweighed a recovery during the day of commodity stocks as oil thrust upwards again after an overnight wobble. Traditional safety plays fared well amid the caution. The Japanese yen and gold were both higher, as were European bonds and Treasuries, which have been clobbered by recent signs that the era of emergency stimulus and ultra low interest rates might be coming to an end. The ECB's chief economist said healthier inflation remained  crucially contingent  on  very easy  financing conditions, while Sweden's central bank sounded reassuringly cautious even as it hinted at tighter policy going forward, That took the wind out of the Swedish crown, which had been the best performing global currency over the last week. The Australian dollar also took a tumble as its central bank steered clear of rate hike talk at its latest meeting. Credit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri said the Swedish Riksbank's move showed how wary central banks remained about their currencies, while the day's other main focus was North Korea's posturing.  North Korea is continuing to provoke,  he said. Although markets were now used to these kind of events, he added:  It is a bit more important as it came ahead of the G20 meeting this week.  Leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes when they meet in Germany. U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter:  North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?  This was an apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. With the market quiet in the absence of U.S. trading, the dollar mainly drifted. It lost 0.2 percent on the yen to leave it buying 113.19 yen and dropped 0.5 percent on the Canadian dollar, but made almost as much back against the Aussie dollar and Swedish crown and inched up to $1.1348 to the euro. On Monday the six-currency dollar index had seen its biggest jump since the start of March, after a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index had also propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since mid May. Emerging Strains There were increasing signs that alongside the geopolitical jitters, higher global borrowing rates and the dollar were starting to pressure emerging markets after their stellar start to the year. MSCI's widely-tracked emerging equity index saw its sharpest one-day drop in nearly three weeks and most Asian currencies were weaker. The won is now down 3 percent over the last two weeks, the Indonesian rupiah has erased weeks of gains in the last two days and the Philippine peso is stuck near multi-year lows.  The bigger-picture driver for these movements you are seeing in emerging market currencies, at least over the past two weeks, are signs of a more hawkish turn from central banks – including the ECB, Fed and the Bank of England,  UniCredit EM FX analyst Kiran Kowshik said. The next major data point is likely to be Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report. China's central bank, meanwhile, warned on Tuesday that its economy still faces  relatively big  downward pressure and that parts of its financial system lacked sufficient regulation. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei surrendered gains to end 0.1 percent down, South Korea's KOSPI closed 0.6 percent lower, though Hong Kong was hardest hit by the regional jitters as it slumped as much as 2 percent at one point. Tokyo, reacting to the North's missile test, strongly protested what it called Pyongyang's clear violation of U.N. resolutions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles in efforts to stop Pyongyang's arms programme. Commodity markets also saw a shift. Gold was shining at $1,224 an ounce while oil managed to steady near $50 a barrel although it still looked on course for its first dip in nine sessions which have amounted to its longest run of gains since February 2012. U.S. crude was flat at $47.00 a barrel while global benchmark Brent dropped fractionally to $49.64 as traders cashed in some gains from a 3.7 percent leap - its biggest in one day since December 2016 - on Monday.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said. However, it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year-on-year in 2018 .

Tensions between European Union countries over how to share the burden of migrants flared in 2015 when hundreds of thousands, many fleeing wars in Africa and the Middle East, began arriving in EU territory, mainly via Greece, and headed for Germany, Austria and other nearby affluent states. Austria took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers at the time, which helped increase support for the far-right Freedom Party. Keen to avoid another influx, it said it would introduce controls at the busy Brenner Pass border crossing with Italy if one materialized there. That has not yet happened but Italy recently asked other EU countries to help it cope with a surge in migrants reaching its southern Mediterranean shores from Africa, raising concern in Austria that many will soon show up at its border with Italy. That is a political hot potato in Austria, where a parliamentary election is scheduled in October with immigration shaping up as a central issue.  Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil told the mass-circulation Kronen Zeitung in an interview published on Tuesday that he expected restrictions would be introduced along the Alpine boundary with Italy  very soon .  Related CoverageItaly criticizes Austria border control plan, warns of security repercussionsOther Austrian officials, including Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka, who oversees crossings like Brenner, said there was currently no reason to introduce controls and Austria remained vigilant, a stance Vienna has repeated for the past year. Echoing his counterpart, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said there was  no emergency  at the Brenner Pass, and Italian and Austrian police were cooperating perfectly.  I am frankly surprised by the comments  from Doskozil, Minniti said in a statement.  This is an unjustified and unprecedented initiative which, if not immediately corrected, will inevitably create repercussions on security cooperation.  An Austrian defense ministry spokesman said controls would include Brenner and that four armored vehicles had already been deployed to the area to block roads, with 750 troops poised to be brought in within 72 hours to deal with emergencies. FILE PHOTO: Migrants disembark from Dattilo coast guard vessel in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta, Italy, March 20, 2017.Antonio Parrinello/File Photo These are not battle tanks. These are armored vehicles without weapons which could block roads. These were already used during the refugee crisis of 2015/16 at the Spielfeld border crossing (with Slovenia),  he said.     Austria coordinated with nearby Balkan countries last year to effectively close what was then the main route into Europe for migrants. The move drew complaints at the time that it was undermining the EU's principle of free movement, though Vienna says it did what it had to do to safeguard its borders. Italy, alongside other states on the bloc's fringes, has complained it is now bearing the brunt and the cost of the migrant crisis. It said last year that any plans to introduce controls at the Brenner Pass, a major road and rail link between northern and southern Europe, would break EU law. Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil arrives for a meeting of European Union defence ministers at the EU Council in Brussels, Belgium May 18, 2017.Eric Vidal National Measures  Doskozil said the EU was not doing enough to stem the migrant flow.  The situation should stir all of us into action,  he told ORF radio. If the EU does not manage to jointly find solutions, he added,  national measures will be necessary .     Doskozil's spokesman said there was no concrete timetable for the new controls on the Italian border.  But we see how the situation in Italy is becoming more acute and we have to be prepared to avoid a situation comparable to summer 2015.   European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans told a news conference in Strasbourg that Austria had not notified the commission of any extra border protection plans.   More than 85,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Italy by boat from North Africa so far this year, making it the main point of entry into Europe.  France, Germany and the EU executive pledged more support for Italy on Monday, but made no direct reference to Rome's plea to allow migrant-rescue boats to dock in other countries' ports. Controls at the Brenner Pass would be particularly sensitive as the frontier there separates two regions that feel closely connected - Austria's Tyrol and Italy's South Tyrol. South Tyrol was once part of the wider Austro-Hungarian empire but was annexed by Italy at the end of World War One in 1918.

Northern Ireland's political scene has been in crisis since the collapse in January of the coalition mandated under a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian Protestant-Catholic violence in which 3,600 died. The Irish Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein and the Protestant pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have been in talks since a March election to form a new power-sharing government. Each has blamed the other for missing repeated deadlines - most recently last Thursday. The British government, which is jointly overseeing the talks alongside Ireland's government, warned on Monday that it would have to step in to manage public spending in the province, and might call new elections unless a deal was reached soon. Related CoverageNorthern Ireland executive will not be formed in 'immediate term': UK ministerSinn Fein blames May for Northern Ireland talks failureBoth parties said on Tuesday that no deal had been agreed and that progress was not expected in the near future. A source in Sinn Fein said a deal was unlikely before September.   Obviously we are disappointed that we don't have an agreement this afternoon and indeed we've been disappointed for quite some time that we haven't been able to reach an agreement,  DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters.  However we are going to keep working at it over the summer and hopefully we can come to an agreement later on in the year.  Sinn Fein blamed the impasse on British Prime Minister Theresa May, who struck a separate deal last week with the DUP to support her minority government in the British parliament - something they say has compromised the government's neutrality.  What this constitutes is a monumental failure on behalf of Theresa May. She has set back decades of work that has been done here throughout the years,  said Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O'Neill. Commentators see little prospect of agreement during the July marching season, when pro-British unionists celebrate the 1690 victory by Protestant King William of Orange over his Catholic rival at the Battle of the Boyne. Britain's Northern Ireland minister, James Brokenshire, signaled he would be prepared to wait for a deal. He said the government wanted to remain engaged in the talks, and that the overriding priority was to reach an agreement on restoring the executive.  The DUP and Sinn Fein alike have been buoyed by historic electoral breakthroughs in recent months - Sinn Fein in regional elections in March and the DUP in Britain's general election last month - and both are reluctant to  be seen to give ground to their rivals.   The Sinn Fein electorate will not consent to be governed by DUP on DUP terms,  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said.  The Irish and British governments have warned that failing to forge a deal would have  profound and serious  implications and limit Northern Ireland's influence in Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union, although no one is forecasting a return to serious violence.

Adds paragraphs 2, 6, 7 to clarify.) By Noor Zainab Hussain July 4 (Reuters) - Britain's 'bad bank', which is charged with winding down the assets of two failed lenders, said it expects to repay a significant part of the loans Bradford & Bingley received when it was bailed out by March next year. UK Asset Resolution Authority (UKAR) says that it expects to sell another tranche of Bradford & Bingley's mortgage portfolio, enabling it to pay the outstanding 4.8 billion pounds ($6.20 billion) it owes to Britain's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), by March next year. UKAR sold the first tranche of Bradford and Bingley's 15.65 billion pound mortgage portfolio in March 2017 to insurer Prudential and buyout firm Blackstone for 11.8 billion pounds.  We are working on the next phase of the programme which we look to launch in the next months with a full repayment (of FSCS loan) expected by March 2018,  said Ian Hares, chief executive of UKAR. Hares did not specify how much of Bradford & Bingley's assets UKAR planned to sell to repay the FSCS loan, which covers compensation given to bank customers. Including the FSCS loan and settlement of the Prudential and Blackstone sale, the UK government is still owed 13.6 billion pounds for the Bradford & Bingley bailout. Sky News reported last week that Blackstone was now looking to buy as much as 6 billion pounds of Bradford & Bingley mortgage loans. Hares said that a sale is in the works, but a formal process had not been launched yet.  I am not in a position to confirm any names because the process has not been formally launched yet. But, there are a number of interested parties,  he said.  Blackstone bought the last one so it wouldn't be a surprise if they are in there again.  Sky also named OneSavings Bank, Och-Ziff, and hedge fund TPG as interested parties. UKAR, a state-run loan firm that does not take on new business, said on Tuesday it repaid 3.3 billion pounds ($4.27 billion) to the government last year. UKAR has now returned 23.7 billion pounds to the government, almost half the total value it owed when it was created in October 2010. UKAR is winding down the loans of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley, which were nationalized in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. UKAR's underlying profit before tax fell by almost 33 percent to 706 million pounds in the year ended March, reflecting in part a 9 billion pound reduction in its loan book.

The beer maker, the local division of the world's leading spirit maker Diageo, said funds raised will support Guinness in executing its strategy in the face of a recession in Africa's biggest economy. Guinness plans to issue five new shares to existing shareholders for every 11 held at 58 naira each, a 10.2 percent discount to Tuesday's market price of 64.57 naira.  Our expectation is that funds raised will help mitigate the impact of increasing finance costs, optimize our balance sheet and improve the company's financial flexibility,  Chief Executive Peter Ndegwa said in a statement. The company, which is 54 percent owned by Diageo, reported in September last year a pretax loss of 2.35 billion naira for the year ended June 30, its first annual loss in 30 years, triggering the share sale. Shareholders approved the sale in January. It said it had also received the green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Last year Guinness acquired the rights to distribute Johnnie Walker whisky and Baileys liqueur in Nigeria and commissioned a 4.7 billion naira production line at one of its plant to produce spirits locally. Guinness Nigeria shares, which have fallen 18 percent so far this year, shed 4.99 percent on the Lagos bourse on Tuesday. The stock fell 31 percent last year.

Researchers examined data on more than 91,000 patients admitted to California hospitals for a heart attack from 2001 to 2011. They didn't find a meaningful difference in one-year survival odds between black and white people when hospitals went on ambulance diversion for less than six hours on the day of patients' heart attacks. But when hospitals diverted ambulances for longer, black patients were more likely to die within a year of their heart attack, the study team reports in Health Affairs.   Black patients still fared worse compared to white patients even though both experienced the same level of diversion, had the same access to technology, received the same measurable treatment, and were treated in similar hospitals,  said lead study author Dr. Renee Hsia, an emergency physician at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. Ambulance diversion happens when emergency departments are too crowded to take care of any more patients, and the goal is to send people instead to other hospitals that may be able to treat them sooner.  You can imagine it's like being at a grocery checkout stand, where one line is way too long, so you self-adjust to go to a shorter line. In healthcare, though, since you can't see how crowded each ER is, the system tries to put you in a shorter line,  Hsia said by email.  The problem, however, is that the next checkout line is at least several miles away, if not more, and the items in your grocery cart - basically your organs - have an expiration date of a few minutes to a few hours,  Hsia added.  So you can see, it's a precarious situation.  Overall, 52 percent of white patients and 48 percent of black patients went to the nearest hospital because ambulance diversion was not necessary.  In the entire group, 23 percent of patients died within one year of their heart attacks. When black patients had a heart attack on a day that the nearest hospital was on diversion for about six to 12 hours, however, their odds of dying within one year were 4.1 percentage points higher than for white people.  When the closest hospital was on diversion for 12 hours or more on the day patients had a heart attack, black people had one-year mortality odds 3.1 percentage points higher than white people. But based on the one-year risk of dying in the entire group, a 4 percentage point increase for blacks represents nearly a 19 percent increase in risk relative to whites, the authors point out.  Limitations of the study include the reliance on hospitals to accurately report ambulance diversion data to local health officials, the authors note. It's also possible that some patients didn't have heart attacks at home, the address used to determine their nearest hospital, and might have instead been closer to the hospital where they were treated.  Results from California also might not apply to other places in the U.S., particularly states with more rural populations, the researchers add.  Still, previous studies have found ambulance diversion isn't uncommon for heart attack patients and when it happens, they have higher odds of dying, said Dr. Joaquin Cigarroa, clinical chief of the Knight Cardiovascular Institute at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.  Individual patients can't control whether ambulance diversion happens, but they can take steps to increase their survival odds when they suspect they're having a heart attack, Cigarroa, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  Recognize signs and symptoms of a heart attack, dial 911, and ask to be taken to the nearest hospital with a heart catheterization laboratory,  Cigarroa said.  Signs can include chest pain, shortness of breath, breaking out in a cold sweat, dizziness or nausea, according to the American Heart Association.  Patients should also make sure they leave the hospital with the right medications, which might include blood thinners, or drugs to lower cholesterol or blood pressure.  In addition, prior to discharge, make sure you are referred to a cardiac rehab program and have a follow-up with a heart doctor,  Cigarroa said.  .","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heartattack-er-crowding-idUSKBN19P23N"},

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.  What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side,  Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.  There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement . The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.  We hope others will respond in a similar spirit.  Qatar says it is ready to meet any  reasonable  demands. But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty. Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, Kaabi said. The decision will have international ramifications. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end  in the coming hours  with the Qatari response to demands.  We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses,  he said.  We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures.  Iranian Question The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.  Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil.  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,   said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell.  For Qatar, LNG is everything.

Poorly designed medication labels and dosing tools lead to dosing errors, especially when parents are given large cups for small doses, the study team writes in Pediatrics, June 27. “Parents frequently make errors in dosing medications for their children. We did this study because we wanted to find out how to redesign medication labels and dosing tools to help parents understand dosing instructions better,” lead author Dr. Shonna Yin told Reuters Health in an email. It is very easy to get confused when dosing liquid medications for a child, said Yin, a pediatrician at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.  “To help make sure they give the right dose, parents should ask their doctor or pharmacist which dosing tool is best to use,” she said. The best tool depends on the amount of medication the parent needs to give the child, Yin said. “Using a tool that is too large or too small makes it more likely that a parent will make a mistake.” The researchers recruited 491 English- and Spanish-speaking parents of children age 8 years or younger, and randomly assigned them to one of four groups, each with a different combination of medication labels and dosing tools including assorted cups and syringes. Parents were given a medication label with instructions in text only, or both text and pictograms, plus dose measuring tools marked only in milliliters (mL) or in both mL and teaspoons.  Participants were asked to demonstrate how they’d use the labels and to measure three different dosage amounts using three different tools.  About 84 percent of parents made at least one error and almost 30 percent made at least one large error such as doubling the correct dose.  There were fewer errors, however, when labels contained both text and pictograms and when dosing cups or syringes were close to and at least as large as the amount of medication needed.  For a 2-mL dose, for example, the fewest errors were seen with the 5-mL syringe and for the 7.5-mL dose, the fewest errors were with the 10-mL syringe. In addition, parents were about 30 percent more likely to make mistakes when they used tools marked in mL and teaspoons compared to mL only. “It is important for parents to use a tool that has markings on it to help them measure out the right amount. This could be an oral syringe, a dropper, a dosing spoon, dosing cup, or even a measuring spoon that is usually used for cooking,” Yin said.  When using any of these tools, parents should carefully check to see that the number and the units used on the tool match what they are trying to give, she added. “Mixing up milliliters and teaspoons can lead to a parent giving 5 times the dose. If there is no dosing tool at home that has markings on it, I would recommend going to the store to get one or trying to get one from the doctor or pharmacist,” Yin said. “The study makes it clear that it’s easy to make mistakes with liquid medicine and that using the right syringe can help and that instructions with pictures help as well,” said Dr. Kathleen Walsh, director of patient safety research at the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio. “There are certain medicines that people tend to think of as safe but actually if you make a big dosing error can be very dangerous, for example, Tylenol or Benadryl are medicines you really want to be careful to give the right dose,” she said.

Shell said it assesses climate change risks internally but it has so far not disclosed in detail what financial impact climate-related risks could have. A think-tank estimated last month that energy companies could be wasting more than $2 trillion by 2025 on projects that will not be needed if governments' carbon-reduction targets are met.  It is right that it should be transparent which companies are truly on firm foundations over the long-term,  Shell CEO Ben van Beurden wrote in a post on social media platform LinkedIn.

The town of al-Awamiya, located in the oil-producing al-Qatif province, is a flashpoint between the Sunni Muslim government and minority Shi'ites complaining of discrimination. The soldier was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade in the old part of the town known as al-Musawara and an investigation was underway, the ministry's spokesman told state news agency SPA, but gave no further details. Authorities have been bulldozing al-Musawara, a small part of the town with narrow streets which date back more than 200 years, to make way for a new project. Local officials say wanted militants believed to be behind attacks on security forces have been using the narrow streets to escape arrest. Last month, a Saudi soldier was killed and two members of the security forces were wounded when an explosive device went off during a patrol in the same area. Saudi Shi'ites complain of marginalization in the birthplace of Islam, which follows the rigid Wahhabi Sunni school that views the minority sect as heretical. Saudi authorities deny the accusations. Qatif has seen protests for more rights for Shi'ite and these have become more frequent since Nimr al-Nimr, a Shi'ite cleric convicted of involvement in violence, was executed a year ago.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Oliver Reinberg raised his recommendation on Stada shares to  hold  from  reduce  on Tuesday, saying he assumed a new bid by Bain and Cinven would reach its mark.

Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies  From Here to Eternity  and  Planet of the Apes.

The pound, which at the start of the week was trading less than half a cent away from nine-month highs on bets the Bank of England could raise interest rates by the end of the year, dipped to a six-day low of $1.2918 after the data.  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey showed activity falling to 54.8 in June, still above the 50 level that denotes growth but down from May's 18-month high of 56.0 and slightly below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.     The equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector, released on Monday, had shown activity grew much more slowly than forecast in June. But MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman said these surveys should be taken  with a pinch of salt , as they reflected political uncertainty last month, when the ruling Conservative party unexpectedly lost its majority in parliamentary elections.  We had heightened political uncertainty last month, and that could have weighed on business confidence,  he said.  That's potentially why the data is coming in weaker than expected, but I suppose one of the key tests going forward will be whether that loss of confidence will be sustained.  Still, the weak data rippled through the bond markets posing fresh headwinds for sterling. Government bond yields are down by 2-3 basis points across the board since the start of the week. The BoE is pondering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, and is watching for signs that other areas of growth can offset a consumer spending slowdown, caused by a rise in inflation and a slowing in pay growth. One of the BoE's interest rate-setters, Gertjan Vlieghe, said late on Monday he favoured keeping borrowing costs at their historic lows, despite a shift among some of his peers at the central bank in favour of a first hike in a decade. But that seemed to have no impact on sterling, which recorded its best week in eight months last week after BoE Governor Mark Carney said a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months.   The BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited.

U.S. financial markets were closed for the July Fourth holiday, greatly reducing market liquidity worldwide and driving many investors to avoid making big trades.     The Brazilian real and the Mexican peso were nearly flat, oscillating in tight ranges as traders erred on the side of caution.     Shares of miners and steelmakers, such as Brazil's Vale SA  and Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais SA , followed iron ore prices lower, capping gains on the country's benchmark Bovespa stock index.     For-profit college operator Estácio Participações SA  was the biggest riser following a report that the government may tap government funds to subsidize student loans.      Shares of power utility Renova Energia SA, which are not part of the benchmark index, jumped the most since mid-April after Reuters reported that Brookfield Asset Management Inc made a formal bid for control of the Brazilian renewable energy company.     Wider emerging stocks fell sharply earlier on Tuesday as North Korea's latest missile test heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula.

Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended down 0.3 percent at 7,357.23 points, having broken a four-day losing streak in the previous session. Mid caps declined 0.1 percent. Payment processor Worldpay rocketed 27.7 percent after news it received competing bids from U.S. credit card technology firm Vantiv and JPMorgan Chase Bank. Analysts said other companies might now be interested in bidding.  We believe Worldpay is a unique asset, and the current interest from two U.S. peers could also trigger the intention of parties like Google, Amazon, Apple,  a note from Mediobanca Securities said. This comes after Danish peer Nets rose in the previous session when it confirmed that it had received an offer from potential buyers. Tuesday saw banking stocks ease 0.8 percent, following strong gains in the previous session. Oil stocks ended flat as oil prices stabilised near $50 a barrel on signs that U.S. crude production may be slowing. Shares in BP fell 0.3 percent. HSBC and Standard Chartered were 1.1 percent and 0.6 percent lower. Results helped shares in grocer Sainsbury edge around 0.3 percent higher. Britain's second-largest supermarket said sales growth accelerated in its latest quarter, helped by inflation and warm weather. Shares in peer Morrison nudged 0.4 percent higher. Tesco was down 0.1 percent. The impact of inflation, both on wages and on the cost of food imports, has been a cause for concern for British supermarkets since sterling's drop after Britain voted to leave the European Union last June.  You've got the dual impact of higher prices which is pushing revenue up. What we don't see today is the effect that has on (Sainsbury's) cost, so it's a bit of a double-edged sword,  George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.  My overall impression is that while things are moving forwards, the headwinds are looking strong as well, so it's just a tough time for the sector.  Outside the blue chips, small-cap Imagination Technologies jumped around 9 percent after reporting full year results, saying it had returned to profitability. Its shares remain down nearly 40 percent this year after Apple, its biggest customer, said in April it would stop using Imagination's graphics technology in its new products .

Tanzania's President John Magufuli has sent shock-waves through the mining community with a series of actions since his election in 2015 that he says are to distribute revenue to the Tanzanian people. Speaking at a televised public rally in northwest Tanzania on Tuesday, Magufuli said he had decided to rush through bills passed on Monday because Tanzania was fighting an economic war.  We couldn't wait to pass the laws because of the large scale theft taking place in the mining sector,  Magufuli said. Tanzania's largest miner Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold, said in a statement that notices of arbitration were served on behalf of companies that own its Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines, hit by an export ban.  The serving of the notices at this time is necessary to protect the Company,  Acacia said.  But, this notwithstanding, Acacia remains of the view that a negotiated resolution is the preferable outcome to the current disputes and the company will continue to work to achieve this.      Tanzania accused Acacia of tax evasion in 2016 in a case that is ongoing and was this year accused of operating illegally. The miner denies the allegations. And in March, Magufuli imposed an export ban on unprocessed ore to encourage the construction of local smelters, rather than allow profits from processing to be accrued abroad. International mining companies have said mining must help to enhance the economic development of Tanzania, but the relationship has to be a fair partnership. Shares in Acacia, which have nearly halved since the export ban in March, were down nearly 1 percent by 1345 GMT.

Uber played down the non-binding opinion from an advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), saying it applied only to a service using unlicensed drivers known as UberPOP, which it had already discontinued in France. Judges will make a final ruling later this year. However, they generally follow the advice of their advocates general and the comments come two months after another opinion, which rejected Uber's argument that it was only a digital platform and so subject to less regulation than a transport firm. The European court battles are being fought as Uber struggles with last month's departure of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick following a string of scandals that have hit a global star of the U.S. tech industry. The latest case before the ECJ was referred to it by a French court in Lille and concerns a 2014 French law on taxis and chauffeured services which makes it a criminal offense to organize illegal taxi services and sets restrictions on the use of software to find customers in the street. Uber had argued that it was not a taxi company and that the criminal fines imposed on two of its French managers were not valid because the French taxi law infringed EU rules under which limitations on digital services in the bloc require prior approval from Brussels. Advocate General Maciej Szpunar, who also provided the opinion in the Spanish case in May, disagreed and upheld France's right to prohibit and punish illegal transport activities like UberPOP without seeking EU approval of its law. The logo of Uber is seen on an iPad, during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei, Taiwan April 13, 2017.Tyrone Siu - Member states may prohibit and punish, as a matter of criminal law, the illegal exercise of transport activities in the context of the UberPOP service, without notifying the Commission of the draft law in advance,  he said in statement. Uber said it now only operates in France with licensed cab drivers, as it does in many of its main European markets. Uber was fined 800,000 euros ($908,000) last year and two of its executives were also fined for running an illegal taxi service with UberPOP. The case is currently being appealed and an outcome is expected at the end of the year. Notably, Szpunar also said that member states remained free to punish illegal transport activities provided by intermediaries such as Uber without asking for Brussels' green light regardless of whether Uber was considered a transport or an information society service. Damien Geradin, a professor of competition law and economics at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, said the impact of a potential ruling along the lines of Tuesday's opinion would have little impact on Uber's operations in France, but would have wider ramifications for how it is regulated across Europe.  More generally, the significance of the opinion is that it shows once again that Szpunar resists any qualification that Uber’s services can be considered as information society services,  Geradin said.  This is a missed opportunity as these provisions would protect Uber against discriminatory or disproportionate rules adopted in the member states, while still allowing member states to regulate the underlying services (provided by the drivers) to protect riders, drivers and third parties.

Officials at the central bank have been unnerved by a rise in the euro and in government bond yields since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door a week ago to policy tweaks. Wary of weakening the economic recovery, some rate-setters have become nervous about dropping a long-standing pledge to expand or extend the ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme if necessary to reach its inflation target of near 2 percent. The ECB's chief economist, Peter Praet, said on Tuesday a continued recovery in euro zone inflation was  crucially contingent  on low borrowing costs and, in turn, on an easy monetary policy from the ECB. Policy tweaks are expected to be discussed when the ECB meets on July 20.  The story does provide support to bond markets,  said Rainer Guntermann, rates strategist at Commerzbank.  But ultimately, the day of reckoning is moving closer for the ECB, and it will have to starting talking more tangibly about tapering.  Euro zone government bond yields fell 1-3 basis points, pulling back from recent highs. In Germany, the bloc's benchmark bond issuer, two-year bond yields fell 3 bps to a one-week low of minus 0.61 percent. News that North Korea has test-launched what it said was a new intercontinental ballistic missile supported safe-haven bonds, although trade was subdued due to the July 4 holiday in the United States. The yield on Germany's 10-year Bund dropped to 0.45 percent at one stage. Though it rose again, it was still down 2 bps on the day at 0.48 percent, and off 3-1/2 month highs hit on Monday. But they remain more than 20 basis points above where they stood a week ago - before Draghi's comments sparked a sharp selloff that accelerated after hawkish comments from British and Canadian central bankers in subsequent days. The general tone of central bank remarks has fuelled a perception that, after a decade of ultra-loose monetary policy, major central banks are seeking to normalise rates and wean markets off a reliance on cheap money without derailing the economic recovery. However, Australia's central bank stuck to a neutral stance on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday. Sweden's central bank said it did not expect more policy easing but did not rule out a further rate cut, given inflation concerns.  One way of interpreting the recent central bank comments is to look at rates, which are still at extraordinarily low levels, and look at growth, which is stronger, and say those emergency levels of rates no longer look appropriate,  said Nick Gartside, International CIO of fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.  This is a transition from policy being extra easy to just easy and that can be ... hard for central banks to communicate.  Elsewhere, Greece's 10-year borrowing costs dropped further towards the 5 percent mark at which sources told Reuters the country will return to bond markets. The yield on the Greek 10-year government bond fell 7 basis points to 5.35 percent, the lowest level since December 2009.

It is a fate that has befallen only two women at Wimbledon in the professional era -- fellow German Steffi Graf in 1994 and Martina Hingis in 1999 and 2001. But such has been the woeful form of Kerber, many pundits feared she might be heading for a Paris-London first-round exit double on Tuesday -- a day when she had been handed the honor of opening Centre Court proceedings in the absence of title holder Serena Williams. Luckily for her she proved the naysayers wrong with her 6-4 6-4 win over American qualifier Irina Falconi.  However, the manner of her win against an opponent who had never won a match at Wimbledon in four previous visits and is ranked 247th, would have done little to quell the belief that Kerber is unlikely to repeat her spectacular 2016 run when she finished runner-up to Williams.

Slideshow (3 Images)A season after being the toast of the tennis world by winning two grand slam titles and finishing runner up to Williams at the All England Club, the 29-year-old admitted that life at the top had not been an easy ride.   There is much more expectation, much more pressure, from me, from outside, from everything,  said Kerber, whose number one ranking is on the line during the Wimbledon fortnight.  It's easier to go there than to stay there.  Such have been Kerber's trials and tribulations this year -- reaching only one final compared with a WTA tour-leading eight in 2016 -- that one false move here and the chasing duo of Karolina Pliskova or Simona Halep could unseat her from the top spot.

The 32-year-old, the only Pole to win a grand prix, left Formula One in 2011 after a rallying accident that partially severed his forearm. He had been one of the sport's brightest prospects, with a likely move to Ferrari on the horizon.  If you asked me (before the test) how much I was realistically thinking that coming back to F1 was possible, I would have put myself up to 10 or maximum 20 per cent chance,  he told Britain's Auto Express.  Because I’m very realistic, and I’m keeping my feet on the ground, I’d put it at 80 or 90 per cent (now),  he added. Kubica completed an impressive 115 laps in Valencia in a 2012 Lotus, with the test carried out in considerable secrecy, and said he had been stunned by how well it went.  Media reports indicated he was faster than Renault's Russian test driver Sergey Sirotkin while his simulator times were on a par with German race driver Nico Hulkenberg, who has scored all the team's points so far this season. The BBC said Kubica would be testing again with Renault, although there was no confirmation from the team. There has been speculation that Kubica could be in the frame to replace Britain's Jolyon Palmer, who is having a difficult season and is yet to score a point in eight races. Kubica said his fitness was better than ever, despite the limitations of his arm, and Valencia had been one of the best days of his life.  If I get the phone call, I don’t have to think about it or say, 'Hmm, maybe I can’t do it. I will reply, ‘Yes, I can do it. Let’s go for it.’,  he said, while not wanting to hurry anything.  I cannot step straight into racing F1. I won’t do it. It’d be crazy. If someone called me and asked me to race next week, I wouldn’t do it. It’s not because I don’t feel I’m capable of doing it; I just feel that I cannot rush,  he explained.  It would be a difficult call to say no, of course, but after the accident I worked a lot on my mental comfort, my mental zone, and these months have been the happiest months of my past six years.

The former world number 17 lost 6-3 6-4 6-3 in only 84 minutes and headed out of the All England Club with his first-round losers' check of 35,000 pounds ($45,241).  It was definitely a mental issue out there. Wasn't mentally and physically there to perform. I don't know why, but, you know, I felt a little bit bored out there to be completely honest with you,  the 24-year-old told reporters.  I tried at the end and stuff, he managed to win that set 6-3 or 6-4, but it was too late.  Tomic, whose career has stagnated since being touted as Australia's next grand slam winning hope, entered into a bizarre exchange with a reporter after being asked whether he would consider handing back his prize money.  Which money?  he said.  Well, if you ask (Roger) Federer to give back $500 million, would he do that or not?  Reminded that he had said he was bored, Tomic continued:  We all work for money. At 34, maybe I can donate to charity. If you ask Roger if he'll do it, I'll do it.  It is not the first time Tomic's attitude has been called into question. In 2012 he was suspended from Australia's Davis Cup team with Tennis Australia citing his poor attitude. In 2014 he was booed on Rod Laver Arena after quitting with an injury against Rafa Nadal at the Australian Open. His off-court behavior has also landed him in trouble - in 2015 he was arrested in Miami on charges of trespassing and resisting arrest after a late-night party. Tomic, who reached the Wimbledon fourth round last year, faces a further drop in the rankings from his current position of 59th. He said a lack of motivation was the problem.  It's a roller coaster, and I just can't seem to find the commitment to work hard, to enjoy, and to lift trophies,  he said.  Maybe I have to look at a few things, maybe play less tournaments. The last two years, nothing motivates.  One person on Twitter was so upset about Tomic's defeat on Tuesday he called on him to be deported from Australia.  That's his opinion. I'm sure he's on the computer somewhere making $50 an hour,  Tomic said.  I'm going to play another 10 years, and I know after my career I won't have to work again.

Spain's Constitutional Court and the conservative government in Madrid have blocked previous secessionist challenges and the government has said it will block any further attempt to hold a referendum. According to the bill, written jointly by the parties which favor secession, the referendum will pose a binary question asking voters whether they want Catalonia, a wealthy region in northeastern Spain, to become an independent nation.  If  Yes  wins, the regional government plans to declare independence within 48 hours. If  No  wins, an early election would be called to form a new regional government. The bill establishes no minimum participation for the referendum's outcome to be valid. FILE PHOTO - A woman covered with an  Estelada  (Catalan separatist flag) shouts slogans during a pro-independence rally in Barcelona, Spain June 11, 2017.Albert GeaIn 2014, Catalonia held a non-binding election on whether the region should be independent despite pressure from Madrid. While more than 80 percent agreed, turnout was low, at around 2.2 million out of 5.4 million potential voters. Catalonia's regional government has said that while details of the bill will be debated in the coming weeks, a formal draft will not be sent to the Catalan legislature until August in an effort to forestall the Constitutional Court blocking the legislation. The bill's announcement comes at a difficult time for the regional government led by Carles Puigdemont. On Monday Puigdemont fired a senior member of his government for expressing doubt over the viability of plans to hold the referendum, highlighting tensions between different elements of the governing pro-independence coalition. The Catalan government also faces technical challenges and has so far been unable to secure ballot boxes for the planned referendum.

The June 25 explosion took place after the oil tanker went off road to avoid a collision outside the eastern city of Bahawalpur. A large crowd of people gathered around the truck and many began collecting fuel in containers when the tanker exploded in a huge fireball.   We are actively pursuing the issue and expect our third party investigators to issue a report by Thursday and we will then begin proceedings according to our rules and regulations,  a spokesman for the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), Imran Ghaznavi, said.   Ghaznavi said the tanker was operated by a contractor hired by Shell Pakistan to transport gasoline from the southern port city of Karachi to the eastern city of Multan in Punjab province. Officials had earlier said the truck was traveling to Punjab provincial capital Lahore.  Shell Pakistan Ltd, a subsidiary of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), issued a statement shortly after the accident saying it would cooperate fully with all investigations.  Road safety is a priority at Shell and we have already started our own investigation into the cause of the incident,” the company's managing director, Jawwad Cheema, said in the statement.  It would be unhelpful to speculate on factors that may have contributed to the incident before those investigations are complete,  said a spokesperson for Shell Pakistan when asked about the investigation.   Our transport vehicles undergo regular maintenance and checks to ensure road worthiness, and Shell Pakistan has a dedicated team focused solely on road safety and transport,  the spokesperson added.   At the time of the explosion, a spokesman for the Punjab provincial government said the truck went off the road after it blew a tyre and the driver lost control. The driver survived the accident and the subsequent explosion. Fuel is a precious commodity for villagers in Pakistan, where more than 60 percent of the population survives on $3 a day, according to a World Bank survey. Shell Pakistan said in a report it sent to the oil and gas regulator, and which has been seen by Reuters, that  to avoid collision from behind, the driver moved the tank truck to left hand side of the road on the soft shoulder which resulted in roll over of the tank truck . Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced two million rupees ($20,000) compensation for the families of the victims on June 26. As of Tuesday, the death toll from the explosion was 209 with 60 people being treated in hospitals, a spokesman for Bahawalpur's Victoria Hospital, Amir Mehmood, told Reuters.

The notes are rated three notches below Phoenix's IDR of 'A-', comprising two notches for expected recovery and one for moderate non-performance risk. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes have been issued by Phoenix under its GBP3 billion euro medium term note (EMTN) programme. The proceeds are being used to repay existing senior bank debt. The notes have been issued with a fixed coupon of 5.375% with a maturity of 10 years. The notes rank pari passu with Phoenix's other dated subordinated Tier 2 notes and junior to Phoenix's subordinated Tier 3 notes and unsecured unsubordinated obligations. The level of subordination is reflected in Fitch's 'poor' baseline recovery assumption for the issue. The notes include a mandatory interest deferral feature, which would be triggered if any solvency capital requirement or minimum capital requirement applicable to the issuer or Phoenix Life Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries is not met or if the Prudential Regulation Authority has notified the issuer or Phoenix Life Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries in writing that payments under the notes have to be deferred. Fitch regards these features as leading to moderate non-performance risk. The notes are expected to qualify for 100% regulatory capital recognition under Solvency II. The notes receive 100% equity credit in Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Model, due to the application of the regulatory override. However, given that it is a dated instrument, the notes are treated as 100% debt in Fitch's financial debt leverage calculation. Fitch views the issue as neutral to Phoenix's financial debt leverage and positive to capital adequacy as the new subordinated notes are replacing existing senior bank debt. Fixed-charge coverage is negatively affected as the new notes pay a higher coupon than the senior bank debt they are replacing. The issue will lengthen the maturity profile of Phoenix's financial debt. RATING SENSITIVITIES The notes' rating is subject to the same sensitivities that may affect Phoenix's Long-Term IDR (for more details, see 'Fitch Affirms Phoenix Life & Phoenix Life Assurance; Outlook Positive' dated 28 September 2016 at www.fitchratings.com).

The Bank of Canada has set the stage for interest rate hikes to come as soon as later this month in comments made in recent weeks, surprising many analysts who had not expected a hike until 2018. Two top policymakers said last week that the two interest rate cuts made in 2015 to offset the shock of cheap oil prices have done their job. Markets are now pricing in 54.4 percent odds of a hike after the Bank of Canada's next meeting on July 12.. A hike would be the bank's first since 2010. The bank cut interest rates to 0.50 percent in 2015 and have held steady since. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz reinforced those expectations in an interview with Handelsblatt published on Tuesday, which boosted the Canadian dollar to a nearly 10-month high against the greenback. While Poloz noted that Canada's core inflation, which strips out volatile items, is  fairly soft,  he said monetary policy must anticipate where the economy will be in 18 or 24 months from now.  If we only watched inflation and reacted to inflation, we would never reach our inflation target, we'd always be two years behind in the reaction,  Handelsblatt quoted Poloz as saying.  So we have to look at the rest of our indicators in the models that predict inflation,  he added, suggesting that easing off the accelerator is appropriate even before hitting the target. Canada's annual inflation rate cooled more than expected in May to 1.3 percent, while the three measures of core inflation the central bank set last year also remained subdued. The bank has an inflation target of 2 percent. Canada's output gap - the difference between actual and potential output - would likely close sometime in the first half of 2018, suggesting that by then, inflation should be well into an uptrend, Poloz added. He added that while oil prices have fallen recently, levels between $40 to $50 per barrel are  not a big issue  for now.

The government cut fuel subsidies last week, hiking prices by up to 50 percent as part of the reforms tied to a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan agreement aimed at tightening government finances and attracting foreign investors. The IMF is expected to disburse a second loan installment of $1.25 billion within the coming few weeks. Egypt is struggling to revive its economy since a 2011 uprising drove away tourists and foreign investors - two major sources of foreign currency. The 9.1 deficit target is lower than the 10.8 percent expected for the current year. It has been maintained despite a decision last month to more than double food subsidies and raise some benefits in order to ease the impact of austerity on the country's most vulnerable. The new budget projects economic growth of 4.6 percent, higher than the 3.8-4 percent growth expected this year. It must now be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a formality, before coming into effect.

The 32-year-old, the only Pole to win a grand prix, left Formula One in 2011 after a rallying accident that partially severed his forearm. He had been one of the sport's brightest prospects, with a likely move to Ferrari on the horizon.  If you asked me (before the test) how much I was realistically thinking that coming back to F1 was possible, I would have put myself up to 10 or maximum 20 per cent chance,  he told Britain's Auto Express.  Because I’m very realistic, and I’m keeping my feet on the ground, I’d put it at 80 or 90 per cent (now),  he added. Kubica completed an impressive 115 laps in Valencia in a 2012 Lotus, with the test carried out in considerable secrecy, and said he had been stunned by how well it went.  Media reports indicated he was faster than Renault's Russian test driver Sergey Sirotkin while his simulator times were on a par with German race driver Nico Hulkenberg, who has scored all the team's points so far this season. The BBC said Kubica would be testing again with Renault, although there was no confirmation from the team. There has been speculation that Kubica could be in the frame to replace Britain's Jolyon Palmer, who is having a difficult season and is yet to score a point in eight races. Kubica said his fitness was better than ever, despite the limitations of his arm, and Valencia had been one of the best days of his life.  If I get the phone call, I don’t have to think about it or say, 'Hmm, maybe I can’t do it. I will reply, ‘Yes, I can do it. Let’s go for it.’,  he said, while not wanting to hurry anything.  I cannot step straight into racing F1. I won’t do it. It’d be crazy. If someone called me and asked me to race next week, I wouldn’t do it. It’s not because I don’t feel I’m capable of doing it; I just feel that I cannot rush,  he explained.  It would be a difficult call to say no, of course, but after the accident I worked a lot on my mental comfort, my mental zone, and these months have been the happiest months of my past six years.

Ireland's tax collection was 0.5 percent below target in the year to the end of June up from a shortfall of 2.4 percent reported two months earlier, a level that had raised questions about the government's spending plans. The improvement was mainly due to corporation tax, which was 12.5 percent, or 205 million euros, ahead of target in June, one of the most important months of the year for the tax.  Corporation tax and VAT were ahead of target in the first six months of the year while receipts from income tax and excise duties were below target.  Overall tax revenues were up 4 percent year-on-year by the end of June, improving from the increase of 0.5 percent reported at the end of April.   Ireland's economy has been the best performing in the European Union for the past three years, swelling the tax take in the process. The finance ministry has forecast that tax revenues will grow by 5.2 percent in 2017.  With expenditure 1.4 percent less than planned, the exchequer posted a 2.485 billion euro surplus at the end of June, compared with a deficit of 1.14 billion at the same point a year ago, the ministry said. Ireland aims to cut its deficit to 0.4 percent of gross domestic product this year as it moves toward its first balanced budget in a decade.

Growing deviations from its  capital key  rule, which ties government bond purchases to each country's size, suggest the ECB was having an increasingly hard time finding enough paper to buy while respecting the other constraints of its money-printing scheme. A scarcity of eligible bonds to buy has been mentioned as one of the reasons for the ECB to start winding down the 2.3 trillion euros ($2.61 trillion) programme as inflation recovers.  The ECB is ... still managing to buy more than the prescribed monthly amount of 60 billion euros, although the constraints are becoming more visible and will intensify,  Kim Liu, an analyst at ABN Amro, said. The ECB and the euro zone's central banks bought 10.8 billion euros of French government bonds and 9.3 billion euros worth of equivalent Italian paper, data showed. In each case this is more than 1 billion euros in excess of those countries' quota of the ECB's capital. By contrast, the ECB bought less than half the Portuguese bonds it should have at just 498 million euros. This is because the ECB already owns Portuguese bonds bought during the crisis, meaning it risks breaking a self-imposed rule that bars it from owning more than a third of any country's debt. Suggestions by President Mario Draghi last week that the central bank may change its bond-buying policy rattled markets. Sources have told Reuters the market move had spooked some policymakers, making the nervous about signalling a change in policy when they meet again on July 20.

India-based Tata said in May it had agreed the main terms of a deal with the British regulator to cut benefits for its 15 billion pound ($19.40 billion) UK pension scheme - formerly the main stumbling block in merger talks between the two firms.     Though Tata would continue to back a new pension scheme under the terms of a deal that Thyssenkrupp has declined to publicly comment on, analysts and investors say the German firm sees the deal as significantly de-risking Tata's pension.     Thyssenkrupp is waiting, however, for the final terms, likely to be approved this month, and is also concerned about factors such as political uncertainty in the UK due to Brexit, achieving fair value for its assets, and winning over German unions.      It seems like the pension deal is good enough (for Thyssenkrupp),  said one top-20 Thyssenkrupp investor. A top-10 investor and two other top-20 investors contacted by Reuters were also optimistic about the pension deal.  Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel declined to comment.  On a recent roadshow with investment bank Jefferies, Thyssenkrupp's chief financial officer  communicated confidence that a merger with Tata is nearing as progress is made to restructure Tata's UK pension , the bank said in a note.    Jefferies estimates the merged entity could save 500 million euros through synergies.     A source familiar with Thyssenkrupp's thinking said CFO Guido Kerkhoff was guiding the market that merger talks were well advanced. A separate source said Thyssenkrupp had stopped working on a 'plan B' should current talks fail. Kerkhoff recently told the head of Thyssenkrupp's steel works council the firm will make a decision on its European steel merger by end-September. Merger talks have been underway for nearly two years.     FILE PHOTO:  A Tata Steel sign is seen outside the Tata steelworks near Rotherham, Britain, March 30, 2016.Phil Noble/File PhotoThyssenkrupp is encouraged that the new pension scheme Tata will back will start off in surplus, analysts say.     This is thanks to a 550 million pound payment Tata will make into the scheme, and to benefit cuts such as linking future pension payout hikes to a lower measure of inflation - a move that will save more than 2 billion pounds.    Thyssenkrupp is waiting, however, for details on other terms, including a 33 percent equity stake that the new pension will hold in Tata's UK business.  This could translate into a stake in a merged entity, making the pension scheme an additional part-owner in a company one investor estimated would be worth 4 billion to 5.5 billion euros. Consolidation Tata and Thyssenkrupp are keen to combine their European operations in order to cut costs, tackle over-capacity and achieve industry consolidation. Thyssenkrupp's ultimate plan is to exit steel altogether by spinning off the joint venture.      A 50/50 (or less) type of joint venture remains the favoured structure from Thyssenkrupp's side. Thyssenkrupp could shift up to 3 billion euros worth of pensions into the joint venture to rebalance the ownership structure,  Deutsche Bank said in a note.     Thyssenkrupp's European steel business is more valuable thanTata's, meaning it can offload 3 billion euros worth of pension debt in order to split the joint venture on a 50/50 basis or less, analysts and investors say. One investor close to Thyssenkrupp said a  a sub-50 percent holding  for the German firm is a  very real possibility .  Thyssenkrupp's shares, trading at two-year highs, rose 5 percent on Monday on German press reports that a merger decision is near.  However, over 18 percent of shares available for shorting are out on loan, according to data from FIS’ Astec Analytics, signaling that some investors believe the price will fall.

FILE PHOTO:  A Tata Steel sign is seen outside the Tata steelworks near Rotherham, Britain, March 30, 2016.Phil Noble/File PhotoThyssenkrupp is encouraged that the new pension scheme Tata will back will start off in surplus, analysts say.     This is thanks to a 550 million pound payment Tata will make into the scheme, and to benefit cuts such as linking future pension payout hikes to a lower measure of inflation - a move that will save more than 2 billion pounds.    Thyssenkrupp is waiting, however, for details on other terms, including a 33 percent equity stake that the new pension will hold in Tata's UK business.  This could translate into a stake in a merged entity, making the pension scheme an additional part-owner in a company one investor estimated would be worth 4 billion to 5.5 billion euros. Consolidation Tata and Thyssenkrupp are keen to combine their European operations in order to cut costs, tackle over-capacity and achieve industry consolidation. Thyssenkrupp's ultimate plan is to exit steel altogether by spinning off the joint venture.      A 50/50 (or less) type of joint venture remains the favoured structure from Thyssenkrupp's side. Thyssenkrupp could shift up to 3 billion euros worth of pensions into the joint venture to rebalance the ownership structure,  Deutsche Bank said in a note.     Thyssenkrupp's European steel business is more valuable thanTata's, meaning it can offload 3 billion euros worth of pension debt in order to split the joint venture on a 50/50 basis or less, analysts and investors say. One investor close to Thyssenkrupp said a  a sub-50 percent holding  for the German firm is a  very real possibility .  Thyssenkrupp's shares, trading at two-year highs, rose 5 percent on Monday on German press reports that a merger decision is near.  However, over 18 percent of shares available for shorting are out on loan, according to data from FIS’ Astec Analytics, signaling that some investors believe the price will fall.    We believe the future of Thyssenkrupp is not steel, it’s technology,  senior portfolio manager Ingo Speich of shareholder Union Investment said.  Steel production only makes sense if you can release scale benefits.”  Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze, Tom Kaeckenhoff, Georgina Prodhan, Maiya Keidan and Pratima Desai; editing by Susan Thomas","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/thyssenkrupp-tata-ma-idUSL8N1JV3Y7"},

In late June, before a one-week Eid-al Fitr holiday, the Saudi market surged after index compiler MSCI said it would consider upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status and economic reformer Prince Mohammed bin Salman was promoted to the post of crown prince. But many fund managers consider Riyadh close to fully valued, leaving it open to profit-taking. On Tuesday, the index fell 2.6 percent, its biggest drop since last October, in thin trading volume. Selling accelerated towards the close. A purchasing managers' survey released on Tuesday showed Saudi business conditions remained tough, with growth of the non-oil private sector slowing to an eight-month low in June. Banking stocks, which were among the top gainers in late June, were the biggest losers on Tuesday. National Commercial Bank, the largest lender, plunged 7.9 percent. Miner Ma'aden slipped 4.9 percent. Falling stocks outnumbered gainers by more than two to one. Wafa Insurance rose 2.6 percent after the central bank said it would let the company accept new subscribers in vehicle insurance, lifting a suspension on this activity. Qatar's stock market rose in early trade but the index closed 0.5 percent lower in moderate volume. Foreign investors, who had been net buyers of stocks for the last several days, were roughly neutral, exchange data showed. A deadline set by the four Arab states imposing sanctions on Qatar was to expire late on Tuesday, and there was no clear sign that Doha was willing to acquiesce in enough of their demands to avoid further economic sanctions. However, some fund managers do not think the additional sanctions would be crippling for Qatar's economy, while they believe there is value in the market after its 10 percent plunge in the past month. Qatar National Bank, the biggest bank, sank 3.1 percent on Tuesday. But companies linked to Qatari gas production were strong as the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum outlined plans to raise output and capacity in coming years. Gulf International Services, the most heavily traded stock, surged 4.0 percent and Qatar Gas Transport (Nakilat) soared its 10 percent daily limit. Dubai's index fell 0.3 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties slid 1.3 percent. GFH Financial, the most heavily traded stock, rose sharply in early trade after saying it had obtained approval from the central bank of Bahrain to buy back up to 5 percent of its issued treasury shares. But it closed 0.9 percent lower; the stock had already surged 6.3 percent on Monday. Builder Arabtec soared 10.6 percent after saying it had won a 353 million dirham ($96 million) contract to build the United Arab Emirates pavilion at the Expo 2020 world's fair in Dubai - a vote of confidence in the company by authorities in Abu Dhabi.

The investment underscores Samsung's determination to widen its lead in memory chips, which are expected to propel Asia's third most-valuable company to record profit this year. It routinely invests more than $10 billion in chips annually, helping it stay ahead of competitors such as cross-town rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) and Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T).  The announcement follows repeated calls from new South Korean President Moon Jae-in for big businesses to invest more domestically as part of a wider job-creation agenda. Samsung said its plan could open up to 440,000 roles by 2021. The huge investment is also likely to alleviate shareholder fears of major decisions being delayed in the absence of Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee. The leader of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] is on trial charged with bribing former president Park Geun-hye for political favors.  Samsung is being more aggressive in domestic investments because of the current (political) climate,  said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score. The firm also needs to show initiative domestically after announcing a $380 million plant in the United States, Park said. Supply Shortage Memory makers are widely expected to post record profits in 2017 as prices rise in response to demand for more features in smartphones and servers, as well as a persistent supply shortage which analysts and industry sources said is more acute for NAND chips due to increasing adoption of high-end storage products.  Samsung, SK Hynix and Toshiba have committed billions of dollars to boost NAND output in recent years, yet shortages are expected to persist at least through 2017 as new facilities will not make meaningful supply contributions until next year. The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2017.Kim Hong-JiUnder its latest spending plan, Samsung will put 14.4 trillion won into its new NAND factory in Pyeongtaek by 2021. It will invest 6 trillion won in a new semiconductor production line in Hwaseong, but did not elaborate on timing or product. Some analysts said additional capacity across the industry could cause slight oversupply in early 2018, but that prices are unlikely to drop because demand is so strong.  There's no chance of major oversupply issues, and I think Samsung is investing so much because it's convinced that won't happen,  said Shinhan Investment analyst Choi Do-yeon. The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2017.Kim Hong-JiChips in China Samsung also said it will add a production line to its NAND plant in Xi'an, China, though it has not yet set an investment amount or time frame. Some South Korean companies in China have seen sales decline or have had to reduce operations since Beijing objected to Seoul's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defense system in March. But components makers have not reported any problems, with Samsung still among China's biggest suppliers of chips and displays. The firm accounted for 40.4 percent of global memory chip revenue in January-March, showed latest data from researcher TrendForce. China is trying to develop its own memory chip producers but it is likely to take several years before they can compete with existing makers, analysts said. Samsung on Tuesday also said Samsung Display plans to invest around 1 trillion won on a new organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display complex in South Korea. The unit controls over 90 percent of the market for OLED smartphone screens, and is widely expected to add production lines to cope with demand from phone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Twenty-one men and women participated in the study. There was no difference in how calcium from the five different sources was absorbed, the researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, online June 19. Other minerals in the water did not affect calcium absorption. Most mineral waters list mineralization on the label, and the higher the amount of calcium, the better the water is as a calcium source, Greupner said. A person would need to drink two liters of 500 mg/L mineral water per day, or more than three eight-ounce cups of milk, to meet the German standard daily requirement of 1,000 mg calcium. In the U.S., 1,300 mg/day of calcium is recommended for adults.  It’s well known in Italy that mineral water can be a good source of calcium, Dr. Maria Luisa Brandi of the University of Florence in Italy told Reuters Health in a phone interview.  Brandi, who wasn’t involved in the current study, and her colleagues showed in a 2004 study that calcium in mineral water was as well absorbed as calcium in milk. “The concept is well established in medicine,” Brandi said. “We recommend water with high calcium content for osteoporotic patients.”","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-calcium-mineral-water-idUSKBN19P1X6"},

Juncker, himself from the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, was visibly annoyed as he watched the proceedings in the near empty parliamentary chamber in Strasbourg.  You are ridiculous,  the European Commission president told the gathering called to listen to a speech by Malta's Joseph Muscat, in a blunt public rebuke of another EU institution.  The fact that there's about 30 members of parliament present in this debate only really illustrates the fact that parliament is not serious,  he said.  The European Parliament is ridiculous, very ridiculous.     Juncker said Malta, the EU's smallest country, which has just completed a stint running the bloc's presidency, deserved better.  If Mr. Muscat was Mrs Merkel, difficult as that is to imagine, or Mr Macron ... we would have a full house,  Juncker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. Parliament president Antonio Tajani did not address the low attendance, but told Juncker himself to take a more respectful tone.  You may criticize the parliament, yes, but the Commission does not control the parliament, it's the parliament that should be controlling the Commission,  he said, to scattered applause. Juncker later apologized to Tajani, a parliamentary spokesman said. Juncker's Dutch deputy defended the outburst as the mark of a  passionate  politician:  Jean-Claude has a habit of letting his heart speak,  Frans Timmermans told reporters. Institutional rivalries are a staple of EU political life. Juncker's Commission is a frequent target of national leaders and EU lawmakers for trying to impose the views of the Brussels-based administration on elected bodies. Juncker often accuses member states of reneging on commitments or undermining the EU and has used the parliament as an ally against national demands. But the Commission shares with the Council of member states a mistrust of Parliament's ambitions. Lawmakers' powers over EU legislation were enhanced by the 2009 Lisbon Treaty but national governments scoff at its claims to be the most democratically legitimate EU body because fewer than half the bloc's voters bother to take part in European elections. Its treaty obligation to divide its sittings between Brussels and Strasbourg is also a source of embarrassment -- and costs -- for the legislature, though there was little sign that traveling had kept the chamber empty for Muscat on Tuesday. Later on, it was packed for other parliamentary business. Slightly more than 400,000 people live on Malta, putting it just behind Luxembourg in the EU population league table. Muscat, who smiled during Juncker's remarks, gave parliament a briefing on his country's presidency, focused on the migration crisis and called Brexit a  disastrous creature which all of us should have seen coming but none of us acted to stop .

The BoE, which can force curbs on lending, said last week it had spotted weaknesses in the way firms have been ramping up offers of credit to consumers who are the main driver of Britain's economy. Consumer borrowing is growing at more than 10 percent a year, while the household savings rate has hit an all-time low, raising concerns that some Britons are overstretching and could struggle to make repayments if interest rates rise.  The BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) did not set out any new rules on Tuesday, but its move was the first time it has ordered firms to apply consumer credit rules more conservatively and think harder about lending assumptions. It is also making company boards directly responsible for acting on its recommendations.  The BoE has previously announced measures to tighten standards in mortgage lending. The PRA requested evidence from providers of consumer credit, such as credit cards and personal loans, of how they will ensure they are not taking too much risk after years of low interest rates. Related CoverageBoE's Saunders tells UK households: prepare for higher rates - GuardianSome interest rate-setters at the BoE want to raise borrowing costs to control Britain's fast-rising inflation rate, suggesting a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching more quickly than had been expected until recently. Lenders will have until September to respond to the PRA and could then be asked to fix any specific areas of weakness. As well as any follow-up action by the PRA, the BoE could introduce sector-wide measures. Incentive Rule Separately on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's lead regulator for smaller consumer credit providers, proposed a new rule to stop incentives from encouraging staff at lending firms to loosen standards for granting credit.  We expect firms to understand the effects their staff incentives might be having,  said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA. Virgin Money (VM.L) said in April it wants to grow its credit card balances to 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) this year, up from 2.65 billion pounds at the end of March. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, said on Tuesday the bank would continue to prioritize asset quality over balance growth in its credit card business. Credit Card, Motor Lending The PRA said it did not believe that growth in lending had been driven primarily by significantly lowering credit rules or scoring. But the growth plans of lenders might only be achievable with some loosening of underwriting standards. Lenders seemed to be assuming Britain's economy will remain healthy and low arrears rates will continue, it said. The PRA cited credit card firms offering long-term zero percent offers and providers of motor finance that rely on generous assumptions about the future value of used vehicles. Lenders will have to show how they are protecting themselves against risk, including in their credit-scoring, at a time when many borrowers have not been put to the test of higher rates. Tuesday's statement is the third leg of the PRA's response to concerns about consumer credit. Last week, the BoE said banks would have to start building a supplementary buffer of capital to ensure they can absorb any losses from defaults in credit. Also last week, the BoE brought forward to September from November the assessment of stressed losses in consumer credit lending in this year's annual  stress test  of top banks.

But as Trump heads to his first face-to-face meeting as president with Putin on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany, he is under pressure at home to take a tough line with the Kremlin. Allegations of Russian meddling in last year’s U.S. election have alarmed both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who are pushing to extend tough sanctions placed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belonging to Ukraine. Lawmakers including Republican Senator Cory Gardner are also concerned Russia has prolonged the civil war in Syria by backing its President Bashar al-Assad, a strongman whose forces have used chemical weapons against insurgents and civilians. The chaos has fueled instability in the region and a flood of migrants to Europe.  President (Trump) needs to make it clear that the continued aggression by Russia around the globe ... is unacceptable, and that they will be held accountable,  said Gardner, who was among six lawmakers invited by the White House last month to discuss foreign policy with Trump over dinner. Meanwhile, the appointment of a special counsel who is investigating potential links between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign has weakened the president’s ability to maneuver with Russia, foreign policy experts say. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded Russia sponsored hacking of Democratic Party groups last year to benefit Trump over his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied those allegations while Trump has repeatedly dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and Russia as a  witch hunt.  Still, just the optics of Trump meeting with Putin, a former KGB agent, are fraught with risk, foreign policy experts say.  If (Trump) smiles, if he wraps his arm around Putin, if he says, 'I'm honored to meet you, we're going to find a way forward,' ... I think Congress is going to react extremely negatively to that,  said Julie Smith, a former national security aide in the Obama administration. Evolving u.s. Policy Trump has signaled an interest in cooperating with Russia to defeat Islamic State in Syria and to reduce nuclear stockpiles. The White House has been mum on what Trump would be willing to give Russia in exchange for that help. But there has been speculation he could ratchet down sanctions, or even return two Russian diplomatic compounds in Maryland and Long Island. President Barack Obama seized those facilities and expelled 35 Russian diplomats just before he left office as punishment for the election hacks. While some administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, also support engagement, others, such as Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, have taken a hawkish line on Russia. The lack of a unified strategy has left U.S. allies anxious. And it has lowered expectations for American leadership to help resolve crises in Syria and Ukraine, where Russian cooperation would be critical.

Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS Trump is like a horse with his front legs tied,  said a German diplomat, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.  He can’t make any big leaps forward on Russia. If he tried people would immediately suspect it was all part of some big conspiracy.  Trump's administration is still reviewing its Russia policy, a process that may not be wrapped up for a couple of months, a U.S. official said. Speaking with reporters last week about Trump's upcoming meeting with Putin, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said his boss would like  the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia. But he’s also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russia’s destabilizing behavior.  Third Try at a Reset Trump is just the latest president to grapple with the complicated U.S.-Russia dynamic. George W. Bush and Obama sought to improve the U.S. relationship with Russia early in their administrations only to see relations deteriorate later. Among the concerns for this president is Trump’s apparent lack of interest in policy details and his tendency to wing it with foreign leaders.  McMaster told reporters that Trump has  no specific agenda  for his meeting with Putin and that topics would consist of  whatever the president wants to talk about.  Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama, said he feared Trump might be headed to the meeting without clear objectives. “I hope that he would think about first: what is our objective in Ukraine? What is our objective in Syria? And secondarily, how do I go about achieving that in my meeting with Putin?  McFaul said. Other Washington veterans say Trump won't be able to make meaningful progress with Russia on anything until he confronts Putin about the suspected election meddling.  (Trump) really has to raise the Russian election hacking last year, and has to say something like, 'Vladimir, don't do this again. There will be consequences,'  said Steve Pifer, a long-time State Department official focused on U.S.-Russia relations. So far Trump has shown little inclination to do so, a situation that has heightened speculation about the potential impact from his coming encounter with the Russian leader.    “The shadow of all these investigations hangs over this,” said Angela Stent, a professor at Georgetown University and former National Intelligence Officer for Russia.

It is strangely appropriate. Shah, the 16-year-old son of a metal welder, dared to give up his studies a few years back to chase his ballet dreams.     He has now received an invitation from the American Ballet Theatre's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School in New York City for a four-year course. And all because of a video clip. Some months ago, Yehuda Maor, Shah's instructor at the Danceworx Performing Arts Academy in Mumbai, sent the artistic director of the school a clip of Shah dancing. The director, Cynthia Harvey, jumped at the idea, insisting Shah turn down a rival offer from the Royal Ballet School in London and attend her school's pre-professional program.

Juncker, himself from the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, was visibly annoyed as he watched the proceedings in the near empty parliamentary chamber in Strasbourg.  You are ridiculous,  the European Commission president told the gathering called to listen to a speech by Malta's Joseph Muscat, in a blunt public rebuke of another EU institution.  The fact that there's about 30 members of parliament present in this debate only really illustrates the fact that parliament is not serious,  he said.  The European Parliament is ridiculous, very ridiculous.     Juncker said Malta, the EU's smallest country, which has just completed a stint running the bloc's presidency, deserved better.  If Mr. Muscat was Mrs Merkel, difficult as that is to imagine, or Mr Macron ... we would have a full house,  Juncker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. Parliament president Antonio Tajani did not address the low attendance, but told Juncker himself to take a more respectful tone.  You may criticize the parliament, yes, but the Commission does not control the parliament, it's the parliament that should be controlling the Commission,  he said, to scattered applause. Juncker later apologized to Tajani, a parliamentary spokesman said. Juncker's Dutch deputy defended the outburst as the mark of a  passionate  politician:  Jean-Claude has a habit of letting his heart speak,  Frans Timmermans told reporters. Institutional rivalries are a staple of EU political life. Juncker's Commission is a frequent target of national leaders and EU lawmakers for trying to impose the views of the Brussels-based administration on elected bodies. Juncker often accuses member states of reneging on commitments or undermining the EU and has used the parliament as an ally against national demands. But the Commission shares with the Council of member states a mistrust of Parliament's ambitions. Lawmakers' powers over EU legislation were enhanced by the 2009 Lisbon Treaty but national governments scoff at its claims to be the most democratically legitimate EU body because fewer than half the bloc's voters bother to take part in European elections. Its treaty obligation to divide its sittings between Brussels and Strasbourg is also a source of embarrassment -- and costs -- for the legislature, though there was little sign that traveling had kept the chamber empty for Muscat on Tuesday. Later on, it was packed for other parliamentary business. Slightly more than 400,000 people live on Malta, putting it just behind Luxembourg in the EU population league table. Muscat, who smiled during Juncker's remarks, gave parliament a briefing on his country's presidency, focused on the migration crisis and called Brexit a  disastrous creature which all of us should have seen coming but none of us acted to stop .

This reflects Fitch's base case view, based on public disclosure, that the positive impact from the higher capital ratios of the merged bank is counterbalanced by recent loan deterioration, meaning the post-merger credit profile is likely to be still commensurate with the 'B-' rating level. Fitch will conduct a further detailed analysis (including with reference to non-public disclosure) in the course of an upcoming rating review to take a more definitive view on the bank's post-merger credit profile and consider potential rating implications. The transaction was completed in May 2017, as a result of which CDB was merged into AB and ceased to exist as a separate legal entity. Before the merger, AB was owned by OJSC  Ata Holding  (AH), and CDB by Synergy Group OJSC (SG), with AH and SG both owned by the same group of people close to the Azerbaijani authorities. After the merger, control over the merged bank was transferred to SG, which subsequently injected AZN20 million of equity into AB. We take a positive view of the increased capitalisation of the merged bank. AB's regulatory tier 1 and total capital ratios increased to 21.4% and 22.9%, respectively (regulatory minimums are 5% and 10%) at end-5M17 from 12.8% and 14.2% at end-4M17. The improvement was mainly due to the merger with CDB, whose assets were a quarter of AB's while capital ratios were much higher (above 40%), as well as the additional capital contribution from SG. Negatively we view the significant weakening of asset quality, mainly attributable to the pre-merger AB, whose non-performing loans (NPLs, 90+ days overdue) increased to around 30% of gross loans at end-2016 (based on IFRS accounts) from 13% at end-2015, while CDB reported negligible NPLs at end-2016. Fitch estimates that the combined NPL ratio for the merged bank should be around 23%, while reserve coverage (based on end-2016 IFRS accounts) would have been about 55%. However, asset quality may be somewhat worse than reported, as based on a combined income statement for 2016 over 30% of accrued income was not received in cash. The unreserved NPLs equaled around 51% of combined equity at end-2016, although the combined equity/asset ratio would still have been a reasonable (for the B- rating level) 10.9% if NPLs had been fully reserved.

Parliament unanimously approved a three-month state of emergency in April, giving the authorities greater powers to crack down on what it called enemies of the state after two church bombings killed at least 45 people. The extension by a further three months, ordered by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, means the state of emergency will last at least until the end of September, Ali Abdelaal,  Speaker of the House of Representatives, said.  The reasons for which the state of emergency was declared are still in place and therefore it must be extended,  Abdelaal told lawmakers. Apart from the three killed, 10 other policemen were wounded by the roadside explosion in the restive Sinai Peninsula, security and medical sources told Reuters. The blast hit an armored vehicle as it drove by in the south of Arish, capital of North Sinai province, killing a lieutenant colonel of the central security forces and two of his men, the sources said. State television confirmed an officer and two conscripts had been killed but did not mention any wounded. There was no immediate comment from the interior ministry. Egypt is fighting an Islamist insurgency led by Islamic State in North Sinai, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013 when the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests. Islamic State has also increasingly carried out attacks in the mainland on security forces and Coptic Christian civilians in recent months, killing around 100 Copts since December. The security sources said Islamic State fighters were most likely behind the attack and had detonated the bomb remotely as the armored vehicle drove by. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

The latest financial troubles of the conglomerate, which has interests ranging from smart cars to online content, have surfaced days after founder and CEO Jia Yueting said its cash problems were  far worse than expected  and that billions of dollars in funds raised in recent months were not enough to help it ride out the crunch. China Merchants Bank Co Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday it had applied to have some of LeEco's assets frozen because a subsidiary, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late making interest payments on a loan.  CMB's Shanghai branch repeatedly urged repayment without success and so sought to use legal means,  the bank said, adding it now had risks related to the loan under control and did not rule out using  friendly talks  to resolve the issue. LeEco, which controls smartphone maker Coolpad and its core listed smart TV unit Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, has been battling huge financial pressure since Jia admitted last year the company had expanded too fast and was facing  big company disease . Shenzhen-listed Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp issued a statement late Tuesday, saying the Shanghai court had frozen a 26.03 percent stake in LeEco held by Jia, and would do so for three years.  As of Tuesday, Jia, the controlling shareholder, held 26.27 percent of shares in LeEco, the statement added.  According to a court document dated June 26, the Shanghai High People's Court approved a freeze order on 1.237 billion yuan ($182 million) of assets of Leview Mobile HK Limited, two other LeEco-linked firms as well as CEO Jia and his wife. The court document, seen by Reuters, said it had found CMB's application to be  in accordance with the law  and so the freeze order ruling would come into immediate effect. Local media outlets earlier reported the asset freeze. A LeEco spokesman said the case concerned  financing loans related to LeEco's smartphone business , but added LeEco had enough collateral to cover the loan.  Our senior executives are currently in close communication with various financing units of CMB, and we hope to resolve the related debt issue very soon,  he said. LeEco also hopes to raise further cash to help it  get back to normal , he added. In late 2015, CMB agreed a 10 billion yuan loan to LeEco, part of which was used to acquire a stake in Coolpad and was the biggest bank loan to LeEco at the time, financial magazine Caixin said on Monday, citing public information. Suppliers, Partners Some other partners and suppliers are re-examining their exposure to the troubled group. This week, local media reported an affiliated company of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn divested its 20 percent stake in LeEco's TV and video unit Leshi Zhixin, a blow to the company's core business and one of its most profitable units. Foxconn did not reply to Reuters' request for comment.  LeEco is also facing pressure from China Mobile over late payments of around 14 million yuan, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The carrier declined to comment. In June, Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc reduced shipments to LeEco, and temporarily suspended its plans to buy shares of Leshi Zhixin, according to local media. At Compal's first quarter investor conference, it said it was monitoring Leshi's repayment abilities and would develop a new strategy to collect its debt, which could involve legal action. Compal did not provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. LeEco did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments on its business partners' actions. Faced with the worsening cash crunch, LeEco has put some of its global properties for sale, cut staff numbers, and is planning a restructuring to fold some business units into Leshi Internet.

The Corte dei Conti, which rules on abuses of public funds, is bringing the case against Morgan Stanley on behalf of Italy's taxpayers. Its prosecutors made their decision after an investigation into derivatives contracts they say were drawn up by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Italian officials, which caused losses to the state. In going to trial, the prosecutors believe there is a case to answer. The hearings are expected to begin next April, the source said. If the allegations are proven, a judge may order Morgan Stanley to pay compensation to the Italian government.  The investigation phase has ended and the court will hear the damages claims,  the source said, seeking anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the decision. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  Last August, Morgan Stanley said in a securities filing it had received a proposal from an Italian prosecutor about a payment to settle derivative transactions. Morgan Stanley said the proposed claim was groundless. The derivative transactions were originally entered into between 1995 and 2005 and were terminated in December 2011 and January 2012, Morgan Stanley said in the filing.     The Corte dei Conti case centers on interest rate derivatives agreed between the Treasury and Morgan Stanley. They were meant as a form of insurance for the government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market interest rates were to rise. After the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, enabling Italy to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets but incurring large losses on its derivative positions. Offsetting such gains and losses are a normal part of hedging, but the Corte dei Conti prosecutors argue that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank. The Italian court will also hear claims worth a total of 1.18 billion euros against two senior government officials - public debt chief Maria Cannata and Treasury boss Vincenzo La Via - and former finance ministers Domenico Siniscalco and Vittorio Grilli. The offices of Cannata and La Via referred media enquiries on the case to the Treasury press office. A Treasury spokesman said it had full faith in the work undertaken by its managers and trusted that the court could clear up these matters. Grilli and Siniscalco declined to comment. The prosecutors have also alleged that Morgan Stanley had a conflict of interest, saying it not only sold derivatives to the Treasury but was also engaged in helping Italy to manage its financing operations, including buying and distributing government bonds. Between late 2011 and early 2012, the government paid Morgan Stanley around 3 billion euros to settle the termination of derivative contracts, the source said. Compensation orders by the special audit court, which will hear the case, can be appealed. Once confirmed, they are legally enforceable through asset seizures if necessary.

Oslo-listed African Petroleum's share price fell 57 percent after the story was published, prompting the bourse to temporarily suspend trading. The company, founded by Australian-Romanian billionaire Frank Timis, issued a statement denying that its licenses had been terminated. African Petroleum had been seeking to prolong its exploration period, which expired in September 2016, and to that end its chief executive met with new President Adama Barrow, who replaced long-ruling Yahya Jammeh in January.  African Petroleum has failed a number of times in meeting their commitments. They asked for an extension and we declined,  Mod K. Ceesay, permanent secretary for petroleum at Gambia's oil ministry said in an interview with Reuters, without giving further details.  We indicated our position to them. There are no ongoing negotiations between us and African Petroleum,  he added.  On Tuesday, it said the terms of its licenses stated they remained active until the state enacted a termination procedure.  No such termination procedure has been enacted by the state and African Petroleum therefore reserves its legal rights over the licenses,  it said. The A1 and A4 blocks it says it still operates are adjacent to blocks in Senegal's water where Britain's Cairn Energy made the largest global discovery in 2014.  A recent evaluation of the blocks cited by African Petroleum suggests they could contain over 3 billion barrels. Shares in African Petroleum were down 24.63 percent at 1416 GMT. Exclusive Talks The company has previously acknowledged that it did not meet its requirement to drill a well within the timeframe of the agreement. But it says it has invested over $64 million in Gambia. A view shows Gambia's tallest building, Petroleum House, which houses the oil ministry at a crossroads in Banjul's West Coast Region, Gambia December 7, 2016 . Picture taken December 7, 2016.Emma FargeIt said in a statement in April that it was in talks with an unnamed listed company to take a 70 percent stake in the two blocks as well as one in neighboring Senegal. The exclusive talks expire on July 20, the company said.  Senegal also says it has canceled one of two contracts held by African Petroleum because the firm had not fulfilled its commitments. It has since been attributed to Total but African Petroleum says it still holds the license. Oil has long been seen as a way of changing the fortunes of Gambia, a tiny riverside nation of 1.9 million people whose economy depends on peanut sales and spending by European tourists in search of winter sunshine. However, industry sources say privately that the caprices of Jammeh, who often personally oversaw decisions in the oil sector, and the perceived risk of fines or imprisonment deterred investment. Ceesay said that the government intended to honor the other exploration contracts granted under the former president.  We have no intention of terminating them but that does not rule out reviewing the terms,  he said. In a sign of the growing interest, New York-listed Erin Energy Corporation said in March it had agreed to grant an 80 percent interest in its A2 and A5 blocks to Australia's FAR. Gambia approved the deal this week. The country has a total of eight blocks: six offshore and two onshore. Most are unallocated. Ceesay said the change of government had stirred considerable interest.  There is huge interest from very credible companies,  he said, adding that Gambia's laws gave it the right to award contracts via tender and direct talks. Ceesay said Gambia planned to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative which aims to promote open and accountable management of resources, without giving a timeframe.

The Big Three -- Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- will withdraw from the domestic, national scale ratings market from July 14, having shunned the special accreditation law administered by the Russian central bank.  The accreditation requirement was introduced after Russia's sovereign rating was downgraded as a result of Western sanctions. Russia says it is designed to prevent rating agencies from withdrawing local ratings under external political pressure; the agencies see it as a restriction on their work. ACRA, the Analytical Credit Ratings Agency, is a major beneficiary of the withdrawal. Ekaterina Trofimova, ACRA's head, told Reuters in an interview her agency already has 40 public ratings in its portfolio and some non-public ratings.   According to our business plan, we should have a (total outstanding) 100 contracts signed (public and non-public) by  year-end. We will exceed this level for sure,  Trofimova, a former S&P; analyst who was also an executive with Gazprombank, said.   The ratings in question -- called national scale ratings -- are essential for using domestic debt instruments, including central bank refinancing. Global rating agencies will continue to provide sovereign ratings and ratings for external debt instruments such as Eurobonds.  Fitch, for example, had around 150 public Russian national scale ratings when it said at the end of the last year it would withdraw them following the new legislation.  ACRA is the only ratings agency to have obtained the central bank's accreditation by the required deadline.   I am confident that the Big Three will sooner or later join this (new regulatory) regime,  Trofimova said.  I think that the reasonable nature of (the accreditation) will become clear as the market and the profitability of such operations grow,  Trofimova said.  Ratings are essential to raise debt on the domestic rouble bond market, where companies and banks have raised a total of around 800 billion roubles (£10.4 billion) so far this year, according to Reuters data, and as Eurobonds remain a privilege of top-notch Russian companies.  Trofimova said that interest in ACRA, established in late 2015, is growing outside Russia where she spends up to a third of her time now.   We are in talks with around a dozen countries on different types of possible cooperation,  Trofimova said with a smile. She did not elaborate further.

The most influential movers on the index included major gold miners Barrick Gold Corp, which fell 1.8 percent to C$20.25, and Goldcorp, which lost 2.2 percent to C$16.36. The slips among bullion producers came despite the precious metal getting a bump from safe-haven buying after a North Korean missile launch. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.1 percent, with First Majestic Silver Corp down 5.2 percent to C$10.20. Two major fertilizer producers gained, with Potash Corp of Saskatchewan up 1.3 percent at C$21.42 and Agrium Inc adding 1.3 percent to C$119. At 10:25 a.m. ET (1425 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index was down 57.5 points, or 0.38 percent, at 15,124.69. Nine of the index's 10 main groups were in negative territory, with declining issues outnumbering advancers at a 2.20-to-1 ratio. The Canadian market was closed for a public holiday on Monday, while U.S. indices are closed Tuesday. The energy group climbed 0.4 percent, as crude prices inched higher to add to eight days of gains. Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc rose 0.7 percent to C$52.04 and Cenovus Energy Inc added 1.2 percent to C$9.67. The financials group slipped 0.1 percent, as Brookfield Asset Management lost 1.2 percent to C$50.27. The company on Monday placed a formal bid for control of a Brazilian renewable energy company, two people with knowledge of the situation said. Some of the country's biggest banks notched small gains, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up 0.4 percent to C$105.78 and Bank of Montreal adding 0.2 percent to C$95.41. They have risen recently as the Bank of Canada has taken a more hawkish stance and investors have bet on rate hikes coming sooner than previously anticipated. In an interview with a German newspaper published on Tuesday, the central bank's governor, Stephen Poloz, said inflation in Canada should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018 and policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target. Canadian National Railway Co fell 0.4 percent to C$104.81 after one of its trains derailed and spilled about 20,000 gallons of crude oil in Illinois.

The news sent the banking index lower, which caused the main index to fall 1.1 percent as investors sold shares on worries that lenders may be forced to take a haircut on Etisalat's loan. The telecom industry regulator said Etisalat Nigeria and its creditors have reached a resolution on key issues on the indebtedness and that a transition process had been mutually agreed.

Conflict in Burundi would alarm global powers because the fortunes of the country are so intertwined with its neighbor, Rwanda, where 800,000 people were killed in a 1994 genocide.    The report by the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) is the first to highlight the impact on the army of violence that followed President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in April 2015. Opponents said the move was unconstitutional and endangered a 2005 peace deal that ended a 12-year civil war pitting the majority Hutus against minority Tutsis. The FIDH report said the purge of officers from the Tutsi ethnic group has occurred as Nkurunziza, a Hutu, consolidates power following violence that has killed at least 1,200 people. Now authorities are systematically targeting former members of the Tutsi-dominated Burundian Armed Forces (FAB), which battled mostly Hutu rebel groups, including Nkurunziza's CNDD-FDD, during the civil war, the report said.  This ... risks leading to the breakup of the army and pushing a number of soldiers toward a military opposition, which would be synonymous with a new civil war,  the report said. The government in Bujumbura rejected the findings of the report.  That report contains untruth, exaggerated figures,  said Martin Nivyabandi, the human rights minister, adding it was designed to manipulate the international community. Drawing on a network of underground rights activists, the report offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the military in a country where many journalists and activists have been banned or fled. Since November 2016, the federation documented more than 120 cases of assassination, attempted assassination, arbitrary arrest, torture and forced disappearance by authorities against ex-FAB soldiers.  This campaign of targeted repression against ex-FAB has continued and intensified since the start of 2017,  FIDH said. Senior ranking soldiers were initially targeted, but middle-level and retired ex-FAB soldiers were now being increasingly attacked, the report said. A former army spokesman, Colonel Adolphe Manirakiza, confirmed that Tutsi officers were being targeted and said he went into exile after finishing a tour of duty with the United Nations in the Central African Republic due to safety concerns.   By attacking Tutsi officers, it is clear that the Burundi regime is planning a genocide. It wants to constitute a mono-ethnic army composed mainly of Hutus, and it will be easy for the regime to complete its plan of genocide,  he told Reuters.

The blast, late on Monday, occurred at a plant operated by  local Bangladeshi firm Multifabs while maintenance work was going on, company and fire brigade officials said.  The explosion at the boiler, located in a tin-roofed shed,  partially damaged a nearby three-storey factory building.  I heard a big bang when I was having tea outside,  factory driver Hafiz Mostafa said, as dozens thronged the factory site and firefighters moved rubble in search of missing persons.  I saw windows, doors, glasses, machinery and a section of the wall of the building go flying.  Families scoured the scene for missing people. The plant had been shut for 10 days for Eid holidays at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and was being readied to resume operations on Tuesday, when the accident occurred.  We're looking for my brother. We checked all the hospitals, but have not found him,  said Nazim Uddin, whose brother Ershad Ullah worked as an electrician at the plant for the last decade. Multifabs has many clients in Europe, its website says. The company started operating in 1992 and reached $70 million in exports in 2016. Its top buyers include fashion chain Lindex, which is part of Finland's Stockmann, German supermarket chain Aldi, and Rexholm of Denmark, Faruqui said. The company said the plant was functioning well and the six-year-old boiler, procured from Germany, had just been serviced. Related CoverageFactbox: Major industrial accidents in Bangladesh in recent years The boiler was running well,  Mahiuddin Faruqui, Multifab's chairman told Reuters.  After servicing when workers were trying to restart it, it went off.  Firefighter Faruk Hussain said a body had been retrieved from the rubble in the morning and that the search was still on for more victims. Investigation Bangladesh's roughly $28 billion garment sector, the biggest in the world after China, employs 4 million people and generates about 80 percent of the country's export earnings. It came under scrutiny after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex in 2013 that killed more than 1,100 people, and a fire at a garment factory in 2012 that killed 112 workers. The Rana Plaza disaster sparked demands for greater safety and put the onus to act on foreign companies sourcing clothing from Bangladesh. A spokeswoman for Stockmann said it was investigating the disaster, but was still seeking more information. She said Stockmann is a member of the industry body Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), and that said Multifabs had cleared a BSCI audit in May 2016 that was valid for two years. Lindex said Multifabs was one of its main suppliers and said  it was monitoring the situation. The Multifabs site hurt by the blast made 100,000 garments a day, generated around $6 million of revenue a month and employed about 6,000 workers, said Mesba Faruqui, factory and operations director in the family-run business. Two international coalitions were formed after Rana Plaza to help fund improvements to building and fire safety at thousands of garment factories across Bangladesh. One of the coalitions, signatories to the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, inspected the Multifabs site in 2015 and noted among numerous concerns that Multifabs' boiler was not separated by fire-rated construction.  As of last week, however, the Accord's updated corrective plan on the facility listed that issue as having been corrected.  But the coalition itself does not inspect boilers, which are monitored by the Bangladesh government.   Bangladesh's chief boiler inspector Mohammad Abdul Mannan said his department had inspected the Multifabs' boiler a year ago and that the next inspection had been due this month. Sulav Chowdhury, chief executive of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, of which Multifabs is a member, said the industry had gone through a  huge shift  since the Rana Plaza disaster.  There has been structural change, and we've worked hard for it,  he said.  So I'd say this is a stray incident.  Still, critics say more work needs to be done.  There is still an enormous amount to be done to improve safety in the Bangaldeshi garment industry  said the IndustriALL Global Union, a signatory to the Bangladesh Accord and a member of the Steering Committee. It added that union signatories to the Accord would demand that it be expanded swiftly to include boiler safety. Additional reporting by Serajul Quadir in DHAKA, Krishna N.

The claim, which is being heard in Australia's Federal Court, said patients had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse since having the mesh surgically implanted. The devices are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Australian action was brought on behalf of more than 700 claimants.   Johnson & Johnson said it was only aware of 200  product events  after selling more than 100,000 pelvic floor repair products in Australia.   It is always a concern to us when a patient doesn't get the outcome they had hoped for, or believes they have experienced an adverse event,  spokeswoman Meshlin Khouri said in a statement.  However it is important to remember that the majority of women who have undergone this surgery have had a positive result, and it has improved their quality of life.  Johnson & Johnson is one of several manufacturers that sold the devices. Those companies are facing tens of thousands of individual lawsuits from plaintiffs who said they were injured by the mesh's poor design and substandard materials. In May, California accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn doctors and patients about the severity and frequency of complications associated with its pelvic mesh devices.

Banks have been pulling out of the business for a variety of reasons from not making enough money to industry consolidation to the fear of falling foul of tougher new rules designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulations for the Group of 20 countries (G20), said the places most affected tended to be small economies or those finding it difficult to apply the new rules. The decline has raised concerns that some payments will pass through unregulated cash couriers instead, harming international trade and driving some people out of the world's financial system, the FSB said in a report. The FSB unveiled a four-point action plan in November 2015 to curb the decline and has since made clear that correspondent banks don't have to know their local customer's customer but the fall has shown no signs of abating.  The decline in the number of correspondent banking relationships is continuing,  the FSB report said.  It said all regions had been hit to a varying degree, with      the Caribbean and small states in the Pacific suffering the worst and Eastern Europe hit hard as well. The FSB said transactions in U.S. dollars and euros were the most affected. In correspondent banking, a global bank typically channels payments in country to a local bank with no international network in another country. Payment Volumes Stable  Heidi Toribio, global head of banks and broker dealers at Standard Chartered, a correspondent bank, said there was no simple solution to the decline. But advances in technology were starting to automate payments processes, making it harder to manipulate invoices.  Regulators globally and locally are coming together with the industry and we’re having the right conversations,  Toribio said. The FSB said its latest update for G20 leaders meeting this week in Hamburg, Germany, draws on better data after sampling 300 banks in 50 countries, and payment messages from SWIFT, a global network that links lenders.  It is too early to tell what the effects of measures taken so far will be, and to what extent they will stem the decline,  the FSB said. The volume of payments remains roughly unchanged, but the involvement of fewer banks means longer payment chains and countries relying on fewer international lenders, the FSB said. The FSB will convene a meeting of private and public sector bodies on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank annual meetings in October to discuss its findings so. Another progress report is due in December. The watchdog will also obtain deeper and more frequent data on the sector from SWIFT over the coming year to monitor progress, while the World Bank is studying the impact of the decline on remittances to see if costs are being driven up. Alexander Karrer, chair of the FSB's Correspondent Banking Coordination Group, and Deputy State Secretary at the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, said the banking industry and regulators would continue to work together to make improvements to simplify due diligence in correspondent banking.

North Korea state television showed a large truck painted in military camouflage carrying the missile. It was identical to one a U.N. sanctions panel has said was  most likely  converted from a Chinese timber truck. Since 2006, U.N. sanctions have banned the shipment of military hardware to North Korea. But control of equipment and vehicles that have  dual-use  military and civilian applications has been far less stringent. The vehicle was imported from China and declared for civilian use by the North Korean foreign ministry, according to a 2013 report by the U.N. panel. Tuesday's launch was the first time the truck had been seen in a military field operation in pictures published in state media.  China, North Korea's largest trading partner and its sole major ally, is under increasing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said Chinese efforts to rein in North Korea's weapons programs have failed.   The truck had been previously on display at military parades in 2012 and in 2013 carrying what experts said appeared to be developmental models or mock-ups of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. Related CoverageJohnson: International community must redouble efforts on North KoreaRussia calls North Korea missile launch breach of U.N. resolutionRussia, China call for restraint on North Korean missile tensions: PutinImages on the North Korea's state television showed soldiers working on the vehicle mounted with a missile, which was then erected and off-loaded ahead of the launch at a hillside location. Leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test.      The transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) is a vehicle designed to move a ballistic missile and stand it upright, allowing for a mobile system that makes surveillance difficult for spy satellites.  In its 2013 report, the U.N. panel of experts said the features of the vehicle in the 2012 parade exactly matched those of a vehicle sold by China's Hubei Sanjiang Space Wanshan Special Vehicle Company. Deliberate Breach? The company is a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, a state-owned company that makes the Shenzhou rocket as well as missiles.  A company manager reached by telephone declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue.  China submitted to the U.N. panel a copy of the end user certificate provided by the North stating that six of the vehicles were being imported for the purpose of transporting timber.  The panel said it  considers it most likely that the (North) deliberately breached  the certificate and converted the trucks into transporter-erector-launchers. This year, North Korea used another Chinese-made truck model to tow submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) at a military parade on the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung. Last year, state media published photos showing Chinese-made trucks being used in a new North Korean mobile rocket artillery system.

Confirming on Tuesday that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would meet heads of EU institutions in Brussels on the eve of a G20 summit with Trump and other world leaders in Germany, the European Council said:  Leaders are expected to announce a political agreement on the EU-Japan free trade agreement.  That would be short of a final accord ironing out all the commercial intricacies between two of the world's biggest economies and EU officials said on Tuesday that some key issues still needed to be settled before Thursday's EU-Japan summit. However, confirming Abe's attendance is a sign of confidence that a deal will be ready for his signature and also puts pressure on trade negotiators to secure at least outline agreements on opening up each other's markets, including in the trickiest areas such as Japanese cars and European farm produce.  Both sides, having seen Trump pull back from free trade relationships, are keen to show they remain committed to removing barriers they say hamper growth. Related CoverageFactbox: Likely winners and losers from a Japan-EU trade deal It is important for us to wave the flag of free trade in response to global moves toward protectionism by quickly concluding the free trade agreement with Europe,  Abe told ministers at a meeting on Tuesday about the EU negotiations.  This agreement is also important for our growth strategy. We will negotiate with all our energy until the very end to achieve the best deal for Japan.   Abe will meet European Council President Donald Tusk, who speaks for the 28 EU national leaders, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the bloc's executive head. Juncker's Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom was in Japan at the weekend and said after her talks that she was  quite confident  that a broad agreement could be announced on Thursday. EU officials had said that Abe would only visit Brussels if both sides were certain that the political agreement would be signed. Malmstrom said:  You can do good, fair, transparent and sustainable trade agreements where you win and I win, and not the American view, which seems to be, 'You lose and I win'.  Abe, Tusk and Juncker will go on to Hamburg on Friday for the G20 summit.  The host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, is expected to lead calls for Trump to keep trade open. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Japan and 10 other states on his first day in office in January. U.S.-EU talks on a trade pact called TTIP have been in limbo since then. Volker Treier, head of the foreign trade unit of Germany's DIHK Chambers of Commerce, said on Tuesday that the state of world affairs was such that a trade war with the United States could not be ruled out. [nB4N1HY015 Japan and the EU launched their bilateral negotiations in 2013 but have been struggling to achieve breakthroughs in key areas, such as Japan scrapping tariffs on EU cheese and wine and Europe giving greater access for Japanese cars and car parts. Although Japan and the EU account for about a third of global GDP, their trade relationship has room to grow - also by a third according to EU officials, who see a deal boosting the EU economy by 0.8 percent and Japan's by 0.3 percent long-term.

Here are some of the likely winners and losers from the expected deal: - The accord is expected to be a boost for Japanese auto makers Toyota (7203.T), Nissan (7201.T), Suzuki (7269.T) and Mazda (7261.T), whose European sales still lag behind market leaders Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and PSA Group (PEUP.PA). Japanese auto parts makers Denso Corp (6902.T), Aisin Seiki Co (7259.T), and JTEKT Corp (6473.T) also stand to gain. - Europe's food sector is the other big winner, especially in high-quality regional specialties. Japan imposes high tariffs on imports of premium European food and drink products, including wines, cheese, chocolate, meats, and pasta. Wine, along with vermouth, cider, and vinegar, constituted the second largest EU food export category to Japan in 2016.  - Japanese trading house Kanematsu Corp would welcome the agreement, as would Kirin Holdings Co and Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. However, they might see a blow to their distribution of Japanese wines.  - French suppliers Pernod Ricard and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton should also benefit from the reduction in tariffs for premium liquors, wines and spirits.  - The European Commission predicts an increase of up to 10 billion euros ($11.34 billion) for EU exports of processed food, including meat and dairy products, or between 170 percent and 180 percent once the deal takes full effect and tariffs are gradually removed. - However, Japanese dairy companies such as Meiji (2269.T) and Megmilk Snow Brand Co (2270.T) will face greater competition. They are protected by tariffs of up to 40 percent on processed cheese, which will slowly be removed. Megmilk dominates two-thirds of the domestic market for soft cheese and could lose customers.   - Competition will come in the form of European dairy manufacturers such as Danone (DANO.PA), Lactalis and Nestle (NESN.S). - Pork products made up the largest single EU food export to Japan in 2016. Exporters from Spain and Denmark hope to capitalize on growing Japanese demand for specialty processed meats such as ham, salami, and cured bacon.

By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced on Tuesday it planned to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent in an apparent show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours who have imposed political and economic sanctions on Doha. The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation. The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference.  Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day,  Kaabi said. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in Jeddah the stand-off between Qatar and its Arab neighbours would best be solved by an agreement across the region to prevent the financing of terrorism,  We all know that (this support) is not organised by states, but often by private persons,  he added.  But we must somehow succeed in ending support in the region for extremist and terrorist organisations.  Iranian Question The glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. The political dispute started on June 5, roiling LNG trade and causing at least one tanker to change course and UK gas prices to spike. Kaabi said the company's operations would not be affected by the diplomatic crisis or sanctions.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Ausralia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accus Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to cooperate with Tehran more on the gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.  Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field. He added that the company will be looking for international partners, declining to say when a tender would be issued. Qatargas, the largest LNG-producing company in the world, and RasGas also operate projects on the North Field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil.  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,   said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell.  For Qatar, LNG is everything.

In 2017, the French people told us that they wanted how France once again finds itself: confident, courageous and conquering.  Judicial Reforms: * Constitutional reform to strengthen independence of magistrates * Five-year plan to simplify and re-organise justice system * Construction of 15,000 extra prison spaces  It is essential not to transform prisons into the breeding grounds of the violence of tomorrow, and it is essential because it is our dignity that is at stake.  Health:  Prevention will be the pivot of our national strategy in the autumn.  * Vaccinations for young children will become compulsory by next year. * Price of a packet of cigarettes will go up gradually to 10 euros, government will fight again illegal cigarette smuggling * Disability allowance to increase in 2018 Local Government:  We are proposing a local government pact to accompany the ecological transition and to accompany  the digital transition, notably to guarantee access to high-speed internet by 2022.  Military/Security  We will give the (military) the means to defend us.   We will fight terrorism with the great firmness.  * Five-year military programme to be adopted in 2018 confirming that defence will make up 2 percent of GDP by 2015. * Will leave state of emergency by latest Nov. 1 and a new law will be put in place to strengthen anti-terrorism arsenal. Asylum/Immigration:  France has been incapable of meeting its legal and moral obligations.  * Average time to process asylum requests will fall from 14 months to 6 months. Education:  All the studies show that we train the very good students extremely well, but inequalities are being reinforced, and the average level of our students is not up to what our country should offer.  * Complete review of the baccalaureat by 2018, with a view to implementing a reform for 2021. French Social Model:  So that the system is more fair and transparent so that one euros worth of contributions, leads to the same rights for everybody.  * Draft law to be presented by Spring 2018 to reform professional training, opening up unemployment insurance to those who resign and independent workers. * Review of the retirement system by end 2018. Public Spending/Rising Public Debt:  We are dancing on a volcano that is rumbling louder and louder.   The French are hooked on public spending. Like all addictions it doesn't solve any of the problems it is meant to ease. And like all addictions it requires willing and courage to detox.  * Budget deficit to be below 3 pct of GDP in 2017 from 3.4 pct in 2016 * French tax burden to be cut by 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 5 years *Public spending to be cut by three percentage points of GDP over next 5 years * Social security budget to balanced by 2020 Making France an Attractive Business Venue:  Companies must want to set themselves up and develop on our soil rather than elsewhere.  * Corporate tax to be gradually cut to 25 pct from 33.3 pct by 2022 * Transformation of  CICE  company tax credit to permanent cut in payroll charges to take effect on Jan 1, 2019 * Exemption of non-housing wealth from special wealth tax to take effect in 2019 Brexit:  Conducting orderly negotiations over the United Kingdom's exit will be a pre-requisite for the future relationship's framework.  * Any talks with Britain over its future relationship with the European Union would come only after  orderly  talks over its exit from the bloc have been conducted Energy/Climate Change:  Those who, through selfishness or a lack of conscience, turn their backs on the Paris climate change agreement, show more than just a simple misunderstanding of the world that is coming.

Banks have been pulling out of the business for a variety of reasons from not making enough money to industry consolidation to the fear of falling foul of tougher new rules designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulations for the Group of 20 countries (G20), said the places most affected tended to be small economies or those finding it difficult to apply the new rules. The decline has raised concerns that some payments will pass through unregulated cash couriers instead, harming international trade and driving some people out of the world's financial system, the FSB said in a report. The FSB unveiled a four-point action plan in November 2015 to curb the decline and has since made clear that correspondent banks don't have to know their local customer's customer but the fall has shown no signs of abating.  The decline in the number of correspondent banking relationships is continuing,  the FSB report said.  It said all regions had been hit to a varying degree, with      the Caribbean and small states in the Pacific suffering the worst and Eastern Europe hit hard as well. The FSB said transactions in U.S. dollars and euros were the most affected. In correspondent banking, a global bank typically channels payments in country to a local bank with no international network in another country. Payment Volumes Stable  Heidi Toribio, global head of banks and broker dealers at Standard Chartered, a correspondent bank, said there was no simple solution to the decline. But advances in technology were starting to automate payments processes, making it harder to manipulate invoices.  Regulators globally and locally are coming together with the industry and we’re having the right conversations,  Toribio said. The FSB said its latest update for G20 leaders meeting this week in Hamburg, Germany, draws on better data after sampling 300 banks in 50 countries, and payment messages from SWIFT, a global network that links lenders.  It is too early to tell what the effects of measures taken so far will be, and to what extent they will stem the decline,  the FSB said. The volume of payments remains roughly unchanged, but the involvement of fewer banks means longer payment chains and countries relying on fewer international lenders, the FSB said. The FSB will convene a meeting of private and public sector bodies on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank annual meetings in October to discuss its findings so. Another progress report is due in December. The watchdog will also obtain deeper and more frequent data on the sector from SWIFT over the coming year to monitor progress, while the World Bank is studying the impact of the decline on remittances to see if costs are being driven up.

The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie. The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation. The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference.  Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day,  Kaabi said. With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year. Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in Jeddah the stand-off between Qatar and its Arab neighbours would best be solved by an agreement across the region to prevent the financing of terrorism,  We all know that (this support) is not organised by states, but often by private persons,  he added.  But we must somehow succeed in ending support in the region for extremist and terrorist organisations.  Iranian Question The glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen  more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014. So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded. Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. The political dispute started on June 5, roiling LNG trade and causing at least one tanker to change course and UK gas prices to spike. Kaabi said the company's operations would not be affected by the diplomatic crisis or sanctions.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said. Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Ausralia, the United States and Russia.  It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field,  said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters. Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accus Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to cooperate with Tehran more on the gas production and exports from the shared field.  Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now,  said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.  Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That’s why I don’t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially,  he added. Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field. He added that the company will be looking for international partners, declining to say when a tender would be issued. Qatargas, the largest LNG-producing company in the world, and RasGas also operate projects on the North Field. While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil.  Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world,   said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell.

Inflation in Canada should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018, Poloz told German newspaper Handelsblatt, adding that policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target.                  Top Bank of Canada officials' recent assertions that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts did their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices appear to be paving the way for a tightening move as soon as July 12.                   Chances of a rate hike next week are better than 50 percent, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                At 9:42 a.m. ET (1342 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2955 to the greenback, or 77.19 U.S. cents, up 0.4 percent.     The currency traded in a range of $1.2955 to C$1.3018.     On Friday, the loonie touched its strongest intraday in nine months at C$1.2947. It was helped by data showing Canada's economy grew for a sixth consecutive month in April, while a central bank survey of business sentiment showed firms were feeling more upbeat.                  Adding to support for the Canadian dollar, prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged higher.     U.S. crude        prices were up 0.15 percent at $47.14 a barrel, extending recent gains on tentative signs a persistent rise in U.S. crude production may be slowing.                        Speculators have cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a fifth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions tumbled to 49,495 contracts as of June 27 from 82,881 a week earlier.                      Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve after reopening following the Canada Day holiday on Monday. They were pressured by Poloz's hawkish comments and by U.S. manufacturing data on Monday that boosted expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again this year.                  The two-year            price fell 5.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.131 percent and the 10-year             declined 54 Canadian cents to yield 1.825 percent.     The two-year yield touched its highest intraday since October 2014 at 1.139 percent.     Canada's trade data for May is due on Thursday and the June employment report is due on Friday.

Tanzania's President John Magufuli has sent shock-waves through the mining community with a series of actions since his election in 2015 that he says are to distribute revenue to the Tanzanian people. Speaking at a televised public rally in northwest Tanzania on Tuesday, Magufuli said he had decided to rush through bills passed on Monday because Tanzania was fighting an economic war.  We couldn't wait to pass the laws because of the large scale theft taking place in the mining sector,  Magufuli said. Tanzania's largest miner Acacia, majority owned by Barrick Gold, said in a statement that notices of arbitration were served on behalf of companies that own its Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines, hit by an export ban.  The serving of the notices at this time is necessary to protect the Company,  Acacia said.  But, this notwithstanding, Acacia remains of the view that a negotiated resolution is the preferable outcome to the current disputes and the company will continue to work to achieve this.  Tanzania accused Acacia of tax evasion in 2016 in a case that is ongoing and was this year accused of operating illegally. The miner denies the allegations. And in March, Magufuli imposed an export ban on unprocessed ore to encourage the construction of local smelters, rather than allow profits from processing to be accrued abroad. International mining companies have said mining must help to enhance the economic development of Tanzania, but the relationship has to be a fair partnership. Shares in Acacia, which have nearly halved since the export ban in March, were down nearly 1 percent by 1345 GMT.

France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, sees taming France's spending and reducing its budget deficit was key to winning the trust of European Union partner Germany and persuading Berlin to embark on reforms of the bloc. Last week France's independent auditor revealed a more 8 billion euro funding shortfall in this year's budget, forecasting a deficit once again above the European Union's cap of 3 percent of national income.  The French are hooked on public spending. Like all addictions it doesn't solve any of the problems it is meant to ease. And like all addictions it requires willing and courage to detox,  Philippe told the National Assembly to applause. Philippe said that for ever 100 euros Germany raised in taxes it spent 98 euros, while France spent 125 euros for every 117 euros levied in taxes.  Who really believes this situation is sustainable?  Philippe said his objective was to haul the deficit below the EU's cap this year and would target reducing public spending by three percent of national income over five years, while also reducing the government's tax-take by one percent over the same period. He said corporate tax would be gradually reduced to 25 percent from 33.3 percent now by 2022. Macron's upstart Republic on the Move (LREM) party has secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly - and France's youngest leader since Napoleon made clear his impatience to complete the reshaping of the political landscape that he has begun. In his own speech to lawmakers from both chambers at the palace of Versailles on Monday, the former investment banker told France it was time to prepare for change. Philippe's address gave the details to Macron's lofty ambitions.

Craig MacKinlay, 50, who beat leading Brexit figure Nigel Farage in the parliamentary election for the South Thanet in southeastern England in 2015, is accused of making false claims about his spending during the campaign. Despite the ongoing case against him, he won the seat again in this year's June election. May's Conservatives lost their majority in that ballot and remain in power only through an agreement with 10 Northern Ireland MPs. If MacKinlay were to be found guilty, he could be jailed for up to a year and there would be pressure for a by-election.        MacKinlay appeared in London's Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday alongside his election agent Nathan Gray, 28, and Marion Little, 62, a campaign director from the Conservatives' head office who both also face charges over the expense returns. All said they would plead not guilty when the charges were read to them and they will now go on trial at London's Southwark Crown Court. Their next hearing set for Aug. 1 and they were granted unconditional bail. The case centers on accusations that MacKinlay should have included costs on his expenses return relating to activists on the Conservatives'  Battle Bus  which was sent to campaign in closely-contested seats. MacKinlay reported a total spend of 14,837.77 pounds  ($19,171.88) against a maximum limit of 15,016.38 but prosecutors say other expenses were deliberately omitted. The 2015 election saw MacKinlay beat Farage, the former head of Britain's UK Independence Party (UKIP), into second by 2,812 votes.  He then retained the seat in June with an increased majority of more than 6,000 votes as support for UKIP collapsed with Farage, who played a key role in securing Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year, no longer the party's candidate. In May, prosecutors ruled out bringing more widespread criminal charges over allegations of expenses fraud by the Conservatives during the 2015 campaign. The Crown Prosecution Service had considered information from 14 police forces across the country about whether the party had broken spending limits, which are governed by tight, complex rules, but decided there was insufficient evidence to charge any individuals. The Electoral Commission, the independent election watchdog, in March fined the Conservatives a record 70,000 pounds ($91,000) for breaking rules by incorrectly reporting its spending.

There have been a few false alarms since the Indonesian government banned all exports of unprocessed minerals, including nickel, at the start of 2014.  China's trade figures have shown the occasional import of what has been classified as nickel ore but which was in all probability iron ore with high nickel content.  But May's 264,000 tonnes seem the real deal. Not only was it the largest monthly total in three years but it tallies with plans by Indonesia's Aneka Tambang (Antam) to make its first 150,000-tonne shipment at the start of the month. It's still a fraction of what Indonesia used to send every month to China before 2014.  The export ban remains in place but with a growing number of exemptions for companies that have committed to building processing plants.  For the Chinese nickel pig iron (NPI) producers that depend on such ore, it marks a dramatic turnaround from what looked like an existential crisis when Indonesia first cut off their supply.  Famine, however, has now turned to feast. Indonesian ore will add to a growing number of nickel raw materials flows into China.  And that spells trouble for the rest of the world's producers.  Graphic on China's imports of Indonesian nickel raw materials:  tmsnrt.rs/2tcthgB Full breakdown of China's nickel trade in May:  Doubling Up in Indonesia Indonesia is not going to be supplying the same volumes of nickel ore to China as it did in 2012 or 2013, when imports reached 34 million and 41 million tonnes respectively.  The government is granting only a limited number of exemptions with limited tonnage quotas.  Antam, for example, has around five million tonnes of low-grade ore available for immediate shipment but so far has got approval to export only 2.7 million tonnes over the 12 months to March 2018.  But it is pushing for more.  And others are joining the list of approved exporters. The latest is PT Ceria Nugraha, which has received government permission to export 2.3 million tonnes through July 2018. The quid pro quo for getting the official nod to export is construction of value-add processing plants within the country. This was the whole point of the export ban and to some extent it has been achieved with the number of plants constructed now in excess of 20. Many of them, not entirely surprisingly, have been built by Chinese companies looking to  off-shore NPI production.  There has been a steadily increasing flow of Indonesian intermediate material into China since the start of 2015. May's imports of 158,130 tonnes were a fresh all-time high.  China's customs department classifies this stuff as  ferronickel  but it's not. The give-away is the price, an average $1,362 per ton in May, compared with over $3,000 per ton for imports from conventional ferronickel suppliers such as Colombia and Brazil.  Graphic on China's imports of Philippine nickel ore:  tmsnrt.rs/2tM996v Philippines Down but Far from Out While China doubles up on Indonesian supply, it can now also feast on the alternative ore sources that arose after the 2014 export ban.  The Philippines emerged as the main source of replacement supply for Indonesian ore. It was another part of China's supply chain that seemed in imminent danger of collapse until a few weeks ago.  However, Regina Lopez, the Philippine firebrand environment secretary who wanted to close just about all the country's nickel mines, has now gone.  Her replacement, Roy Cimatu, has taken a much more conciliatory approach and many of the targeted mines have continued operating anyway after filing appeals against Lopez' closure orders. China's imports of Philippine ore looked to have fallen off a cliff in the first quarter of this year, plummeting by 20 percent to 2.3 million tonnes.  But they recovered strongly over the course of April and May with the cumulative year-to-date tally of 6.7 million tonnes down by a modest 7 percent on last year's equivalent figure.  A particularly severe monsoon season and normal mine depletion have had a more significant impact than Ms Lopez.  Nor has the Philippines been the only country to have benefited from Indonesia's shipping absence.  New Caledonia has redirected its ore shipments from the bankrupt and now shuttered Queensland Nickel refinery in Australia to China.  Chinese imports of New Caledonian material have more than tripled so far this year to 346,000 tonnes.  Other new ore suppliers now regularly appearing in China's trade figures include Guatemala and Turkey with imports this year of 147,200 tonnes and 91,700 tonnes respectively.  Refined Nickel Imports Slide China's massive NPI sector has survived two potentially killer supply blows in the form of the original Indonesian ban and last year's threat of widespread mine closures in the Philippines.  It has emerged with a more geographically diverse nickel raw materials supply chain than ever before. Rumors of its imminent demise, which have been plentiful in recent years, appear to have been seriously exaggerated.  But the flip side of its survival is a steady slide in China's appetite for nickel in refined metal form.  Imports slumped by 57 percent to 83,400 tonnes in the January-May period from 195,000 tonnes in the same period of 2016.  Exports, meanwhile, jumped by 45 percent to 7,400 tonnes.

We must expect further attacks by individuals or terror groups,  Maassen said, citing growing evidence and over 1,000 expressions of concern from the general public about growing risks.  Islamist terrorism is the biggest challenge facing the BfV and we see it as one of the biggest threats facing the internal security of Germany,  he said. The agency's annual report for 2016 said there were 24,400 Islamists in Germany, including around 9,700 Salafists, and the number of Salafists had increased to 10,100 this year.

There have been a few false alarms since the Indonesian government banned all exports of unprocessed minerals, including nickel, at the start of 2014.  China's trade figures have shown the occasional import of what has been classified as nickel ore but which was in all probability iron ore with high nickel content.  But May's 264,000 tonnes seem the real deal. Not only was it the largest monthly total in three years but it tallies with plans by Indonesia's Aneka Tambang (Antam) to make its first 150,000-tonne shipment at the start of the month. It's still a fraction of what Indonesia used to send every month to China before 2014.  The export ban remains in place but with a growing number of exemptions for companies that have committed to building processing plants.  For the Chinese nickel pig iron (NPI) producers that depend on such ore, it marks a dramatic turnaround from what looked like an existential crisis when Indonesia first cut off their supply.  Famine, however, has now turned to feast. Indonesian ore will add to a growing number of nickel raw materials flows into China.  And that spells trouble for the rest of the world's producers.  Graphic on China's imports of Indonesian nickel raw materials:  tmsnrt.rs/2tcthgB Full breakdown of China's nickel trade in May:  Doubling Up in Indonesia Indonesia is not going to be supplying the same volumes of nickel ore to China as it did in 2012 or 2013, when imports reached 34 million and 41 million tonnes respectively.  The government is granting only a limited number of exemptions with limited tonnage quotas.  Antam, for example, has around five million tonnes of low-grade ore available for immediate shipment but so far has got approval to export only 2.7 million tonnes over the 12 months to March 2018.  But it is pushing for more.  And others are joining the list of approved exporters. The latest is PT Ceria Nugraha, which has received government permission to export 2.3 million tonnes through July 2018. The quid pro quo for getting the official nod to export is construction of value-add processing plants within the country. This was the whole point of the export ban and to some extent it has been achieved with the number of plants constructed now in excess of 20. Many of them, not entirely surprisingly, have been built by Chinese companies looking to  off-shore NPI production.  There has been a steadily increasing flow of Indonesian intermediate material into China since the start of 2015. May's imports of 158,130 tonnes were a fresh all-time high.  China's customs department classifies this stuff as  ferronickel  but it's not. The give-away is the price, an average $1,362 per ton in May, compared with over $3,000 per ton for imports from conventional ferronickel suppliers such as Colombia and Brazil.  Graphic on China's imports of Philippine nickel ore:  tmsnrt.rs/2tM996v Philippines Down but Far from Out While China doubles up on Indonesian supply, it can now also feast on the alternative ore sources that arose after the 2014 export ban.  The Philippines emerged as the main source of replacement supply for Indonesian ore. It was another part of China's supply chain that seemed in imminent danger of collapse until a few weeks ago.  However, Regina Lopez, the Philippine firebrand environment secretary who wanted to close just about all the country's nickel mines, has now gone.  Her replacement, Roy Cimatu, has taken a much more conciliatory approach and many of the targeted mines have continued operating anyway after filing appeals against Lopez' closure orders. China's imports of Philippine ore looked to have fallen off a cliff in the first quarter of this year, plummeting by 20 percent to 2.3 million tonnes.  But they recovered strongly over the course of April and May with the cumulative year-to-date tally of 6.7 million tonnes down by a modest 7 percent on last year's equivalent figure.  A particularly severe monsoon season and normal mine depletion have had a more significant impact than Ms Lopez.  Nor has the Philippines been the only country to have benefited from Indonesia's shipping absence.  New Caledonia has redirected its ore shipments from the bankrupt and now shuttered Queensland Nickel refinery in Australia to China.  Chinese imports of New Caledonian material have more than tripled so far this year to 346,000 tonnes.  Other new ore suppliers now regularly appearing in China's trade figures include Guatemala and Turkey with imports this year of 147,200 tonnes and 91,700 tonnes respectively.  Refined Nickel Imports Slide China's massive NPI sector has survived two potentially killer supply blows in the form of the original Indonesian ban and last year's threat of widespread mine closures in the Philippines.  It has emerged with a more geographically diverse nickel raw materials supply chain than ever before. Rumors of its imminent demise, which have been plentiful in recent years, appear to have been seriously exaggerated.  But the flip side of its survival is a steady slide in China's appetite for nickel in refined metal form.  Imports slumped by 57 percent to 83,400 tonnes in the January-May period from 195,000 tonnes in the same period of 2016.  Exports, meanwhile, jumped by 45 percent to 7,400 tonnes.  All of which is bad news for everyone else.  There are 446,000 tonnes of refined nickel sitting in London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses. There is almost certainly a lot more hiding in the off-exchange statistical shadows.  Lacking a bull narrative since the political demise of Ms Lopez in the Philippines, the London price is looking bombed out again just above $9,000 per ton.  Which means it's back to the cost-curve drawing board.  Brazil's Vale confirmed on Tuesday it is reassessing its loss-making New Caledonian operations. It won't be the only nickel producer to be running the numbers again.  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

Along with the U.S. dollar, the yen suffered last week from a shift towards tighter monetary policy by central bank officials outside the United States and many had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia to fall into line with the trend. But the Aussie central bank's neutral stance on rates was broadly unchanged and the Aussie dollar, up in earlier trade, sank in response.  Sweden's Riksbank also stuck to forecasts for rates not to rise until the middle of next year and said, while it did not expect to cut borrowing costs again, it did not rule that out, pushing its crown currency lower.  The fact that the RBA didn't meet the expectations for a shift to more hawkish rhetoric was a big driver,  said Lee Hardman, an analyst with Japan's MUFG in London.  If the yen has weakened in the past week it has been on the idea that the central banks were shifting to a more hawkish stance. And obviously this goes in the other direction.  The yen, also helped by Asian investors seeking safe havens for their money after a missile launch by North Korea, rose around 0.2 percent against the dollar and double that against the euro. A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationThe Aussie, which hit almost four-month highs in last week's moves, fell 0.8 percent on the day to $0.7599.   While the dollar slipped against the yen, it stood firm at 96.309 against the basket of six major currencies used to measure its broader strength.  That followed its strongest daily gain in almost four months on Monday, helped by better-than-expected U.S. factory activity data which propelled the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy. But a number of analysts have begun to highlight the chances of ECB policymakers, three of whom speak on Tuesday, expressing concern about euro appreciation - or simply dialling down any more rhetoric on tightening - if the currency gets much higher.   Last Thursday, euro sentiment reached an extreme with 93 percent of traders bullish, before settling down to 82 percent yesterday,  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.   The last time the index reached this high was in February 2013, causing the ECB to intervene verbally. We expect a EUR downward correction, but the magnitude of the anticipated correction will be ... moderate.  Despite that call, the U.S. bank recommended buying in to any break for the euro above $1.1450. It traded 0.2 percent lower by 1320 GMT at $1.1341.

The cracker is expected to have a capacity of 1,500 kilotonnes per year (KTA) (1.5 million tonnes per year), said a source familiar with the plans, who described them as at an initial stage. The feedstock would partially come from SATORP, the existing Aramco-Total joint refining venture, and from Sadara, a joint venture between Aramco and Dow Chemical, also in Jubail. Sadara operates a mixed-feed cracker, the first in Saudi Arabia. The idea of the cracker has been raised before. In 2010, an executive from Total Petrochemicals, a unit of Total, said it could be the largest possible, typically 1,500 KTA of ethylene and 500 KTA of propylene, plus derivatives.  It is a greenfield project, they have launched the bidding for the feasibility study,  said one of the sources, adding the study did not include a refinery expansion. He estimated the cost of the project known as Amiral to be around $3 billion, while another source said the cost of the cracker and other downstream units was expected to be around $5 billion.  Despite having massive natural gas reserves, Saudi Arabia is short of gas supplies as the majority of its gas reserves are associated with oil, said energy consultant Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Aramco. Saudi Arabia is currently restricting oil output as part of an international agreement.   There remains of course the potential for more gas discoveries as the kingdom's shale gas exploration program gathers momentum,  he said, adding the availability of ethane would be key to the overall economics of the project.  Saudi Aramco plans to double its gas production in a decade, including shale that will add around 2-3 billion standard cubic feet to the mix. But the kingdom is encouraging the petrochemicals industry to include more liquid feedstock to diversify and become less vulnerable to price fluctuations. For instance, Aramco plans to develop a project with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) with a new technology that converts crude oil to chemicals by limiting extensive refining. A second source said SATORP had issued a tender for pre-feed engineering and design to upgrade its production of aromatics, with an award of that contract seen by the second quarter of 2019. Saudi Aramco declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Total said the company was still interested in developing petrochemicals units downstream of SATORP's refinery, which already produces some petrochemicals products: paraxylene, benzene and propylene.  It is consistent with our strategy of investing in our major integrated refining and chemicals platform and capitalizing on advantaged feedstock,  the Total spokeswoman said, adding:  the main issue is the gas feedstock allocation.  The two companies have already been operating the 400,000 barrels per day SATORP refinery integrated with petrochemical production and have considered expanding petrochemicals output for several years. In 2015, Total said partners would need to solve the issue of obtaining natural gas supplies before moving on to detailed studies of the project. In February last year, a Total executive said the two companies were considering expanding the refining capacity of the project by 10 percent. Saudi Aramco owns 62.5 percent of SATORP and Total 37.5 percent.

Along with the U.S. dollar, the yen suffered last week from a shift towards tighter monetary policy by central bank officials outside the United States and many had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia to fall into line with the trend. But the Aussie central bank's neutral stance on rates was broadly unchanged and the Aussie dollar, up in earlier trade, sank in response.  Sweden's Riksbank also stuck to forecasts for rates not to rise until the middle of next year and said, while it did not expect to cut borrowing costs again, it did not rule that out, pushing its crown currency lower.  The fact that the RBA didn't meet the expectations for a shift to more hawkish rhetoric was a big driver,  said Lee Hardman, an analyst with Japan's MUFG in London.  If the yen has weakened in the past week it has been on the idea that the central banks were shifting to a more hawkish stance. And obviously this goes in the other direction.  The yen, also helped by Asian investors seeking safe havens for their money after a missile launch by North Korea, rose around 0.2 percent against the dollar and double that against the euro. A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationThe Aussie, which hit almost four-month highs in last week's moves, fell 0.8 percent on the day to $0.7599.   While the dollar slipped against the yen, it stood firm at 96.309 against the basket of six major currencies used to measure its broader strength.  That followed its strongest daily gain in almost four months on Monday, helped by better-than-expected U.S. factory activity data which propelled the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy. But a number of analysts have begun to highlight the chances of ECB policymakers, three of whom speak on Tuesday, expressing concern about euro appreciation - or simply dialling down any more rhetoric on tightening - if the currency gets much higher.   Last Thursday, euro sentiment reached an extreme with 93 percent of traders bullish, before settling down to 82 percent yesterday,  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.   The last time the index reached this high was in February 2013, causing the ECB to intervene verbally. We expect a EUR downward correction, but the magnitude of the anticipated correction will be ... moderate.  Despite that call, the U.S. bank recommended buying in to any break for the euro above $1.1450. It traded 0.2 percent lower by 1320 GMT at $1.1341.

The flood began last Friday when the 60 meter (yard) high wall of a reservoir at a phosphate factory partially collapsed, letting loose 100,000 cubic meters (26.4 million gallons) of highly acidic wastewater in the Ashalim riverbed. That was enough fluid to fill 40 Olympic-sized pools. The toxic torrent snaked through the desert, singeing anything in its path, before collecting again hours later in a pool several kilometers from the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth. Days later, the ground is still stained a dark brown and giving off a nauseating acidic stench, more potent than a highly chlorinated swimming pool. One section of the Ashalim riverbed is made up of narrow canyons, popular for hiking, but no one was around when the wastewater first gushed through. A collapsed wall of a reservoir holding a highly acidic wastewater is seen in Mishor Rotem, in Southern Israel July 4, 2017.Baz RatnerIsrael’s Ministry of Environment has opened a criminal investigation into the plant’s owner, Rotem Amfert, and its parent company Israel Chemicals (ICL), a leading potash and fertilizer producer with exclusive rights in Israel to mine the Dead Sea. “All the plants and animals in the valley during the tsunami of acid were probably highly damaged, probably dead,  said Oded Netzer, an ecologist for the ministry.  In the long term, there will be soil damage and large functional ecological problems.  Residue of toxic wastewater is seen in the Ashalim riverbed in Mishor Rotem, Southern Israel July 4, 2017.Baz RatnerHe said weeks of intense clean-up work, including pumping out small pools of the wastewater that remain along the path, lay ahead, and complete rehabilitation would likely take years. ICL has stopped using the series of reservoirs where the breech occurred. They contained a production by-product called phosphogypsum water. The company declined to answer questions on the criminal investigation or about the impact the incident will have on its operations. Shares in ICL fell almost 4 percent after the spill but partially recovered to trade 1.3 percent higher on Tuesday. In a statement, Rotem Amfert said it was working  around the clock  in full coordination with authorities, and it would spare no resources to clean up the riverbed.

Tensions between minority Muslims and majority Buddhists have been running high in Rakhine since an army crackdown in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks in October, but Sittwe has not seen a repeat of communal clashes that killed dozens and displaced about 140,000 people in 2012. The seven men had traveled into Sittwe from a camp on the outskirts of the town housing people displaced in the 2012 violence, said Police Captain Kyaw Moe at Sittwe's central police station.  They were attacked by several people with bricks,  he said.  A local administrator from the quarter where the attack took place, Htay Win Tun, said the attackers were Rakhine Buddhist residents of Sittwe. Most Muslim residents have been confined to camps since 2012, when whole Muslim neighborhoods were razed. Rohingyas are denied citizenship in Myanmar, where many see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They are usually only permitted to leave the camps - and Sittwe's one remaining  Muslim ward, penned in by checkpoints - when accompanied by security personnel. On Tuesday, the men had been allowed to leave their camp to give statements in a case at Sittwe's court, and had afterwards gone to see a boat they were planning to buy from a Rakhine businessman, according to a military intelligence officer in Sittwe and the nephew of one of the men. At the boat jetty, according to a note on the incident by the United Nations Security Operations Centre in Myanmar, an argument developed. The raised voices attracted the attention of other ethnic Rakhine men nearby, who allegedly began throwing rocks at the group, the note said. The UN note went on to say that rumors spreading on social media about the incident were  fuelling anxieties and elevating tensions within communities in Sittwe, and elsewhere , and that police had increased patrols in the town. Security forces in Rakhine have been on high alert since last week, after hundreds of villagers from both Buddhist and Muslim communities fled their settlements in the north of the state after a spate of killings and amid fears of fresh attacks by Rohingya insurgents. The United Nations has established a fact-finding mission to investigate crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the military during the counter-offensive following the October attacks. The administration of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected the allegations and opposes the mission.

The new rules are part of a wider overhaul of tax regulation spurred by the so-called Panama Papers and other revelations of widespread tax avoidance by companies and wealthy individuals. They do, however, still need approval from the EU member states in coming months, and would then have to be enacted into national law in each country within a year. EU countries lose between 50 and 70 billion euros in revenues every year because of tax avoidance, the vice president of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, told lawmakers.  The new measure would require firms with activities in the EU and an annual turnover of at least 750 million euros ($850 million) to disclose data such as profits, revenues, taxes paid and number of employees for each country where they operate. Currently, multinationals disclose their operations in one consolidated report. Tax-dodging schemes often hinge on the transfer of taxable profits from the higher-tax states where they are made to countries with lower taxation or none at all. Tax-saving schemes used by Apple, Amazon, Google, Starbucks and other companies have raised public pressure for EU-wide rules to close these loopholes. The original legislative proposal made by the European Commission required country-by-country disclosures only for operations in EU states and in tax havens, although there is no common EU list of such jurisdictions. The European Parliament changed the proposed rules to extend the reporting requirement to all countries where firms operate. To protect Europe's competitiveness, the conservative and liberal groups in the EU legislature successfully pushed for companies to be allowed to apply for limited-period exemptions from disclosing information that is commercially sensitive. But the bill does not specify what would be considered sensitive. The anti-corruption group Transparency International called the exemption a  massive loophole  that could undermine the new legislation, and another campaign group, Oxfam, said lawmakers were  bowing to big business . German conservative legislator Markus Ferber said the clause was necessary to prevent companies  handing away business secrets to the competition on a silver platter .

ECB policymakers have been trying to steady investors since suggestions by President Mario Draghi last week that the central bank may change its policy rattled markets. Echoing Draghi's remarks, Praet predicted that stronger growth in the euro zone would boost returns on investments, thereby making borrowing more attractive and reinforcing the ECB's monetary stimulus. But he cautioned that ultra-easy financial conditions were still needed.  The baseline scenario for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance,  he said at an event in Rome.     Draghi's comments in Sintra, Portugal, sent euro zone government bond yields and the euro EUR= rallying last week, threatening to undo some of the central bank's own work. Sources have told Reuters the market move had spooked some policymakers, making the nervous about signaling a change in policy when they meet again on July 20.

Juncker, himself from the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, was visibly annoyed as he watched the proceedings in the near empty parliamentary chamber in Strasbourg.  You are ridiculous,  the European Commission president told the gathering called to listen to a speech by Malta's Joseph Muscat, in a blunt public rebuke of another EU institution.  The fact that there's about 30 members of parliament present in this debate only really illustrates the fact that parliament is not serious,  he said.  The European Parliament is ridiculous, very ridiculous.     Juncker said Malta, the EU's smallest country, which has just completed a stint running the bloc's presidency, deserved better.  If Mr. Muscat was Mrs Merkel, difficult as that is to imagine, or Mr Macron ... we would have a full house,  Juncker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. Parliament president Antonio Tajani did not address the low attendance, but told Juncker himself to take a more respectful tone.  You may criticize the parliament, yes, but the Commission does not control the parliament, it's the parliament that should be controlling the Commission,  he said, to scattered applause. Juncker later apologized to Tajani, a parliamentary spokesman said. Juncker's Dutch deputy defended the outburst as the mark of a  passionate  politician:  Jean-Claude has a habit of letting his heart speak,  Frans Timmermans told reporters. Institutional rivalries are a staple of EU political life. Juncker's Commission is a frequent target of national leaders and EU lawmakers for trying to impose the views of the Brussels-based administration on elected bodies. Juncker often accuses member states of reneging on commitments or undermining the EU and has used the parliament as an ally against national demands. But the Commission shares with the Council of member states a mistrust of Parliament's ambitions. Lawmakers' powers over EU legislation were enhanced by the 2009 Lisbon Treaty but national governments scoff at its claims to be the most democratically legitimate EU body because fewer than half the bloc's voters bother to take part in European elections. Its treaty obligation to divide its sittings between Brussels and Strasbourg is also a source of embarrassment -- and costs -- for the legislature, though there was little sign that traveling had kept the chamber empty for Muscat on Tuesday. Later on, it was packed for other parliamentary business. Slightly more than 400,000 people live on Malta, putting it just behind Luxembourg in the EU population league table. Muscat, who smiled during Juncker's remarks, gave parliament a briefing on his country's presidency, focused on the migration crisis and called Brexit a  disastrous creature which all of us should have seen coming but none of us acted to stop .

There are excellent opportunities to unlock value from the many high quality businesses that currently comprise Clariant,  said a spokesman for White Tale, the vehicle they created to buy the stake.   Unfortunately, we do not believe that the proposed merger with the Huntsman Corporation is one of those options.  Meister, who is a protege of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, manages assets worth $6 billion with Corvex and took a 5.5 percent stake in communications company Century Inc (CTL.N) earlier this year. 40 North, run by New York real estate investor David Winter and former Bear, Stearns & Company financial analyst David Millstone, held a stake in Clariant before linking with Corvex in their bid to overturn the Huntsman deal. Winter and Millstone are also co-CEOs of roofing maker Standard Industries. Their gambit is the latest by a U.S.-based activist investor  in Europe, with billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point  last month taking a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle (NESN.S) to pressure the Swiss food giant to boost performance and repurchase shares. Nestle subsequently announced a nearly $21 billion share buyback. Clariant, which on Tuesday noted the increased investment by Corvex without addressing Corvex's opposition to the merger, said it has been in contact with the hedge fund since last year when it initially took a stake.  As with all our shareholders we maintain an open dialogue with them,  a Clariant spokesman said.  Huntsman did not return a phone call seeking comment. Clariant shares traded 3 percent higher by 1310 GMT.   Friendly Merger Clariant and Huntsman in May announced a merger valued at around $20 billion including debt in which Clariant shareholders would hold 52 percent of the combination. They talked up the friendship between chief executives Hariolf Kottmann and Peter Huntsman as well as prospects for faster growth for the combined company as rationale for  a merger of equals . Among other things, they expect about $400 million in annual cost synergies. Keith Meister, founder and chief investment officer at Corvex Management LP., speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York May 4, 2015.Brendan McDermidThe deal, creating a company with about $13 billion in annual sales, had support of German families that own almost 14 percent of Clariant.  The stake at least gives Corvex and 40 North a platform to lobby against the deal or try to flush out an alternative bid.  They contend the Clariant-Huntsman transaction lacks strategic rationale and undercuts Clariant's strategy of becoming a pure-play specialty chemicals company.  Shareholders ought to reject this value destructive merger,  the White Tale spokesman said.  Some analysts said the merger makes sense, in particular after Huntsman spins off its Venator pigments business in an IPO.  Huntsman's portfolio, after the pending Venator spin-off, offers a highly complementary growth portfolio, in our view - complementary in a way that it puts both companies on a sounder, broader footing,  Kepler Cheuvreux's Christian Faitz said. No Date for Vote No date has yet been set for shareholders to vote on the merger, Clariant said, but a source familiar with the situation said a meeting would be scheduled only after Huntsman spins off Venator. The source said a business combination agreement between Clariant and Huntsman is already in place and would be difficult to rewrite. Still, some investors said the merger always looked like a defensive move designed to protect Clariant or Huntsman from being swallowed up by a larger group.  We sold our position following the Huntsman announcement,  said a former top-10 investor in Clariant.  The logic for value accretion for Clariant shareholders was questionable, so I do understand where Corvex is coming from.  Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said a counteroffer was now more likely, citing Germany's Evonik (EVKn.DE) and Lanxess (LXSG.DE) as having courted Clariant in the past and as companies including BASF (BASFn.DE) that could still be interested in the Swiss company.  Clariant is an attractive bride,  said Martin Lehmann, of 3V Asset Management AG in Zurich. Clariant is among his fund's largest holdings.  I hope another interested party steps in and makes an offer,  he said. 40 North's Winter and Millstone also have been building up Standard Industries, their roofing materials company, including through a $2.1 billion takeover of Germany's Braas Monier and the $1 billion purchase of Denmark's Icopal.

ECB policymakers have been trying to steady investors since suggestions by President Mario Draghi last week that the central bank may change its policy rattled markets. Echoing Draghi's remarks, Praet predicted that stronger growth in the euro zone would boost returns on investments, thereby making borrowing more attractive and reinforcing the ECB's monetary stimulus. But he cautioned that ultra-easy financial conditions were still needed.  The baseline scenario for future inflation remains crucially contingent on very easy financing conditions which, to a large extent, depend on the current accommodative monetary policy stance,  he said at an event in Rome.     Draghi's comments in Sintra, Portugal, sent euro zone government bond yields and the euro EUR= rallying last week, threatening to undo some of the central bank's own work. Sources have told Reuters the market move had spooked some policymakers, making the nervous about signaling a change in policy when they meet again on July 20. The ECB is on course to buying 2.3 trillion euros worth of bonds in a bid to bring inflation back to its target of almost 2 percent, from just above 1 percent currently.

The cracker is expected to have a capacity of 1,500 kilotonnes per year (KTA) (1.5 million tonnes per year), said a source familiar with the plans, who described them as at an initial stage. The feedstock would partially come from SATORP, the existing Aramco-Total joint refining venture, and from Sadara, a joint venture between Aramco and Dow Chemical, also in Jubail. Sadara operates a mixed-feed cracker, the first in Saudi Arabia. The idea of the cracker has been raised before. In 2010, an executive from Total Petrochemicals, a unit of Total, said it could be the largest possible, typically 1,500 KTA of ethylene and 500 KTA of propylene, plus derivatives.  It is a greenfield project, they have launched the bidding for the feasibility study,  said one of the sources, adding the study did not include a refinery expansion. He estimated the cost of the project known as Amiral to be around $3 billion, while another source said the cost of the cracker and other downstream units was expected to be around $5 billion.  Despite having massive natural gas reserves, Saudi Arabia is short of gas supplies as the majority of its gas reserves are associated with oil, said energy consultant Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Aramco. Saudi Arabia is currently restricting oil output as part of an international agreement.   There remains of course the potential for more gas discoveries as the kingdom's shale gas exploration program gathers momentum,  he said, adding the availability of ethane would be key to the overall economics of the project.  Saudi Aramco plans to double its gas production in a decade, including shale that will add around 2-3 billion standard cubic feet to the mix. But the kingdom is encouraging the petrochemicals industry to include more liquid feedstock to diversify and become less vulnerable to price fluctuations. For instance, Aramco plans to develop a project with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) with a new technology that converts crude oil to chemicals by limiting extensive refining. A second source said SATORP had issued a tender for pre-feed engineering and design to upgrade its production of aromatics, with an award of that contract seen by the second quarter of 2019. Saudi Aramco declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Total said the company was still interested in developing petrochemicals units downstream of SATORP's refinery, which already produces some petrochemicals products: paraxylene, benzene and propylene.  It is consistent with our strategy of investing in our major integrated refining and chemicals platform and capitalizing on advantaged feedstock,  the Total spokeswoman said, adding:  the main issue is the gas feedstock allocation.  The two companies have already been operating the 400,000 barrels per day SATORP refinery integrated with petrochemical production and have considered expanding petrochemicals output for several years. In 2015, Total said partners would need to solve the issue of obtaining natural gas supplies before moving on to detailed studies of the project. In February last year, a Total executive said the two companies were considering expanding the refining capacity of the project by 10 percent. Saudi Aramco owns 62.5 percent of SATORP and Total 37.5 percent.

There are excellent opportunities to unlock value from the many high quality businesses that currently comprise Clariant,  said a spokesman for White Tale, the vehicle they created to buy the stake.   Unfortunately, we do not believe that the proposed merger with the Huntsman Corporation is one of those options.  Meister, who is a protege of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, manages assets worth $6 billion with Corvex and took a 5.5 percent stake in communications company Century Inc (CTL.N) earlier this year. 40 North, run by New York real estate investor David Winter and former Bear, Stearns & Company financial analyst David Millstone, held a stake in Clariant before linking with Corvex in their bid to overturn the Huntsman deal. Winter and Millstone are also co-CEOs of roofing maker Standard Industries. Their gambit is the latest by a U.S.-based activist investor  in Europe, with billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point  last month taking a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle (NESN.S) to pressure the Swiss food giant to boost performance and repurchase shares. Nestle subsequently announced a nearly $21 billion share buyback. Clariant, which on Tuesday noted the increased investment by Corvex without addressing Corvex's opposition to the merger, said it has been in contact with the hedge fund since last year when it initially took a stake.  As with all our shareholders we maintain an open dialogue with them,  a Clariant spokesman said.  Huntsman did not return a phone call seeking comment. Clariant shares traded 3 percent higher by 1310 GMT.   Friendly Merger Clariant and Huntsman in May announced a merger valued at around $20 billion including debt in which Clariant shareholders would hold 52 percent of the combination. They talked up the friendship between chief executives Hariolf Kottmann and Peter Huntsman as well as prospects for faster growth for the combined company as rationale for  a merger of equals . Among other things, they expect about $400 million in annual cost synergies. Keith Meister, founder and chief investment officer at Corvex Management LP., speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York May 4, 2015.Brendan McDermidThe deal, creating a company with about $13 billion in annual sales, had support of German families that own almost 14 percent of Clariant.  The stake at least gives Corvex and 40 North a platform to lobby against the deal or try to flush out an alternative bid.  They contend the Clariant-Huntsman transaction lacks strategic rationale and undercuts Clariant's strategy of becoming a pure-play specialty chemicals company.  Shareholders ought to reject this value destructive merger,  the White Tale spokesman said.  Some analysts said the merger makes sense, in particular after Huntsman spins off its Venator pigments business in an IPO.  Huntsman's portfolio, after the pending Venator spin-off, offers a highly complementary growth portfolio, in our view - complementary in a way that it puts both companies on a sounder, broader footing,  Kepler Cheuvreux's Christian Faitz said. No Date for Vote No date has yet been set for shareholders to vote on the merger, Clariant said, but a source familiar with the situation said a meeting would be scheduled only after Huntsman spins off Venator. The source said a business combination agreement between Clariant and Huntsman is already in place and would be difficult to rewrite. Still, some investors said the merger always looked like a defensive move designed to protect Clariant or Huntsman from being swallowed up by a larger group.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - The fright factor in sequels is often less acute than in original features. In May 2013, emerging markets recoiled in horror as the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it was time to stop pumping them full of new cash, bearing the brunt of a  Taper Tantrum  that rippled around the globe. As other major central banks look to follow suit four years on,  Taper Tantrum II  is unlikely to pack the same shock value - at least not for developing economies jarred by the original. Compared to May 2013, emerging market currencies are significantly lower, borrowing rate premiums wider and overall asset valuations less frothy. With current account deficits more manageable, emerging economies are also less vulnerable to global shocks or sudden reversal of capital flows. Their debt levels have risen. The Institute of International Finance shows emerging economies have ramped up an extra $3 trillion of borrowing over the past year alone to a $56 trillion total while debt in mature markets had receded. But developing world exposure to non-dollar debt is much smaller and the actions of the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan are unlikely to match the impact of the Fed - whose policy trajectory remains the biggest threat but where gradual tightening has been under way for years. Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows that dollar credit to non-financial customers in emerging markets was $3.6 trillion last year, about a third of total dollar credit outside the United States. The euro- and yen-denominated equivalents were just 600 billion euros and 16 trillion yen ($143 billion), respectively. Take Two ... That's not to say emerging markets are completely insulated. If last week does prove to be a game changer, a tightening of central bank largesse across the world tends to lift U.S. Treasury yields regardless of any change of Fed thinking. Many of the world's top central bankers last week at the European Central Bank's annual forum in the Portuguese town of Sintra indicated that the post-crisis era of zero interest rates and powerful quantitative easing stimulus was drawing to an end. Analysts at Deutsche Bank dubbed it the  Sintra Pact . Coordinated or not, the ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and even Bank of Japan are, to varying degrees, talking along the same lines and looking to take their feet off the stimulus pedal. In response, long-term borrowing rates in the four major reserve currencies jumped suddenly, with yields in German Bunds, British gilts, U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds all recording some of their biggest weekly rises of 2017. But the original  Taper Tantrum  hit emerging markets so hard because their heavy reliance on dollar borrowing left them as, or even more, vulnerable to an outsize surge in the dollar exchange rate as any rise in borrowing rates themselves. Between early 2013 and the time of the first Fed rate hike in December 2015, the dollar index soared 25 percent. Emerging stocks fell 15 percent in less than a month and by early 2016 they had lost around a third of their value. JP Morgan's emerging market EMBI bond index fell 10 percent between May and September 2013. The EMBI sovereign yield spread widened almost 100 basis points in barely a month to 366 bps from 270 basis points. But if it's now a case of the ECB or BOJ catching up, the singular dollar surge is less likely and that dollar dampening effect should cushion the impact on emerging markets too. What's more, developing markets appear less stretched. Stocks have rallied strongly in the past 18 months but remain below highs of 2015, 2014 and 2011 and well short of the records of 2007. That contrasts with the all-time records Wall Street has been grinding out all year. And while developed market bond yields popped higher last week in response to signals from Sintra, the EMBI yield spread actually narrowed slightly and EM stocks barely budged. 'Taper Tantrum II' may yet become uncomfortable viewing for emerging markets, but it won't be the video nasty of four years ago.

The June 25 explosion took place after the oil tanker went off road to avoid a collision on a road outside the eastern city of Bahawalpur. A large crowd of people gathered around the truck and many began collecting fuel in containers when the tanker exploded in a huge fireball.  We are actively pursuing the issue and expect our third party investigators to issue a report by Thursday and we will then begin proceedings according to our rules and regulations,  a spokesman for the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), Imran Ghaznavi, told Reuters. Ghaznavi said the tanker was operated by a contractor hired by Shell Pakistan to transport gasoline from the southern port city of Karachi to the city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province. Shell Pakistan Ltd, a subsidiary of energy giant Royal Dutch Shell, issued a statement shortly after the accident saying it would cooperate fully with all investigations.  Road safety is a priority at Shell and we have already started our own investigation into the cause of the incident,” the company's managing director, Jawwad Cheema, said in the statement. At the time of the explosion, a spokesman for the Punjab provincial government said the truck went off the road after it blew a tyre and the driver lost control. The driver survived the accident and the subsequent explosion. Fuel is a precious commodity for villagers in Pakistan, where more than 60 percent of the population survives on $3 a day, according to a World Bank survey. Shell Pakistan said in a report it sent to the oil and gas regulator, and seen by Reuters, that  to avoid collision from behind, the driver moved the tank lorry to left hand side of the road on the soft shoulder which resulted in roll over of the tank lorry . Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced two million rupees ($20,000) compensation for the families of the victims on June 26. As of Tuesday, the death toll from the explosion was 209 with 60 people being treated in hospitals, a spokesman for Bahawalpur's Victoria Hospital, Amir Mehmood, told Reuters.

In the first phase, India's biggest power producer, NTPC (NTPC.NS), plans to build three new plants with a combined capacity of more than 5 gigawatts (GW), nearly double the capacity of those currently being phased out, five senior company officials said. The company has not made the investment public because it has not yet received government approval. If approved, the plan could set back efforts by the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter to control carbon output and raise questions about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vow to stand by commitments under the Paris climate accord. The proposal also comes as several coal-fired stations built in the last power boom a decade ago are standing idle due to softer-than-expected demand. State-controlled Coal India (COAL.NS) is struggling to sell its stockpile as a result.     But other indicators indicate demand will pick up, a top NTPC executive said, asking not to be named because the plan had not yet been announced.  I don't think (the current) electricity surplus will be there for a long time,  he told Reuters.  We should not fool ourselves.  More than 300 million of India's 1.3 billion people are still not hooked up to the grid, according to NITI Aayog, which makes policy recommendations to the government. As connections improve, the panel reckons, the country's per-capita power consumption could jump around a third to up to 2,924 kilowatt-hours by 2040 from 2012 levels. In the next decade, the around 50 GW of capacity from thermal plants due to come online by 2022 will meet demand, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said. Additional supplies will come from sources such as solar and wind, it said. Asked about NTPC's plan, CEA chairman RK Verma said the commercial decisions of the company were its own affair.  NTPC is a commercial organization and they must be having their own commercial considerations,  Verma said. For its part, a spokesperson at NTPC would say only:  NTPC takes decisions after consulting both the CEA and the ministry of power.  Thermal vs Renewable Solar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in three years to more than 12 GW since Modi targeted raising energy generation from renewable sources to 175 GW by 2022, against total installed capacity at the end of May of 330.3 GW.     Around 78 percent of generated power in India at the moment still comes from coal-fired plants, however, making it one of the biggest users of the dirty and cheap fuel in the world. Carbon dioxide emissions from India's thermal plants are expected to jump to 1,165 million tonnes by 2026/27 from 462 million tonnes in 2005, the CEA estimates. Emission intensity, measured in carbon dioxide emissions versus GDP, is likely to fall, however. India is undergoing a program to retrofit several coal-fired plants to reduce emissions. (bit.ly/2tBpNFI) The plants planned by NTPC are  supercritical , meaning they are 2-3 percent more efficient than conventional plants and therefore have lower emissions. NTPC's proposal is likely to be greeted with alarm by environmental activists who are already worried by the CEA's statement that existing power plants are unlikely to meet India's emission norms before the Paris deadline of December this year.  Adding more power plants would aggravate health impacts even further,  said Sunil Dahiya, an energy activist with Greenpeace in New Delhi, when asked about the possibility of new coal-fired plants.  NTPC's proposal is to build plants of two 660 megawatt (MW) units each at Singrauli in central India's Madhya Pradesh and Talcher in Odisha in the east.  The biggest plant, with a capacity of 2.4 GW in the eastern state of Jharkhand, was close to getting clearance from the environment ministry, one of many steps in the process of getting government approval, one of the senior company officials said.  A plan announced by NTPC last year to generate 10 GW of energy from renewable sources by 2022 was making slow progress due to land acquisition issues, another company official said.

I believe that when there is a clear political signal and willingness to act by manufacturers, I believe we can avoid bans,  VDA head Matthias Wissmann told a news conference on Tuesday. The German government, which has defended the car industry since the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal, is facing mounting pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce pollution from diesel cars or see courts force cities to impose driving bans. The government last week announced plans to work with vehicle makers and regional governments to find ways to reduce emissions, set to culminate in a meeting on Aug. 2. Wissmann said he expected the meeting would help lift the uncertainty that has been weighing on diesel sales in Germany due to the threat of driving bans, noting that more than 40 percent of cars sold in Germany are still diesels. Last month new car sales in Germany fell 3.5 percent to 327,693 vehicles, the KBA federal vehicle transport authority reported on Tuesday, dragged down by a 9 percent drop in sales of diesel cars while sales of gasoline-powered vehicles rose almost 12 percent. Wissmann said he was worried about diesel's market share falling because modern diesel engines emit 15 percent less carbon dioxide than gasoline-powered cars and can therefore help to reduce carbon emissions.  We will need diesel for a long time to reach our CO2 goals,  he said. Wissmann said a deal struck last week by the regional government in Bavaria to cut pollution corresponded with the common position of the VDA, which represents suppliers and carmakers including Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), suggesting it will form a basis for a national deal with the whole industry. Under the Bavarian deal, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Audi (NSUG.DE) agreed to engine management software updates to cut nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) for at least half of their diesel car fleets which only meet older Euro-5 emission standards. Wissmann said all German auto makers would offer updates for about half of the 6 million Euro-5 diesel cars on the roads that should cut their NOx emissions by about 25 percent. He said the industry would take on the development costs for the software and said an agreement on who should cover servicing costs should be reached by Aug. 2. The industry association said it expected German domestic car production and exports to fall 2 percent each this year to 5.6 million and 4.3 million autos respectively. Year-to-date registrations in Europe's largest auto market were still up 3 percent on year-earlier levels at 1.79 million vehicles, VDA said, confirming a Reuters story.

I believe that when there is a clear political signal and willingness to act by manufacturers, I believe we can avoid bans,  VDA head Matthias Wissmann told a news conference on Tuesday. The German government, which has defended the car industry since the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal, is facing mounting pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce pollution from diesel cars or see courts force cities to impose driving bans. The government last week announced plans to work with vehicle makers and regional governments to find ways to reduce emissions, set to culminate in a meeting on Aug. 2. Wissmann said he expected the meeting would help lift the uncertainty that has been weighing on diesel sales in Germany due to the threat of driving bans, noting that more than 40 percent of cars sold in Germany are still diesels. Last month new car sales in Germany fell 3.5 percent to 327,693 vehicles, the KBA federal vehicle transport authority reported on Tuesday, dragged down by a 9 percent drop in sales of diesel cars while sales of gasoline-powered vehicles rose almost 12 percent. Wissmann said he was worried about diesel's market share falling because modern diesel engines emit 15 percent less carbon dioxide than gasoline-powered cars and can therefore help to reduce carbon emissions.  We will need diesel for a long time to reach our CO2 goals,  he said. Wissmann said a deal struck last week by the regional government in Bavaria to cut pollution corresponded with the common position of the VDA, which represents suppliers and carmakers including Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), suggesting it will form a basis for a national deal with the whole industry. Under the Bavarian deal, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Audi (NSUG.DE) agreed to engine management software updates to cut nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) for at least half of their diesel car fleets which only meet older Euro-5 emission standards. Wissmann said all German auto makers would offer updates for about half of the 6 million Euro-5 diesel cars on the roads that should cut their NOx emissions by about 25 percent. He said the industry would take on the development costs for the software and said an agreement on who should cover servicing costs should be reached by Aug. 2. The industry association said it expected German domestic car production and exports to fall 2 percent each this year to 5.6 million and 4.3 million autos respectively. Year-to-date registrations in Europe's largest auto market were still up 3 percent on year-earlier levels at 1.79 million vehicles, VDA said, confirming a Reuters story.

It's impossible to buy cows from land that isn't deforested,  Felipe Oliveira told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in his tatty office at the abattoir in Brazil's Amazonas State.   Everyone here deforests... if they don't, it's impossible for a family to live,  the slaughterhouse boss said, sitting beneath exposed electrical wires hanging from the ceiling. If the Amazon forest, described as the lungs of the planet for its role sucking climate-changing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, is to be saved, then addressing the impact of livestock is the most pressing priority, environmentalists say. Deforestation Rises  The clearance of land for cattle pasture is responsible for 80 percent of the forest destruction in the Amazon, according to data from Yale University.  The rate of deforestation in the Amazon increased by 29 percent last year, according to government figures. Larger ranchers, truckers and traders have set up elaborate schemes to  launder  cattle raised on illegally deforested land on the legitimate market, said analysts and officials.  Brazilian authorities also link illegal deforestation to other crimes in the Amazon, such as forced labor on farms or  grilagem  - land grabs - by ranchers who fraudulently register properties occupied by small farmers to produce cattle. Powerful rural businessmen often bribe government officials or land registry agents known as  cartorios  to obtain property title deeds, according to Brazilian prosecutors. These illegally registered plots are often hotbeds of deforestation.   As the world's largest exporter of beef and chicken, the importance of Brazil's struggle to contain illegal deforestation for livestock extends far beyond rural Amazonian settlements. Bovine Battles In Boca do Acre, a poor municipality of wooden stilted homes with 28,000 residents, the cattle industry accounts for more than 70 percent of the economy, officials said. It's a reality replicated in towns throughout the Amazon rainforest, often making it difficult for officials to take a hard line enforcing laws on deforestation.   It's impossible for this city to live without cattle,  Josimar Fidelquino, a local government official responsible for environmental monitoring told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The municipality is the largest cattle producer in Amazonas, Brazil's biggest state, officials said. The FrigoAmazonas slaughterhouse employs more than 100 staff. In muddy rubber boots, ripped jeans and cowboy hats, they arrive at the plant in open-air trucks to process 1,200 head of cattle per month. The slaughterhouse produces meat exclusively for the local market in Amazonas State.   We know illegal cows are being killed by people in town,  said Fidelquino, adding that authorities are working on schemes to allow more cattle to be raised on smaller chunks of land. Typically, farmers simply cut down trees on a plot and allow cattle to graze freely, eating plants growing on the scrub land. The same number of cows could be produced on far smaller plots with supplies of hay or other feed, officials said.  The president of the Boca do Acre Ranchers Union, Paulo Castillo, refused interview requests about slaughterhouses and their adherence to deforestation or land registration rules.  Under Brazilian law, Amazon land owners must maintain 80 percent of the forest cover on their properties.  Some local farmers and slaughterhouse owners say that expectation is unrealistic; environmentalists say it's essential.  Regardless, laws on forest preservation and land governance are not well enforced in remote jungle regions, analysts said.   The Amazon is like the 'Wild West' was in America,  said Jose Puppim de Oliveira, a professor at Brazil's Getulio Vargas Foundation university, who studies land politics.   Forest land is considered unproductive, as are the people living there,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   'Constant Problem' While small slaughterhouses like FrigoAmazonas producing for the local market are known to flout environmental laws, they account for a comparatively small part of Amazon deforestation, said University of Wisconsin professor Holly Gibbs. About 90 percent of Brazil's cattle is processed in slaughterhouses that can export nationally or internationally,  Gibbs said, and they are a driver of deforestation. Large cattle companies say they are taking the problem seriously by improving their monitoring of suppliers and working with the government and environmentalists to try to keep cattle produced on illegally cleared land out of their supply chains.  Brazil-based JBS (JBSS3.SA), the world's largest meatpacker, has pledged not to buy cattle from deforested land in the Amazon, said an official at the company which is in the midst of a separate political corruption scandal.  Building a supply chain free from deforestation is a constant challenge for the entire industry,  a JBS official told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.  The company has been successful in stopping its direct suppliers from deforesting land, the official said, but monitoring indirect suppliers remains a  major challenge . Following the Cows Brazilian cows are supposed to have two tracking numbers so their origins can be traced by authorities.   The first is a health registration document known as a GTA - which shows cattle have received the right vaccinations along with information about the animal's transportation history.  The second is certification from Brazil's environment ministry known as a CAR showing that they were raised on legally registered land adhering to forest protection rules.  GTA documents could be the  holy grail for ending deforestation , said Gibbs, by acting as a passport for cattle. They could allow cattle to be tracked from birth until death and as they move between farms to trace legality. But the information is not publicly available.  Companies agree. JBS wants authorities to launch a new  Green GTA  to allow for better tracking of the origins of cattle. Government officials in Boca do Acre said they had no information about possible improvements to the GTA system.  Without clear tracking data, ranchers can move cattle from illegal land to legally registered properties just before selling them to slaughterhouses, Gibbs said. The border post in Amazonas State, where cattle documents are supposed to be inspected before bovines travel into neighboring Rondonia State, has been shuttered for months, said a cook who works at locked, dusty building. The lack of checks makes it harder for companies to monitor their supply chains. Back at FriggoAmazonas, slaughterhouse boss Oliveira says more paperwork under an expanded GTA system would make life even more difficult for small farmers.   Most of the small farmers here don't have titles or land registration,  Oliveira said.  How could they get these papers?  Some can't even sign their names.

The IPO was, nevertheless, the biggest stock market flotation in Malaysia since 2012.  The integrated petrochemical producer, part of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, had initially planned to price its offer last week. However, due to a lukewarm reception from investors it instead relaunched the IPO on Monday after slashing the shares on offer by a fifth to 580 million. It also lowered the indicative price range to 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share from 7.60-8.00 ringgit earlier. In a statement on Tuesday, Lotte Chemical Titan said the IPO had been priced at 6.50 ringgit. The company said global institutional investors accounted for about 30 percent of total demand while 23.5 percent of the shares was taken up by five local cornerstone investors.  The institutional offering of the IPO received strong demand from both Malaysian and global institutional investors, and was oversubscribed,  the company said in a statement. At 6.50 ringgit a share, Lotte Chemical Titan will have a market capitalization of about 15 billion ringgit, it said. The shares are due to start trading on Bursa Malaysia on July 11. Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters that retail interest for the IPO was weak as investors had deemed the offer overvalued.  Ninety percent of the institutional investors are long-only funds,  one source said, declining to be named as the process was private. The offering attracted five cornerstone investors - Permodalan Nasional, Eastspring Investments, Great Eastern Life Assurance Malaysia, Maybank Asset Management and Maybank Islamic Asset Management.

A survey released by the Financial Stability Board showed that from the start of 2011 to the end of 2016 the number of active correspondent banking relationships globally fell by 6%. The decline was more severe for US dollar and euro relationships, which both fell 15%.  The decline in the number of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) is continuing,  the FSB said in a report on Tuesday. The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation for G20 countries, said the decline was a concern because for affected countries it can lessen the ability to send and receive international payments, or drive payment flows underground. That can have  potential adverse consequences on international trade, growth, financial inclusion, as well as the stability and integrity of the financial system,  the FSB report said. Massive fines on several banks for breaching trade sanctions and rules related to anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and other areas of compliance have prompted dozens of banks to cut their relationships with banks in countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and elsewhere. Senior bankers have privately said that is because they fear getting slapped with a hefty fine by US regulators. Banks have erred on the side of caution, and cut relationships where they cannot be certain who they are dealing with, the bankers said. The British Bankers' Association warned three years ago that western banks had cut hundreds of relationships with banks in emerging markets, hurting businesses, governments and people in poorer countries. It prompted some government officials and bankers to urge a rethink to avoid hurting economies and driving financial transactions underground. Two years ago the FSB launched an action plan to assess and address the decline in correspondent banking. It said on Tuesday the plan was making progress, but more needed to be done. It said national regulators should clarify rules and supervision so banks know what is expected in their risk management. The monitoring of trends and the impact on countries needs to be improved, and technical assistance providers need to coordinate help to affected countries to improve their anti-money laundering and compliance frameworks, the FSB said. Developing 'know your customer' utilities could also help in conducting due diligence and reduce compliance costs, it said. Big Drop The survey released by the FSB showed the number of CBRs fell most sharply in eastern Europe (down 16%), Oceania (down 12%) and the Americas excluding North America (down 8%). Relationships in Europe excluding eastern Europe fell 15%, but the FSB said that was mainly due to the use of a Europe-wide payments system and consolidation in the industry. In 2016 alone, the Caribbean and the small Pacific areas of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia saw the highest rates of decline, of about 10% each, according to the survey of more than 300 banks and payment data from Swift. The FSB said a number of sometimes related factors can explain the reduction in CBRs, including a reduced risk appetite among banks, issues related to anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions regimes, industry consolidation or a lack of profitability from the business. The FSB will publish its next progress report in December. (Reporting by Steve Slater)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/risk-averse-banks-cut-correspondent-rela-idUSL8N1JV23V"},

Banks have been pulling out of the business for a variety of reasons from not making enough money to industry consolidation to the fear of falling foul of tougher new rules designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulations for the Group of 20 countries (G20), said the places most affected tended to be small economies or those finding it difficult to apply the new rules. The decline has raised concerns that some payments will pass through unregulated cash couriers instead, harming international trade and driving some people out of the world's financial system, the FSB said in a report. The FSB unveiled a four-point action plan in November 2015 to curb the decline and has since made clear that correspondent banks don't have to know their local customer's customer but the fall has shown no signs of abating.  The decline in the number of correspondent banking relationships is continuing,  the FSB report said. It said all regions had been hit to a varying degree, with the Caribbean and small states in the Pacific suffering the worst and Eastern Europe hit hard as well. The FSB said transactions in U.S. dollars and euros were the most affected. In correspondent banking, a global bank typically channels payments in country to a local bank with no international network in another country. Payment Volumes Stable The FSB said its latest update for G20 leaders meeting this week in Hamburg, Germany, draws on better data after sampling 300 banks in 50 countries, and payment messages from SWIFT, a global network that links lenders.  It is too early to tell what the effects of measures taken so far will be, and to what extent they will stem the decline,  the FSB said. The volume of payments remains roughly unchanged, but the involvement of fewer banks means longer payment chains and countries relying on fewer international lenders, the FSB said. The FSB will convene a meeting of private and public sector bodies on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank annual meetings in October to discuss its findings so. Another progress report is due in December. The watchdog will also obtain deeper and more frequent data on the sector from SWIFT over the coming year to monitor progress, while the World Bank is studying the impact of the decline on remittances to see if costs are being driven up. Alexander Karrer, chair of the FSB's Correspondent Banking Coordination Group, and Deputy State Secretary at the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, said the banking industry and regulators would continue to work together to make improvements to simplify due diligence in correspondent banking.

Industrial output, despite its recent improvement, remains 18.5 percent below its June 2013 peak, IBGE said.      This increase needs to be put into context,  IBGE economist André Macedo said.  There is a lot to be done for industry to recover the losses of its recent past.

Hosszu last month called on fellow swimmers to band together ahead of the 2017 World Championships in Hungary. She raised the possibility of boycotting global competitions. The main issue, she said at the time, was giving athletes more of a say in rule changes and getting them a fair share of the proceeds, especially from global events that draw millions of viewers. The 28 year-old Hungarian, who won three Olympic golds in Rio, earned more than $1 million in the past three seasons as she thoroughly dominated the FINA professional series. It makes her one of the few to cash in on her skill in the sport. Her success came fairly late in her career after she joined forces with her U.S. husband-and-coach, Shane Tussup. Dozens of top athletes answered her call within two weeks, Hosszu wrote on Tuesday in a post on her Facebook page, prompting her to establish the Global Association of Professional Swimmers (GAPS) and invite more athletes to join.  We believe that athletes are essential to a successful sport,  a statement on GAPS' web site swimmingprofessionals.org says.  Athletes should have a say in how their sport is formed and how the rules are changed. Right now our sport’s leaders are not involving us in these rule changes.  Alongside Hosszu, the 30 members of GAPS include 15 Olympic champions from all continents, she wrote. Names include British breaststroker Adam Peaty, Australian freestyler Bronte Campbell and others.  We now rightfully expect that leaders of FINA will give us a seat at the table. We expect swimmers to be treated as equal partners... in important decisions about the future of our sport,  Hosszu said. A spokesman for FINA, the global swimming body, declined to comment. FINA director Cornel Marculescu last month said Hosszu's call for action was an  anti-FINA open letter.  Other groups have also challenged FINA for the governance of the sport, including the World Swimming Association.

The IPO was, nevertheless, the biggest stock market flotation in Malaysia since 2012.  The integrated petrochemical producer, part of South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, had initially planned to price its offer last week. However, due to a lukewarm reception from investors it instead relaunched the IPO on Monday after slashing the shares on offer by a fifth to 580 million. It also lowered the indicative price range to 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share from 7.60-8.00 ringgit earlier. In a statement on Tuesday, Lotte Chemical Titan said the IPO had been priced at 6.50 ringgit. The company said global institutional investors accounted for about 30 percent of total demand while 23.5 percent of the shares was taken up by five local cornerstone investors.  The institutional offering of the IPO received strong demand from both Malaysian and global institutional investors, and was oversubscribed,  the company said in a statement. At 6.50 ringgit a share, Lotte Chemical Titan will have a market capitalization of about 15 billion ringgit, it said. The shares are due to start trading on Bursa Malaysia on July 11. Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters that retail interest for the IPO was weak as investors had deemed the offer overvalued.  Ninety percent of the institutional investors are long-only funds,  one source said, declining to be named as the process was private. The offering attracted five cornerstone investors - Permodalan Nasional, Eastspring Investments, Great Eastern Life Assurance Malaysia, Maybank Asset Management and Maybank Islamic Asset Management. Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Maybank are joint global coordinators for the IPO. Bookrunners are CIMB, HSBC and Nomura.

The arrest of the opposition leader has stoked political tensions in what is regarded as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies following a bruising election last year. The blaze started at dawn and destroyed property worth millions of kwacha and the entire southern part of Lusaka's City Market, one of the country's modern markets.

The opposition has accused Magufuli, nicknamed  the Bulldozer  for his blunt leadership style, of presiding over an increasingly authoritarian government. Kinondoni District Commissioner Ali Hapi ordered police to detain Halima Mdee, a lawmaker from the main opposition CHADEMA party, in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam and keep her for 48 hours pending criminal charges. She should be questioned and sent to court to explain the insults she made against our president,  Hapi told journalists. He did not say what the insults were.  Tanzania's laws allow regional and district commissioners to detain for 48 hours anyone who may  disturb public tranquillity.   Magufuli warned opposition leaders on Sunday against  reckless  remarks and ordered authorities to take action against any opposition leader who incites violence.  More than 10 people, including university students and a lecturer, have been charged in court over the past few months with insulting the president via social networking platform like WhatsApp.Insulting the president was made a criminal offense under a cyber crimes law passed in 2015 before Magufuli came into office. It is punishable by up to three years in jail, a fine of around $3,000 or both.Magufuli ordered the immediate release of a popular local musician in March, a day after he was arrested for allegedly mocking the government in a song.Tanzanian authorities banned a newspaper for two years in June over articles it published linking two former presidents to alleged improprieties in mining deals signed in the 1990s and early 2000s.  Activists and opposition leaders have accused the government of cracking down on press freedom. The government said free speech had limits. Magufuli remains popular with many voters for his anti-corruption drives and cutting wasteful government spending since coming to power in November 2015. On Monday, the government passed two bills allowing it to renegotiate gas and mining contracts with multinationals. Magufuli accuses many companies of tax evasion, charges the companies deny. editing by Katharine Houreld and Duncan Miriri","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-politics-idUSKBN19P1JJ"},

Over a 100 girls from the northeast and northern part of West Bengal state were trafficked in the last two years, nearly 50 to 60 percent of them on passports issued by Nepal,  said Hasina Kharbhih, founder of anti-trafficking charity Impulse NGO Network.  Obtaining visas for Middle East countries is difficult on Indian passports, so recruitment agents are getting them from Nepal. They are doing the paperwork for both passports and visas in Kathmandu,  Kharbhih told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Shillong, capital of northeastern state of Meghalaya. Traffickers have been trying new ways, including transporting women on tourist visas to Gulf nations to get round Indian emigration checks. They are also trying routes through neighboring countries including Nepal where collusion of officials with traffickers is suspected. Campaigners said traffickers are flying the girls from Kathmandu airport and in some cases crisscrossing through Indian airports with them before flying to a Gulf nation such as Kuwait or Oman. For destinations in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore and Malaysia, the girls are trafficked through Myanmar.  India's underdeveloped northeast, a region marred by ethnic violence and armed conflicts, is bordered by China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan and is a hub for sex traffickers to source girls for brothels in Mumbai and Delhi. But cases of trafficking for labor to other countries are being increasingly reported. Recruitment agents peddle dreams to college graduates of well-paid jobs in hotels and spas in Gulf nations or the frozen fish packaging industry of Malaysia. They target illiterate girls for jobs as domestic helps.  The agencies are focusing on these areas because they find  many girls are happy to go to Middle East countries as they find they can earn more there,  Kharbhih said. But when they arrive they often find themselves trapped in bonded labor, having to pay off debts to traffickers.  Their passports are taken by the employers. They are not paid, as promised,  she said. Alerts and Checks The police in Sikkim - considered prosperous among northeastern states - is currently investigating the case of a 25-year-old who flew to Kuwait to work as a housemaid in 2010 and went missing after that. Her family lodged a complaint with police last year.  She had flown on a passport issued by Nepal. This is our first such case,  an official with the Sikkim anti-human trafficking unit said. A similar case three years ago put campaigners on the Nepal passport trail when a woman trafficked to Lebanon committed suicide.   We found during the investigation that she was among a bunch of others who was taken there on Nepalese passports for housemaid jobs. That one case was our entry point into the issue,  Kharbhih said. Cases have been trickling in since then - a recent one of a girl taken through Chennai on her Indian passport to Malaysia to work in a beauty parlor. Her passport was seized by her employer and she couldn't renew her visa when it expired.  It was a complex case as she was legally detained for overstaying in Malaysia. It was very difficult to get her back,  Kharbhih said. Impulse NGO has police from India's northeastern states and campaigners logged on to its trafficking alert software. It is now training border forces on how to send alerts on the system in an effort to curb the numbers of trafficked girls and women.  These girls want a good job, and some mortgage assets and take loans with the hope of returning home with money. In some cases, they do send money back home, but these happy stories are short-lived,  Kharbhih said. Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Ros Russell.

India-based Tata said in May it had agreed the main terms of a deal with the British regulator to cut benefits for its 15 billion pound ($19.40 billion) UK pension scheme - formerly the main stumbling block in merger talks between the two firms. Though Tata would continue to back a new pension scheme under the terms of a deal that Thyssenkrupp has declined to publicly comment on, analysts and investors say the German firm sees the deal as significantly de-risking Tata's pension. Thyssenkrupp is waiting, however, for the final terms, likely to be approved this month, and is also concerned about factors such as political uncertainty in the UK due to Brexit, achieving fair value for its assets, and winning over German unions.  It seems like the pension deal is good enough (for Thyssenkrupp),  said one top-20 Thyssenkrupp investor. A top-10 investor and two other top-20 investors contacted by Reuters were also optimistic about the pension deal. Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel declined to comment. On a recent roadshow with investment bank Jefferies, Thyssenkrupp's chief financial officer  communicated confidence that a merger with Tata is nearing as progress is made to restructure Tata's UK pension , the bank said in a note. Jefferies estimates the merged entity could save 500 million euros through synergies. A source familiar with Thyssenkrupp's thinking said CFO Guido Kerkhoff was guiding the market that merger talks were well advanced. Kerkhoff recently told the head of Thyssenkrupp's steel works council the firm will make a decision on its European steel merger by end-September. Merger talks have been underway for nearly two years. Thyssenkrupp is encouraged that the new pension scheme Tata will back will start off in surplus, analysts say. This is thanks to a 550 million pound payment Tata will make into the scheme, and to benefit cuts such as linking future pension payout hikes to a lower measure of inflation - a move that will save more than 2 billion pounds. Thyssenkrupp is waiting, however, for details on other terms, including a 33 percent equity stake that the new pension will hold in Tata's UK business. This could translate into a stake in a merged entity, making the pension scheme an additional part-owner in a company one investor estimated would be worth 4 billion to 5.5 billion euros. Consolidation Tata and Thyssenkrupp are keen to combine their European operations in order to cut costs, tackle over-capacity and achieve industry consolidation. Thyssenkrupp's ultimate plan is to exit steel altogether by spinning off the joint venture.  A 50/50 (or less) type of joint venture remains the favoured structure from Thyssenkrupp's side. Thyssenkrupp could shift up to 3 billion euros worth of pensions into the joint venture to rebalance the ownership structure,  Deutsche Bank said in a note. Thyssenkrupp's European steel business is more valuable than Tata's, meaning it can offload 3 billion euros worth of pension debt in order to split the joint venture on a 50/50 basis or less, analysts and investors say. One investor close to Thyssenkrupp said a  a sub-50 percent holding  for the German firm is a  very real possibility . Thyssenkrupp's shares, trading at two-year highs, rose 5 percent on Monday on German press reports that a merger decision is near. However, over 18 percent of shares available for shorting are out on loan, according to data from FIS’ Astec Analytics, signalling that some investors believe the price will fall.

The arrest of the opposition leader has stoked political tensions in what is regarded as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies following a bruising election last year. The blaze started at dawn and destroyed property worth millions of kwacha and the entire southern part of Lusaka's City Market, one of the country's modern markets.

North Korea state television showed a large truck painted in military camouflage carrying the missile. It was identical to one a U.N. sanctions panel has said was  most likely  converted from a Chinese timber truck. Since 2006, U.N. sanctions have banned the shipment of military hardware to North Korea. But control of equipment and vehicles that have  dual-use  military and civilian applications has been far less stringent. The vehicle was imported from China and declared for civilian use by the North Korean foreign ministry, according to a 2013 report by the U.N. panel. Tuesday's launch was the first time the truck had been seen in a military field operation in pictures published in state media.  China, North Korea's largest trading partner and its sole major ally, is under increasing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said Chinese efforts to rein in North Korea's weapons programs have failed.   The truck had been previously on display at military parades in 2012 and in 2013 carrying what experts said appeared to be developmental models or mock-ups of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. Related CoverageJohnson: International community must redouble efforts on North KoreaRussia calls North Korea missile launch breach of U.N. resolutionRussia, China call for restraint on North Korean missile tensions: PutinImages on the North Korea's state television showed soldiers working on the vehicle mounted with a missile, which was then erected and off-loaded ahead of the launch at a hillside location. Leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test.      The transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) is a vehicle designed to move a ballistic missile and stand it upright, allowing for a mobile system that makes surveillance difficult for spy satellites.  In its 2013 report, the U.N. panel of experts said the features of the vehicle in the 2012 parade exactly matched those of a vehicle sold by China's Hubei Sanjiang Space Wanshan Special Vehicle Company. Deliberate Breach? The company is a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, a state-owned company that makes the Shenzhou rocket as well as missiles.  A company manager reached by telephone declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue.  China submitted to the U.N. panel a copy of the end user certificate provided by the North stating that six of the vehicles were being imported for the purpose of transporting timber.  The panel said it  considers it most likely that the (North) deliberately breached  the certificate and converted the trucks into transporter-erector-launchers. This year, North Korea used another Chinese-made truck model to tow submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) at a military parade on the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung. Last year, state media published photos showing Chinese-made trucks being used in a new North Korean mobile rocket artillery system. Both vehicles showed the logo or had markings specific to the Chinese company Sinotruk. A Sinotruk sales official said in April he was not aware the company's trucks were used in the military parade. North Korean state media has in the past released images of Sinotruk chassis and cabins related to construction or mining. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, after the launch, it was opposed to North Korea contravening rules laid out in U.N. Security council resolutions. China was working hard to resolve the issue and urged all sides to meet each other half way, it added.

Korea won drops, safe-haven yen strengthens * Oil ends run of gains on US supply drop as traders take profits * Risk aversion, dollar moderation boosts gold, bonds By Marc Jones LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - World shares and oil pulled back and bonds and gold were back in favour on Tuesday, as a long-range ballistic missile test by North Korea and July 4 holidays for U.S. markets restricted risk appetite. Asian shares were pushed lower and South Korea's won slid to a 16-week low after the North's missile landed in Japanese waters amid claims from Pyongyang that it could now strike  anywhere in the world . Europe dropped too as the first fall in oil prices in nine days pushed down commodity stocks and traders also cashed in some of gains made by the STOXX 600 on Monday which had been the biggest in over two months. Traditional safety plays fared well amid the caution. The Japanese yen and gold were both higher, as were European bonds and Treasuries, which have been clobbered by recent signs that the era of emergency stimulus and ultra low interest rates might be coming to an end. Sweden's central bank sounded reassuringly cautious on Tuesday even as it hinted at tighter policy going forward. That took the wind out of the Swedish crown that had been the best performing global currency over the last week. The Australian dollar also took a tumble as its central bank steered clear of rate hike talk at its latest meeting. Credit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri said the Swedish Riksbank's move showed how wary central banks remained about their currencies, while the day's other main focus was North Korea's posturing.  North Korea is continuing to provoke,  he said. Although markets were now used to these kind of events he added:  It is a bit more important as it came ahead of the G20 meeting this week.  Leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes when they meet in Germany. U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter:  North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?  in an apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The dollar lost 0.2 percent on the yen to leave it buying 113.19 yen. It made almost as much back against the high flying euro however, leaving the six currency dollar index steady at 96.259. It had seen its biggest jump since the start of March overnight, as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index also propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since mid May. Emerging Strains There were increasing signs that alongside the geopolitical jitters, higher global borrowing rates and the dollar were starting to pressure emerging markets after their stellar start to the year. MSCI's widely-tracked emerging equity index saw its sharpest one-day drop in nearly three weeks and most Asian currencies were weaker. The won is now down 3 percent over the last two weeks, the Indonesian rupiah has erased weeks of gains in the last two days and the Philippine peso is stuck near multi-year lows.  The bigger-picture driver for these movements you are seeing in emerging market currencies at least over the past two weeks, are signs of a more hawkish turn from central banks – including the ECB, Fed and the Bank of England,  UniCredit EM FX analyst Kiran Kowshik said. The next major data point is likely to be Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report. China's central bank meanwhile warned on Tuesday that its economy still faces  relatively big  downward pressure and that parts of its financial system lacked sufficient regulation. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei surrendered gains to end 0.1 percent down, South Korea's KOSPI closed 0.6 percent lower, though Hong Kong was hardest hit by the regional jitters as it slumped as much as 2 percent at one point. Tokyo, reacting to the North's missile test, strongly protested what it called Pyongyang's clear violation of UN resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles in efforts to stop Pyongyang's arms programme. Commodity markets also saw a shift. Gold was shining at $1,224 an ounce while oil posted its first session of losses in nine, ending their longest run of gains since February 2012, as traders closed positions ahead of the July 4 U.S. holiday. U.S. crude slipped 0.5 percent to $46.90 a barrel while global benchmark Brent dropped to $49.50 as traders cashed in some of gains from a 3.7 percent leap -- its biggest one-day gain since December 2016 -- on Monday.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said, although it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year-on-year in 2018 .

Etisalat Nigeria is the biggest foreign-owned victim of dollar shortages plaguing the country due to lower oil prices and economic recession, leaving the company struggling to make repayments to lenders and suppliers. The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) said Etisalat Nigeria and its creditors have reached a resolution on key issues on the indebtedness and that a transition process was continuing on mutually agreed terms. It said the resolution would ensure that Etisalat Nigeria was maintained as a going concern regardless of changes in the company's shareholders. As a result the company has appointed the central bank's deputy governor Joseph Nnanna as chairman, Boye Olusanya as chief executive and Funke Ighodaro as chief financial officer, Etisalat Nigeria's vice president for regulatory affairs, Ibrahim Dikko, told Reuters. The regulatory source said the central bank had provided assurances to lenders but had not invested any funds, adding that the company's minority owner, Abu Dhabi's Etisalat , has indicated it may pull out of Nigeria following the debt crisis but has not made a decision on the use of its brand in the country. On June 23 the central bank said Abu Dhabi state investment fund Mubadala, which had a 40 percent stake in Etisalat Nigeria, had already pulled out of the company and the debt negotiations. The 13 lenders involved in the $1.2 billion loan deal arranged for Etisalat four years ago, have been under pressure to avoid loan-loss provisions and were pushing to finalise a restructuring before half-yearly audits due in June. With central bank involvement, the lenders could get some foreberance on provisions pending when the debt crisis is resolved or the company is sold to new investors, the regulatory source said. On Monday Chief Executive Matthew Wilsher resigned after chairman Hakeem Belo-Osagie departed. Last month lenders initiated changes in Etisalat Nigeria's shareholding structure to enforce their rights under the loan default agreement. UAE's Etisalat has said it is carrying its 45 percent stake in the Nigerian arm at nil value. A source at the telecoms industry regulator said the new interim board made up of six members will operate for six months and will include a member representing the shareholders. Regulators have said they want to protect Etisalat Nigeria's 4,000 workers and are seeking to prevent lenders placing the telecoms firm in receivership in order to avoid a wider debt crisis. They held talks with Etisalat's lenders last week, the regulatory source said. Etisalat Nigeria has a 14 percent share of the country's mobile market, behind MTN with 47 percent, Globacom with 20 percent and Airtel, a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel, with 19 percent.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late stage liver cancer.  High Commissioner (Zeid) sent a letter to the government of China requesting a meeting to discuss the situation of Liu Xiaobo and of his wife Lu Xia and her access to him,  U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a Geneva news briefing.  That meeting took place on Friday, the 30th of June, and we're hoping to continue this dialogue over the coming days and weeks,  she said. Throssell declined to comment on whether the United Nations was seeking for Liu to be treated abroad. A growing number of Western politicians and international rights activists have expressed concern about the quality of Liu's treatment and have said he should be given the choice to leave China if that was the best option. The concern over Liu's fate, and that of his wife Liu Xia, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize in 2010, comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to arrive in Germany on Tuesday for a G20 summit. China is hoping to use the G20 to show global leadership on issues ranging from free trade to climate change, but pressure to allow Liu to leave for treatment could overshadow Xi's appearance. A family member of Liu's said on Saturday his  time is limited  due to a fluid build up around his stomach caused by liver scarring. Chinese authorities on Friday told diplomats from Germany, the United States and the European Union that Liu could not be moved abroad due to his condition. However, a source close to the family told Reuters on Monday that Liu was still well enough to travel.

With Wimbledon in full swing, former world number two Petr is at the All England Club to support his son Sebastian in the Wimbledon boys’ competition, while the Korda sisters keep each other company and keep up the family passion for sports on the golf circuit. Jessica, a four-times LPGA winner, is long established, while this is the rookie season for Nelly, who at 18 is nearly six years younger than Jessica. They are a close-knit family, as was evident after the first round at the Women’s PGA Championship last Thursday, where Nelly stopped on the way from the 18th green to the scoring area to call out to Jessica, who was extracting her clubs from her car on arriving for a later tee time. “She’s my best friend and having her out here means a lot,” Nelly told Reuters. “She just guides me and having her out here makes me feel really comfortable so it definitely helps.” Asked for an example of how Jessica helps, Nelly said: “Little things here and there that are really tiny.” Jessica, speaking to Reuters the next day, was more specific: “She’s always forgetting things,” Jessica said, a rueful smile on her face. “Where do you want me to start? Phone. She’s always forgetting her phone.” Jessica then told of a time her teenaged sister left some fruit in her car. “We get inside and (she says) ‘OK, I forgot my fruit,'  related Jessica.  It was two seconds ago. I told you, your freakin' fruit was right there.” Nelly and Jessica both played tennis among many sports when they were children, but their father’s post-career passion for golf rubbed off. “We love sports, very sport-oriented. (We) figure skated, gymnastics, occasionally tennis, skied. We did all sorts of things,” said Nelly.

Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports“When my dad retired he started golfing and my sister started and I just followed in their footsteps. Dad’s really good. He shoots around even-par. He was a scratch (golfer). He still beat me two or three years ago.” Nelly decided to focus on golf after qualifying for the 2013 U.S. Women’s Open as a 14-year-old amateur. She is having a solid first season, 45th on the LPGA money list, while Jessica is 27th. Both of them performed well at the Women's PGA with Jessica equal 14th, a stroke ahead of Nelly, who tied for 20th. Jessica, Nelly and Sebastian all hold dual U.S. and Czech citizenship, due to their parents’ heritage. “I’m more Czech than my sister and my brother in a lot of the things I do and say and think, considering I lived there until 2008,” said Jessica. “Nelly and Sebastian are very American. I’m a good split, in-between personality wise.” But Jessica makes clear her allegiance to the U.S. -- and not just for team golf. “America is my chosen country for everything,” she said. “I’m very patriotic. Nobody can ever take that away from me.” Both are fully aware of their father’s tennis achievements, even if the 1998 Australian Open champion is not one to boast. “We don’t really talk about it much but I know everything,” said Nelly, who has watched clips of her father on YouTube and notes how skinny he was back then. “We used to have a trophy room so all his trophies were there,” said Nelly. “It was cool growing up seeing that. We’re very proud.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Larry Fine","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-korda-idUSKBN19P1HV"},

Volkswagen (VW) has signed an agreement with Iran's Mammut Khodro which will import VW brand models Tiguan and Passat via eight dealerships, focusing on the greater Tehran area, VW said on Tuesday. Europe's largest automotive group is seeking to tap new overseas markets as it grapples with billions of euros in costs stemming from an emissions scandal while pushing a strategic shift to electric cars and new mobility services. Group deliveries to China, VW's biggest market accounting for over a third of its sales, fell 3.3 percent between January and May to 1.51 million cars. Sales in Brazil were down 1.9 percent to 116,600 cars. VW is trying to catch up with French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault which have been pushing hard into Iran since the country's 2015 deal with world powers that saw international sanctions lifted in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear activities.  We are strengthening once more our international presence.  Anders Sundt Jensen, VW's project leader for Iran said in an emailed statement. Wolfsburg-based VW, which sold its iconic Beetle in Iran in the 1950s and its Gol subcompact model in the 1990s, left the market in 2000.

While Iraqi commanders predicted final victory in Mosul this week, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced they had begun an assault on Islamic State's Syrian redoubt in the Old City of Raqqa. The Iraqi military has pushed insurgents into a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters beside the Tigris river in Mosul; but the resistance has been fierce. The Rapid Response Division, an elite Interior Ministry unit, called in air strikes just 50 meters away from their targets, and the fighting got close enough at one point for the militants to toss a hand grenade at the troops. It was from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque that, three years ago, leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and Syria. Forces retook the mosque on Thursday, prompting Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to declare an end to the group's  state of falsehood . The number of Islamic State militants fighting in Mosul, by far the biggest city it has ever controlled, has dwindled from thousands at the start of the U.S.-backed offensive more than eight months ago to a couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military. A commander from the Rapid Response Division estimated more than 10,000 civilians remained trapped inside the area under militant control, including people brought from other areas as human shields. They are trapped with little food, water or medicine amid the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways, according to residents who have managed to escape.  The presence of civilians has affected the troops' advance a lot. The directions from the commander-in-chief of the armed forces are to advance slowly to preserve civilians' lives and this is what we are doing,  the officer said on state TV without being named.  The area is small but the advance today is very good, relatively.  He said the progress had also been slowed by a high number of improvised explosives planted in streets and buildings.

Territory Sinking Fast With Mosul gone, the group's territory in Iraq will be limited to a few areas west and south of the city where some tens of thousands of civilians live. Slideshow (3 Images)In neighboring Syria, a U.S-backed coalition force said it had fired on two small sections of the historic Rafiqah Wall in the Old City of Raqqa, allowing them to overcome Islamic State defenses.  The portions targeted were 25-metre sections and will help preserve the remainder of the overall 2,500-meter wall,  the coalition said in a statement.  Iraqi authorities are planning a week of nationwide celebrations, to mark the end of the offensive, and Abadi is expected to visit Mosul to formally declare victory. With its territory shrinking fast, Islamic State has been stepping up suicide attacks in the parts of Mosul taken by Iraqi forces and elsewhere, including a camp for displaced people west of Baghdad on Sunday. Thousands of people have already fled the Old City this week, joining about 900,000 others, about half the city's pre-war population, who have been displaced over months of grinding warfare. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding near the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The group has moved its remaining command and control structures to Mayadin, in eastern Syria, U.S. intelligence sources have said, without indicating if Baghdadi was also hiding in the same area. Baghdadi has often been reported killed or wounded. Russia said on June 17 its forces might have killed him in an air strike in Syria. But Washington says it has no information to corroborate such reports and Iraqi officials are also skeptical.

At the same time, the Deutsche Boerse-owned exchange is expanding its product range to include the first futures on a European corporate bond index. Sweeping reform of Europe's securities and derivatives markets, which takes effect on January 3, 2018, will force more instruments into an exchange-like environment and introduce new reporting and execution requirements for trades that are bilaterally arranged on a request-for-quote basis. Large and complex orders in listed futures and options markets are still agreed bilaterally over the phone and manually entered into Eurex's T7 Entry Service. According to Thomas Book, CEO of Eurex, demand has been growing for a fully automated RFQ service that improves efficiency by moving voice-brokered business closer to the electronic world for documentation purposes. “Not everyone will trade in an open order book but people want to direct quotes to a certain number of brokers to increase the efficiency of price discovery for large blocks or strategies,” said Book.  An electronic execution platform makes it more efficient to get wider quotes and takes out the documentation and audit requirement, so it’s a cost saving for brokers and market-makers.” The new service allows banks and brokers to selectively contact market-makers to request quotes to find a trading counterparty. Orders are then automatically transmitted to the exchange’s T7 entry service for exchange trade confirmation and post-trade processing, including clearing and settlement. “This is an important extension of our Order Entry services. We address the need of our clients to move more voice-brokered activity into electronic execution,” said Book. “By extending the capability to off-exchange arrangements, it means that two counterparties no longer need to pick up the phone, but can request a quote directly through the platform.” The platform provides a similar service to organised trading facilities – a new breed of execution platform stemming from MiFID II for over-the-counter swaps execution - though matching ultimately happens in the regulated exchange environment. The exchange is finalising the RFQ service and plans to start simulation tests in September, with full launch expected before the year-end. Corporate Bond First Eurex is also responding to wider investment trends with the launch of new hedging tools that include the first futures on corporate bond indices. The contracts, which are scheduled to launch in September, reference the EuroStoxx 50 Corporate Bond index. The index tracks the performance of euro-denominated investment-grade bonds issued by constituents of the eurozone blue-chip equity benchmark. The new contracts are the first to provide exchange-traded exposure to European corporate bonds and offer an alternative to over-the-counter credit default swaps on iTraxx Europe Main. “A general trend towards passive products such as ETFs creates new hedging needs for asset managers,” said Book. ”Corporate bond futures address that need as it is a very transparent product that also has a very transparent index rule book on the back of it.” The exchange is in advanced discussions with market-makers interested in providing liquidity for the products. Fixed income investors have increasingly turned to exchange-traded funds to gain more liquid exposure to corporate bonds and at lower cost. Fixed income ETFs have attracted more than US$70bn so far this year, taking total assets in the products to US$685bn, according to data from BlackRock iShares. At the same time, liquidity in corporate bond markets has plummeted since dealers reduced inventory in response to stringent Basel III capital requirements. Liquidity in CDS markets has also declined since the global financial crisis as many firms retracted, particularly on the buyside. Notional outstanding in CDS index products stands at US$4trn, down from a peak of US$25.8trn in 2007. Trf Extension The corporate bond futures launch forms part of a wider bid by Eurex to become the biggest derivatives exchange for broad based indices. Earlier this year, it became the only exchange to offer futures and options on all major MSCI equity benchmarks after adding futures and options on the provider's EAFE index, which represents developed markets across Europe, Australasia and the Far East. The exchange has also extended the maturity profile of Total Return Futures on the EuroStoxx 50, adding December expiries for years five to 10. More than 137,000 TRF contracts with a notional value of €4.8bn have traded since launch earlier this year and open interest currently stands at €3.9bn.

The bid approaches show how automated payments specialists have become attractive targets for credit card companies, banks and technology firms seeking to capitalize on the growth in popularity of paying by smartphone or other mobile devices. Danish payment services company Nets A/S (NETS.CO), said over the weekend that it had also been approached by potential buyers. Worldpay, which sells technology to businesses so they can take payments via cards, online or on mobile devices, said the approaches were preliminary and there was no certainty of any deal. Sources close to the company said the offers were unsolicited.  Worldpay's shares hit record high. At 1146 GMT the shares were up 25.4 percent. The company has a market capitalization of about 6.43 billion pounds ($8.3 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts suggested other companies might now be interested in making a bid.   We believe Worldpay is a unique asset and the current interest from two U.S. peers could also trigger the intention of parties like Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O),  a note from Mediobanca Securities said. Vantiv and JP Morgan now have until August 1 to announce firm intentions to buy or else walk away. Vantiv could not immediately be reached for comment. JP Morgan declined to comment. Emphasis on Scale The payment processing industry has grown rapidly as consumers shun cash. The number of non-cash transactions rose 8.9 percent in 2014 to reach 387.2 billion, according to Capgemini’s World Payments Report.  While banks have been trying to develop and buy more sophisticated technology, payment service companies like PayPal (PYPL.O) and Worldpay gained a large part of the market share during the e-commerce boom.  Set up in 1989, Worldpay was spun out of British bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) to private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International in 2010. The buyout firms listed the company on the London Stock Exchange in late 2015, when it was valued at 4.8 billion pounds.  Deal activity in the payments industry has so far been dominated by smaller companies being merged into divisions of  bigger groups. Earlier this year, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities said the emphasis may instead shift toward scale, noting Worldpay and Vantiv as a compelling deal.  Vantiv, which has a market capitalization of $12.32 billion has recently gone on a buying spree of smaller players. It bought Moneris Solutions USA for $425 million and Paymetric, which automates business payments processing. While Vantiv is U.S.-focused, Worldpay supports 400,000 merchants in 126 currencies across 146 countries. It also has a highly-developed e-commerce platform which serves large and fast growing internet-led multinationals. Worldpay's enterprise value to earnings on a next twelve month basis is at 13.88 times, according to Thomson Reuters data, above a ratio of 9.89 times for its rivals.

Over the last month, Chinese regulators have closed celebrity gossip websites, restricted what video people can post and suspended online streaming, all on grounds of inappropriate content.      On Friday, an industry association circulated new regulations that at least two  auditors  will, with immediate effect, be required to check all audiovisual content posted online - from films to  micro  movies, documentaries, sports, educational material and animation - to ensure they adhere to  core socialist values . Topics deemed inappropriate include drug addiction and homosexuality, said the government-affiliated China Netcasting Services Association, which represents more than 600 members. People flocked online at the weekend to criticize the move, with most saying it was a step backwards that would hamper creativity. Some noted it could be near impossible to enforce.  According to these censorship rules, nothing will make it through, which will do away with audiovisual artistic creation,  Li Yinhe, an academic who studies sexuality at the government-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in an online post. Under the government rules, such works as Georges Bizet's opera  Carmen  and Shakespeare's  Othello  would technically have to be banned for depicting prostitution and overt displays of affection, she said.         The rules, which affect social media giants like Weibo Corp (WB.O) as well as small platforms that have thrived in China's buzzing creative online space, are the latest step toughening oversight ahead of the Communist Party Congress later this year, when President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate power.     China's online video market, including revenue from advertising and content purchases, had been expected to more than quadruple to around 96.2 billion yuan ($17.6 billion) by 2020 from 2015, according to 2016 data from IHS Markit.  We used to describe the constant drip of regulation as boiling a frog in warm water. Now it is outright scalding with boiling water,  Wang Xiaoxiao, a talent agent who represents several actors who have gained fame online, told Reuters.     Zhao Jing, the founder of Yummy, a site that specializes in education on gender topics, said she would be using euphemisms for genitalia and avoid banned topics such as one-night stands and extramarital affairs to get around keywords that will trigger the censors. She fears her site could be thrown off Tencent's WeChat instant messaging application otherwise. Entertainment in Focus While censorship of creative content in China is nothing new, the internet has generally been a more permissive arena because of the gray areas around regulation.     The atmosphere has become more tense since Xi called for stricter regulation last year.      FILE PHOTO - People use computers at an internet cafe in Hefei, Anhui province, September 15, 2011.StringerIn June, China's cyberspace authorities ordered internet firms like Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and Tencent Holding Ltd (0700.HK) to close 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts, including  China's Number One Paparazzi  Zhuo Wei, an account that had more than 7 million followers. The government said it aimed to  create a healthy and uplifting mainstream media environment, and actively spread socialist core values.          This focus on online entertainment content - an extension of the government's well-established control over politics and news - is aimed at a largely younger audience, said Qiao Mu, a Beijing-based media scholar known for criticizing censorship.      This is a return to ideology,  Qiao said in a phone interview.  To the Party, entertainment will make people lose their revolutionary spirit.   One of the main focuses of online scorn was the inclusion of homosexuality on the list of banned topics, underlining a long-standing conservative attitude in China towards same-sex relations despite often thriving gay scenes in major cities.     Two filmmakers interviewed by Reuters said the latest ruling closed one of the remaining channels for uninhibited creative works. Films shown in cinemas or on television already go through thorough censorship processes before being given the go-ahead.      Many filmmakers know they could never get their film approved for cinemas, and so put them online,  said Fan Popo, a gay activist and film director. The only hope for such filmmakers left was that censors would struggle to implement the new rules, he said. The crackdown is also being felt in the country's top internet firms. Shares in Weibo Corp, the operator of China's top microblogging site, are down around 10 percent since restrictions were imposed on its audiovisual content in mid-June.  The company said last week it would work closely with state media to promote  mainstream  ideas. For some platforms, investors have pulled funding and advertisers have jumped ship because of the uncertainties, industry insiders told Reuters. Dushe Dianying, or  poison tongue movie , a popular movie-review site known for its acerbic critiques, had its account on WeChat shut down last month by regulators citing  socialist values .     The site, backed by German media group Bertelsmann, was valued at 300 million yuan ($44.17 million) last year.     A person familiar with the site's operations said some of its business tie-ups and advertising deals had been hit. Others in the industry also said investment had suffered.      It is now just too risky,  said the person, who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The bid approaches show how automated payments specialists have become attractive targets for credit card companies, banks and technology firms seeking to capitalize on the growth in popularity of paying by smartphone or other mobile devices. Danish payment services company Nets A/S (NETS.CO), said over the weekend that it had also been approached by potential buyers. Worldpay, which sells technology to businesses so they can take payments via cards, online or on mobile devices, said the approaches were preliminary and there was no certainty of any deal. Sources close to the company said the offers were unsolicited.  Worldpay's shares hit record high. At 1146 GMT the shares were up 25.4 percent. The company has a market capitalization of about 6.43 billion pounds ($8.3 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts suggested other companies might now be interested in making a bid.   We believe Worldpay is a unique asset and the current interest from two U.S. peers could also trigger the intention of parties like Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O),  a note from Mediobanca Securities said. Vantiv and JP Morgan now have until August 1 to announce firm intentions to buy or else walk away. Vantiv could not immediately be reached for comment. JP Morgan declined to comment. Emphasis on Scale The payment processing industry has grown rapidly as consumers shun cash. The number of non-cash transactions rose 8.9 percent in 2014 to reach 387.2 billion, according to Capgemini’s World Payments Report.  While banks have been trying to develop and buy more sophisticated technology, payment service companies like PayPal (PYPL.O) and Worldpay gained a large part of the market share during the e-commerce boom.  Set up in 1989, Worldpay was spun out of British bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) to private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International in 2010. The buyout firms listed the company on the London Stock Exchange in late 2015, when it was valued at 4.8 billion pounds.  Deal activity in the payments industry has so far been dominated by smaller companies being merged into divisions of  bigger groups. Earlier this year, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities said the emphasis may instead shift toward scale, noting Worldpay and Vantiv as a compelling deal.  Vantiv, which has a market capitalization of $12.32 billion has recently gone on a buying spree of smaller players. It bought Moneris Solutions USA for $425 million and Paymetric, which automates business payments processing. While Vantiv is U.S.-focused, Worldpay supports 400,000 merchants in 126 currencies across 146 countries. It also has a highly-developed e-commerce platform which serves large and fast growing internet-led multinationals. Worldpay's enterprise value to earnings on a next twelve month basis is at 13.88 times, according to Thomson Reuters data, above a ratio of 9.89 times for its rivals.

Go-Jek, which already counts global private equity firms KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] and venture capital player Sequoia Capital as investors, is seeking to raise more capital from existing and new investors, the sources said. The startup aims to raise up to $1 billion from its current funding round, the sources, who are familiar with the matter but did not want to be named, told Reuters.  A Go-Jek spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's fund-raising plans, saying:  If there is information that we can share then we will share it.  Tencent declined to comment on the investment. An investment by China's largest social media and online entertainment firm would indicate it wants to establish its presence in Southeast Asia that many expect will produce the next batch of high-valued tech startups known as unicorns.  Tencent, with a current market capitalization of $341 billion, has previously bought a stake in Singapore-based gaming startup Sea Ltd, formerly known as Garena, which was valued at $3.75 billion after a March 2016 funding round. Other Chinese tech behemoths have also been carving out their territory in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and some of the world's fastest-growing economies. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) last week said it would invest an additional $1 billion in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada Group, boosting its stake by nearly a third to 83 percent and amplifying its focus on the region. Alibaba's domestic rival JD.com Inc (JD.O) is in talks with Indonesia's online marketplace Tokopedia for possible investment, a separate source told Reuters.  Go-Jek, which started as a hailing app for motorbike taxis, also operates a food delivery business that a source said yields a much higher margin than ride-hailing. Its mobile payment business, Go-Pay, is growing rapidly as it is complementary with all the other Go-Jek offerings, the source added. Tencent and Alibaba have each invested in food delivery apps in China and have been fighting to gain market share in the mobile payment space with their respective platforms. One of the sources said that Go-Jek aims to close the current funding round in the third quarter. According to a media report, the start-up was valued at more than $2 billion when the funding round started. Last August, KKR, Warburg and others invested $550 million in Go-Jek at an undisclosed valuation. Warburg is looking to chip in more in this round, sources said.  A spokeswoman for Warburg declined to comment.

Germany is concerned that the U.S. administration's push to fix the causes of U.S. trade deficits and to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules could hurt its exporters.  We live in a world where a trade war cannot be ruled out,  said Volker Treier, who heads DIHK's foreign trade unit.  Divisions on trade are expected to cloud the G20 summit that Chancellor Angela Merkel will host in Hamburg this week, attended by Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, whose cheap steel exports the U.S. administration wants to target. U.S. officials have lamented their country's trade deficit with the United States which has nearly doubled in the past 10 years from some 28.8 billion euros in 2006 to 49 billion euros in 2016. Trump has warned he will impose a border tax of 35 percent on cars that German carmaker BMW plans to build at a new plant in Mexico for export to the U.S. market. Merkel has said she would seek a compromise with Trump on trade but major differences remain, notably over Trump's decision to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris global agreement to fight climate change. DIHK said on Tuesday a record high of 50 percent of the 4,000 firms operating abroad named political risks as a top threat to their business over the next 12 months in a new survey. Britain's divorce negotiations with the European Union, U.S. trade policies and protectionism were seen as major risks. Still, some 56 percent said they expected better business over the next 12 months and more than a third said they expect the economies in their host countries to improve. DIHK's Treier said German companies are expected to create 200,000 jobs abroad this year, including 40,000 in the United States.

Compared with traditional bank lending, the opaque nature of shadow banking products make it easier for them to bypass regulatory requirements and provide credit to restricted areas, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in its annual China Financial Stability Report released online. The central bank will increase supervision over the rapidly growing asset management industry to curb shadow banking risks, it said.  Since the first quarter, the PBOC has included banks' off-the-balance-sheet wealth management products in its examination of broad credit in its Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) risk-tool. The world's second-largest economy faces major challenges, including excess industrial capacity, sluggish growth, high corporate leverage, mounting local government debt, property bubbles in some regions, and the deterioration of banking assets, the PBOC said in its report. As the economy still faces relatively big downward pressures, the bank pledged to create a favourable monetary and financial environment for the development of the real economy this year.

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said at a news conference that data stolen in 2015 in a hack of the lower house of parliament could surface in the coming weeks. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, said that while it was not known what Russia would do he suspected that Russian President Vladimir Putin would prefer a different German chancellor than Angela Merkel. It was likely that Russia had sought to influence the U.S. election and everything points to Moscow's involvement in efforts to influence the election in France, de Maiziere said.  As a result, it cannot be excluded - and we are preparing internally - that there will be a similar effort to influence the election in Germany,  he said. Russia has denied trying to influence foreign elections. Merkel, who backs continued sanctions against Russia for its actions toward Ukraine, is seeking a fourth term.  Sources have told Reuters that one of the dozen or so accounts hit in the 2015 Bundestag hack was Merkel's parliamentary account, although her primary work account was not touched. Tuesday's comments come days before Putin arrives in Germany for a meeting of G20 leaders, and follow a spate of cyber attacks directed at the German parliament, individual lawmakers, political parties and think tanks affiliated with parties since summer 2015 - all of which German intelligence agencies blame on APT 28, a Russian hacker group with links to Moscow. Russia denies it has been in any way involved in the cyber attacks. Maassen said any campaign to influence the election could be  more about unsettling German voters than promoting any particular candidate.  It may not be aimed at strengthening one party or another, or ensuring that one or another person is elected to run the government, but that the trust in the functioning of our democracy is damaged,  he said. Maassen also said the German electoral system - which is based on written rather than electronic votes - was less vulnerable to electronic manipulation than other systems. Maassen said his agency had no reliable evidence that a cyber attack that started in Ukraine last week and spread around the world was carried out by Russia. Ukraine has blamed Russian security services for the attack, which it said was aimed at destroying important data and spreading panic.

Go-Jek, which already counts global private equity firms KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] and venture capital player Sequoia Capital as investors, is seeking to raise more capital from existing and new investors, the sources said. The startup aims to raise up to $1 billion from its current funding round, the sources, who are familiar with the matter but did not want to be named, told Reuters.  A Go-Jek spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's fund-raising plans, saying:  If there is information that we can share then we will share it.  Tencent declined to comment on the investment. An investment by China's largest social media and online entertainment firm would indicate it wants to establish its presence in Southeast Asia that many expect will produce the next batch of high-valued tech startups known as unicorns.  Tencent, with a current market capitalization of $341 billion, has previously bought a stake in Singapore-based gaming startup Sea Ltd, formerly known as Garena, which was valued at $3.75 billion after a March 2016 funding round. Other Chinese tech behemoths have also been carving out their territory in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and some of the world's fastest-growing economies. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) last week said it would invest an additional $1 billion in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada Group, boosting its stake by nearly a third to 83 percent and amplifying its focus on the region. Alibaba's domestic rival JD.com Inc (JD.O) is in talks with Indonesia's online marketplace Tokopedia for possible investment, a separate source told Reuters.  Go-Jek, which started as a hailing app for motorbike taxis, also operates a food delivery business that a source said yields a much higher margin than ride-hailing. Its mobile payment business, Go-Pay, is growing rapidly as it is complementary with all the other Go-Jek offerings, the source added. Tencent and Alibaba have each invested in food delivery apps in China and have been fighting to gain market share in the mobile payment space with their respective platforms. One of the sources said that Go-Jek aims to close the current funding round in the third quarter. According to a media report, the start-up was valued at more than $2 billion when the funding round started. Last August, KKR, Warburg and others invested $550 million in Go-Jek at an undisclosed valuation. Warburg is looking to chip in more in this round, sources said.  A spokeswoman for Warburg declined to comment.

Since the first quarter, the PBOC has included banks' off-the-balance-sheet wealth management products in its examination of broad credit in its Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA) risk-tool. The world's second-largest economy faces major challenges, including excess industrial capacity, sluggish growth, high corporate leverage, mounting local government debt, property bubbles in some regions, and the deterioration of banking assets, the PBOC said in its report. As the economy still faces relatively big downward pressures, the bank pledged to create a favourable monetary and financial environment for the development of the real economy this year.

Fintech firms in Brazil have been growing fast in sectors such as consumer lending and credit cards, seeking to undercut some of the highest interest rates in the world offered by traditional banks.  Now fintechs such as Banco Inter are diversifying to offer accounts for small companies run by their existing retail clients.  Banco Inter and other fintechs are expanding into  bridging loans  for small businesses borrowing against their receivables from supply contracts with major companies, offering lower rates than traditional banks.  Borrowers in Latin America's biggest country pay an average 250 percent a year for the riskiest type of unsecured rollover credit, the highest among the world's 20 major economies.   There's a lot of room to grow because banks still charge very high rates and availability of credit for small- and mid-sized enterprises remains restricted,  said Jorge Vargas Neto, founding partner of Biva, a fintech that has originated 30 million reais ($9.1 million) in loans since 2015. Lacking the necessary capital and scale to grow in a segment where assessing credit risk can be tricky, fintechs like Biva are using  peer to peer  models - connecting individuals and small enterprises to borrow and lend money without a financial institution.  Biva offers rates of between 1.7 percent and 6.3 percent a month to borrowers, and average returns of 22 percent a year to investors, Vargas said. No Regulation  Employees of Brazilian financial technology firm Geru work in the company's headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 3, 2017.Leonardo BenassattoBrazil has yet to regulate peer-to-peer lenders, although activity has grown considerably in the past two years. The central bank said in May that it was looking to implement regulations this year to oversee fintech firms.  The slow progress in designing a framework underscores fintechs' concern not to circumvent or breach existing banking laws. Fintechs are trying different systems through which their investors can fund lending to smaller firms, including systems similar to a Dutch auction - in which borrowers get incentives to present as many guarantees as possible to get the lowest interest rate.     Employees of Brazilian financial technology firm Geru work in the company's headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 3, 2017.Leonardo Benassatto This is a means to try to overcome the inefficiency of the credit system in Brazil, which is most accentuated for small- and medium-sized companies,  said Dan Cohen, founder and partner at F(x), which uses algorithms to match the profiles of lenders and borrowers. The move comes as traditional banks have cut credit access for smaller companies amid record defaults and bankruptcies during Brazil's deepest recession on record.  State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA) curbed lending in the segment by almost 30 percent in the 12 months through March, while disbursements at Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) for the segment were down almost 10 percent in the same period. Itaú is Brazil's No. 1 bank by assets. According to a study released in May by the InterAmerican Development Bank and tech accelerator Finnovista, Brazil is home to 230 of the 703 fintechs in Latin America, ranging from digital banks to financial education companies. Many Brazilian financial startups involved in lending say that demand is coming from small businessmen. Brazilian fintech Geru lends on average up to 50,000 reais per client to individuals to invest in their own small businesses.  We have seen that a large number of our loans go to self-employed people to invest in their own companies,  said Geru's founder, Sandro Reiss.

Shares of Tencent, one of Asia's most valuable firms with a market value of HK$2.6 trillion ($333 billion), ended 4.1 percent down on Tuesday, its biggest one-day fall in 17 months, after it announced restrictions for some users of the world's top-grossing mobile game, responding to complaints that children were getting addicted. Regulatory control on such  social games  is imminently needed, the People's Daily said on its website on Tuesday, after calling the game  poison  on Monday, alluding to a similarly pronounced nickname in Chinese that players jokingly use to describe the addictive nature of the game.  Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Honour of Kings, a multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users - more than Pokemon Go at its peak. It is the world's top-grossing mobile game according to analysts, with estimates of its monthly revenue ranging from 1 billion to 2 billion yuan.   The state media attack comes amid a crackdown on content and entertainment from China's internet censors.  The state media commentary calling for tighter industry regulation is a cooling signal for gaming stocks that could cause short-term declines, but whether there would be revenue impact depends on what regulatory measures would follow,  said Connie Gu, analyst at BOCOM International Securities.  Gu estimates the game, with 200 million users, contributes around 7 percent to Tencent's total revenue. While Tencent's official website for the game says it is  for 16 and above , it does not ban younger users and the game is popular among teenagers. Tencent said it introduced the play time and spending curbs for minors and those under 12 effective from Tuesday out of social responsibility.  China Merchants Securities International analyst Richard Ko estimates the game accounts for around a third of Tencent's mobile gaming revenue - which grew to 12.9 billion yuan in the first quarter. Ko estimates that assuming 25 percent of its players are under 18, Tencent's play curb could cost around 5 percent of the game's 2017 revenue, or 0.5 percent of Tencent's total revenue which he estimates to be 224 billion yuan.

The company said on Tuesday it expected sales of radar systems to leap by 60 percent and of video sensors by 80 percent this year. It forecast sales at its Mobility Solutions division, which makes sophisticated safety systems as well as autonomous car components, would grow around 7 percent this year, benefiting from a broader push to make vehicles more intelligent. Last year, Mobility Solutions - which employs 227,000 staff - generated 43.9 billion euros ($49.8 billion) in sales, boosted by deliveries of crash avoidance technologies.  We are growing faster than the market,  management board member Rolf Bulander said.  Bosch delivers advanced safety systems to all of the world's largest automotive companies as well as start-up carmakers. It developed the electric powertrain and steering for Google's prototype autonomous vehicle and is a supplier of driver assistance systems to Tesla. Bosch has around 3,000 developers working on highly automated driving systems, a market which is booming as simple anti-collision technologies like automated braking systems evolve into sophisticated crash avoidance programs using camera and radar to detect obstacles and avoid collisions. Last year, sales of driver assistance systems, which include radar and video sensors used for emergency braking and cruise control functions, reached 1 billion euros, with the company receiving orders for a further 3.5 billion worth of assistance systems, Bosch said. Beyond this, the company is expanding into areas such as software, services, internet-connected devices and electric cars. In doing so, it is moving into new businesses like short-term motorbike rental, giving it direct access to new consumers and also potentially putting it in competition with its traditional clients: car and motorbike manufacturers that have also launched short-term ride hailing and rental services.  While there are market segments where we are clearly a supplier, there are markets which are not yet developed where new players are emerging, this includes us,  Bulander said. Bosch declined to detail which emerging mobility markets, like for example ride-hailing, it is targeting next, but said by the end of 2017, its mobility solutions business would have 48,000 research and development staff, increasing its headcount by roughly 4,000.  Bosch forecast significant growth in the market for electric scooters and microcars, driven mainly be demand from China and countries like Taiwan. Already this market has seen sales rise from 58,000 in 1998, to more than 30 million per year in Asia. Separately Bosch appealed to regulators in Europe not to ban diesel vehicles on fears that a European Union target to cut carbon dioxide gas emissions, which are blamed for causing global warming, could be jeopardized.   If all the diesel cars were replaced by equivalent cars with petrol engines, average fleet emissions would rise by 16 grams,  Bulander told Reuters.  Diesel cars are around 15 percent more efficient than petrol engined cars, but regulators have sought to ban some older versions because of their emissions of nitrogen oxides which are blamed for causing respiratory disease.

The honeymoon between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump ended abruptly, and the latter feels sore. China hasn't delivered change in North Korea, and trade is still imbalanced. Now the U.S. administration is lashing out. The likelihood of miscalculation is rising, as is the risk of economic fallout. Graphic: China's trade surplus with the United States has risen since February: reut.rs/2sGKCuT     The fundamental problem lies in the false cognate Trump presents to Chinese officials. He looks so familiar: an autocratic real-estate developer who unabashedly mixes business and political interests, and surrounds himself with trusted family members.      Seeing a man who disdained the advice of experts from his own bureaucracy, China invested heavily in relationships with Trump's family, in particular his son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump, who have been invited to visit China later this year. The president reciprocated by saying nice things about Xi, and by abandoning his brief flirtation with Taiwan.     But that analysis underestimates three things: Trump’s unpredictability, pushback from the Washington bureaucracy, and electoral support for China-bashing. Trump's support base rallied behind his tough talk about 35 percent sanctions on Chinese imports.      Meanwhile, Trump's team also misread China's openness to compromise. Beijing has tossed out a few token concessions on market opening, including allowing American beef imports, and opened a few more doors for Wall Street. But it has pushed ahead with a cyber security law that appears designed in part to squeeze out foreign software companies. After briefly falling to a multi-year low in February, China's trade surplus with the United States has been rising, to hit $22 billion in May.       China implemented further sanctions on North Korea but to no effect: Pyongyang tested another ballistic missile on Tuesday, on the day America celebrates its independence.      Trump appears to be losing patience. He is selling $1.4 billion of weapons to Taiwan. He is sanctioning Chinese individuals and banks doing business with Pyongyang, and talking steel sanctions. The U.S. navy is confronting Chinese ships and aircraft in the South China Sea.      The first risk is that the U.S. president swings from one extreme to the opposite. The second is that China over-reacts, and the status quo that has placated investors so far takes a turn for the worse.

Industrial espionage costs German industry billions of euros each year, with small- and medium-sized businesses often the biggest losers, the BfV domestic intelligence agency said in its 339-page annual report. The report mapped out a range of security threats, including Islamist militancy and increased far-right violence, but highlighted the growing incidence of cyber espionage. It cited a  noticeable increase  in spying by Turkey's MIT foreign intelligence agency in Germany in 2016, following the failed July 15 coup in Turkey, and said Russia was seeking to influence a parliamentary election on Sept. 24.  The consequences for our country range from weakened negotiating positions to high material costs and economic damage all the way to impairment of national sovereignty,  it said. Key targets were the Foreign Ministry and its overseas offices, the Finance and Economics ministries, the Chancellery and the German military.  Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the government was working closely with industry to better protect German firms, with the most affected sectors being the weapons, space and aerospace and car industries, as well as research institutes. Cyber attacks could not only lead to losses of information, but also, through delayed-action malware, trigger  silent, ticking digital time bombs  that could manipulate data and sabotage equipment, especially critical infrastructure, the report said. It said that the Sandworm malware, which computer experts have linked to Russia, had actively targeted government sites, the NATO military alliance, utilities and telecommunications firms in recent years. Russia, China, Iran        Russia, China and Iran were the main countries spying on Germany, albeit for different reasons, it said. Russia had a keen interest in the removal of economic sanctions imposed by the European Union for Moscow's actions in Ukraine, and the Russian hacker group APT 28, also known as Fancy Bear and believed to be state-controlled, continued to attack German political targets, the report said. Russia was also using so-called Internet trolls to influence public opinion and push pro-Russian views, the report said, citing a sharp increase in propaganda and disinformation campaigns using social and Russian-backed media.  It is assumed that Russian state agencies are trying to influence parties, politicians and public opinion, with a particular eye to the 2017 parliamentary election,  it said. Iran was focused mainly on Israeli or pro-Jewish targets and political opponents of Tehran's clerical rulers. The report cited a sharp decline in potential attempts by Iran to buy dual-use items for its nuclear program, but said that was not true for its missile development efforts. Chinese espionage had increased since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013, and was focused increasingly on political events such as the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, as well as technology and critics of the Chinese government. It said Chinese intelligence was using social media sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook to try to recruit Western informants, and that the close links between government and industry meant state and industrial espionage were hard to distinguish. Turkish spying was focused on backers in Germany of both the banned separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for the failed coup, though he denies involvement.

The company said on Tuesday it expected sales of radar systems to leap by 60 percent and of video sensors by 80 percent this year. It forecast sales at its Mobility Solutions division, which makes sophisticated safety systems as well as autonomous car components, would grow around 7 percent this year, benefiting from a broader push to make vehicles more intelligent. Last year, Mobility Solutions - which employs 227,000 staff - generated 43.9 billion euros ($49.8 billion) in sales, boosted by deliveries of crash avoidance technologies.  We are growing faster than the market,  management board member Rolf Bulander said.  Bosch delivers advanced safety systems to all of the world's largest automotive companies as well as start-up carmakers. It developed the electric powertrain and steering for Google's prototype autonomous vehicle and is a supplier of driver assistance systems to Tesla. Bosch has around 3,000 developers working on highly automated driving systems, a market which is booming as simple anti-collision technologies like automated braking systems evolve into sophisticated crash avoidance programs using camera and radar to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.

Danish lawmakers concluded in 2015 that it would be in the country's interests to participate in the banking union, designed to integrate the industry more closely within a single bloc-wide regulatory and supervisory framework. But the Danes postponed making a decision then, pending clarification of certain matters. Brexit and increased focus on Denmark as a financial center made it relevant for the country to now launch a review leading to a final decision by autumn 2019, after Britain's EU exit has been formalized, Business Minister Brian Mikkelsen said in a statement. Related CoverageDanish central bank welcomes review of possible EU banking union membership We have to look at the consequences of Britain leaving the EU ... It means that we lack an important partner because the financial sector will be weakened by us not standing side by side,  Mikkelsen told broadcaster TV2. Participation in the banking union would mean closer integration for a country that has been an EU member since 1973 but holds opt-outs from EU policies on security, police and the euro. He added that a majority in parliament and the Danish banks were positive toward Denmark joining the banking union and said a referendum would not be needed.  Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region's biggest bank, has said it could move its headquarters to either Denmark or Finland from Sweden if the government further tightens some of the toughest capital requirements in Europe, but has yet to make a decision. The review would include unresolved issues in relation to supervision of Danish mortgage credit institutions. Denmark has said it wants to keep a tacit exemption that allows its banks to count mortgage-backed bonds - a market worth about 2.8 trillion Danish crowns ($428 billion) - as highly liquid assets should it join the banking union. The banking union project suffered a setback last month when Rome closed down two Veneto banks by means of a deal that could cost the Italian state up to 17 billion euros - breaking a principle agreed by European leaders that investors should shoulder the cost of bank failures. The banking union covers all countries in the euro zone, but European Union countries outside the currency area such as Denmark can also join.

By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA, June 5 (Reuters) - The pace of expansion of private sector activity in Uganda slowed in May, weighed down by weak exports as conflicts in neighbouring countries disrupted regional trade, a survey index showed on Monday. The Markit Stanbic Bank Uganda Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 51.0 from 53.5 in April. The survey report said new export orders had declined in May on the back of reduced demand from key markets.  A notable slowdown in new orders was perhaps the main trigger in May, which is not entirely surprising given that Uganda’s key export markets continue to face enhanced political risks,  said Jibran Qureishi, economist for East Africa at Stanbic Bank. Unrest in South Sudan, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi has made Uganda's transport links to those markets insecure and disrupted the flow of trade. Qureishi said economic activity could rebound in the second half of the year as access to credit improves. The central Bank of Uganda (BOU) has been cutting its benchmark lending rate for about a year, trying to spur credit flows and lift flagging growth. In April the bank said the economy was now unlikely to expand by 4.5 percent in the fiscal year 2016/2017 as it had previously forecast. Last month the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast to between 3.5 and 4 percent from 5 percent, blaming drought and slow credit growth. The PMI report said input costs had risen in May for most firms amid an increase in prices for raw materials, including sugar and food items.

Open Mineral already has commitments from several major parties to use the online marketplace and plans to start actual trades once it gains a critical mass of members, probably in August or September, said Chief Executive Boris Eykher. Smelters and miners could potentially boost returns by millions of dollars by dealing directly in the concentrate market, which is inefficient and opaque, he added.  That's where the intermediaries are making the biggest margins and that's where the mines and smelters are losing the most money,  Eykher said. He says the potential market for the platform in copper, zinc and lead concentrates is about $50 billion. This excludes concentrates produced by miners that have their own smelters. Miners and smelters will post tenders on the online platform, get offers from counterparties and agree deals, paying a fee to the platform, which is being financed by its partners. Eykher, who was chief financial officer at Glencore-owned zinc producer Kazzinc, acknowledges that it will take time to build up activity on the site, with the initial transactions small spot deals.  It will take time for the platform to start operating because we need to have both parties. There are about 1,000 mines and smelters and we will knock on the door of each of them,  he said. Annual concentrate deals are already agreed for 2017, so the platform will target spot and 2018 contracts, which are due to be negotiated later in the year. While refined metal is largely standardised and priced on global metals exchanges, the content of concentrates vary sharply due to a wide range of byproducts and impurities. The platform estimates the value of each concentrate based on the component parts that add or subtract value when processed. For example, copper concentrates often have valuable byproducts such as gold but also can include poisonous arsenic.  We are confident there is a massive demand out there for improved efficiency, transparency, and better market analytics,  said Chief Operating Officer Ilya Chernilovskiy. The platform also allows members to post tenders for logistics providers, he added. Open Mineral is part of the Thomson Reuters Labs Incubator Program for start-ups.

The military government, which has ruled since a 2014 coup, has invoked Article 44, a security order that gives it power to push through policy, to delay the law that imposes heavy fines on employers and employees who do not have work permits, a senior official said. The original decree was issued in part to tackle human trafficking concerns raised by the international community, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam told reporters.  The government had to issue this law because we are being watched by the foreign community in terms of ... human trafficking. If we don't issue this law they will not buy our goods. So we have to do it,  Wissanu said. The U.S. State Department last month left Thailand on a Tier 2 Watchlist, just above the lowest ranking of Tier 3, in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report because it did not  do enough to tackle human smuggling and trafficking. Wissanu said the government would delay implementation of four sections of the law for six months. He did not elaborate but the labor ministry said it would suspend parts of the law until January in order to give both workers and their employers more time to get their work permits. Thailand is a destination for many migrant workers from poorer neighboring countries, including Myanmar and Cambodia. Official estimates put the number of foreign workers at 3 million but rights groups say the real figure is far higher. Many work in Thailand without legal documents, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by brokers and sometimes traffickers. 'Work No Thai Wants' A Myanmar migrant worker rest outside his house near a wholesale market for shrim and other seafood in Mahachai, in Samut Sakhon province, Thailand, July 4, 2017.Chaiwat SubprasomMyanmar said that on Monday, it received more than 5,000 workers returning from Thailand across their border.  Most of the workers went directly back to their home towns. We help them with the transport,  said Aung Htay Win, a Myanmar labor ministry official. Migrants are predominately employed in low-skilled jobs in Thailand's multi-billion dollar fishing sector, in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and as domestic workers. Businesses have complained that the new regulations have caused a shortage of workers in the construction and fishing sectors. Slideshow (3 Images)Property development and construction, which have had a stellar performance in an otherwise sluggish Thai economy, have felt the brunt of the departures.  We lost 75 percent of our workers overnight,  an executive at a Bangkok construction firm, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. In the fishing port of Mahachai, south of Bangkok and home to a many migrants from Myanmar, workers and business people said they were worried. A Myanmar worker who identified himself as Kway, 36, said he had a work permit but his wife and young child did not have proper papers.  I sent my wife and child back to Myanmar because I am not sure what will happen to them , he said. Other residents said they feared the economic impact.  The fishing businesses needs a large labor force and it is work that no Thai wants to do so I don't know why the government has introduced this new legislation,  said Ton, 46, a shrimp vendor.  Many people are afraid to come out of their homes,  said the manager of a grocery shop.

All unremarkable, except that they are wearing a cow mask.     The photographs aim to highlight the growing violence against women in India, while also drawing attention to a wave of attacks on religious minorities accused of eating beef or slaughtering cows - considered sacred by many Hindus.      People are getting lynched in this country to protect cows. But women's safety is neglected and violence against women is rising,  photographer Sujatro Ghosh said of his project.      If we can protect cows, then why not women?      Violence against women has been under the spotlight since a fatal gang-rape of a student on a bus in New Delhi in 2012 sparked nationwide protests about entrenched violence against women and the failure of authorities to protect them.     India has enacted tougher jail sentences for rapists and promised to try those accused through  fast-track  courts but rape, acid attacks and domestic violence remain common.     More than 327,390 crimes against women were registered in India in 2015, an increase of more than half since 2010.     But activists say many crimes go unreported because women are afraid of reprisals from their attackers, or because they are ashamed to report them.     There has also been a surge in violence against people accused of harming cows.     Earlier this month, a 16-year old Muslim boy was stabbed to death on a train on suspicion of carrying beef, the latest victim of an estimated 28 people killed in cow-related violence since 2010.      Most were killed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist party won elections three years ago.     Modi last week broke his silence and condemned the violence by so-called cow protection groups, some of which have links to his party.     Ghosh, who began by photographing his friends and family in Delhi and Kolkata wearing the cow mask, said he has been flooded with offers from women to pose for his project since he began posting the pictures on social media.      He has taken about 30 photographs so far, and is raising money via crowdfunding to take the project across the country.     But he has also been attacked on social media for the project, which some people see as belittling the cow.      I hope people get the message and realize we need to protect women with at least as much zeal as we protect cows,  Ghosh said.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is attempting to revive the oil industry on which the country's economy depends, and which the government relies on for roughly two-thirds of its revenue. Militant attacks on oil facilities last year cut production by as much as a third, helping push the economy into its first recession in a quarter of a century.  For the upstream, cost reduction and efficiency are key features that we will pay attention to,  said Maikanti Baru, who heads the NNPC, in the statement. The company has also cut operating costs for oil production to $22 a barrel from $27 per barrel, Baru said. Average daily production of oil and condensates has been about 1.88 million barrels since the beginning of the year, with the Forcados and Qua Iboe terminals running again after being taken down by attacks last year, he said. That puts Nigeria on target to exceed its 2017 goal of producing an average of 2.2 million barrels of oil and condensate a day, Baru said. Militant attacks crippled Nigeria's oil production in 2016. But since February, the government has sent senior officials including Acting President Yemi Osinbajo to hold talks with local communities in the oil heartlands of the Niger Delta, hoping to address their grievances. That has brought a fragile truce to the region since the beginning of the year and allowed oil production to recover.

In recent years, Moscow has cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes with neighboring countries in winter months. Exports from the United States would help reduce their dependence on Russia. Trump will tell the group that Washington wants to help allies by making it as easy as possible for U.S. companies to ship more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to central and eastern Europe, the White House said. Trump will attend the  Three Seas  summit - so named because several of its members surround the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas - before the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Germany, where he is slated to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Among the aims of the Three Seas project is to expand regional energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals and gas pipelines. Members of the initiative include Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia's neighbors Latvia and Estonia.  Trump's presence will give the project a lift, said James Jones, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Increased U.S. gas exports to the region would help weaken the impact of Russia using energy as a weapon or bargaining chip, said Jones.       I think the United States can show itself as a benevolent country by exporting energy and by helping countries that don’t have adequate supplies become more self-sufficient and less dependent and less threatened,  he said. Trump's Russia policy is still taking shape, a process made awkward by investigations into intelligence findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.  Lawmakers in Trump's Republican Party, many of whom want to see him take a hard line on Russia because of its interference in the election and in crises in Ukraine and Syria, support using gas exports for political leverage.  It undermines the strategies of Putin and other strong men who are trying to use the light switch as an element of strategic offense,  said Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Kremlin relies on oil and gas revenue to finance the state budget, so taking market share would hurt Moscow.  In many ways, the LNG exports by the U.S. is the most threatening U.S. policy to Russia,  said Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund.

Picture taken July 23, 2014.Filip Klimaszewski/File PhotoCompetitive Arena The U.S. is expected to become the world's third-largest exporter of LNG in 2020, just four years after starting up its first export terminal. U.S. exporters have sold most of that gas in long-term contracts, but there are still some volumes on offer, and more export projects on the drawing board. Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), which opened the first U.S. LNG export terminal in 2016, delivered its first cargo to Poland in June. Five more terminals are expected to be online by 2020. Tellurian Inc (TELL.O) has proposed a project with a price tag of as much as $16 billion that it hopes to complete by 2022, in time to compete for long-term contracts to supply Poland that expire the same year and are held by Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM).  We would like to be a supplier that competes for that market,  Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle told Reuters. A global glut in supply may, however, limit U.S. LNG export growth, regardless of Trump's support. The glut has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, said Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia has the advantage in Europe due to its proximity and pipeline connections.  Europe is going to be the great competitive arena between Russian gas and LNG,  said Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice-chairman with IHS Markit analysis firm. Nord Stream Europeans will be watching to see whether Trump clarifies his administration's position on a new pipeline to pump Russian gas to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. The U.S. Senate in June passed a package of sanctions on Russia, including provisions to penalize Western firms involved in the pipeline. The new sanctions have stalled in the House of Representatives. The U.S. State Department has lobbied against the pipeline as a potential supply chokepoint that would make Europe more vulnerable to disruptions. The threat of sanctions adds to tensions between Washington and Berlin. Germany's government supports the pipeline, and Trump's position on it is a concern for European diplomats.

In the latest talks, the two sides have reached agreement for construction of petrochemical plants with the total capacity of 2.2 million tonnes of petrochemical and polymer products per year,  the managing director of Iran's National Petrochemical Company (NPC) was quoted as saying by the oil ministry's news agency SHANA.  We predict that Total would invest $1.5 to $2 billion in Iran's petrochemical industry if we reach final agreement,  Marzieh Shahdaei added. A spokesman for Total said:  Total and Iran's National Petrochemical Company are currently working on an in-depth study of an ethane-based petrochemical project whose figures (Capex especially) have to be fine-tuned.  The preliminary deal on the petrochemical plants follows Monday's agreement by Total to go ahead with the phase 11 development project for Iran's South Pars offshore gas field, the first major Western energy investment in the Islamic Republic since the lifting of sanctions against it. Total's Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said after the signing of the South Pars deal that it would open the door for more business with Tehran. South Pars is part of the world's largest gas field which is shared with neighboring Qatar where development of the deposit known as the North Field has made the tiny Gulf state the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas. Total is active in both Iran and Qatar as well as the UAE, which together with its bigger neighbor Saudi Arabia is in dispute with Qatar over its close ties with Iran. Total's CEO told Reuters last month the petrochemical plants project in Iran was less advanced than South Pars 11 because Total would need to fund that project with loans from banks while South Pars could be developed with its own funds. Iranian deputy oil minister, Amir Hossein Zamaninia said on Monday that Iran and Total have held  positive talks  to cooperate in petrochemicals but added that the deal was not final. An oil industry official said in January that Iran plans to build 25 petrochemical plants and is currently seeking $32 billion in foreign investment to fund projects.

Danish lawmakers concluded in 2015 that it would be in the country's interests to participate in the banking union, designed to integrate the industry more closely within a single bloc-wide regulatory and supervisory framework. But the Danes postponed making a decision then, pending clarification of certain matters. Brexit and increased focus on Denmark as a financial center made it relevant for the country to now launch a review leading to a final decision by autumn 2019, after Britain's EU exit has been formalized, Business Minister Brian Mikkelsen said in a statement. Related CoverageDanish central bank welcomes review of possible EU banking union membership We have to look at the consequences of Britain leaving the EU ... It means that we lack an important partner because the financial sector will be weakened by us not standing side by side,  Mikkelsen told broadcaster TV2. Participation in the banking union would mean closer integration for a country that has been an EU member since 1973 but holds opt-outs from EU policies on security, police and the euro. He added that a majority in parliament and the Danish banks were positive toward Denmark joining the banking union and said a referendum would not be needed.  Nordea (NDA.ST), the Nordic region's biggest bank, has said it could move its headquarters to either Denmark or Finland from Sweden if the government further tightens some of the toughest capital requirements in Europe, but has yet to make a decision. The review would include unresolved issues in relation to supervision of Danish mortgage credit institutions. Denmark has said it wants to keep a tacit exemption that allows its banks to count mortgage-backed bonds - a market worth about 2.8 trillion Danish crowns ($428 billion) - as highly liquid assets should it join the banking union. The banking union project suffered a setback last month when Rome closed down two Veneto banks by means of a deal that could cost the Italian state up to 17 billion euros - breaking a principle agreed by European leaders that investors should shoulder the cost of bank failures. The banking union covers all countries in the euro zone, but European Union countries outside the currency area such as Denmark can also join.

Along with the U.S. dollar, the yen suffered last week from a shift towards tighter monetary policy by central bank officials outside the United States and many had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia to fall in line with the trend. But the Aussie central bank's neutral stance on rates was broadly unchanged and the Aussie dollar, up in earlier trade, sank in response. Sweden's Riksbank also stuck to forecasts for rates not to rise until the middle of next year and said that, while it did not expect to cut borrowing costs again, it did not rule that out, pushing its crown currency lower.  The fact that the RBA didn't meet the expectations for a shift to more hawkish rhetoric was a big driver,  said Lee Hardman, an analyst with Japan's MUFG in London.  If the yen has weakened in the past week it has been on the idea that the central banks were shifting to a more hawkish stance. And obviously this goes in the other direction.  The yen, also helped by Asian investors seeking safe havens for their money after a missile launch by North Korea, rose around a third of a percent against both the dollar and the euro. The Aussie, which hit almost four-month highs in last week's moves, fell 0.8 percent on the day to $0.7599. While the dollar slipped against the yen, it stood firm at 96.256 against the basket of six major currencies used to measure its broader strength. That followed its strongest daily gain in almost four months on Monday, helped by a bigger-than-expected rise in one U.S. factory activity indicator which propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy. But a number of analysts have begun to highlight the chances of ECB policymakers, three of whom speak on Tuesday, expressing concern about euro appreciation - or simply dialling down any more rhetoric on tightening - if the currency gets much higher.  Last Thursday, euro sentiment reached an extreme with 93 percent of traders bullish, before settling down to 82 percent yesterday,  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.  The last time the index reached this high was in February 2013, causing the ECB to intervene verbally. We expect a EUR downward correction, but the magnitude of the anticipated correction will be ... moderate.  Despite that call, the U.S. bank recommended buying in to any break for the euro above $1.1450. It traded 0.1 percent lower by 1045 GMT at $1.1349.

The Los Angeles Dodgers spent the last week separating themselves from the pack and have a chance to put even more distance between themselves and their closest competition when they host the Arizona Diamondbacks in the opener of a three-game series on Tuesday. Los Angeles enters the week 2 1/2 games up on the Diamondbacks in the West, with the Colorado Rockies falling off the pace, and owns the best record in the NL at 55-29 but did not have a starter voted to the All-Star Game by the fans, which annoyed closer Kenley Jansen.

Credit Suisse Private Fund Group advised Hayfin on the €2.2bn eight-year, closed-end special opportunities capital raise, which comprises a €1.7bn co-mingled fund and €500m of managed accounts. The fund raising kicked off in 2016 and attracted commitments from new and existing institutional investors, with around 85% coming from public and private pension funds and the rest coming from sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and endowments. The investor base was split evenly between Europe, North America and Australasia. The strategy has targeted a 15%-20% gross internal rate of return and will invest across a range of sectors in illiquid assets and corporate debt, including rescue financings and debt restructurings. It will also provide asset-back financing for inventory and equipment of distressed companies in sectors including healthcare, retail, shipping and oil & gas. Other areas of interest include real estate non-performing loans. Investments have already been made in assets including troubled Spanish renewable energy and engineering firm Abengoa. This is the second special opportunities credit strategy for Hayfin, which raised €2bn in 2013 comprising €1.4bn in a co-mingled fund and the rest from managed accounts. That is fully invested. Hayfin has been on a fundraising spree, having raised €3.6bn for its European direct lending strategy earlier this year. Hayfin has grown to a team of 78 people, 73 of which are based across Europe, sourcing opportunities locally to originate deals. Hayfin’s deep sector expertise, local reach and scale have been instrumental in building our strong track record of sourcing and managing a diverse portfolio of illiquid credit investments across Europe and generating strong risk adjusted returns for our investors throughout the cycle,” said Tim Flynn, CEO of Hayfin.

Heavy rainfall, mudslides and hail caused by the annual rainy season has killed 56 people and 22 people were missing across 11 provinces and regions as of Tuesday morning, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. More than 750,000 hectares (1.85 million acres) of crops have been damaged and direct economic losses totaled more than 25.3 billion yuan ($3.72 billion), it said.  The government said it had disbursed 700 million yuan ($103 million) in emergency aid to four flood-hit provinces -  Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou. Rain in the southern provinces is expected to ease in the coming days, but weather forecasters predict downpours will move to the southwestern province of Sichuan. In what analysts said was a move unprecedented in its scale, the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, two of China's top hydropower plants, closed as much as two-thirds of their capacity to avert flooding further downstream on the Yangtze River.     The move stoked concerns about electricity supplies from China's second-largest power source as a heatwave continued to scorch northern parts of the country, raising the export prices of coal, the fuel the country uses to produce most of its power. Coal from Australia's Newcastle terminal rose to its highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand. The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province, one of the nation's largest hog and freshwater fish producers, the most.  High water levels on the Yangtze, Asia's largest river, also slowed barges carrying grain from northern ports to the south, spurring a rise in freight rates and physical corn prices in some regions, analysts and corn buyers said. A man sits in the attic of his flooded house after a flood in Zhaoqing, Guangdong province, China July 4, 2017.StringerZhang Yi, a purchase manager at a feed producer in Hunan, said he had three ships carrying about 5,000 tonnes of corn stuck on waterways near the port of Changsha, the capital of Hunan, since Friday. Corn Prices Rise on Barge Delays Spot corn prices at major ports along the Yangtze and its tributaries, including Changsha, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Wuhan in Hubei province, have risen by 30 yuan to 1,800 yuan a ton since last week, according to data provided by China National Grain and Oils Information Center, a government think tank. Slideshow (9 Images)China usually transports corn from northern growing regions to the ports in the south. Then the grain is shipped along the Yangtze and its branches, to central and western provinces including Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. The Yangtze river's large watershed also accounts for 60 percent of the nation's freshwater fish output. Cao Delian, manager of the Dabeinong Changlin fish farm, estimated that he has lost about one-third of his carp due to the deluge.  It's the biggest loss we've seen in at least 5 years,  he told Reuters. On Monday, a natural gas pipeline in Guizhou owned by China National Petroleum Corp collapsed due to a mudslide, causing an explosion that killed at least eight people and injured another 35. In his office in Liuyang, a city near Changsha, Zhang was hoping water levels would continue to subside on Wednesday.   I have stocks of corn that can last for four to five days. As long as it does not rain tomorrow, Changsha port can resume operation and I will get my corn offloaded,  Zhang said.

The government of Africa’s second most populous country has set an ambitious aim of reducing poverty and becoming a carbon-neutral economy by 2025, in part by transforming the way rural landscapes are managed. Its Climate Resilient Green Economy strategy aims to meet half of its target reduction in carbon emissions by adding 5 million hectares (12.4 million acres) of forests by 2020 – just three years from  now – and restoring 22 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2030. The government sees adding forests as a key way to both curb climate change and help the country adapt to and deal with strong climate change impacts, including droughts, said Yitbetu Moges, the national representative for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) at Ethiopia’s Ministry of Forestry, Environment and Climate Change. With water resources under ever greater stress due to the country’s rising population, forests are important to maintaining stable rainfall and building drought resilience, while the carbon they store reduces emissions to the environment, Moges said. Starting in Oromia According to the ministry, the biggest forest conservation programmes are taking place in Oromia, which is home to a third of the country’s population. The 10-year Oromia Forested Landscape Programme (OFLP), which is getting underway this year, is a community-centered program for sustainable forest management. The project, with an initial $18 million of funding from the World Bank, aims to reduce deforestation and lower net greenhouse gas emissions resulting from land use. The program's first pilot project launched in early May in the Chilimo Forest Reserve, one of the last remnants of a dry, mountainous forest that once covered Ethiopia’s central plateau. Located 90 km (56 miles) west of Addis Ababa, the forest currently covers about 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres), down from 12,000 hectares (29,600 acres) in the 1980s, mainly as a result of logging in the early 1990s, officials say. Under the program, local community cooperatives have been given the right to protect and manage the forest, which faces encroaching population pressure and illegal logging, and decide on how to use the benefits accrued from it. The program encourages cooperative members to harvest stalks and other crop residue from fields for fuel, instead of using wood, and cultivate wild honey and crops like green pepper, onion and potatoes, which can be grown within the forest limits without requiring significant deforestation. Communities are also urged to plant fast-growing, non-native trees such as eucalyptus to harvest for timber or medicinal purposes as a way of generating income. Degu Woldegiorgis, a local community leader, is a member of one of 12 forest associations, representing 3,000 residents around Chilimo, that will participate in managing the forest. He said the community’s decision to help preserve the Chilimo reserve is the result of seeing the problems other communities have faced after destroying their forests. “The forest is our life. We get many benefits from the forest,” he said. Woldegiorgis said his community has committed to planting three tree seedlings per community member on deforested land each year. Benefits Downstream Stephen Danyo, an expert in natural resources management with the World Bank’s Ethiopia office, said the forestry management scheme aims not just to secure incomes for local communities but to protect water resources for downstream communities as well. “Forest is worth protecting and expanding because forest not only provides jobs and livelihoods, it provides water security, it provides food security, it provides climate security,” he said. Moges said protecting forests would also help ensure more stable harvests by protecting water supplies – a major concern in a country where the government says 7.8 million Ethiopians face food shortages as a result of climate change-related drought and land degradation. “Agriculture will benefit as it will be less impacted by climate change shocks, creating climate stability, in addition to the forest’s well-known touristic benefits,” he said. The government estimates that about 15.5 percent of Ethiopia is covered in forests – but the country is losing 92,000 hectares (227,000 acres) of forest annually, and only 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) are being replanted, Moges said. He said that to protect more forests young Ethiopians need to learn about the value of forest conservation in school, from primary level onward. Woldegiorgis, on the other hand, thinks tougher punishments for illegal loggers in the Chilimo Forest Reserve are needed. He said that loggers caught by his organization and handed over to the authorities have received what he sees as lenient prison sentences of only a few months. Population Pressure Moges also thinks some of Ethiopia’s rural population needs to move to its cities to better protect forests and other land as the country’s population expands. More than 80 percent of the country’s population lives in rural areas, adding to the pressure on forests, he said. “National planning is needed with regards to population pressure to relieve pressure on land. But we also have to ensure today’s children can migrate to cities, learn in good schools, be employed in industries, and open up business,” he said. Danyo said such strategies need to start working soon, or Ethiopia may struggle to hold onto its remaining forests as population pressures grow. “There’s not much left in Ethiopia of the old, native, original forest. It’s disappearing quickly,” he said. “Protecting forests is not just because people love trees and forests but because it’s important for poverty reduction, jobs, water security energy and agriculture.” Moges said he sees protecting forests as critical to the country’s future success. “A prosperous Ethiopia is one that protects its forest resources. Preserving forests is creating prosperity,” he said.

There can be no negotiations on worker safety and no tolerance for such accidents,  said Amirul Haque Amin, president of the National Garment Workers Federation, seven of whose members were among the over 50 injured in the factory blast.  After Rana Plaza, the coming together of various stakeholders has brought in better regulation in the industry but casualties in such accidents are still on the higher side.  The boiler explosion on Monday night occurred at a plant of Multifabs Limited, a Bangladeshi company on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka. The firm supplies knitted apparel to clients in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Russia, Spain, Netherlands and Britain, including to Littlewoods, one of Britain's oldest retail brands. The company said the plant was functioning well and the boiler, procured from Germany, had just been serviced. The factory had been shut for 10 days for the Eid period at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and was being readied to resume operations from Tuesday.  The company had undergone mandatory independent safety inspections as it supplies to brands that are signatories to the Bangladesh Accord on fire and building safety, an independent, legally binding framework set up after the Rana Plaza collapse.

The government of Africa’s second most populous country has set an ambitious aim of reducing poverty and becoming a carbon-neutral economy by 2025, in part by transforming the way rural landscapes are managed. Its Climate Resilient Green Economy strategy aims to meet half of its target reduction in carbon emissions by adding 5 million hectares (12.4 million acres) of forests by 2020 – just three years from  now – and restoring 22 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2030. The government sees adding forests as a key way to both curb climate change and help the country adapt to and deal with strong climate change impacts, including droughts, said Yitbetu Moges, the national representative for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) at Ethiopia’s Ministry of Forestry, Environment and Climate Change. With water resources under ever greater stress due to the country’s rising population, forests are important to maintaining stable rainfall and building drought resilience, while the carbon they store reduces emissions to the environment, Moges said. Starting in Oromia According to the ministry, the biggest forest conservation programmes are taking place in Oromia, which is home to a third of the country’s population. The 10-year Oromia Forested Landscape Programme (OFLP), which is getting underway this year, is a community-centered program for sustainable forest management. The project, with an initial $18 million of funding from the World Bank, aims to reduce deforestation and lower net greenhouse gas emissions resulting from land use. The program's first pilot project launched in early May in the Chilimo Forest Reserve, one of the last remnants of a dry, mountainous forest that once covered Ethiopia’s central plateau. Located 90 km (56 miles) west of Addis Ababa, the forest currently covers about 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres), down from 12,000 hectares (29,600 acres) in the 1980s, mainly as a result of logging in the early 1990s, officials say. Under the program, local community cooperatives have been given the right to protect and manage the forest, which faces encroaching population pressure and illegal logging, and decide on how to use the benefits accrued from it. The program encourages cooperative members to harvest stalks and other crop residue from fields for fuel, instead of using wood, and cultivate wild honey and crops like green pepper, onion and potatoes, which can be grown within the forest limits without requiring significant deforestation. Communities are also urged to plant fast-growing, non-native trees such as eucalyptus to harvest for timber or medicinal purposes as a way of generating income. Degu Woldegiorgis, a local community leader, is a member of one of 12 forest associations, representing 3,000 residents around Chilimo, that will participate in managing the forest. He said the community’s decision to help preserve the Chilimo reserve is the result of seeing the problems other communities have faced after destroying their forests. “The forest is our life. We get many benefits from the forest,” he said. Woldegiorgis said his community has committed to planting three tree seedlings per community member on deforested land each year. Benefits Downstream Stephen Danyo, an expert in natural resources management with the World Bank’s Ethiopia office, said the forestry management scheme aims not just to secure incomes for local communities but to protect water resources for downstream communities as well. “Forest is worth protecting and expanding because forest not only provides jobs and livelihoods, it provides water security, it provides food security, it provides climate security,” he said. Moges said protecting forests would also help ensure more stable harvests by protecting water supplies – a major concern in a country where the government says 7.8 million Ethiopians face food shortages as a result of climate change-related drought and land degradation. “Agriculture will benefit as it will be less impacted by climate change shocks, creating climate stability, in addition to the forest’s well-known touristic benefits,” he said. The government estimates that about 15.5 percent of Ethiopia is covered in forests – but the country is losing 92,000 hectares (227,000 acres) of forest annually, and only 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) are being replanted, Moges said. He said that to protect more forests young Ethiopians need to learn about the value of forest conservation in school, from primary level onward. Woldegiorgis, on the other hand, thinks tougher punishments for illegal loggers in the Chilimo Forest Reserve are needed. He said that loggers caught by his organization and handed over to the authorities have received what he sees as lenient prison sentences of only a few months. Population Pressure Moges also thinks some of Ethiopia’s rural population needs to move to its cities to better protect forests and other land as the country’s population expands. More than 80 percent of the country’s population lives in rural areas, adding to the pressure on forests, he said. “National planning is needed with regards to population pressure to relieve pressure on land. But we also have to ensure today’s children can migrate to cities, learn in good schools, be employed in industries, and open up business,” he said. Danyo said such strategies need to start working soon, or Ethiopia may struggle to hold onto its remaining forests as population pressures grow. “There’s not much left in Ethiopia of the old, native, original forest. It’s disappearing quickly,” he said. “Protecting forests is not just because people love trees and forests but because it’s important for poverty reduction, jobs, water security energy and agriculture.” Moges said he sees protecting forests as critical to the country’s future success. “A prosperous Ethiopia is one that protects its forest resources. Preserving forests is creating prosperity,” he said.

Authorities closed more than 600 steel mills producing low-grade construction steel during the first half of the year, cutting capacity by about 120 million tonnes, the state-owned China Economic Daily reported earlier on Tuesday. Last month, China said it has reduced its total steel production capacity by 42.4 million tonnes as of end-May, meeting 85 percent of its full-year target.  In Hebei, the combined reduction in steelmaking capacity at nine mills of more than 11 million tonnes was meant to make way for the expansion of a plant by Shougang Jintang Iron and Steel Co, according to a document published on the Hebei government's website this week.  The expansion at Shougang Jintang Steel's plant will add new capacity of 5.1 million tonnes, it said. The entire plant, when finished, can produce 9 million tonnes of steel products annually. Shougang Jintang is a unit of Chinese conglomerate Shougang Group [SGANG.UL].

Go-Jek, which already counts global private equity firms KKR & Co LP, Warburg Pincus LLC and venture capital player Sequoia Capital as investors, is seeking to raise more capital from existing and new investors, the sources said. The startup aims to raise up to $1 billion from its current funding round, the sources, who are familiar with the matter but did not want to be named, told Reuters. A Go-Jek spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's fund-raising plans, saying:  If there is information that we can share then we will share it.  Tencent said it would respond  in due course  when asked about the investment, without giving any more details. An investment by China's largest social media and online entertainment firm would indicate it wants to establish its presence in Southeast Asia that many expect will produce the next batch of high-valued tech startups known as unicorns. Tencent, with a current market capitalisation of $341 billion, has previously bought a stake in Singapore-based gaming startup Sea Ltd, formerly known as Garena, which was valued at $3.75 billion after a March 2016 funding round. Other Chinese tech behemoths have also been carving out their territory in Southeast Asia, home to more than 600 million people and some of the world's fastest-growing economies. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd last week said it would invest an additional $1 billion in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada Group, boosting its stake by nearly a third to 83 percent and amplifying its focus on the region. Alibaba's domestic rival JD.com Inc is in talks with Indonesia's online marketplace Tokopedia for possible investment, a separate source told Reuters. Go-Jek, which started as a hailing app for motorbike taxis, also operates a food delivery business that a source said yields a much higher margin than ride-hailing. Its mobile payment business, Go-Pay, is growing rapidly as it is complementary with all the other Go-Jek offerings, the source added. Tencent and Alibaba have each invested in food delivery apps in China and have been fighting to gain market share in the mobile payment space with their respective platforms. One of the sources said that Go-Jek aims to close the current funding round in the third quarter. According to a media report, the start-up was valued at more than $2 billion when the funding round started. Last August, KKR, Warburg and others invested $550 million in Go-Jek at an undisclosed valuation. Warburg is looking to chip in more in this round, sources said.

Blockchain technology provides an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system, which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third-party verification. In a separate statement on Tuesday on the deal, VEB said it had signed a framework agreement with China Development Bank under which the Russian lender will receive 50 billion roubles ($844 million) in financing over 15 years. VEB is under Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict and therefore cannot raise long-term financing from U.S. and European investors.  VEB has been grappling with a mountain of bad debt after projects in Russia such as construction for the Sochi Winter Olympics. The framework agreement was signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow. The financing will be in the form of participation in private equity funds and the repurchase of bond issues. It will be targeted at supporting high-tech and innovative projects. The money provided  can be used to finance projects in energy, transport, industrial and energy infrastructure, cross-border projects in Siberia and the Far East,  Gorkov said in a statement. China Development Bank has been a partner of VEB for about 11 years and has signed credit agreements with VEB for more than $10 billion, the statement said.

The Riksbank kept its benchmark repo rate at -0.50 percent and its bond purchase programme at 290 billion Swedish crowns ($34 billion), as forecast by all 17 analysts in a Reuters poll published on Friday. They had also expected it to follow the lead of the European Central Bank and its counterpart in Norway by drawing a line under further rate cuts. After a decade of ultra-loose monetary policy across much of the world's financial system, many developed economies' central banks are trying to map out a path towards weaning markets off cheap money without upsetting the recovery. The Riksbank said higher inflation and a more stable international picture made it  less likely than before that (we)... will cut the repo rate in the near term . The crown weakened slightly to 9.6890 to the euro after the bank also said it did not rule out more rate cuts. But analysts said its overall tone fitted in with the global policy picture.  The near-term easing bias was dropped, underlining the importance of other central banks,  Nordea chief analyst Torbjorn Isaksson said in a note.  Improved global growth prospects, reduced deflation fears, less political risks and higher inflation expectations have led to less dovish messages from central banks in general, now also including the Riksbank . Focusing Minds Last month, the Bank for International Settlements called on major central banks to push forward interest rate increases, focusing investors' minds on the challenges of shifting away from ultra-loose policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked four times since the financial crisis and looks like continuing to do most of the heavy lifting, though other central banks have started to tentatively prepare the ground for similar moves. The euro and the pound strengthened after what markets viewed as more hawkish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. With Sweden's economy in rude health, the Riksbank's transition to normalising policy should theoretically be among the easiest, especially as negative rates are causing imbalances such as runaway house prices and household borrowing. Even Swedish inflation has surprised on the upside recently. But the central bank, which has used a weak crown to build price pressures, has insisted that inflation should hit 2 percent before it changes course, meaning it is likely to remain on the dovish side for some time.  When it comes to monetary policy, it is much too early to make it less expansive,  bank Governor Stefan Ingves told a news conference following the policy decision. SEB chief economist Robert Bergqvist said he expected the crown's importance for monetary policy to diminish.  I think the Riksbank will accept a gradually stronger crown, down to 9.30 against the euro, without being scared,  he said. The central bank publishes its next policy decision on Sept. 7.

Brent crude futures fell by 22 cents to $49.46 per barrel by 0927 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading down 20 cents at $46.87 a barrel. The falls came after both benchmarks recovered around 12 percent from their recent lows on June 21. Many traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, while Brent also faced technical resistance as it approached $50 per barrel, traders said. Despite this, the market's outlook has shifted somewhat. Late May and most of June were overwhelmingly bearish as U.S. output rose and doubts grew over the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold back enough production to tighten the market. But sentiment began to shift towards the end of June, when U.S. data showed a dip in American oil output and a slight fall in drilling for new production. RIG-OL-USA-BHI C-OUT-T-EIA  The fact that prices have not come under any noticeable pressure of late points to a shift in sentiment,  Commerzbank said on Tuesday.  This may be related to the fact that most of the 'shaky hands' have withdrawn from the market by now,  the bank added. Prices rose in recent days despite OPEC production hitting a 2017 high of 32.72 million barrels a day in June, according to a Reuters survey. The group's efforts to rebalance the market have been undermined by rising production from Libya and Nigeria, who are exempt from the cuts. Libya is currently pumping around 1 million bpd of crude, a four-year high.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said, although it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year on year in 2018 . BMI said it expected Brent to average $54 per barrel in the second half of this year, and to average $55 a barrel in 2018. It expects WTI to average $51 in the second half of 2017 and $52 next year.

Fitch classifies SNI as a credit-linked entity under its public-sector entity rating criteria, due to its 99.99% ownership by Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC; AA/Stable/F1+), its strategic and financial integration with CDC, and its key role for CDC and France in the supply of rented social housing. The rating differential - one notch lower than CDC's ratings - takes into account that SNI's intermediate housing activity does not benefit from the same institutional support as does social housing activity. Fitch only rates SNI's consolidated division, which focuses on intermediate housing and excludes the core social housing division that comprises social housing entities (SHEs), among others. The consolidated division and the social housing division represent 45.6% and 54.4%, respectively, of SNI group's total stock. KEY RATING DRIVERS Legal Status (Midrange) Fully consolidated within CDC, SNI is a semi-public company that is fully controlled by CDC. Social and intermediate housing developments run by SNI are part of CDC's medium-term strategic plan. Every year, a letter of objectives is addressed to SNI Group's CEO to define the policy guidelines, with a strategic and financial plan that establishes shareholder action for the coming year. Strategic Importance (Midrange) As CDC's general housing subsidiary, SNI is France's largest social landlord and aims to build 100,000 units over 2015-2021. SNI Group plays a strategic role for the French State through the stimulus package of intermediate housing, which is structured in three investment vehicles. The number of units managed by SNI Group would reach 398,950 in 2026 compared with 348,725 units at end-2016. Control (Midrange) CDC applies its prudential model to SNI, implying tight control. This implies detailed information reporting to CDC, on a quarterly basis for debt and liquidity. CDC's CEO is the chair of SNI Group supervisory board, while SNI Group's CEO is a member of CDC's management committee. Integration (Stronger) As a shareholder, CDC receives dividends from SNI. The medium- and long-term plan is based on support from CDC, which will translate into an equity increase of EUR900 million over 2016-2021. This equity increase will be realised in cash and dividend restraint. To this end, CDC carried out a capital increase of EUR400 million in May 2017. Fitch believes that in case of need, CDC would be able to provide SNI with further support. SNI's liquidity is sound, underpinned by strong and predictable cash flows from a recurring rental business. Excluding ADOMA, (SNI's subsidiary which is dedicated to emergency housing) 68% of SNI's rents come from public-sector tenants (with or without a housing reservation agreement). About 80% of the total housing reservation agreements are long-term (exceeding five years). Typical rental leases with third parties are for three, six or nine years, and are renewable. This constitutes a strong security against the cyclical fluctuations of the housing rental market and global real estate prices, in Fitch's view. Including ADOMA, 85% of SNI's tenants are associated with the organisation's public interest mission. At end-2016, 7.1% of SNI's aggregate housing rents were composed of individual housing benefits paid directly by the French State to SNI. Fitch judges that the cash flow of SNI Group's consolidated division (EUR204 million) in 2020 should be sufficient to cover debt repayment (EUR175.4 million). In 2026, SNI expects to comply with the gearing (net debt-to-equity excluding swaps) set out in CDC's financial objectives (below 2.0x), with net debt of EUR3.9 billion (EUR3 billion expected at end-2017). In common with other property companies, SNI Group's consolidated division post high and stable leverage with a gearing ratio, which would reach 1.6x at end-2017 (2016: 1.9x) and net debt, which would represent 5.5x net turnover in 2017 (net rental income plus other revenues; 2016: 5.6x). Fitch estimates that the debt weighted on the value of fixed assets would remain stable, with a loan-to-value ratio of 43% at end-2017 (44% at end-2016). RATING SENSITIVITIES A rating action on CDC would lead to a similar action on SNI. A weakening of the state's institutional and financial support to the affordable housing sector - which Fitch views as unlikely at present - may result in negative rating action.

Blockchain technology provides an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system, which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third-party verification. In a separate statement on Tuesday on the deal, VEB said it had signed a framework agreement with China Development Bank under which the Russian lender will receive 50 billion roubles ($844 million) in financing over 15 years. VEB is under Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict and therefore cannot raise long-term financing from U.S. and European investors.  VEB has been grappling with a mountain of bad debt after projects in Russia such as construction for the Sochi Winter Olympics. The framework agreement was signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow. The financing will be in the form of participation in private equity funds and the repurchase of bond issues. It will be targeted at supporting high-tech and innovative projects. The money provided  can be used to finance projects in energy, transport, industrial and energy infrastructure, cross-border projects in Siberia and the Far East,  Gorkov said in a statement. China Development Bank has been a partner of VEB for about 11 years and has signed credit agreements with VEB for more than $10 billion, the statement said.

Qatar in April lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. That new project will raise Qatar's total liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, Qatar Petroleum's CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference in Doha. Global LNG demand was 265 million tonnes in 2016, according to Royal Dutch Shell's annual LNG outlook.  After further assessment, we have decided that the best way to develop this huge project is by dedicating it to the production and export of liquefied natural gas,  Kaabi said.  We have decided that the best option would be to double the size of the project to 4 billion cubic feet of gas per day... This project will strengthen our position as the world's largest LNG producer and exporter.  QP will need to build new LNG trains to meet the expansion in capacity, Kaabi said.  We will be looking for international partners to join us,  he said, declining to say when a tender would be issued. The announcement comes a day after France's Total signed an agreement with Iran to develop its part of the shared off-shore gas field that Tehran calls South Pars. Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field.  We know what they [the Iranians] are doing and they know what we are doing,  he said. Iran, which suffers severe domestic gas shortages, has made a rapid rise in production from South Pars a top priority. The deal on Monday with Total is to develop its South Pars Phase 11 project, the first major Western energy investment in the country since the lifting of sanctions. Gulf OPEC member Qatar, a future World Cup host with a population of 2.7 million, faces sanctions by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain who have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the accusation. The four Arab states meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis or impose further sanctions on Qatar, which could include asking trade partners to pick a side in the Gulf rift. Kaabi said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.  Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with,  he said.

The missile, launched days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes, flew a trajectory that an expert said could allow a weapon to hit the U.S. state of Alaska.      North Korea's missile deployment to Sea of Japan is a sign of increasing intensity of security risk in the region,  said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura in Hong Kong.     Global equity markets were weighed down late last week by worries that major central banks were turning hawkish, possibly signalling a coordinated end to years of ultra-loose monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic.     Asia, however, has had its bright spots, as this week's manufacturing surveys showed. Private sector surveys of manufacturers in Asia showed the factory sectors of China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan picked up in June, driven largely by a recovery in exports.    In southeast Asia, Indonesian shares ended the day 0.8 percent lower as telecommunication and consumer shares weighed on the index.

Petronas Gas Bhd was down as much as 1.60 percent.         Malaysian palm oil futures fell on Tuesday from a two-week high on profit-taking and as the market tracked a weaker performance in related oils on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange.

Sainsbury's and major rivals - market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L) - are grappling with the rapid growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl and having to cope with more expensive food imports due to a fall in the value of sterling since Britain voted to leave the European Union.

Our strategy is delivering and we are well placed to navigate the external environment.  Shares in Sainsbury's rose up to 3 percent.  Sainsbury's has improved volume growth while improving their price position in the quarter,  said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has an  outperform  rating on the stock. The group's retail like-for-like sales rose 2.3 percent, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to July 1, its fiscal first quarter - ahead of analysts' average forecast for a rise of 2 percent, and growth of 0.3 percent in the previous quarter. This was the first quarter following the Home Retail purchase for which the group did not issue separate like-for-like sales data for Sainsbury's and Argos. Inflation, Savings  Our performance is really driven by own label (food)products and the fact that we’ve invested a lot over the last few years,  Coupe told reporters, highlighting 430 new and improved products in the quarter, including over 250 new Summer eating lines. He said that while overall grocery inflation had trended upwards in the quarter, Sainsbury's prices versus competitors were better.  We’ve done a great job with our suppliers within our own (label) business to hold our costs down which means our price position has improved in the quarter,  said Coupe. He noted that prices of staples, such as broccoli, milk, apples, chicken breasts and eggs were cheaper than they were three years ago. Sainsbury's said total grocery sales rose 3.0 percent, while transactions at supermarkets were up 1.9 percent. General merchandise sales increased 1.0 percent. Online grocery sales increased 8 percent, while sales at convenience stores were up 10 percent. Finance chief Kevin O'Byrne said he was comfortable with analysts' average profit forecast of 572 million pounds for 2017-18, down from 581 million in 2016-17. Such an outcome would represent a fourth straight year of profit decline. Sainsbury's has held takeover talks with franchised convenience chain Nisa, according to two industry sources, and is also reportedly considering a move for wholesaler Palmer & Harvey. Coupe, however, wouldn't be drawn on possible deals.  A business like Sainsbury’s is always looking at potential opportunities ... We talk to lots of people,  he said.  Most of these conversations come to nothing,  added O'Byrne. Sainsbury's said it remained confident of delivering 160 million pounds of earnings synergies from the Argos purchase by 2019 and was on track to achieve 145 million pounds of other cost savings this year.

Four refiners in the world's third largest crude importer bought 9 million barrels of Middle East and Russian crude loading in July-August via spot tenders last month, drawing down excess supplies in the market after China's demand slowed. Refiners such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have opted to buy more spot crude as they gradually ramp up output, rather than increase long-term crude supplies, the sources said. IOC expects to run its new 300,000-bpd Paradip refinery at full capacity this year, while BPCL plans to ramp up output at its Kochi refinery to 310,000 bpd by September after an expansion, they said. An IOC spokesman said his company's high-sulfur crude oil purchases from the spot market have risen as operations at the Paradip refinery stabilized. IOC has bought 5 million barrels of high-sulfur oil for August, he said, adding  there could be more .  Refiners are buying heavier grades to increase middle distillate and fuel oil yields  as refining profits for these products have strengthened, said Ehsan Ul Haq, director at London-based consultancy Resource Economics said. Indian refiners have also increased spot purchases during a period of abundant supplies, allowing them to react quickly to market changes and pick up cargoes when prices are competitive. IOC said in May it plans to buy 68 percent of its oil needs from term suppliers, down from 80 percent earlier. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and BPCL have bought Omani and Bahraini crude while IOC bought 5 million barrels of Abu Dhabi, Iraqi and Russian Urals crude. [CRU/TENDA] Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL) also purchased 1 million barrels of Russian Urals, traders said. MRPL and BORL seldom buy high-sulfur crude while IOC and BPCL have increased purchases this year, they said. Sellers include Litasco, the trading arm of Russian producer Lukoil, Sinochem Corp [SASADA.UL] and Vitol[VITOLV.UL], traders said. The companies did not respond to e-mails and calls seeking comments. BPCL could buy more sour crude this week as it has issued a tender seeking oil for August arrival, a trader said. All-Time High India is buying more Brent-linked Urals crude this year, with imports to hit an all-time high of 4 million barrels in July, after the price gap between Brent and Dubai narrowed to multi-year lows of below $1 a barrel. Global crude markets remain oversupplied, weighing on Brent and West Texas Intermediate prices, despite a deal among members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers to extend output cuts. Some Indian refiners are also exploring the feasibility of importing U.S. crude, sources said, joining other Asian buyers such as China and Japan that stepped up imports from the United States this year on weak WTI prices. IOC issued its first ever tender seeking sour crude from the United States and Canada, trade sources said on Tuesday. Still, India's crude demand is expected to fall early in the fourth quarter as several refineries are scheduled to shut for maintenance.

Authorities first considered banning the notorious hordes of bikes in the capital last year over fears its leafy streets would soon be overrun as the population swells and the middle class buys up cars in record numbers. Under the scheme, the city government will gradually limit motorcycles in certain areas, the committee said in a statement on its website. But there is concern over the feasibility of the plan. Motorcycle riders say it would be impossible to ban people from a mode of transport they have grown up with, especially given the city's poor public transport. Vietnam's rapid economic growth has seen household incomes quadruple since the turn of the century. One in every two of its 90 million people own a motorcycle, and car sales rose 30 percent in 2016. Hanoi is forecast to have six million motorcycles on its roads in the next three years, according to the city government.

Worldpay, which sells technology to businesses so they can take payments via cards, online or on mobile devices, said the approaches were preliminary and there was no certainty any deal would be made. Businesses which automate payments are becoming a popular takeover target with card companies, banks and technology firms all competing in the sector. Danish payment services company Nets A/S, said over the weekend that it had also been approached by potential buyers. Worldpay's shares rose sharply after it disclosed the takeover approaches, briefly hitting an all time high of 402 pence. At 0850 GMT the shares were trading at 362 pence, valuing the company at 6.43 billion pounds ($8.3 billion). Analysts suggested other companies might now be interested in making a bid.  We believe Worldpay is a unique asset and the current interest from two U.S. peers could also trigger the intention of parties like Google, Amazon, Apple,  a note from Mediobanca Securities said. Vantiv and JP Morgan now have until August 1 to announce firm intentions to buy or else walk away. Neither company could be reached for comment in the U.S., which is marking the July 4 holiday. Worldpay was spun out of British lender Royal Bank of Scotland to private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International in 2010. The buyout firms listed the company on the London Stock Exchange in late 2015, when it was valued at 4.8 billion pounds.

But an offer came along he couldn’t refuse - a loan from a fund that partners with international aid agency World Vision, intended to help him recover from the disaster linked to a powerful El Niño climate pattern.  “It helped me restock my business,” said the father of five in his shop on Ole Ndutu Street in western Kenya’s Narok town. “It has also enabled me to expand my business.” Macharia started with a loan of 360,000 Kenyan shillings ($3,472), and after repaying that in 15 months, secured another for 700,000 shillings.  “I have even bought a car and built housing units for renting out using the loan,” he said. Macharia is among hundreds of thousands of Kenyans who frequently struggle with weather and climate extremes, including flooding and drought.  But many cannot obtain credit from commercial banks to cope with the impacts, because they are poor and viewed as high-risk. The El Niño Recovery Lending Programme run by VisionFund International, the microfinance arm of World Vision, is helping to change that in Kenya's Great Rift Valley region. Kijoolu Nkoito, a farmer from Olooroito village in Narok County, has long been disadvantaged because she is not regarded as creditworthy by mainstream banks. The widow burns charcoal for a living and sells local brew to feed her five children and keep them in school. But during the 2015 rains, driven by the El Niño phenomenon as Pacific waters warmed, she felt as though nature had turned against her.  Her home was inundated, sweeping away her kitchen utensils. And just when the floodwater had receded, pests invaded her maize field, destroying her entire crop.  But VisionFund’s lending program allowed her to get her life back on track. “I have been able to set up a business selling maize with the loan,” said the 45-year-old. Shy Banks Charity Mati, an officer in charge of business development at VisionFund Kenya, said some 3,700 people in Narok have benefited since the program was launched in February 2016. It also operates in Eldoret and Kabarnet. The fund is unique in that it helps Kenyans hit by extreme weather who commercial banks would not touch as customers. In the 15 years she has worked in microfinance, Mati has never come across a bank that assists farmers and traders hit by disasters. “The quickest thing these financial institutions do when there is a disaster is to run away,” she said.  Maurice Opiyo, managing director at Kenyan investment bank NIC Capital, said the reluctance to lend to small businesses has worsened due to the government’s interest rate cap. The Banking (Amendment) Act 2016 set the maximum lending rate at four percentage points above the central bank rate. “Banks are shy to give loans because the profit margin they used to get has reduced,” he said. “They prefer to buy government securities to remain operational.”  But lending for recovery after a disaster is essential because it allows survivors to build their resilience against weather extremes, said Diana Gichaga, managing partner at Private Equity Support. Credit should be offered, along with insurance, to protect farmers and traders against future crises, she said. “The cash model serves the immediate needs of the affected, while insurance is a long-term intervention,” she added.  Philip Ochola, chief executive officer at VisionFund Kenya, said it offers loans to businesses, including agricultural enterprises, and individual loans for co-operative members. It also provides loans that contribute to children’s well-being after a disaster, such as paying school fees. “Aid of this nature is good because it has helped me stabilize my life and motivated me to work,” said 36-year-old Kateti Kirima, whose livestock were killed and crops destroyed by the 2015 floods in Olopito village in Narok County. She used some of her loan to buy more livestock and fatten them up. She then sold some of the animals as the rains were followed by drought towards the end of 2016, making it hard to sustain a large herd. Uk Aid Finance  In late 2015, Britain's Department for International Development agreed to provide up to £2 million ($2.6 million) in the form of an innovative returnable grant to finance VisionFund's El Niño lending program in Kenya, Malawi and Zambia.  VisionFund Kenya received 119 million shillings ($1.15 million), and used the money to provide families hit by floods and drought with small loans for a period of up to a year.  As of late June, only 12 million shillings had yet to be returned by the Kenyan recipients, after farmers reaped good harvests thanks to the rains, World Vision said.  VisionFund paid back to the UK government the full amount of the grant at the end of May, it said. The fund is planning to expand to other regions of Kenya experiencing climate change pressures once it can find new zero-interest finance.

In keeping with tradition, cities across the country will launch fireworks after dark, perhaps the most emblematic way to commemorate July 4, 1776, when the American colonies' Declaration of Independence from Britain was adopted. The document enshrines the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which in many U.S. cities today involves competitions over how many hot dogs and hamburgers people can stuff down their throats in rapid succession. In Washington, a hamburger restaurant challenges competitors to consume as many sandwiches as possible in 10 minutes, while in New York City, a seaside establishment stages a tournament that tests some of the world's most formidable consumers of frankfurters. Americans are expected to flock to beaches, especially in the West where the weather is hot and dry, while the eastern part of the country may see scattered thunderstorms. In New Jersey, a budget battle halted nonessential services, forcing state beaches and parks to close, but lawmakers on Monday night ended the three-day-old state government shutdown. On Sunday, while state beaches were still closed, however, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie managed to visit Island Beach State Park, prompting outrage. Maine residents are facing a partial government shutdown as well, but its state parks remain open. They are two of nine states to miss deadlines for passing a budget. An informal peace and love celebration will mark the holiday in Oregon's Malheur National Forest. The annual Rainbow Family Gathering had drawn nearly 12,000 people by Monday, and thousands more were expected for July Fourth, said Ryan Nehl, a forest administrator. Professing to have no leaders and no organization, the families mark Independence Day with  care-taking of mother earth, nonviolence and living a compassionate and loving life,  according to one blog associated with the event. Forest rangers are concerned they will be outnumbered.  We don't want any of the groups to potentially surround any of the officers on site,  Nehl said. U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend a picnic for military families on the South Lawn of the White House and later view an 18-minute fireworks display. City officials expect almost 700,000 visitors for a range of events in the U.S. capital.

The notes are rated at the same level as Shimao's senior unsecured rating as they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 21 June 2017. Shimao's ratings are supported by its focus on maintaining high margins from its high quality and well-located land bank rather than building contracted sales. Its contracted sales have been stable at around CNY67 billion each year for the last four years, while its cash collection of contracted sales was a healthy 80%-88%. The homebuilder maintained an EBITDA margin of 26%-27% in 2015-2016, which is comparable with other 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers. Fitch expects Shimao's cash flow from operations (CFO) to remain neutral to positive in the next year or two, after achieving positive CFO of CNY2.2 billion in 2015, including capex on property construction. The ratings are also supported by the homebuilder's strong execution record and leadership in key regions. KEY RATING DRIVERS Well-Positioned in Lower-Tier Cities: Shimao is well-positioned to capture market growth in weaker tier 2 and stronger tier 3 and 4 cities and has increased its 2017 target for the share of contracted sales from these cities to 40% of total contracted sales, from a Fitch estimate of 23%-25% in 2016. We expect stronger growth from these cities in 2017 due to limited supply and strict policies to rein in property price increases in tier 1 cities. High-Quality Inventory: Shimao re-established its focus on higher-tier cities in 2014, when the average land cost was around CNY3,000-4,000 per square metre (sq m). Fitch expects average selling prices for these projects to be as high as CNY14,000/sq m subject to location, allowing Shimao to maintain its margin-focused business model for the next year or two. Tighter Operational Control: Fitch believes Shimao's efforts to improve its sales efficiency, cash flow cycle, operations and financing costs have created a sound base to maintain its stable business profile for the next year or two. Shimao improved its sell-through rate for new supply to 74% in 2017, from 60% in 2014, and its cash collection rate increased to 88%, from 80%. Selling, general and administrative expenses also improved to around 7% of recognised revenue, from over 8% historically, and Shimao reported that its finance costs decreased to around 5.8% at end-2016, from 6.9% at end-2015. The homebuilder has also moved with the market towards upgrader and larger units and expects these products to make up 72% of its 2017 saleable resources, from 66% in 2014 and 2013. It continued to clear inventory in more remote lower-tier cities that have not benefited from growth in upper-tier cities and increased the proportion of products targeting buyers in tier 1 and 2 cities. Expansion into Hotel and Investment Properties: Shimao forecasts annual hotel income growth of 20% to CNY4 billion by 2021 and an expansion of its commercial investment properties to more than 2 million sq m gross floor area (GFA), with rental income of CNY3 billion. Fitch estimates that Shimao has a GFA of more than 1 million sq m in commercial and office building resources in its pipeline to support its five-year plan. We do not expect the homebuilder's expansion into hotels and investment properties to affect its property development business, as its CFO is close to neutral and it has significantly improved its homebuilding operations. Shimao's hotel and rental segment had revenue of CNY3 billion and an EBITDA margin of around 65%-70% in 2016. Fitch will monitor the development of Shimao's investment-property operation and may consider positive rating action if Shimao's investment-property business stabilises at a larger scale that generates substantially higher recurring income. Healthy Financial Profile: Fitch expects Shimao to maintain its EBITDA margin at above 25% and its leverage below 30%-32% for the next two years, although this may narrow thereafter as sector competition intensifies. Shimao has a well-located land bank and products in higher-tier cities that will support wider margins than those of peers. DERIVATION SUMMARY Shimao has elevated itself to a margin-focused homebuilder by moving away from a contracted sales model. It is well-positioned among peers. Its contracted sales of around CNY68 billion a year are comparable with peers rated 'BBB-' to 'BB+' and its EBITDA margin of 26%-27% in 2015-2016 are comparable with 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers, such as China Overseas Land & Investment Limited (A-/Stable) and China Resources Land Ltd (BBB+/Stable). Shimao's leverage of around 30%-32% is comparable with that of Longfor Properties Co. Ltd. (BBB-/Stable). No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect Shimao's rating. Operating environment risks make it difficult for companies in this sector to be rated above 'BBB+'. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: - Contracted sales by GFA to increase by 7%-8% over 2017-2018. - Average selling prices for contracted sales to increase by 5% in 2017-2018. - An EBITDA margin of around 25%-27% in 2017-2018. - Land premium of CNY40 billion in 2017-2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: -sustained strong positive cash flow from operations (CFO); -stronger position in metropolitan cities in northern and southern China without significant deterioration in its financial profile; -net debt/adjusted inventory sustained below 25% (2016: 32%, 2015: 31%); and -investment property operations stabilising at a larger scale and generating substantially higher recurring income. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: - negative CFO for a prolonged period; - net debt/adjusted inventory at above 35% for a prolonged period; - an EBITDA margin below 22% for a prolonged period (2016: 27%. 2015: 27%); and - contracted sales/total debt at below 1.0x for a prolonged period (2016: 1.0x, 2015: 0.9x). LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Shimao had CNY22.2 billion in cash, of which CNY2.9 billion was restricted, and CNY22 billion in unused bank credit facilities as of end-2016. This easily covers its short-term borrowings of CNY17.8 billion. Diversified Funding Channels: Shimao has many financing options, including equity issuance, perpetual capital securities, offshore notes, onshore debentures and bank borrowings. Its weighted-average borrowing cost was 5.8% in 2016.

Under the scheme, the city government will gradually limit motorcycles in certain areas, the committee said in a statement on its website. But there is concern over the feasibility of the plan. Motorcycle riders say it would be impossible to ban people from a mode of transport they have grown up with, especially given the city's poor public transport. Vietnam's rapid economic growth has seen household incomes quadruple since the turn of the century. One in every two of its 90 million people own a motorcycle, and car sales rose 30 percent in 2016.

The United States halted imports of fresh Brazilian beef last month after a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers have blamed on vaccinations against foot and mouth disease. Brazil is the top supplier of imported beef and chicken to China. The Brazilian agriculture ministry said last week that the problems found in its beef exports to the U.S. were  only reactions of the animals when getting vaccines  and did not pose any food safety risks, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection Quarantine (AQSIQ) said in a statement sent to Reuters. China destroyed or returned over 350 tonnes of Brazilian meat in May, including chicken feet, chicken legs and beef, according to a list published on AQSIQ's website on Monday. Some did not pass inspection and quarantine, and others did not have proper labeling. China will take necessary steps if it finds food safety issues in meat imports from Brazil and notify the public in a timely manner, AQSIQ said. China only allows imports of frozen boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months old from Brazil, while the U.S. had allowed more types of Brazilian beef to enter its market, the agency said. China briefly suspended imports of all meat products from Brazil in March after police accused inspectors of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats in March. It soon lifted the sanctions after Brazilian authorities clarified details of the police investigation.  Since then, AQSIQ said it has found mislabeling in some Brazilian meat imports and others with health certificates that did not comply with China's requirements.

Carmakers are watching with concern the falling market share of Euro-6 diesel vehicles and the rising share of fuel-powered vehicles which emit higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, said VDA which represents suppliers and carmakers including Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW . With German national elections less than three months away, the country's auto industry is expected to contribute towards a plan to cut pollution from diesel engines to help improve air quality and restore trust that was pared down by VW's 2015 emissions scandal.

Days of heavy rainfall have pushed water levels in more than 60 rivers in southern China above warning levels. Floods have damaged crops, forced hundreds of thousands from their homes and killed at least 33, while the north has wilted in a heat wave and drought-like conditions. The Three Gorges dam is the world's biggest power station by far, with an installed generation capacity of 22,500 megawatts (MW), equivalent to about 20 coal-fired stations. The two power stations in Hubei province have stopped 26 generators, due to flood pressure in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Asia's longest river, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Three Gorges Corp [CYTGP.UL], the world's largest hydroelectric power producer. Hydropower is China's second largest electricity source after coal. The shutdowns have cut capacity by 13.52 gigawatts (GW) to just 7.5 GW. The Three Gorges plant has reduced capacity to 6 GW from 18.12 GW, while Gezhouba, some 38 kms (23 miles) away, has halved capacity to 1.5 GW from 2.9 GW.     Phone calls to Three Gorges were unanswered. Hydropower schemes can shut during times of high rainfall to prevent flooding downstream or to protect their turbines. Such measures are frequent during the rainy season in China's south, but Li Rong, power analyst with consultancy SIA Energy, said the size of the current shutdown was unprecedented. He estimated it at 200 GW hours of daily electricity output, about 40 percent of demand in Shanghai, China's most populated city, during the summer peak season. While the heavy rainfall has led to short-term power shutdowns, it is also helping to replenish reservoir levels in the country's south, which had been falling in recent months, hurting output of hydro power. Most of the nation's hydro power plants are located in the southern provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou. Any prolonged closure of the generators will renew concerns about higher demand for coal to fuel the nation's thousands of thermal power plants as a weeks-long heatwave scorches the north. Traders said that it would take at least a dozen large fossil fuel or nuclear power stations to make up for the hydro restrictions. In recent weeks, Beijing has urged coal mines to ramp up output to ensure electricity supplies during peak hours as a prolonged bout of hot weather across the north has boosted demand for air conditioning. On Tuesday, coal for export from Australia's Newcastle terminal hit their highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand.

The United States halted imports of fresh Brazilian beef last month after a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers have blamed on vaccinations against foot and mouth disease. Brazil is the top supplier of imported beef and chicken to China. The Brazilian agriculture ministry said last week that the problems found in its beef exports to the U.S. were  only reactions of the animals when getting vaccines  and did not pose any food safety risks, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection Quarantine (AQSIQ) said in a statement sent to Reuters. China destroyed or returned over 350 tonnes of Brazilian meat in May, including chicken feet, chicken legs and beef, according to a list published on AQSIQ's website on Monday. Some did not pass inspection and quarantine, and others did not have proper labeling. China will take necessary steps if it finds food safety issues in meat imports from Brazil and notify the public in a timely manner, AQSIQ said. China only allows imports of frozen boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months old from Brazil, while the U.S. had allowed more types of Brazilian beef to enter its market, the agency said. China briefly suspended imports of all meat products from Brazil in March after police accused inspectors of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats in March. It soon lifted the sanctions after Brazilian authorities clarified details of the police investigation.  Since then, AQSIQ said it has found mislabeling in some Brazilian meat imports and others with health certificates that did not comply with China's requirements.

Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said. The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers. Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.  The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said. It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.  The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,  he said. The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said.

Abe surged back to power in 2012, pledging to revive the stale economy and bolster defense. He has led his ruling bloc to three more landslide victories in national polls since then. But those victories were less robust than met the eye, since record or near-record low voter turnout allowed Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to rack up seats with support from a quarter or less of eligible voters.  On Sunday, the party got a chilling glimpse of just how vulnerable it could be if a viable opposition force emerges to attract unhappy voters. That reminder could encourage rivals in Abe's own party to challenge him in a leadership race next year if his slumping poll ratings fail to recover. Popular Governor Yuriko Koike's novice Tokyo Citizens First party and its allies - including the LDP's national-level coalition partner - won a landslide victory, taking 79 seats in Sunday's election for the 127-member Tokyo Metropolitan assembly. The LDP got 23 seats, its worst ever result in the capital and less than half its pre-vote presence. The vote was a referendum on the first year in office of Koike, a media-savvy former LDP lawmaker and defense minister who defied the party's old boy network to run on a reformist platform and become the first female governor of the metropolis.   But it was also a stinging rebuke to Abe's administration, battered by suspicions of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business and verbal gaffes by his cabinet ministers. Worse than the scandals and missteps, however, was the perception among many voters that Abe and his powerful Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga have grown haughty and dismissive of criticism given the ruling bloc's super-majorities in both houses of parliament, a weak and fragmented opposition and no serious challengers in his party.  Arrogance, complacency, fragility  summed up a headline in the Nikkei business daily on Tuesday, ingredients politicians and pundits agreed were key causes of the LDP defeat.  It doesn't have anything to do with policy,  said Gerry Curtis, professor emeritus at New York's Columbia University.  It's all about the arrogance of Abe and Suga and the sense that they are riding roughshod ... to break unstated rules of the game.   Reflecting Deeply  Abe heads to Hamburg on Wednesday for a Group of 20 summit where leaders are likely to discuss North Korea's nuclear and missile programs - a topic that could play to Abe's strengths at home, where he is known for his tough line towards Pyongyang. North Korea said on Tuesday it had successfully test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that could strike anywhere in the world. In an interview with the Mainichi newspaper published on Tuesday, Abe said he would  reflect deeply  on the Tokyo poll results. But he also said there would be no change to his plan to have the LDP present a proposal to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution to an extra session of parliament in the autumn to meet his target of amending the U.S.-drafted charter by 2020. Trying to stick to that timetable for what would be a deeply divisive amendment, however, could be risky, since even many who support the change don't see it as an urgent priority. Abe's conservative agenda of restoring traditional values and loosening constraints on the military centers on revising the constitution. But the public are deeply split on the proposal, which would antagonize China and South Korea.  New Party? The huge win for Koike's novice party has fanned speculation that her group will go national in a general election that must be held by late 2018, perhaps joining with disaffected lawmakers from the struggling opposition Democratic Party. The Democrats, who have had little success in repairing  their image after a rocky three-year reign ended in 2012, also fared badly in the Tokyo poll, taking only five seats. A new party could set up Koike for a run at the nation's top job, but her allies have said she's unlikely to quit as governor to return to parliament before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In the meantime, with much of Abe's previous clout over his party based on his record of leading it to election wins, the dismal Tokyo showing could well encourage rivals to challenge his bid for a third term as LDP leader from September 2018. Victory in that party poll would put Abe on track to become Japan's longest-serving leader, eclipsing early 20th Century premier Taro Katsura who logged nearly eight years in power. Among those floated as possible challengers are former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishida, who has been focusing on ways to revitalize Japan's depopulated rural regions, and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, considered more dovish than Abe.  As politicians realize that Abe is vulnerable, that will inspire them to do something,  Curtis said.  He'll probably survive, but even so, I don't think he will get much done in terms of policy.

The higher capital buffers should help to support credit growth and provide resilience against potential pressures on asset quality. The sector's capital adequacy ratio increased to 20% at end-1Q17 from 16.2% at end-2015  as lenders reacted to the introduction of a new capital floor on 1 January. (The minimum required ratio remains unchanged at 12%.) The capital floor was raised to AMD30 billion (about USD60 million) from AMD5 billion. This mostly affected small and mid-sized banks, triggering some mergers and acquisitions. The number of commercial banks operating in Armenia fell to 17 at end-1Q17 from 21 at end-2015 and we expect more consolidation, given modest returns on equity. The sector's net interest margin hit a record low of 4.3% in 2016, pressured by intense competition and limited credit growth. An improvement in profitability will largely depend on asset quality trends and banks' ability to grow. Credit growth picked up in 2016, reaching 15% compared to a 4% contraction in 2015. However, this was fuelled by two banks that expanded rapidly through cash-backed transactions, particularly in 4Q16. We expect new lending will be moderate in 2017, with credit demand yet to recover in line with macroeconomic trends. The economy recovered strongly in 1Q17 and Fitch projects 3.4% GDP growth in 2017. Growth could accelerate further in 2018-19 but medium-term growth will depend on progress in improving the investment climate, as total investment is low at 18.4% of GDP. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to gross loans improved to 6.8% at end-1Q17 from 9.7% at end-3Q16, reflecting the rapid lending growth in 4Q16 and balance sheet clean-ups prior to M&A; deals. But loan impairment charges still amounted to a sizeable 68% of pre-impairment profits in 1Q17. Unreserved NPLs were a moderate 17% of capital at end-2016. We believe asset quality trends will be driven by the performance of the economy. Dollarisation has reduced, driven by the stabilisation of the exchange rate and helped by regulatory measures. But foreign-currency lending is still high (62% of total lending at end-1Q17), posing significant risks to asset quality metrics given the low proportion of naturally hedged borrowers. Foreign-currency lending is lower (36%) in the retail segment as most consumer finance loans are issued in local currency. Sector liquidity is good, partly due to high obligatory reserve requirements. At end-April 2017, the system's liquidity cushion covered 165% of demand deposits. The funding structure is broadly stable, with customer deposits accounting for about half of the sector's liabilities at end-1Q17. Most of these are retail deposits, which have proven to be relatively stable through the credit cycle. We rate three banks in Armenia: Ameriabank, Ardshinbank and ACBA-Credit Agricole, all at 'B+'/Stable. The ratings reflect the banks' solid domestic franchises and adequate financial profiles, but also the high dollarisation rates on both sides of their balance sheets, and exposure to the Armenian operating environment. The banks could be downgraded if there is a marked weakening in asset quality, resulting in lower earnings and capital pressures, without sufficient support being provided by shareholders. Improvements in the economy and the banks' financial metrics would be positive for their credit profiles. But upgrades are unlikely without an upgrade of the sovereign. We affirmed Armenia's 'B+'/Stable sovereign rating on 30 June.

Idemitsu management has been keen to merge its operations with the smaller Japanese refiner as shrinking gasoline demand in the country pushes the industry to consolidate, but has been locked in a battle with the Idemitsu founding family for more than a year over the move. Acting quickly with a share issue plan last year would have come across as a blatant move to dilute the founding family's stake of more than third and drawn the ire of the Tokyo stock exchange and other authorities. Idemitsu on Monday said the share issue would raise funds to repay loans for a 31.3 percent stake already bought in Showa Shell as well as to develop overseas operations. It has denied it is trying to dilute the founding family's holding. Although the founding family, which says the two firms' cultures will not mesh, quickly said it would seek a court injunction, investors rushed to bet on the success of the plan. Showa Shell's shares jumped 7 percent while Idemitsu's stock tumbled 11 percent on the forthcoming dilution. Lawyers representing the family said after the market closed that an injunction had been lodged with a court in Tokyo.  This capital increase will lower the stake held by the founding family and make the proposed merger with Showa Shell Sekiyu more realistic,  Nomura analyst Shigeki Matsumoto said in a note to clients. Idemitsu said it would sell 48 million new shares, equivalent to 30 percent of its outstanding shares. If the family did not take part in the fundraising, its stake in Idemitsu would be reduced to about 26 percent, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters, eliminating its ability to veto the merger.   Obviously the family could participate in the global offering, but the time frame is narrow to come up with such a large amount of cash, in our view,  said Thanh Ha Pham, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo.  This is a positive for Showa Shell (as) Idemitsu will eventually decide to fully take over Showa Shell's minorities and merge the two companies,  said Pham. Overcoming opposition from the founding family, last week, Idemitsu's CEO Takashi Tsukioka, who has been pushing for a full merger, was re-elected to the company's board at an annual shareholders' meeting.  If the deal goes through, it would be the second in the domestic refining sector after JX Holdings Inc (5020.T) bought TonenGeneral Sekiyu.

Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said. The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers. Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.  The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said. It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.  The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,  he said. The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said. Shares in Angle, which has a market cap of about 50 million pounds, rose 2.2 percent to 68 pence.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent by 0820 GMT, in line with a dip in Euro zone stocks and blue-chips. Britain's FTSE was also 0.2 percent lower. On Monday, European shares had their strongest day since 24 April, when Emmanuel Macron won the first round of France's presidential election. But tech stocks weighed on markets on Tuesday, after a seeming glitch caused some big name Nasdaq stocks to appear as if their prices had been slashed. The closure of the U.S. market for the 4 July national holiday also meant volumes were lower than usual.  Today is a consolidation day after gains yesterday, as we don't have a U.S. market,  said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor Capital. Dealmaking was back with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. Payments company Worldpay shares soared 21 percent to a record high after it said it was approached for acquisition by Vantiv and JPMorgan. This came after Danish rival Nets said on Monday it had received offers. Nets and another German rival Wirecard rose more than 4 percent.  This is one of the most intriguing sub-sectors in the financials space,  said Meda.  There are a lot of companies still, and we are probably going to have only one or two big leaders in the payments space.  EDP was a top gainer, up 3.2 percent after Spain's Gas Natural approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalisation.  There's been no major cross-border activity for the last five to six years, so this is one of the sectors where we expect some to happen,  said Meda. Gas Natural shares, meanwhile, fell 0.6 percent. Shares in French rival EDF also dropped 3.8 percent after HSBC downgraded the stock to  reduce . Clariant shares gained 3.9 percent after two activist investors upped their stake in the Swiss chemicals firm in opposition to a planned merger with U.S. firm Huntsman . Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely.

Idemitsu management has been keen to merge its operations with the smaller Japanese refiner as shrinking gasoline demand in the country pushes the industry to consolidate, but has been locked in a battle with the Idemitsu founding family for more than a year over the move. Acting quickly with a share issue plan last year would have come across as a blatant move to dilute the founding family's stake of more than third and drawn the ire of the Tokyo stock exchange and other authorities. Idemitsu on Monday said the share issue would raise funds to repay loans for a 31.3 percent stake already bought in Showa Shell as well as to develop overseas operations. It has denied it is trying to dilute the founding family's holding. Although the founding family, which says the two firms' cultures will not mesh, quickly said it would seek a court injunction, investors rushed to bet on the success of the plan. Showa Shell's shares jumped 7 percent while Idemitsu's stock tumbled 11 percent on the forthcoming dilution. Lawyers representing the family said after the market closed that an injunction had been lodged with a court in Tokyo.  This capital increase will lower the stake held by the founding family and make the proposed merger with Showa Shell Sekiyu more realistic,  Nomura analyst Shigeki Matsumoto said in a note to clients. Idemitsu said it would sell 48 million new shares, equivalent to 30 percent of its outstanding shares. If the family did not take part in the fundraising, its stake in Idemitsu would be reduced to about 26 percent, according to calculations by Thomson Reuters, eliminating its ability to veto the merger.   Obviously the family could participate in the global offering, but the time frame is narrow to come up with such a large amount of cash, in our view,  said Thanh Ha Pham, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo.  This is a positive for Showa Shell (as) Idemitsu will eventually decide to fully take over Showa Shell's minorities and merge the two companies,  said Pham. Overcoming opposition from the founding family, last week, Idemitsu's CEO Takashi Tsukioka, who has been pushing for a full merger, was re-elected to the company's board at an annual shareholders' meeting.  If the deal goes through, it would be the second in the domestic refining sector after JX Holdings Inc (5020.T) bought TonenGeneral Sekiyu.

MSCI's emerging equity benchmark fell 0.7 percent - its sharpest one-day drop in nearly three weeks - after losses among Asian heavyweights Taiwan and South Korea as the North Korean missile landed in Japanese waters. Stocks in Hong Kong fell 1.5 percent, their steepest daily fall in more than half a year, while Chinese mainland equities turned tail after a rally following their inclusion in a key MSCI index continued to unwind. Bourses in South Africa, Poland and Romania all chalked up losses. Currencies were mixed as oil and copper trended lower, counteracting the effect of a tepid dollar . Major central banks turning more hawkish and higher core bond yields are also weighing, said Kiran Kowshik, EM FX strategy, UniCredit.  The bigger-picture driver for these movements you are seeing in emerging market currencies at least over the past two weeks, are signs of a more hawkish turn from central banks – including the ECB, Fed and the Bank of England,  Kowshik said.  At the same time, when oil prices fall you tend to see inflation expectations fall as well – those two things together - nominal bond yields moving up and inflation expectations moving down - take real rates higher,  he said. The South Korean won dropped to a more than 16-week low, while currencies in oil producers Russia and Kazakhstan eased. However, South Africa's rand and Turkey's lira strengthened around 0.2 percent. Investors were watching for further developments in the Gulf, where Qatar faces a Tuesday night deadline to comply with a list of demands by four Arab powers which accuse Doha of supporting terrorism. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have listed 13 demands including ejecting Turkish troops based in Qatar and shutting al Jazeera TV – requests so severe, says Qatar, that they seem designed to be rejected. Qatar assets have suffered in recent weeks, but the stock market continued rebounding from recent lows, gaining 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, profit-taking in a few Saudi blue chips dragged down the region's largest stock market by 1.3 percent.

There is a chance the buildings will be hit again,  he told Reuters.  But in the short term people should be able to take refuge in their homes.  Abu Salem heads a group of 12 construction workers who rebuild and patch up buildings damaged by barrel bombs, air strikes and shelling in and around Syria's Deraa city. With no access to modern tools, and materials made expensive by the war, Abu Salem's men break up buildings, mix concrete and carry loads by hand. Despite the difficulties, they have kept their sense of humor.   Three months ago a video circulated widely on Syrian social media showing masked men kneeling in formation, brandishing staffs and rising to shouts of  God is Great . At first glance it looks like a typical example of the  belligerent propaganda footage often posted by armed groups in the Syrian conflict. But it isn't what it seems.   In the name of God, I am Abu Salem al-Muhameed and I announce the formation of a Concrete Pouring Brigade in the free areas!  Salem shouts into the camera in an unmistakable parody of fired-up rebel leaders fighting President Bashar al-Assad.   If you destroy, by God we will rebuild!  he cries as his men wave pickaxes and shovels and then descend into laughter.  After the You Destroy and We Rebuild Brigade's video appeared, people began stopping Abu Salem in the street.   They said: you are the best brigade formed since the start of the Syrian crisis,  he told Reuters by phone.  War Economy Members of  You Destroy and We Rebuild Brigade  pose at a construction site, in front of their banner depicting a still from their parody video that circulated on Syrian social media, in the rebel-held town of Saida, in Deraa province, Syria May 24, 2017.Alaa Al-FaqirSyria's war has destroyed the national economy and fractured the country into a patchwork of areas of control which bisect trading routes, raising prices and causing local shortages of vital commodities.  But money can sometimes talk louder than political loyalty, and across Syria goods still find their way across front lines, with heavy bribes and taxes paid at checkpoints. Abu Salem lives in a rebel-held area but sources his building materials from government-controlled zones. Slideshow (5 Images)Cement secured from Damascus may cost about 30,000 Syrian pounds a ton at source, he said, but arrives in Deraa at a price of 50,000 to 55,000 pounds after passing through all the checkpoints.   By the time they get to us the price has become 50, 60 or sometimes 100 percent more than their real price,  said Abu Salem, a 39-year-old father of five who was a builder before the war.  Abu Salem is passionate about his mission to reverse the destruction, but laments he can't do as good a job as he'd like.  There are no engineers, modern construction techniques or cement mixers. He and his colleagues reuse rubble and steel from destroyed buildings and do everything by hand.  The quality of building has changed significantly ... If there was equipment we would be able to build faster and better. But these are war conditions,  said Abu Salem, who has had to vacate and repair his own house because of air attacks. Brigade members are paid in accordance with what customers can afford, averaging the equivalent of a mere four or five U.S. dollars a day.  It's always just (enough for) food and water. There are no savings because of the high prices,  Abu Salem said. Abu Salem said he and his men stood ready to help whichever parties eventually agree to rebuild Syria.  But if someone comes with a rocket or a weapon and says 'fight', I won't,  he said. Editing by Andrew Roche","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-builders-idUSKBN19P0ZI"},

The claim, which is being heard in Australia's Federal Court, said patients had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse since having the mesh surgically implanted. The devices are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Australian action was brought on behalf of more than 700 claimants.   Johnson & Johnson said it was only aware of 200  product events  after selling more than 100,000 pelvic floor repair products in Australia.   It is always a concern to us when a patient doesn't get the outcome they had hoped for, or believes they have experienced an adverse event,  spokeswoman Meshlin Khouri said in a statement.

Johnson & Johnson is one of several manufacturers that sold the devices. Those companies are facing tens of thousands of individual lawsuits from plaintiffs who said they were injured by the mesh's poor design and substandard materials. In May, California accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn doctors and patients about the severity and frequency of complications associated with its pelvic mesh devices. An Australian parliamentary committee is also holding an inquiry into the products and is expected to report its findings at the end of November.

The pound, which at the start of the week was trading less than half a cent away from nine-month highs on bets the Bank of England could raise interest rates by the end of the year, dipped to a six-day low of $1.2918 after the data. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey showed activity falling to 54.8 in June, still above the 50 level that denotes growth but down from May's 18-month high of 56.0 and slightly below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The equivalent survey for the manufacturing sector, released on Monday, had shown activity grew much more slowly than forecast in June. But MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman said these surveys should be taken  with a pinch of salt , as they reflected political uncertainty last month, when the ruling Conservative party unexpectedly lost its majority in parliamentary elections.  We had heightened political uncertainty last month, and that could have weighed on business confidence,  he said.  That's potentially why the data is coming in weaker than expected, but I suppose one of the key tests going forward will be whether that loss of confidence will be sustained.  The BoE is pondering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, and is watching for signs that other areas of growth can offset a consumer spending slowdown, caused by a rise in inflation and a slowing in pay growth. One of the BoE's interest rate-setters, Gertjan Vlieghe, said late on Monday he favoured keeping borrowing costs at their historic lows, despite a shift among some of his peers at the central bank in favour of a first hike in a decade. But that seemed to have no impact on sterling, which recorded its best week in eight months last week after BoE Governor Mark Carney said a rate rise was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months.  The BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited. This means downside room for sterling is also more limited,  wrote Nomura strategists in a morning note to clients.  We expect the market to price a higher possibility of a BoE hike in August, supporting sterling. These expectations could be disappointed, but we should not underestimate the medium-term impact of the change in the BoE's policy stance.  Against the euro, sterling edged down 0.1 percent to 87.83 pence. Editing by Andrew Heavens","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-sterling-update-idUSL8N1JV1BA"},

Christie ended the three-day shutdown by signing a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. Christie said all state parks and beaches would be open on Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday. He said he was happy a resolution had been reached on the budget impasse, but saddened it came three days late.  This bill is a long overdue significant reform that will have a lasting impact on New Jersey residents,  he said before signing it into law. New Jersey State Senate President Steve Sweeney told a news conference:  None of this was easy.  Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said the agreement to end the partial government shutdown was reached after long talks in  crisis  mode on Monday with Horizon and state legislators. Christie was ridiculed after a newspaper captured photos of the Republican governor and his family sunbathing on a beach that had been closed to the public over the holiday weekend due to the budget standoff. New Jersey's state parks closed on Saturday, forcing many to alter their holiday weekend plans. More than 30,000 state workers were on furlough on Monday. In Maine, the state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue all planned to work through the shutdown, the state's first since 1991. But the majority of its 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. Members of Maine's State Employees Association rallied outside the State House to demand a budget deal from lawmakers and Republican Governor Paul LePage. About 10 U.S. states still do not have budgets for the fiscal year that began on July 1, including Illinois, which is in its third year without an enacted budget. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. In some states without full budgets, including Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.

The programmes should further ease pressure on the currency peg of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) zone to the euro, although this will also depend on oil prices and on developments elsewhere in the CEMAC zone, including in the Republic of Congo (CCC), which is also in negotiations with the IMF. Increased IMF involvement in the CEMAC monetary zone is in line with our expectations, and bolsters our assumption that the probability of a devaluation of the Central African CFA franc exchange rate against the euro in response to the fall in commodity prices since 2014 remains very low. The IMF's Executive Board approved a USD666 million three-year Extended Credit Facility programme for Cameroon on 26 June, having approved a USD642 million three-year Extended Fund Facility programme for Gabon a week earlier. The IMF initiated country-by-country discussions on potential programmes with all three Fitch-rated members of the CEMAC zone (Cameroon, Gabon and the Republic of Congo) in 1Q17. Some funds will be made available immediately to Cameroon (USD171 million) and Gabon (USD99 million), reducing the near-term risks of external financing gaps emerging. Conditionality appears relatively light; this should reduce implementation risk, although it cannot be discounted given the challenging political environment and shortcomings of the public financial management framework in the region. The IMF highlights the need to implement structural reforms in both Cameroon and Gabon to improve the revenue base, rationalise public investment and minimise fiscal risks from contingent liabilities. The main thrust of the programmes is on improving fiscal sustainability at a national level and reducing external imbalances regionally. Their success will therefore  depend on the implementation of supportive policies and reforms by the regional institutions,  as noted by the IMF. There are some signs that this will be forthcoming. Banque des Etats d'Afrique Centrale (BEAC), the regional central bank, has recently taken steps to support the currency peg, raising its refinancing rate 50bp to 2.95% in March. Meanwhile, statutory advances from BEAC to member countries have been frozen at their 2014 ceiling. BEAC also approved plans for an emergency liquidity facility in May that will enable it to act as a lender of last resort for commercial banks, strengthening the monetary policy framework. The more pro-active approach to the challenge of lower commodity prices since last December's meeting of CEMAC heads of state in Yaounde, combined with IMF support, boosts the prospects of reversing the fall in collective reserves. The pace of reserves decline slowed in 1Q17, with international reserves decreasing to USD4.7 billion at end-March, from USD4.8 billion in December 2016 and USD10.1 billion in December 2015. The coverage ratio of official reserves to short-term liabilities fell to 56.8% from 65% in the three months to end-2016, but BEAC forecasts it will recover back to 65% over an unspecified timescale. Fitch-rated CEMAC members' external and fiscal positions should also be supported by recovering oil prices, and in Cameroon's case the start of gas exports. However, stabilising reserves, which are pooled at BEAC, will depend on the ability of all CEMAC members to address their own macroeconomic imbalances. Even if the Republic of Congo fails to agree and implement an IMF programme, rising oil output means that its contribution to reserves should increase, although this remains highly uncertain. Equatorial Guinea (not rated) is also a significant contributor to the regional reserve pool, and its fiscal settings and outturns will be relevant.

Russia has been considering implementing a law requiring telecoms operators to store all user-generated data, such as phone calls and text and video messages, for six months starting from mid-2018. The draft law is part of what the government calls counter-terrorism amendments to bolster state security, but for telecom companies would mean new bureaucratic hurdles and increased spending on new hardware. They have opposed the law, saying it would hurt their profits and they would have to raise tariffs. Vedomosti daily said on Tuesday that parliament may now postpone approval of the law, proposed by lawmaker Irina Yarovaya, well into 2023. The so-called Yarovaya law would require telecom companies to spend as much as a combined $37 billion on additional equipment and data centres, Alfa Bank said in a note. Shares in Russia's largest mobile-phone provider MTS were up 0.4 percent, while shares in the second-biggest telecom company Megafon rose 2.4 percent. Telecom companies outperformed Moscow's benchmark stock index Micex, which was up just 0.1 percent at 1,903.9, and the dollar-traded RTS index, which was up 0.4 percent at 1,013.2. The rouble was relatively steady in light trade as the U.S. market was closed for Independence Day, trading at 59.2 against the dollar and at 67.2 against the euro. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.4 percent at $49.45 a barrel, limiting the rouble's upside. The rouble is likely to continue gradually weakening amid dividend payments by Russian companies that foreign investors usually convert into dollars, analysts at ING Bank said in a note. The market is also waiting for an expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit in Germany on July 7-8.

Korea missile that landed in Japan's waters spooks markets * S. Korea won drops, safe-haven yen strengthens * Oil ends run of gains on US supply drop as traders take profits * Risk aversion, dollar moderation boosts gold By Marc Jones LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - World shares, oil and bond yields all pulled back after bright  starts to the second half of the year on Tuesday, as a long-range missile test by North Korea and July 4 holidays for U.S. markets restricted risk appetite. Asian shares had fallen and South Korea's won had hit a 16-week low after the North's missile landed in Japanese waters, while Europe was in the red as the first fall in oil prices in nine days also pushed down commodity stocks. Traditional safety plays were working well. The Japanese yen and gold were both higher, as were European bonds helped also as Sweden's central bank sounded reassuringly cautious as it hinted at the end of its easing programme. That took the wind out of the Swedish crown that had been the best performing global currency over the last week. The Australian dollar also took a tumble as its central bank steered clear of rate hike talk at its latest meeting. Credit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri said the Swedish Riksbank's move showed how wary central banks remained about their currencies, while the day's other main focus was North Korea's posturing.  North Korea is continuing to provoke,  he said. Although markets were now used to these kind of events he added:  It is a bit more important as it came ahead of the G20 meeting this week.  Leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 96.254 after rising 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since mid May. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent as Korean tensions rose. Japan's Nikkei surrendered earlier gains to drop 0.1 percent. South Korea's KOSPI extended losses to trade 0.6 percent lower, though Hong Kong was hardest hit as it slumped as much as 2 percent at one point. The missile flew 930 kilometres (580 miles) before landing in Japanese water, the South Korean military and Japanese government said. North Korea state media said the missile could hit anywhere in the world. Tokyo strongly protested what it called a clear violation of UN resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles in efforts to stop Pyongyang's arms programme. Commodity markets also saw a shift. Crude futures posted their first session of losses in nine, ending their longest run of gains since February 2012, as traders closed positions ahead of the July 4 U.S. holiday. U.S. crude slipped 0.5 percent to $46.85 a barrel while global benchmark Brent dropped to $49.44 as traders cashed in some of gains from a 3.7 percent leap -- its biggest one-day gain since December 2016 -- on Monday.  We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,  BMI Research said, although it added that  large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year-on-year in 2018 .

Duterte placed the southern island of Mindanao under military rule on May 23, hours after hundreds of pro-Islamic State militants seized control of the predominantly Muslim town of Marawi, which is on the island. Eleven members of the 15-member court bench ruled the president's order valid. Three agreed with it but wanted to limit the area of martial law and one judge opposed it, said court spokesman Theodore Te. He did not elaborate. Six weeks after the imposition of martial law on the island, government forces are still battling the rebels in the town.  Hundreds of people have been killed and alarm has spread across the region about the prospects of Islamic State establishing a Southeast Asian foothold in the troubled south of the predominately Christian Philippines.  With the Supreme Court decision, the whole government now stands together as one against a common enemy,  presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he was hopeful the battle with the militants of the previously little-known Maute group would be over before the 60-day period of martial law ends, as the Philippines' was getting more help from allies.  Philippines army soldiers store seized combat weapons in bags after a news conference, as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group in Marawi city, Philippines July 4, 2017.Jorge SilvaTwo Australian P-3C Orion surveillance planes, manned by joint Australian and Philippine crews, have started flying over Marawi, to pinpoint the locations of the militants, Lorenzana said.  The aircraft will be in the Philippines for two weeks. On Tuesday morning, clouds of smoke hung over the lakeside town as troops fired on militant positions with artillery and machine guns from helicopters.  Slideshow (2 Images)Sporadic explosions were heard later in the day. The army said it had captured another militant stronghold, a century-old college set up by Americans which the rebel leaders, brothers from the Maute family, had attended. An army spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera, said troops had also recovered the body of a militant who was believed to be from Singapore, bringing to 11 the number of foreign fighters killed in the battle. It was not clear why authorities believed the fighter was from Singapore. Herrera only said they had information. More than 400 people, including 337 militants and 85 members of the security forces, have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Forty-four civilians had also been killed, either in  crossfire or executed by the militants, the military said.

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,359.45 points by 0847 GMT, having broken a four-day losing streak in the previous session. Mid caps also declined 0.2 percent. Payments firm Worldpay was the biggest gainer, rocketing 14 percent after confirming an approach for a potential deal. This comes after Danish peer Nets rose in the previous session after confirming that it had received an offer from potential buyers. Tuesday saw banking stocks ease 0.3 percent, following strong gains in the previous session, while oil stocks were also a weak spot as the price of oil fell ahead of the U.S. holiday. Shares in oil majors BP fell 0.5 percent, while lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered were 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent lower. Results helped shares in grocer Sainsbury edge around 1 percent higher, after Britain's second-largest supermarket said sales growth accelerated in its latest quarter, helped by inflation and warm weather. Shares in peer Morrison nudged 0.2 percent higher, while Tesco was up 0.1 percent. The impact of inflation, both on wages and on the cost of food imports, has been a cause for concern for the UK supermarket sector since sterling's drop in the aftermath of the referendum vote to leave the European Union last June.  You've got the dual impact of higher prices which is pushing revenue up. What we don't see today is the effect that has on (Sainsbury's) cost, so it's a bit of a double-edged sword,  George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.  My overall impression is that while things are moving forwards, the headwinds are looking strong as well, so it's just a tough time for the sector.  Outside of the blue chips, small cap stock Imagination Technologies jumped around 8 percent after reporting full year results, saying it returned to profitability. Its shares remain down nearly 40 percent year to date after Apple, its biggest customer, said in April it would stop using Imagination's graphics technology in its new products.

With meticulous strokes of tiny brushes and spoons, Lee, 26, recreates the likes of Vincent van Gogh's  The Starry Night  and Edvard Munch's  The Scream  using thick cream stained with food coloring atop a cup of coffee. The result of the painstaking 15-minute process is a 10,000 won ($8.71) cup of cold coffee that has won Lee thousands of fans at his cafe and online.  One time I drew 'The Starry Night' and it looked so special as the famous painting placed on top of coffee. After that, lots of people ordered that coffee,  Lee said, as he copied the painting off an image on his smartphone.  Customers usually ask me to draw their favorite art works,  he added. Creamarts, what South Korean barista Lee Kang-bin calls his latte arts, are seen at his coffee shop in Seoul, South Korea, June 30, 2017.Kim Hong-JiOn his Instagram profile where he regularly posts images and videos of his so-called  creamart,  Lee says he has never learned to draw. He started brewing coffee at age 17, during his mandatory military service and enjoyed it so much that he bought a coffee machine and opened his first cafe for fellow soldiers in his camp near the border with North Korea. Slideshow (7 Images)Customers at his cafe are delighted with Lee's art, which ranges from intricate paintings to cheeky recreations of Disney cartoon characters like Aladdin and Bambi.  I heard (on TV) that this barista draws these kinds of famous paintings. I think he has very talented hands,  said Kim Su-Kyung, a 24-year-old university student who recently visited Lee's store, named  Cafe C. Through.  South Korea's per capita coffee consumption has nearly doubled since 1990 to 2.3 kg (5 lb) per person, according to the International Coffee Organization - still roughly half the 4.5 kg that Americans consume.

Amid transatlantic tensions over trade, security and climate change, Poland's right-wing, eurosceptic government wants to put the focus firmly on improving business ties between the United States and ex-communist central and eastern Europe. Trump, a wealthy businessman, will attend a gathering of the 'Three Seas' initiative, launched jointly by Poland and Croatia last year, which aims to bolster trade, energy ties and infrastructure along a north-south axis stretching from the Baltic states down to the Balkans. The three seas are the Baltic, the Adriatic and Black Sea. Some European Union officials are skeptical about the project, which they see as an attempt by Poland - at loggerheads with Brussels on a range of issues - to build a leadership role in a region that includes the EU's poorest member states. Trump, who has also clashed with the EU on a range of issues, is expected to promote U.S. natural gas exports in his address to about 10 leaders attending from across a region that is keen to reduce its heavy reliance on Russian energy. Poland, the largest economy in the ex-communist region, received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) last month at its Baltic port of Swinoujscie. Gas The chief executive officer of Poland's state pipeline operator GAZ-System said the Three Seas summit could give a boost to its North-South Gas Corridor project, which aims to diversify gas supplies away from Moscow.  Political support is extremely important for such projects, it helps with their timely delivery,  Tomasz Stepien told Reuters, adding that this could also help Poland tap EU funds if Brussels deems the corridor a priority. The North-South Gas Corridor, expected to be completed in the next two-three years, will help send gas supplied from the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie and also from a planned Baltic pipeline through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to a new LNG terminal in Croatia. Until now the region's main trade routes have tended to run from east to west rather than north to south, partly reflecting Germany's economic dominance - but that is starting to change. PKP Cargo, Poland's largest rail freight firm, has a deal with Croatia's state railway cargo unit HZ Cargo and is planning other link-ups, including with Romanian ports on the Black Sea.  Increasing transport between the ports of the Adriatic, the Baltic and the Black Sea is one of our priorities,  the firm's Chief Executive Officer Maciej Libiszewski said.   I think that this region is also important for Americans who, if they wish so, will certainly be welcomed here.  Libiszewski pointed to the U.S. manufacturer of railcars, Greenbrier, which has a facility in Poland's Swidnica. North-South Highway Poland's ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), has backed the construction of the 'Via Carpatia' highway, which is intended to run some 7,750-kilometres from the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda on the Baltic to the Greek city of Thessaloniki on the Aegean, passing through most countries of the region along the way.  The aim ... is to build a communication backbone that will enable an effective and reliable flow of people and goods,  Szymon Huptys, the spokesman for Poland's Infrastructure and Construction Ministry, said. Many fewer people live along the north-south axis than along the region's east-west trade routes. This may create a challenge in convincing investors that any infrastructure project makes sense.  Asked if the Three Seas initiative could gain traction, one western European diplomat said:  We have our doubts.  But the Poles remain undaunted by the challenges, and insist the Three Seas project will help complement moves among older EU member states in western Europe toward greater integration.  The Three Seas initiative is not an alternative to European integration processes, but is complementary to them and contributes to the renewal of the European project,  Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told Reuters.

After the market's rapid gain in the first half,  investors are suffering from a bit of acrophobia,  said Charles Wang, founder of Shenzhen-based fund house Academia Capital Management.  It's natural for the market to see increasing volatility ahead.  The Hang Seng index fell 1.5 percent, to 25,389.01, representing the biggest one-day percentage fall since Dec. 15. The China Enterprises Index lost 1.0 percent, to 10,305.98 points. Hang Seng's upward momentum already appears to be losing steam, with the gauge fluctuating within a narrow range over the past month, after jumping 17 percent in January-May. Tencent, the market's bellwether, tumbled over 4 percent, its biggest loss in over six months. Fund manager Wang attributed Tencent's slump to recent negative comments around its popular one-line game products, as well as valuation concerns after its price surge. Despite Tuesday's slump, the stock is still up 42 percent this year.

The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.8 from May's 18-month high of 56.0, slightly below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for 55.0.  Survey respondents commented on renewed caution among clients, in response to heightened political and economic uncertainty,  said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI. The Bank of England is pondering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade and is watching for signs that other areas of growth can offset a consumer spending slowdown, caused by a rise in inflation and a slowing in pay growth. On Monday, a PMI survey for the manufacturing sector came in weaker than economists' forecasts. Factory exports increased at the slowest rate in five months. A closely watched survey of Britain's giant services industry is due to be published on Wednesday. Tuesday's construction PMI showed optimism in the sector about business over the next year slipped to a four-month low. Cost pressures for goods bought by construction firms picked up again in June after receding in the previous three months. Consumer price inflation in Britain is running at 2.9 percent, an almost four-year high. Growth in the housebuilding, commercial and civil engineering sectors slowed from May but the PMI still signalled a solid pace of expansion overall.

However, despite a slowdown in issuance since then, the USD30 billion Basel III AT1 and T2 CoCos issued in 2017 to date were up slightly compared with the previous year. Volumes of USD15.9 billion in 2Q17 were underpinned by large UK, Spanish and Italian bank issuances in EMEA and by Indian banks in APAC. The decision to put Banco Popular Espanol S.A. into resolution due to acute liquidity problems in early June resulted in the full write-down of the bank's outstanding EUR1.25 billion high trigger and low-trigger AT1 instruments, the first application of these instruments' loss absorbing mechanism. Bremer Landesbank's decision to omit coupon payments on its EUR50 million externally issued AT1 was also a first for the Basel III AT1 asset class. Prices of eurozone AT1 instruments proved resilient to these events, confirming a more stable and mature market than in 1H16, aided in part by regulatory developments since, and adequate common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios at most issuing banks in Europe. Southern European banks have been the largest issuers this year to date, with Spanish, Italian and Portuguese banks together raising USD7.4 billion. UK banks remain strong issuers given their relatively high Pillar 2A and MREL requirements. Heightened investor interest for Russia-related risk and for AT1 instruments have resulted in manageable funding costs for the three privately owned Russian banks that placed Basel III perpetual debt in 2H16-1H17. Indian banks' local currency issuance benefited from liquidity generated by the demonetisation process. Fitch expects healthy banks in Europe and established issuers to remain active throughout the year, although issuance of AT1 and Tier 2 instruments may become more challenging for lower-rated banks. In Germany, in addition to Bremer Landesbank's precedent generally restrictive rules on AT1 coupon and other distributions will make it more difficult for other Landesbanken to issue AT1 instruments. Fitch's updated AT1 Tracker includes 304 capital instruments with numerical write-down or conversion triggers, totalling USD296 billion, half of which are rated by Fitch. The accompanying Dashboard also includes country- and bank-specific commentary including on regulatory developments such as the European Banking Authority's opinion on the prioritisation of AT1 coupons over other discretionary payments.

Murray suffered an injury scare in the week before Wimbledon as he pulled out of two exhibition matches at Hurlingham due to a sore hip sustained during his French Open semi-final loss to Stan Wawrinka in June.  My team have given me a few different exercises to do during the day when we're together, and also at home in the evening,  Murray wrote in a column for BBC.  It's probably about 20 minutes of extra stuff... that means two freezing cold dips a day -- one at Wimbledon and one in my ice bath at home before bed.  It might not be everyone's ideal preparation for a good night's sleep, but fortunately I've got used to plunging myself into ice-cold water over the years and I don't mind it.  The extra effort worked wonders on Monday as Murray cruised to a 6-1 6-4 6-2 win over Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik without showing any signs of injury troubles in the first round at the All England Club. However, former world number four Greg Rusedski believes Murray's hip was a hindrance against Bublik and the 30-year-old's lack of rest since earning top ranking last November would stop him from progressing past the semi-finals at Wimbledon.  What does worry me is that Andy is so far from looking fresh. I don't see why he can't make it through to the semi-finals, but I also expect all the  Big Four  to go deep,  Rusedski wrote in a column for The Telegraph after the match.  And I am not sure he can beat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in successive matches if he feels weary,  the Briton added.   The bottom line is that Andy has had precious little rest since his crazy finish to last year. He might have improved his Wimbledon chances by either losing early at the French Open or skipping it altogether, but that is easy to say in hindsight.  Murray remains focused on preparing for his second round match against an  unpredictable  Dustin Brown on Wednesday.

Along with the U.S. dollar, the yen suffered last week from a shift towards tighter monetary policy by central bank officials outside the United States and many had expected the RBA to fall in line with the trend. But the Aussie central bank's neutral stance on rates and statement were broadly unchanged and the Aussie dollar, up in earlier trade, sank in response. Sweden's Riksbank also stuck to forecasts for rates not to rise until the middle of next year and said it did not rule out a cut in rates in the near term, pushing its crown currency lower.  The fact that the RBA didn't meet the expectations for a shift to more hawkish rhetoric was a big driver,  said Lee Hardman, an analyst with Japan's MUFG in London.  If the yen has weakened in the past week it has been on the idea that the central banks were shifting to a more hawkish stance. And obviously this goes in the other direction.  The yen, also helped by a flight to safety after a missile launch by North Korea, rose around a third of a percent against both the dollar and the euro. The Aussie, which hit almost four-month highs in last week's moves, fell 0.7 percent on the day to $0.7610. While the dollar slipped against the yen, it stood firm against other rivals. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 96.254 after rising 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. Monday's developments helped the dollar index bounce back from a 9-month low of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy.  The dollar's latest rise is driven by direct demand, as opposed to the U.S. currency gaining thanks to the weakness of its peers,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low. We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.

Amid transatlantic tensions over trade, security and climate change, Poland's right-wing, eurosceptic government wants to put the focus firmly on improving business ties between the United States and ex-communist central and eastern Europe. Trump, a wealthy businessman, will attend a gathering of the 'Three Seas' initiative, launched jointly by Poland and Croatia last year, which aims to bolster trade, energy ties and infrastructure along a north-south axis stretching from the Baltic states down to the Balkans. The three seas are the Baltic, the Adriatic and Black Sea. Some European Union officials are skeptical about the project, which they see as an attempt by Poland - at loggerheads with Brussels on a range of issues - to build a leadership role in a region that includes the EU's poorest member states. Trump, who has also clashed with the EU on a range of issues, is expected to promote U.S. natural gas exports in his address to about 10 leaders attending from across a region that is keen to reduce its heavy reliance on Russian energy. Poland, the largest economy in the ex-communist region, received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) last month at its Baltic port of Swinoujscie. Gas The chief executive officer of Poland's state pipeline operator GAZ-System said the Three Seas summit could give a boost to its North-South Gas Corridor project, which aims to diversify gas supplies away from Moscow.  Political support is extremely important for such projects, it helps with their timely delivery,  Tomasz Stepien told Reuters, adding that this could also help Poland tap EU funds if Brussels deems the corridor a priority. The North-South Gas Corridor, expected to be completed in the next two-three years, will help send gas supplied from the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie and also from a planned Baltic pipeline through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to a new LNG terminal in Croatia. Until now the region's main trade routes have tended to run from east to west rather than north to south, partly reflecting Germany's economic dominance - but that is starting to change. PKP Cargo, Poland's largest rail freight firm, has a deal with Croatia's state railway cargo unit HZ Cargo and is planning other link-ups, including with Romanian ports on the Black Sea.  Increasing transport between the ports of the Adriatic, the Baltic and the Black Sea is one of our priorities,  the firm's Chief Executive Officer Maciej Libiszewski said.   I think that this region is also important for Americans who, if they wish so, will certainly be welcomed here.  Libiszewski pointed to the U.S. manufacturer of railcars, Greenbrier, which has a facility in Poland's Swidnica. North-South Highway Poland's ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), has backed the construction of the 'Via Carpatia' highway, which is intended to run some 7,750-kilometres from the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda on the Baltic to the Greek city of Thessaloniki on the Aegean, passing through most countries of the region along the way.  The aim ... is to build a communication backbone that will enable an effective and reliable flow of people and goods,  Szymon Huptys, the spokesman for Poland's Infrastructure and Construction Ministry, said. Many fewer people live along the north-south axis than along the region's east-west trade routes. This may create a challenge in convincing investors that any infrastructure project makes sense.  Asked if the Three Seas initiative could gain traction, one western European diplomat said:  We have our doubts.  But the Poles remain undaunted by the challenges, and insist the Three Seas project will help complement moves among older EU member states in western Europe toward greater integration.  The Three Seas initiative is not an alternative to European integration processes, but is complementary to them and contributes to the renewal of the European project,  Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told Reuters.

Under the previous framework, global ratings agencies could only have minority stakes in joint-venture operations in the country and could not issue ratings on local bonds. Foreign credit rating agencies must now be registered under the PBOC, have a certain level of experience, have sound corporate governance and be generally accepted by qualified institutional investors, according to the notice, which was published on the central bank's website on Monday evening. To qualify, the foreign credit ratings agency must not have been involved in any  major illegal acts in the past three years and not be subject to any investigations for illegal activity, the notice added.  We are strongly committed to playing a part in the development of China's domestic bond market,  Standard & Poor's said in an emailed statement.  We are reviewing the newly-released rules relating to the interbank bond market and will engage with regulators and other relevant stakeholders to determine how we can best serve the market.  Fitch Ratings declined to comment, while Moody's Investors Service was not immediately available for comment. In December last year, the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission - the government's top planning agency - jointly published draft foreign investment guidelines aimed at removing restrictions on credit investigation and ratings services.

A deadline set by four Arab states for Doha to comply with their demands will expire late on Tuesday, and recent comments by Qatari officials suggest it is unlikely to acquiesce to enough of the demands to avoid further economic sanctions. But net buying by foreign investors in the Qatari stock market over the last few days suggests some funds do not think the additional sanctions would be crippling, while they believe there is now value in the market. Qatar's stock index, which had rebounded 1.3 percent on Monday, added a further 1.1 percent in early trade on Tuesday. Some blue chips remained weak, with Qatar National Bank down 0.2 percent, for example. But companies linked to Qatari gas production were strong as the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum outlined plans to raise output and capacity in coming years. Gulf International Services, the most heavily traded stock, surged 4.0 percent and Qatar Gas Transport soared its 10 percent daily limit. Saudi Arabia's index fell 0.5 percent as a few blue chips, which had surged last week after MSCI said it would consider Riyadh for emerging market status and economic reformer Mohammed bin Salman was promoted to crown prince, pulled back. National Commercial Bank, the largest lender, was the biggest loser, dropping 3.1 percent. Miner Ma'aden slipped 0.6 percent. Second- or third-tier stocks accounted for much activity and some rose strongly; Wafa Insurance gained 5.3 percent after the central bank said it would let the company accept new subscribers in vehicle insurance, lifting a suspension on this activity. Dubai's index fell 0.5 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties slid 1.1 percent. But GFH Financial , the most heavily traded stock, rose 1.8 percent after saying it had obtained approval from the central bank of Bahrain to buy back up to 5 percent of its issued treasury shares. Builder Arabtec surged 4.1 percent after saying it had won a 353 million dirham ($96 million) contract from to build the United Arab Emirates pavilion at Expo 2020 world's fair in Dubai.

Cadent, formerly National Grid Gas Distribution, owns the gas distribution networks in north London, central England, the east of England and northwest England. It was renamed in May following the sale by National Grid of the majority stake in its gas distribution business to a consortium. Ofgem sets price controls for Britain’s energy network companies. The controls set the amount of money that can be earned by the companies that operate Britain's network operators over a set period of time. The firms recover their allowed revenues by charging suppliers, which in turn pass on the costs to customers. The price controls run until 2021 and aim to encourage the network companies to spend money on upgrading and maintaining Britain's electricity network. Ofgem said on Tuesday it had decided to reduce Cadent's allowances by 54 million pounds. This is in addition to a 185 million pound reduction in National Grid's allowances which has already been announced.  As part of today’s decision Ofgem has also decided to delay the allowances that National Grid and Scottish Power will receive for building the Western HVDC link, a subsea electricity cable linking Hunterston in Scotland with Deeside in North Wales,  it said in a statement.  This is because the completion of the cable has been delayed until 2017-18 due to cable manufacturing problems,  it added. $1 = 0.7721 pounds Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-gas-cadent-idUSL3N1JV2OZ"},

Central bank officials have been unnerved by a rise in the euro and government bond yields after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door a week ago to policy tweaks, Reuters reported late on Monday. Wary of weakening the economic recovery, some rate-setters have become nervous about dropping a long-standing pledge to expand or extend the ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme if necessary to reach its near 2 percent inflation target. Such policy tweaks are expected to be discussed when the ECB meets on July 20.  The story does provide support to bond markets,  said Rainer Guntermann, rates strategist at Commerzbank.  But ultimately, the day of reckoning is moving closer for the ECB and it will have to starting talking more tangibly about tapering.  Most euro zone government bond yields were down about 2-3 basis points in early trade, pulling back from recent highs. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield fell 2.5 basis points to 0.46 percent, down from 3-1/2 month highs hit on Monday around 0.50 percent and just shy of 2017 peaks. Still, Bund yields remain 20 basis points above where they stood a week ago - before Draghi's comments sparked a sharp selloff that accelerated after hawkish comments from central banks in Britain and Canada in the following days. The general tone of central bank remarks in the past week has fuelled a perception that monetary policy globally has reached a turning point as brighter economic conditions give central banks confidence to lift rates from low levels. But Australia's central bank stuck to a neutral stance on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday. News on Tuesday meanwhile that North Korea has test-launched what it said was a new intercontinental ballistic missile leant safe-haven bonds markets some support. Trading in general was expected to be subdued due to the July 4 holiday in the United States.

European shares had their strongest day since the first round of the French presidential election on Monday, buoyed by a rally in crude prices and strong banking stocks. But basic resources and banks were among the worst performers on Tuesday, while oil and gas stocks fell 0.3 percent. Dealmaking returned with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. EDP was a top gainer, up 3.8 percent after Spain's Gas Natural approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalisation and could spur further consolidation in the utility sector. Gas Natural shares, meanwhile, fell 0.6 percent at the open. Shares in French rival EDF also dropped 2.5 percent.

Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely. And the prospect of suitors Bain and Cinven getting regulatory approval for a renewed offer for Stada sent the generic drugmaker's shares up 3 percent. Elsewhere, Worldpay jumped 7.1 percent.

An exiled former leader called on Yameen to resign on Tuesday after 10 lawmakers from the president's own party joined opposition lawmakers in launching an impeachment motion against his close ally, Speaker of Parliament Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed The 10 defections saw Yameen lose his 48-seat majority in the 85-seat parliament, with a four-party opposition coalition now holding 45 seats. The reason for the defections was not immediately known. The largely Muslim island chain, which has a population of 400,000, has a reputation as a tourist paradise but has been mired in political unrest for years. The opposition coalition, which includes the party of exiled former leader Mohamed Nasheed and former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, said Mohamed had been deliberately ignoring requests to summon government officials for questioning. Nasheed said on Twitter:  President Yameen has lost parliament, lost local council elections, lost the coalition that brought him to power. He has lost and should resign.  The coalition said in a statement it backed public demands for reform  following widespread corruption, the politicization of independent institutions, mismanagement of the economy, brutalizing of citizens and encroachment of individual liberties .  We urge the independent institutions, the judiciary, security services, our international development partners to respect the wish of the people and the decision of the majority of the parliament,  it said. A parliament sitting scheduled for Tuesday was canceled soon after the impeachment motion was lodged, Maldives news website Mihaaru.com reported.   Mohamed survived a bid to impeach him amid chaotic scenes in the Indian Ocean island nation's parliament in March and Yameen brushed aside the latest attempt.  The opposition has mounted several such political challenges in the past, which the administration is confident of weathering once again,  Yameen's spokesman Ibrahim Hussain said. Yameen's plans to run for a second five-year term in 2018 have been dogged by allegations of corruption and undemocratic behavior. His administration has arrested most of the opponents who might challenge him in 2018, and his government denies opposition allegations his administration is trying to cover up corruption, including money laundering. Nasheed, the first democratically elected leader of the Maldives, was ousted in 2012 and was later sentenced to 13 years in jail on terrorism charges after a widely denounced trial. The Maldives has other looming problems, including significant numbers of radicalized youths who have enlisted to fight for the Islamic State group in the Middle East.

The latest financial woes have surfaced days after its founder and CEO Jia Yueting said the conglomerate's cash problems were  far worse than expected  and that billions of dollars in funds raised in recent months were not enough to help it ride out the crunch. China Merchants Bank Co Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday it had applied to have some of LeEco's assets frozen because a subsidiary, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late on making interest payments on a loan.  CMB's Shanghai branch repeatedly urged repayment without success and so sought to use legal means,  the bank said, adding it now had risks related to the loan under control and did not rule out using  friendly talks  to resolve the issue. LeEco, which controls smartphone maker Coolpad and its core listed smart TV unit Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, has been battling huge financial pressure since Jia admitted last year the company had expanded too fast and was facing  big company disease . Several local media outlets this week reported CMB's Shanghai branch had successfully applied for an asset freeze against some of LeEco's subsidiaries, Jia and his wife, totalling 1.237 billion yuan ($182 million). Reuters could not immediately confirm if the Shanghai court had approved the asset freeze. CMB did not comment further on the details. A LeEco spokesman said CMB's asset-freeze application concerned  financing loans related to LeEco's smartphone business , but added LeEco had enough collateral to cover the loan.  Our senior executives are currently in close communication with various financing units of CMB, and we hope to resolve the related debt issue very soon,  he added. LeEco also hopes to raise further cash to help the firm  get back to normal , the spokesman said. In 2015, CMB agreed on a 10 billion yuan loan to LeEco, part of which was used to acquire a stake in Coolpad and was the biggest bank loan to LeEco at the time, financial magazine Caixin said on Monday, citing public information. Some other partners and suppliers are re-examining their exposure to the troubled group. This week, local media reported an affiliated company of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn divested its 20 percent stake in LeEco's TV and video unit Leshi Zhixin, a blow to the company's core business and one of its most profitable units. Foxconn did not reply to Reuters' request for comment. LeEco is also facing pressure from China Mobile over late payments of around 14 million yuan, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The carrier declined to comment. In June, Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc reduced shipments to LeEco, and temporarily suspended its plans to buy shares of Leshi Zhixin, according to local media. At Compal's first quarter investor conference, it said it was monitoring Leshi's repayment abilities and would develop a new strategy to collect its debt, which could involve legal action. Compal did not provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. LeEco did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments on its business partners' actions. Faced with the worsening cash crunch, LeEco has put some of its global properties for sale, cut staff numbers, and is planning a restructuring to fold some business units into Leshi Internet.

Chief Executive Matthias Wiedenfels, who was appointed just over a year ago, will be replaced by Engelbert Tjeenk Willink, a former board member of privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, Stada said in a statement. Bernhard Duettmann, previously finance chief at Nivea owner Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE) and then chemicals group Lanxess (LXSG.DE), will succeed Stada's Chief Financial Officer Helmut Kraft. Willink and Duettmann have been appointed until the end of 2017, Stada said. The move came only hours after Stada said that private equity firms Bain and Cinven were considering seeking regulatory clearance to make a new takeover offer for the group after their 5.3 billion euro ($6 billion) bid fell through, driving Stada's shares higher. Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity had signed up for their last bid, missing a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. A renewed approach would need to be approved by both German financial watchdog Bafin and Stada itself because a suitor is normally not allowed to make another offer for at least a year.  Should further takeover offers be made, we will examine and evaluate them impartially,  Stada supervisory board Chairman Ferdinand Oetker said. Sources told Reuters last week that a new bid could be launched as early as this week. The private equity firms are expected to bid at the same price but lower the acceptance threshold to 65 percent, the sources said at the time. Support Several people close to the matter had said Bain and Cinven were talking to investors to drum up support for a potential new offer. The bidders wanted to secure irrevocable commitments to tender from shareholders representing more than 15 percent of Stada's voting rights.  Some shareholders - mainly hedge funds, who currently own more than 30 percent of the stock - held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. Others meanwhile have signed commitments to try and secure the renewed offer's success as it promises a more certain deal than a potential third-party bid from funds such as Advent and Permira or Shanghai Pharma, which had shown interest in Stada. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Oliver Reinberg raised his recommendation on Stada shares to  hold  from  reduce  on Tuesday, saying he assumed a new bid by Bain and Cinven would reach its mark.  Given the low margin of failure in the first bidding process - note they only fell 2 percent short of the outstanding shares tendered - we assume that the deal will ultimately succeed,  he said in a note. Shares in Stada rose 2.1 percent to 63.87 euros by 1530 GMT on Tuesday, making them the biggest gainers on Germany's MDAX index of mid-sized companies .MDAXI. Stada said that Wiedenfels and Kraft had told its supervisory board they were stepping down for  personal reasons . People close to the matter said, however, that relations between the executives and the supervisory board had become increasingly strained due to their handling of the takeover process.  It was clear from the beginning that Wiedenfels would be replaced. But the timing of the move was not ideal as it creates insecurity around the deal,  one of the sources said.

The announcement from Macau's monetary authority is the latest in a series of measures being rapidly implemented in the special administrative region of Macau as the Chinese territory ramps up scrutiny on capital outflows from the mainland. Earlier in May, authorities unveiled security measures including facial recognition at ATM machines which require users of China's state-backed UnionPay to provide identification. Since May, authorities said they have installed 834 ATMs with 'know your customer' functions. The monetary authority said the new move was to  promote the integrity of the financial system of Macau and enhance the protection of the legal rights of mainland card holders.  The monetary authority said it has been working with banks to speed up the implementation to cover all ATMs in the former Portuguese colony, including those inside the casinos, by the end of this year. In June, Macau additionally implemented new anti-money laundering legislation, beefing up the previous framework from 2006 with a much wider scope and stricter compliance measures. The flurry of steps coincided with a visit in May by Zhang Dejiang, the head of China's parliament and its third-most powerful leader, during which he stated Macau faced challenges. A 2014 Reuters investigation found that many mainland Chinese use state-backed UnionPay cards to circumvent cash withdrawal limits of 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a day, and either use that money to gamble or transfer it abroad. Customers open multiple bank accounts, and then withdraw cash from each, or use pawn shops in Macau to make fake purchases, the investigation found.

The tropical port is a sensitive diplomatic and physical asset, given Landbridge is said to have links with China's military, and the area is also used for military exercises involving U.S. forces. Darwin has hosted a contingent of 1,250 U.S. Marines since 2011, part of former President Barack Obama’s strategic pivot to Asia to counter a rising China. The Northern Territory government had been holding a 20 percent share in the port while Landbridge searched for an Australian partner to take it over, in line with the 2015 lease arrangements. On Tuesday, the territory's government said it would keep that stake permanently and pay Landbridge only a nominal fee of A$100 ($76.33).  The NT government will not be required to refund any of the $506 million lease purchase price to retain the 20 percent stake,  the territory's chief minister, Michael Gunner, said in a statement. Gunner said the territory would earn no income from its stake, nor contribute to the port's operating costs. A source close to the process said Landbridge had been unable to find a buyer. Darwin Port Chief Executive Officer Terry O'Connor, who works for Landbridge, declined to comment. Landbridge last month told Reuters it was canvassing Australian and Chinese banks to recapitalise its investment in the port. The firm has previously said it is not connected with the Chinese government or military, though its chairman, Ye Cheng, has been a delegate on the advisory body to China's parliament, a high-profile but largely ceremonial position handed out to Communist Party backers.

The GST that came into effect on 1 July is relatively complex, including multiple tax rates for different goods - ranging from 0% to 28%, or higher where 'sin taxes' are applied - and requires frequent filing in all states in which a company operates. Nevertheless, it is far simpler than the previous system, under which each state set its own sales taxes - in addition to the central government - and imposed border taxes on goods entering the state. The unified national system should offer significant opportunities for productivity. For example, it will become much quicker and less costly to move goods across the country now that trucks will not be held up at checkpoints at state borders. Smoother logistics should reduce retailers' need for working capital and allow them to operate centralised warehouses, rather than in every state. Supply chains could extend, encouraging specialisation, now that there is less incentive to source goods within state borders. Tax filing may also become less time-consuming as a result of the new electronic system. The GST is unlikely to increase revenue in the short term. However, it is likely to boost revenue indirectly over the long term, as it supports GDP growth and encourages tax compliance. A benefit of value-added taxes like India's GST is that retailers are required to show compliance right along the supply chain to claim refunds. Large companies will now have an incentive to pressure smaller suppliers into compliance. The new electronic filing system is also likely to lead to more tax reporting. Moreover, the tax base will be broadened, as only SMEs with sales of INR2 million (USD31,000) will now be exempt from paying GST, down from INR15 million. Small informal retailers - which account for over 90% of retail sales - should also find it harder to understate their sales or to avoid filing tax returns altogether in a system where transactions are tracked throughout the supply chain. This could accelerate the shift toward organised retail. Shifting activity into the formal sector, where activity is regulated and taxed, is a key government goal and was the main motivation stated for demonetisation in late-2016. The informal sector is very large, accounting for over 20% of GDP and 80% of employment, and is largely untaxed. This is one of the reasons why government revenue is low, at just 21.4% of GDP in 2016, compared with a median of 29.9% for 'BBB' range sovereigns. There are significant short-term risks involved in the GST implementation, emphasised by the late changes to the bill and the disruptive roll-out of demonetisation. High compliance costs for businesses and administrative difficulties have been problems in some emerging economies that have introduced value-added taxes, particularly those that had complex systems, under-resourced bureaucracies and short lead-in periods. India's new system will overhaul the way businesses operate, affecting their financial reporting, tax accounting, supply-chain management and technology requirements. Contracts will also need to be renegotiated. Smaller firms, many of which still keep their books manually, are likely to find the transition particularly difficult. India's large bureaucracy is likely to be tested by the new system, with further potential implications for businesses. For example, delays in processing tax returns and paying out refunds might create cash flow problems. Multiple GST rates are also likely to lead to disputes over which goods fall into which category, which could add to strains on the judicial system.

UKAR is winding down the loans of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley, two of Britain's customer-owned building societies which were nationalized in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. UKAR's underlying profit before tax fell by almost 33 percent to 706 million pounds in the year ended March, reflecting in part a 9 billion pound reduction in its loan book. UKAR sold a portfolio of mortgages issued by failed lender Bradford & Bingley for 11.8 billion pounds to insurer Prudential and buyout firm Blackstone in March in one of the biggest deals of its kind.

The investment underscores Samsung's determination to widen its lead in memory chips, which are expected to propel Asia's third most-valuable company to record profit this year. It routinely invests more than $10 billion in chips annually, helping it stay ahead of competitors such as cross-town rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) and Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T).  The announcement follows repeated calls from new South Korean President Moon Jae-in for big businesses to invest more domestically as part of a wider job-creation agenda. Samsung said its plan could open up to 440,000 roles by 2021. The huge investment is also likely to alleviate shareholder fears of major decisions being delayed in the absence of Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee. The leader of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] is on trial charged with bribing former president Park Geun-hye for political favors.  Samsung is being more aggressive in domestic investments because of the current (political) climate,  said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score. The firm also needs to show initiative domestically after announcing a $380 million plant in the United States, Park said. Supply Shortage Memory makers are widely expected to post record profits in 2017 as prices rise in response to demand for more features in smartphones and servers, as well as a persistent supply shortage which analysts and industry sources said is more acute for NAND chips due to increasing adoption of high-end storage products.  Samsung, SK Hynix and Toshiba have committed billions of dollars to boost NAND output in recent years, yet shortages are expected to persist at least through 2017 as new facilities will not make meaningful supply contributions until next year. The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2017.Kim Hong-JiUnder its latest spending plan, Samsung will put 14.4 trillion won into its new NAND factory in Pyeongtaek by 2021. It will invest 6 trillion won in a new semiconductor production line in Hwaseong, but did not elaborate on timing or product. Some analysts said additional capacity across the industry could cause slight oversupply in early 2018, but that prices are unlikely to drop because demand is so strong.  There's no chance of major oversupply issues, and I think Samsung is investing so much because it's convinced that won't happen,  said Shinhan Investment analyst Choi Do-yeon. The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen at its office building in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2017.Kim Hong-JiChips in China Samsung also said it will add a production line to its NAND plant in Xi'an, China, though it has not yet set an investment amount or time frame. Some South Korean companies in China have seen sales decline or have had to reduce operations since Beijing objected to Seoul's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defense system in March. But components makers have not reported any problems, with Samsung still among China's biggest suppliers of chips and displays. The firm accounted for 40.4 percent of global memory chip revenue in January-March, showed latest data from researcher TrendForce. China is trying to develop its own memory chip producers but it is likely to take several years before they can compete with existing makers, analysts said. Samsung on Tuesday also said Samsung Display plans to invest around 1 trillion won on a new organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display complex in South Korea. The unit controls over 90 percent of the market for OLED smartphone screens, and is widely expected to add production lines to cope with demand from phone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Among energy stocks, Beach Energy advanced 3.4 percent and Caltex Australia Ltd was up 3 percent. The benchmark showed little reaction to Australia's central bank holding interest rates at a record low 1.50 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose 0.4 percent or 32.21 points to finish the session at 7,620.64. The gains were driven by Spark New Zealand, which surged 3.6 percent.

The world number 59 made her WTA main draw breakthrough in 2014 and has since beaten established players including Elina Svitolina, Venus Williams and Johanna Larsson in the last three years.  The 19-year-old, who was named WTA Newcomer of the Year in 2016, has struggled to maintain her momentum this year, failing to get past the third round in all but one of her competitions, a quarter-final loss at the Auckland Open in January.  Osaka missed the SW19 event last year due to injury but is confident she can excel on grass despite recording 40 unforced errors against Tormo.  I think we can say that I play well on grass,  Osaka told reporters after the match.  I'm quite upset with my stats. I felt like crying when I wasted a match point (up 6-5 in the second set) but I pulled myself together and focused once again.  Osaka will continue her Wimbledon campaign against Czech 22nd seed Barbora Strycova in the second round on Wednesday.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea said it would make a major announcement at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, North Korea test-launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast, South Korean and U.S. officials said. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the military was analysing the missile with the possibility that it may have been an intercontinental ballistic missile-class rocket. The Nikkei dropped 0.1 percent to 20,032.35, moving away from an intraday high of 20,197.16 reached in the morning. The news report  stating that it (North Korea) will make an important announcement this afternoon after it launched a ballistic missile earlier in the day really unnerved the markets, even if it turns out to be sabre rattling,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Limited. Parry said  there is a major uncertainty for investors to digest,  as stock markets in Asia turned lower on the escalating tensions. On the same day, Japan's Defence Ministry said that the intermediate-range ballistic missile launched by North Korea  greatly exceeded  an altitude of 2,500 kilometres (1,560 miles).  If it's an intercontinental basaltic missile, it will likely reach America's west coast, but Trump would not wait until it reaches his land, so the market started to worry what Trump's next move would be,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Twitter message it was  hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer.  Still, with the dollar rising against the yen on upbeat U.S. data, automakers staged a rally. Toyota Motor Corp gained 1.9 percent and Honda Motor Co surged 2.0 percent. The dollar reached a seven-week high of 113.480 yen on the previous day before falling 0.4 percent to 112.910 yen on the heightened risk aversion. However, 24 of Topix's 33 subsectors were in negative territory. The broader Topix shed 0.3 percent to 1,609.70.

As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on gold has jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously, with traders and buyers saying the move will likely force more transactions into the black market.  Three percent is too much. I preferred to buy without receipts. The jeweler did not have any problem,  said a middle-aged buyer, who declined to be identified after making purchases on Monday at the country's biggest bullion market, Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai. Smaller shops could be more inclined to sell without receipts, potentially hitting sales at big jewelers that keep to the rules, said Harshad Ajmera, the proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city Kolkata.    Just to save 1 percent, some customers were earlier buying gold without receipts. With the 3-percent GST, now many more will be tempted to make unofficial purchases from small jewelers,  Ajmera said. The tax hike could also encourage more smuggling into the world's second biggest gold consumer, which buys almost all its bullion abroad. Gold smuggling has been rife since India raised import duties on the metal to 10 percent in a series of hikes to August 2013, looking to curb demand to narrow a gaping current account deficit. The World Gold Council estimates smuggling networks imported up to 120 tonnes of gold into India in 2016.  The GST rate has increased the incentive to bring in smuggled gold. The government should reduce import duty and make smuggling unviable,  said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai. The country's legal imports typically stand at around 800 tonnes a year, with the metal used in everything from investment to religious donations and wedding gifts.  A lower import duty would increase legal imports and ultimately legal sales. Tax revenue would go up instead of going down,  said Daman Prakash Rathod, director at wholesaler MNC Bullion in the southern city of Chennai.

Since mid-June, Singaporeans have been riveted by a public battle between the heirs of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's long-serving first prime minister, over whether to demolish the old family home or let the government decide whether it should become a heritage site. Before he died in March 2015, Lee made it public that he wanted the humbly furnished home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum.  He stated that in his last will, part of which was released by the prime minister's younger brother last month, but the prime minister has said there were  deeply troubling circumstances  over how the will was drawn up. The prime minister's brother and sister accuse him of being disingenuous and abusing his power by using a committee to look at options for the house. Following the accusations, Prime Minister Lee called for a special sitting of parliament to  clear the air  over an issue that some people say has tarnished Singapore's image. The prime minister has consistently denied the allegations, and on Monday laid out his side of the argument in a lengthy statement at the outset of a debate that was adjourned after seven hours. But as lawmakers began gathering for the resumption on Tuesday, the prime minister's brother, Lee Hsien Yang, posted a sharp rejoinder on his Facebook page.  LHL (Lee Hsien Loong) has made convoluted, ultimately false claims about Lee Kuan Yew's wishes. LHL is trying to suggest that because LKY signed some renovation plans in early 2012, he was open to preservation of the house,  Lee Hsien Yang said in the post. The post went on to say that Lee Kuan Yew's desire for the house to be demolished was unwavering, and that any consideration of alternatives was only because Lee Hsien Loong had led him to believe that the house at 38, Oxley Road, would be gazetted.  If he changed his mind on demolition, he would have made it known in a clear and public fashion. He never did,  Lee Hsien Yang wrote. Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, want the house to be demolished once Lee Wei Ling ceases to live there, in accordance with their father's will. Prime Minister Lee has also said that he personally favors honoring his father's wishes, but he has questioned the will and argued that his father also made provision in case the house could not be knocked down due to any regulatory changes.Prime Minister Lee has recused himself from the committee looking at the options, and said he has played no part in its discussions. During the first day of the debate there were no revelations over the accusation that Prime Minister Lee had abused his power, or why his siblings should say that they feared the  organs of the state  could be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang has said he and his wife, lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and hugely unwelcome. Some lawmakers urged the prime minister to sue his siblings, and settle a matter that was distracting the government and damaging Singapore's image. Lee had told parliament that he was loathe to do so, fearing it would drag out the affair and further damage his parents' name.

The pair were planning a future together, but that future was cut short in a brutal instant. Suddenly, police officers barged into the park in the city of Herat and arrested the couple. Maliha was accused of maintaining an illicit relationship, which in the eyes of Islamic law is a criminal act. At the police station, her companion called his family, bribed the police and disassociated himself from her.  He deserted me like he never knew me,  said Maliha said.  They informed my family about the incident and my involvement with a man. My father disowned me immediately and threatened to kill me if I ever approached him.  Maliha was convicted of being a prostitute and spent more than three years in a women's prison, sharing a cell with women convicted on similar charges. Wardens at the prison came to the cell and harassed, beat and sexually assaulted the women, she said.  We were branded as cheap and filthy women. Some nights I heard girls shouting...the prison officers were taking them out and sexually abusing them,  she said.  I was so scared that I hardly ever bathed as it could attract attention toward me.  Maliha herself was abused one day when a man arrived claiming to be a lawyer. She was shown into a room with him where he tried to rape her. She was badly beaten when she resisted. Her suffering continued until a woman lawyer and women's rights activist, Mahdis Doost, stepped into help her. Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries to be a woman or girl in, and a shortage of female police officers and lawyers means women rarely report abuse, rights groups say. Research indicates that more than eight in 10 women in Afghanistan have been sexually, physically or psychologically abused, but only a few thousand cases are reported each year. If an unmarried woman is caught alone with a man who is not her relative, she can be accused, like Maliha, of being a prostitute. A man and woman in Herat province, accused of being in an illicit relationship, were captured by a mob and shot in an extra-judicial killing, Herat's police spokesman said on Monday. Patriarchal      When women do report abuse or are arrested themselves, they find themselves at the mercy of Afghanistan's patriarchal judicial system, shaped by sharia law, women's rights campaigners say.  In many court meetings, I could easily defend my client but the judge didn't let the proceedings be completed. The atmosphere was heavily antagonistic and many times I was called a whore or abused - just because of my choice of clients,  Doost, 26, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Afghanistan's roughly 500 registered women lawyers - mostly confined to the big cities of Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat, undertake some of the most dangerous jobs in Afghan society. They help women fleeing domestic violence and forced marriage. Divorce still remains taboo in Afghan society and if a woman wants to get a divorce lawfully, she has to navigate the male-dominated judicial system.  There is a common phrase in Afghanistan which says  a girl should come to her in-laws in a white dress and leave them in a white shroud,  said Fereshta Karimi, another women lawyer working in Herat. Among Afghanistan's women lawyers, only a few actually dare to practice in court. Doost, who represented Maliha, is one of them.   When I took Maliha's case, she had been held in prison for nearly three years without a single appearance in court and no lawyer. I provided evidence that she was arrested in a public place and the crime (sex with a man) didn't happen and there were no witnesses for that,  Doost said by phone.  She had already spent more time than she should in prison for a crime she did not commit. The judge would not cooperate. That is why it took eight months for me to release Maliha.  Danger Abdul Qadir Rahimi, head of the Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they were aware of abuse of women by the police and judicial authorities.  No specific report about rape or sexual exploitation (of women in detention) has surfaced yet, but we cannot deny such incidents occur as the system and police are corrupt in this country,  he said. There are around 100 women lawyers in Herat working under the Afghanistan Independent Bar Association (AIBA), Aziz Rafi, the head of the AIBA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But most of them are working as advisors and do not appear in court because of the dangers. Fereshta Karimi has worked on more than 30 women's cases over the last six years.   As a married woman, every day I invite unwanted danger to my family with the nature of my job,  she said.  Sometimes clients' associates come to my door to discuss the intricacy of a case, which makes my family worried and upset.   Many times my husband has tried to stop me from working and I have to struggle every day to continue my job as a lawyer.  she said. For women like Maliha, rejected by their own families, women lawyers have been their only hope. Maliha is now living secretly with her widowed aunt. Because of her conviction, she can't resume her studies, get a job or move freely in society. Her male relatives have threatened to kill her. Doost has promised to send her to the capital Kabul and find her a job there.  It may be a place where I can resume my life among unknown people,  Maliha said.  My aunt keeps saying me she can't hide me for long and I am scared for my life if my brother finds me.

Moustakas hit a solo homer off the facade of the second deck in right field Monday night at Safeco Field, just below the Hit It Here Cafe, as the Kansas City Royals defeated the Seattle Mariners 3-1. It was the 23rd home run of the season for Moustakas, not only breaking his career high but also the team record for the most before the All-Star break. Jermaine Dye hit 22 before the break in 2000.  I'm just trying to go out there and get hits,  Moustakas said.  Getting some good pitches, putting some good swings on them, and the ball is going out.  It was announced during the game that Moustakas would participate in the Home Run Derby on July 10 in Miami, the day before the All-Star Game.  I'm really excited. It's going to be an awesome experience,  he said.  I've never been to Miami, so I'm excited to go there and have some fun in the Home Run Derby.  Moustakas is also one of five finalists for the final spot on the American League team for the All-Star Game, to be determined by a vote from fans.  Hopefully that still happens,  said Moustakas, who won the final vote in 2015 to make his first All-Star Game.

Kennedy allowed one run on four hits in 6 2/3 innings, with two walks and seven strikeouts, to win his third consecutive decision. Relievers Peter Moylan, Neftali Feliz and Joaquim Soria combined for 2 1/3 perfect innings to close out the victory. Soria got the last three outs for his first save of the season.  Kennedy had the little blip in the second inning where he walked a couple of guys and gave up the one run, but after that, he was great in every inning,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He had a really good curveball, commanded his stuff extremely well and just pitched a great game.  That was important for the Royals, who played a doubleheader Saturday against Minnesota and used five relievers to beat the Twins on Sunday.  It was a long weekend,  Kennedy said.  No matter what, you try to go as deep as you can.  The Royals (42-40), who lost 20 of their first 30 games, moved two games above .500 for the first time this season and prevented the Mariners (41-43) from returning to the .500 mark. Kansas City struck early against Seattle right-hander Andrew Moore, who was making his second major league start. Whit Merrifield led off the game with a double into the right field corner. Merrifield advanced to third on a Ramon Torres flyout to center field and scored on Lorenzo Cain's sacrifice fly to right. Kansas City made it 2-0 in the second as Moustakas led off with his homer. The Mariners scored in the bottom of the second, but Kennedy did well to limit the damage. With one out, Kyle Seager walked, Danny Valencia grounded a single up the middle, and Jarrod Dyson walked to load the bases. Seager scored on a wild pitch, with Valencia and Dyson also advancing. Kennedy struck out Mike Zunino and Boog Powell to end the threat.  Getting out of the second with two strikeouts was big to stop any rally,  Kennedy said. Moore retired 11 consecutive batters after Moustakas' home run. Gordon snapped that streak with two outs in the fifth, hitting a broken-bat home run into the first row of seats in right-center field, just over the outstretched glove of Mariners right fielder Mitch Haniger. The blast gave the Royals a 3-1 lead. The Mariners threatened in the seventh as Valencia led off with a single and took second on a wild pitch. With two outs, Moylan relieved Kennedy with pinch hitter Nelson Cruz coming up. Moylan struck out Cruz to end the inning. Moore went eight innings, allowing three runs on five hits. He struck out four without issuing a walk.  For his second major league start, Moore was very impressive,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  He made some good in-game adjustments.  They hit some balls out of the park, and we didn't get much going offensively.  NOTES: Royals 1B Eric Hosmer went 2-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. ... The Mariners optioned RHP Dan Altavilla, who was 1-1 with a 5.46 ERA in 29 relief appearances, to Triple-A Tacoma to make room on the roster for RHP Andrew Moore. ... Seattle made a trade just before the game, sending Double-A RHP Tyler Herb to the San Francisco Giants for cash considerations. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy (4-4, 3.54 ERA) is scheduled to be activated from the 10-day disabled list Tuesday to start against Mariners RHP Felix Hernandez (3-2, 4.66). Duffy has been out since May 28 with a strained right oblique.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED74JVBL6G"},

The auction of 2.2 trillion yen of 10-year JGBs held on Tuesday attracted strong demand as investors see limited downside in their prices, and upside in yields, given the Bank of Japan's commitment to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent. The benchmark 10-year yield stood flat at 0.080 percent, off a 3 1/2-month high of 0.085 percent hit last week. The auction attracted bids 4.77 times the offer, the highest bid-to-cover ratio in more than a decade. The lowest accepted price was slightly stronger than market expectations. But yields on longer-dated bonds rose as investors were more worried about Thursday's auction of 30-year JGBs, on which the BOJ does not have an explicit yield target and has less control. The 20-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.600 percent while the 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis point to 0.865 percent, a three-month high.  Because of the BOJ's yield curve control, 10-year bonds were easier to buy. On the other hand, investors remain wary of 30-year bonds as volatility in global bond markets has risen and U.S. bond yields have not stopped rising,  said Naoya Oshikubo, yen rates strategist at Barclays. Global bond yields have risen sharply after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last Tuesday that the ECB could adjust its policies. Policymakers from the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada also signalled they could raise interest rates, fuelling worries about tighter monetary conditions globally. The 10-year JGB futures fell 0.01 to 150.15. The market was little affected by rising geopolitical tensions in Asia after North Korea test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile and a U.S. warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea.

Two people familiar with the process told Reuters that the central bank - which in 2015 allowed eight firms including Alibaba's Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings to develop scoring systems - has quietly pulled back its support. The People's Bank of China has shelved plans to turn that initial approval into official licenses, the people said, raising questions over what services the firms can offer and their ability to build fully-fledged credit bureaus. The impasse also underlines how China's tech companies with banking ambitions struggle with unpredictable regulation as Beijing weighs the pros and cons of private sector involvement, when it needs to both encourage consumption and control economic risk.  Clearly there's a conflict of interest and that's something the PBOC has realised,  said one of the people, adding the bank felt none of the eight firms was entirely suitable.  They're not going to stand up and publicly admit they made a mistake; the only power they have is to basically not grant the licenses, which is what they've done.  Unlike leading international peers that only operate credit scoring systems, these Chinese firms have existing businesses in commerce and finance, raising questions about their impartiality, the people said. The two people - one with direct knowledge of the scheme and a central bank official - asked not to be named as they were not authorised to talk publicly about the plans. The PBOC did not respond to requests for comment. Yet, in a closed-door seminar in April, Wan Cunzhi, head of the PBOC's Credit Information System Bureau, said there was currently a  major conflict of interest  - potentially the first acknowledgement of concern outside internal circles.  Their corporate governance structures don't have third party credit independence,  he said, referring to the eight companies, according to a transcript of the speech seen by Reuters and confirmed by a person who attended the seminar.  It's not possible under these circumstances to give out licenses unless they can meet the standards.  The eight firms are Ant Financial's Zhima Credit, Tencent, Sinoway Credit, Lakala Payment Co, Intellicredit Inc, China Chengxin Credit, Pengyuan Credit Service Co Ltd, and Qianhai Zhengxin, a unit of Ping An Insurance.  On one hand, the government is trying to encourage this inclusive financing, but on the other hand, they are tightening regulations to make clear rules for the game,  said John Chen, China Managing Director of U.S. credit scoring firm FICO . Tencent, Ping An and other smaller rivals among the eight did not respond to requests for comment. An Ant Financial spokeswoman said discussions with the PBOC were ongoing. An official at Chengxin Credit declined to comment on the firm's plans.  At the moment, we haven't received the license, and we're still waiting for information from the PBOC,  she said. Spend, Spend, Spend Ant Financial, tapping hundreds of millions of monthly users of its own services and those of Alibaba, has an online bank, MYBank, controls the world's largest money market fund Yu'e Bao, popular payment platform Alipay and lending service Huabei. It also has Zhima Credit, or Sesame Credit, one of China's most popular platforms, which scores people depending on their use of other Ant-linked systems - in effect, their shopping habits. Zhima Credit currently has roughly 260 million users. Tencent Credit Service has a website offering credit scores, though currently it is not accepting new users. None now offers the full suite of consumer credit reporting agencies like Equifax Inc, Experian Plc and TransUnion, but had hoped to expand as China borrows more on credit. While China's older generations are mostly still big hoarders, more young Chinese consumers are spending on credit. Consumer borrowing topped 27 trillion yuan ($3.96 trillion) in May, more than four times the level in 2010. Household debt relative to the economy, still lower than in many Western economies, has also ballooned. Yet China's existing, centralized credit scoring system, the Credit Reference Center, only covers around 300 million people out of around 800 million potential borrowers. That creates a blind spot of some half a billion borrowers beyond Beijing's credit network. By contrast, almost all adults in the United States have a credit score. Companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion use a plethora of data from banks, legal bodies and tax agencies to help lenders decide whether to extend a loan and at what rate. The current scope in China is rather more limited: Zhima Credit scores are linked to shopping patterns on Taobao, Alibaba's online marketplace, or online payments made through Alipay, while the benefits include waiving a deposit on a rental car, jumping the queue at a medical clinic or quicker visa applications. Industry insiders said discussions between the firms and regulators could find a way forward, possibly through a limited data sharing agreement.  Right now, it's unclear what will be the next step,  said FICO's Chen.  What is clear is that the eight firms, as they are today, will not get those licenses.  $1 = 6.8268 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Cate Cadell and Shu Zhang; Additional reporting by BEIJING and SHANGHAI newsrooms; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Ian Geoghegan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ant-financial-credit-idUSL3N1JO05W"},

European shares were also set to open in the red, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX to start off 0.2 percent each, and France's CAC 40 down 0.3 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent after rising earlier. Japan's Nikkei also surrendered earlier gains to drop 0.1 percent, and South Korea's KOSPI extended losses to trade 0.6 percent lower. North Korea test-launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean and U.S. officials said, days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes. The missile flew 930 kilometres (580 miles) before landing in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, the South Korean military and Japanese government said. Tokyo strongly protested what it called a clear violation of UN resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he will ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles in efforts to stop Pyongyang's arms programme. North Korea said it will make a major announcement on Tuesday at 3:30 pm local time (0630 GMT), South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The South Korean won dropped 0.4 percent to 1,151 won to the dollar as of 0532 GMT. The nervous mood pushed the safe-haven yen up 0.4 percent to 113.02 yen per dollar.  As concerns surrounding the firing of ballistic missiles brewed midday, we are seeing the slide in the Japanese market spreading across to the rest of Asia,  said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore.  Reports suggesting that the missile had landed in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone certainly bring about deeper concern compared to past instances.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng posted the biggest loss with a 1.6 percent drop, after earlier slumping more than 2 percent. Chinese blue-chips fell 0.9 percent. Australian shares bucked the trend to surge 1.6 percent, bouncing solidly from a 2.3 percent loss over the previous two sessions, helped by the nation's central bank steering a neutral course on rates in contrast to some of its peers who have recently turned more hawkish. The broad Asian share market performance was in stark contrast to the overnight increases in European and U.S. shares, with oil's longest stretch of daily price gains in over five years boosting energy shares. The S&P; 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted gains of 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, led by financials and energy shares. The Nasdaq lost 0.5 percent, as the rotation away from technology names continued. An error in Nasdaq's computer systems on Monday evening in the U.S. caused some third-party providers to incorrectly show large after-hours swings for the prices of Amazon Inc, Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc shares. Google parent Alphabet Inc and eBay Inc  shares were among others that appeared to be priced at $123.47 on some financial news websites. The actual prices of the stocks were not affected and no trades were completed at that price, a Nasdaq spokesman confirmed. U.S. markets are closed on Tuesday for the independence day holiday. European markets posted even stronger gains, with the FTSEurofirst 300 jumping as much as 1.2 percent following losses last week. In currency markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was steady at 96.23. On Thursday, it jumped 0.6 percent after a private index of June domestic manufacturing activity rose more than expected while other data showed government outlays on construction projects in May at their highest in more than four years.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.  The Australian dollar slid 0.65 percent to $0.7609 after the Reserve Bank of Australia's neutral outlook on rates disappointed speculators betting it would join other global central banks that have recently turned hawkish. The euro was little changed at $1.136 on Tuesday. Sterling inched up 0.1 percent to $1.295, but failed to make up most of Monday's 0.7 percent loss after poorer-than-expected data from Britain's manufacturing sector. Crude futures posted their first session of losses in nine, ending their longest run of gains since February 2012, as traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. holiday. U.S. crude slipped 0.5 percent to $46.85 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent also fell 0.5 percent to $49.44. On Monday, it closed up 3.7 percent, its biggest one-day gain since December 2016. Gold inched up from its lowest level in more than seven weeks hit on Monday on the dollar's strength. Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,224.49 an ounce on Tuesday.

The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 112.910 yen, pulling away from a seven-week high of 113.480 reached the previous day. The greenback had earlier taken in stride news that North Korea had launched a missile on Tuesday, which Tokyo said appeared to have landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). But it took a dip after Pyongyang later said it would make a major announcement later in the day.  The yen gained as North Korea's actions came just ahead of the G20 summit scheduled this weekend and cooled risk sentiment,  said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale in Tokyo.  Dollar/yen is still confined in reasonable range right now. The market will want to see what North Korea's announcement is about before deciding if further gains by the yen are warranted.  The Japanese currency, sought in times of risk aversion, also bounced back from lows marked earlier against other major currencies. The euro was down 0.6 percent at 128.105 yen after rising to a 16-month high of 128.970 earlier. Sterling fell 0.4 percent to 146.12 yen, nudging away from a seven-week peak of 146.84 yen. The Australian dollar shed 1.1 percent to 85.92 yen after touching 86.96 yen, its strongest since March 21. The Australian currency was particularly hard hit on Tuesday. The Aussie was 0.7 percent lower at $0.7609 following the RBA's monetary policy announcement. While the RBA's decision to keep interest rates unchanged did not come as a surprise, currency bulls were disappointed as the central bank refrained from taking a hawkish tilt. Australia's central bank stuck to a neutral stance on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday, a marked divergence from some of its peers abroad who have recently signalled an intent to tighten policy. The Australian dollar had risen to $0.7685 earlier in the session as some market participants had expected the RBA to join a shift towards a hawkish stance taken by peers like the European Central Bank, Bank of England and the Bank of Canada. While the dollar slipped against the yen, it stood firm against other rivals. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 96.254 after rising 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. Monday's developments helped the dollar index bounce back from a 9-month low of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy.  The dollar's latest rise is driven by direct demand, as opposed to the U.S. currency gaining thanks to the weakness of its peers,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low. We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.  The euro extended overnight losses and was last down 0.2 percent at $1.1343. The common currency has taken a step back from a near 14-month high of $1.1445 scaled on Friday.

Rodon allowed two runs and struck out 10 over 6 1/3 innings, leading the White Sox to a 7-2 victory against the Oakland Athletics in the opener of a three-game series at Oakland Coliseum. Rodon (1-1), the third overall pick in the 2014 draft, made just his second start of 2017 after missing nearly the first three months of the season with left biceps bursitis. He walked three, allowed four hits and came within one strikeout of matching his career high. In his season debut during a 12-3 loss to the New York Yankees on Wednesday, Rodon gave up three unearned runs but walked six. Last year, Rodon won his final two starts against the Cleveland Indians and the Minnesota Twins, striking out a combined 21 batters and allowing just two earned runs on five hits.  It's just one start, but that's closer to where I was, and hopefully I can build off that in the next start in Colorado,  Rodon said.  It felt good. A little bit of relief, try to get that first one out of the way and then build off that.  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said he was impressed by Rodon's efficiency in his second start.  Throwing a lot of strikes, getting after the hitters,  Renteria said.  I think it was similar to how he was finishing up last year.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at AthleticsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchRodon gave Renteria a scare when he appeared to land awkwardly on a pitch. Renteria and a trainer quickly went to the mound, but Rodon told them he was fine.  I just slipped a little bit,  Rodon said.  That's nothing. I think that was my fault. I just landed a little wrong and had to make an adjustment. I was good.  The road I've been on lately, they were a little protective, which was good.  Todd Frazier went 2-for-4 with two doubles, two runs and two RBIs for the White Sox. Melky Cabrera had three hits, including a double, in six at-bats, with an RBI and a run. Willy Garcia went 2-for-3 with a double, two walks, a run and an RBI. The White Sox, who were swept at home by Oakland in a three-game series June 23-25, won for the fourth time in five games. A's right-hander Jharel Cotton (5-8) allowed four runs on seven hits over five innings with five strikeouts, two walks, a wild pitch and a balk. He made his first start since a 3-0 victory against the White Sox on June 23, when he threw five shutout innings but had to leave in the sixth with a blister on his right thumb.  They got the big hits with two strikes,  Cotton said.  I got to get better at that. Something I'll work on and get better at for sure. I need to bear down in those situations.  The A's lost their sixth straight game overall and fell for the eighth straight time at home, both season highs. The White Sox led 4-2 through three innings and scored two more runs in the eighth. They had three hits in the inning, including doubles by Cabrera and Garcia. Chicago padded the lead with a run in the ninth. Rodon had two strikeouts in the second inning, struck out the side in the third then had two more one-two-three innings in a row.  He looked confident today,  Frazier said.  He was all business. He worked fast, and when he works fast, he's a better pitcher.  After Rodon exited, Anthony Swarzak threw 1 1/3 perfect innings with two strikeouts, and Dan Jennings pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings with a strikeout. The A's struck out 13 times in the game.  When we play well, we hit home runs but we also strike out a lot,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  It's been an Achilles heel for us.  The White Sox took a 1-0 lead in the top of the second inning when Frazier hit a leadoff double and scored with two outs on Tim Anderson's single. Oakland answered with two runs in the bottom of the second. Josh Phegley lined a two-out double, and Rodon walked Franklin Barreto and Matt Joyce, loading the bases. Adam Rosales, the Athletics' No. 9 hitter, lined a two-run single to right field. Chicago scored three times in the third, moving ahead 4-2. Adam Engel walked with one out and moved to third on Cabrera's hit-and-run single to center. Frazier brought them both home with a two-out double to left and scored on Matt Davidson's double to left-center. NOTES: White Sox RHP David Robertson was placed on the paternity list and is expected to miss the entire three-game series at Oakland. The White Sox closer remained in Chicago with his wife for the birth of their second child. RHP Gregory Infante was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte. ... White Sox RF Avisail Garcia (left knee soreness) missed his fifth straight game, but manager Rick Renteria said he's doing  very, very well  and should be available to play at some point in the three-game series. ... Oakland 3B/1B Ryon Healy (upper back spasms) did not play Monday, and he remains day-to-day. He left the game Sunday against Atlanta after the bottom of the second inning. ... A's 3B Matt Chapman (left knee cellulitis) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and started against Chicago. He went 0-for-4. ... 1B/OF Matt Olson was optioned to Triple-A Nashville. In 16 games over four stints with the A's this season, Olson batted .184 with four home runs and nine RBIs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED74JV886C"},

Conversations with six central bank officials from across the euro zone showed they had been unnerved by a rise in the euro and in government bond yields after ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door last week to policy changes. Wary of weakening the economic recovery, some rate setters have become nervous about dropping their long-standing pledge: they will expand or extend the ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro bond-buying programme if necessary to bring inflation back to its target of just under 2 percent. Such a change is almost certain to be discussed when the bank meets on July 20. But removing the pledge would probably be taken by the market as a sign the ECB was preparing to wind down the scheme, which has made borrowing cheap and boosted euro zone exports by holding down the value of the euro. Despite declines on Monday, the euro and German bond yields, the debt benchmark for the region, were still far higher than they had been before Draghi's speech. That is an unwelcome development for an ECB seeking to maintain ultra-easy borrowing conditions.  We have to see how the market develops between now and the meeting,  one of the sources said.  I’d say we should err on the side of caution.  A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment. With inflation above 1 percent and the euro zone's economy on its best run for years, officials generally agreed the way was clear for a gradual normalisation of ECB policy. They disagreed on the timing, though. In June, the ECB shut the door to further rate cuts and took a more sanguine view of the economic outlook for the euro zone - thereby removing two so-called 'easing biases' from its policy message. The market took those changes in its stride, so economists expected the rate-setters would soon omit their pledge  to increase the (bond) programme in terms of size and/or duration  if necessary. But the officials who spoke to Reuters are no longer sure that will happen at the July 20 meeting.  I was thinking we'd drop the other easing bias in July, but after the market reaction to Draghi's speech I'm less sure about it,  one official said. The head of Germany's Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said on Saturday that ECB rate setters were discussing moving away from an ultra-easy stance but were still arguing about how expansive policy should be. Another source suggested one solution might be to break up that part of the guidance: take out only the reference to increased purchases or the one to prolong them. The message could then be amended further in September, when the ECB gets updated inflation forecasts. Those might help the policymakers decide on the future of the programme beyond its December end date.

ADIA last year increased its exposure to direct private equity transactions and broadened its focus in Asian private equity markets particularly China and India, it said in its annual review. ADIA’s 20-year and 30-year annualised rates of return in U.S. dollar terms were 6.1 percent and 6.9 percent respectively in 2016. That compared with 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent respectively in 2015.  As in 2015, these figures were impacted by the exclusion of strong returns in the mid-1980s and 1990s from the rolling averages, although ADIA’s real rates of return remain consistent with historical levels,  Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed al Nahyan, managing director of ADIA, said in the review. Headquartered in the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates, ADIA manages a global investment portfolio across more than two dozen asset classes. It does not disclose its assets but the U.S-based Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which tracks the industry estimates them at $792 billion. Sovereign wealth funds around the world are trying to find new avenues to boost returns in a period of relatively low interest rates and slow economic growth. Singapore’s GIC Pte Ltd warned last year of a decade of low growth. In a drive to cut costs and gain more control, some state funds are striking their own private equity deals rather than relying on external fund managers. ADIA also said its Alternative Investments department had launched a new Emerging Opportunities programme to invest in asset types that fall outside the remit of ADIA’s other departments. That programme will become active this year and help diversification, it added.  Within our investment departments, we continued to expand our universe of investable asset classes and geographies, and deploy internal teams to proactively identify and originate attractive opportunities,  al Nahyan said.  When viewed as a whole, ADIA ended 2016 on a positive note, with performance underpinned by respectable gains in global markets despite considerable headwinds from political events throughout the year.  ADIA had 1,750 employees from 60-plus nationalities in 2016, up from 1,700 in 2015. One area of focus was ADIA Global Research, which appointed a Head of Economic Analysis and a Head of Energy Analysis, among other hires, to boost specialisation.

Andrew Benintendi's bloop single over a drawn-in infield with the bases loaded drove in two runs in the 11th inning and gave Boston a 7-5 victory over the Texas Rangers. Benintendi dropped the ball just over the head of backpedaling shortstop Elvis Andrus to score Tzu-Wei Lin, who had walked against Texas reliever Ernesto Frieri, and Mookie Betts, who had doubled. Dustin Pedroia, who went 3-for-5 with four RBIs, including a two-run single in Boston's three-run sixth, was intentionally walked to load the bases. Red Sox right-hander Heath Hembree (1-2) earned the victory, retiring all six batters he faced in the 10th and 11th, including three strikeouts. Boston earned its fifth win in a row.  I was just thinking about trying to get something to the outfield,  said Beninendi, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the ninth.  Basically anything but a ground ball. And it's a funny game and things tend to work like that.  Frieri (0-1) gave up two runs on two hits and two walks in the 11th, including a one-out free pass to Lin, the Red Sox's No. 9 hitter. In all, Rangers pitchers issued seven walks. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RangersBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchBoth teams used six pitchers. Texas' Mike Napoli tied the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth off All-Star closer Craig Kimbrel. The homer was Napoli's third in four games. The Rangers could manage only three hits and three runs in 6 1/3 innings against Red Sox starter Rick Porcello. Rougned Odor, who had an error that led to three Boston unearned runs in the sixth and a 5-2 Red Sox lead, hit a solo home run in the fourth, and Carlos Gomez added a solo shot in the seventh. Pedroia also made two good defensive plays, a diving stop on Andrus' sharply hit ball in the 10th and a tough over-the-shoulder catch on Delino DeShields' blooper on the next at-bat.  He's had a lot of great seasons here, a lot of great games,  Boston manager John Farrell said of Pedroia,  but tonight might be one of the better games he's played in this uniform.  He was the right man in the right spot at the plate, he was everywhere defensively. So they make decision to load the bases, and (Benintendi) gets just enough for the two-run single.  Boston's usually reliable bullpen, which entered having allowed only three runs in the past 22 2/3 innings, gave up two runs in the late innings as the Rangers tied the score. Nomar Mazara's single to left in the eighth cut Boston's lead to 5-4. Neither starter figured into the decision. Porcello gave up three runs on three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked three in a 110-pitch outing. He continued a good run for Red Sox starters, who have posted a 3.09 ERA with 85 strikeouts and 20 walks in the team's past 13 games. Porcello's quality start was the team's 10th during that stretch. Texas lefty Martin Perez, in his first start since June 22 after a stint on the disabled list with a broken thumb, gave up seven hits and five runs, though only two earned, with four walks over 5 2/3 innings. Two walks extended Boston's two-run third.  When you look at the whole game, and you continue to walk (hitters), you continue to turn the lineup over, you're going to continue to give quality hitters more opportunities,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  You give them that many opportunities, they're going to come through.  Banister had a choice to make in the 11th with the bases loaded and one out. Play the infield in, trying to get a force out at home and possibly a double play, or align the infield in standard double-play depth.  The likelihood of turning a double play there is very slim,  Banister said.  Obviously, you're in a tough situation, so you make a decision on playing in there. Set up a double play for yourself at home, a play at the plate, play at any base, there's a number of things that can happen.  It turned out to be a perfectly placed bloop over the infield.  You go back and look at some of the balls we hit hard, and then our bloop (in the 10th) doesn't fall in,  Banister said.  The game of baseball is very cruel in certain instances and very rewarding for others.  NOTES: Boston SS Xander Bogaerts (groin tightness) sat out a second consecutive game but took swings in the indoor cage and did some agility work on Monday after responding well to treatment. Manager John Farrell said he expected Bogaerts back as early as Tuesday. ... Texas placed RHP Keone Kela (shoulder soreness) on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 30, while activating LHP Martin Perez. ... The Rangers also optioned LHP Dario Alvarez to make room on the active roster for RHP Jason Grilli, who was acquired in a trade from the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED74JUJ761"},

The dollar was down 0.25 percent at 113.100 yen after going as high as 113.480 late on Monday, its strongest since mid-May. The greenback had earlier taken in stride news that North Korea had launched a missile on Tuesday, which Tokyo said appeared to have landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). But it took a dip after Pyongyang later said it would make a major announcement later in the day. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 96.178 after rising 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger-than-expected rise in the June Institute of Supply Management (ISM) national factory activity index propelled the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since May 16. Monday's developments helped the dollar index bounce back from a 9-month low of 95.470 plumbed on Friday. The greenback was hit hard last week as expectations increased that central banks in Europe and Canada would eventually shift to tighter monetary policy.  The dollar's latest rise is driven by direct demand, as opposed to the U.S. currency gaining thanks to the weakness of its peers,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  Expectations towards the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this year had perhaps sunk too low. We are now seeing such lowered expectations being reversed a little.  The euro was effectively flat at $1.1369 after dropping 0.6 percent overnight. The common currency has taken a step back from a near 14-month high of $1.1445 scaled on Friday. Pressure against the yen has been mounting as the Bank of Japan is expected to stick with its negative interest rate scheme in order to meet its inflation target while its counterparts seem poised to raise rates or begin exiting their accommodative policies.  The yen is slipping against popular crosses like euro/yen, pound/yen and Aussie/yen, which is contributing to its weakness against the dollar,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo. Earlier, the euro edged up to a 16-month high of 128.970 yen , sterling was near a seven-week peak of 146.84 yen and the Aussie saw 86.96 yen, its strongest since March 21. No Boost for Aussie The Australian dollar was 0.7 percent lower at $0.7609 following the RBA's monetary policy announcement. While the RBA's decision to keep interest rates unchanged did not come as a surprise, currency bulls were disappointed as the central bank refrained from taking a hawkish tilt. Australia's central bank stuck to its balanced view on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday, a marked divergence from some of its peers abroad who have recently signalled an intent to tighten. The Australian dollar had risen to $0.7685 earlier in the session as some market participants had expected the RBA to join a shift towards a hawkish stance taken by peers like the European Central Bank, Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.

Foreign ministers from the four Arab countries sanctioning Qatar will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the dispute. Kuwaiti state media reported Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had submitted to Kuwait Doha's formal response to the Arab states' demands, but the contents of the response have not been revealed. Recent comments by Qatari officials suggest it is unlikely to acquiesce to enough of the demands by the late Tuesday deadline to avoid further sanctions. But Monday's buying by foreign investors in the Qatari stock market suggests some funds do not think the additional sanctions would be crippling and there is now value in the market. Dubai-listed GFH Financial said it had obtained approval from the central bank of Bahrain to buy back up to 5 percent of its issued treasury shares. Much of this good news may already be reflected in the share price, however; the stock jumped 6.3 percent on Monday.

The Australian dollar sank half of a U.S. cent after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) finished its July policy meeting with rates staying at a record low 1.50 percent, where it has been since August last year. Investors had bid the currency up on speculation the central bank would turn hawkish like its counterparts in Europe and Canada. Instead, its statement was anodyne.  The Board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time,  it repeated. Indeed, it even refrained from highlighting the recent pick up in employment, noting only that the indicators remain  mixed.  Official data showed employment blew past forecasts to jump 42,000 in May, a third straight month of upbeat outcomes that drove the jobless rate to a four-year trough of 5.5 percent. The RBA's reticence to play up the numbers even led the futures market to pare back the probability of a hike in interest rates. The December contract implied a 4 percent chance of a move higher, down from 12 percent on Monday. Su-Lin Ong, head of fixed income strategy for Australia and New Zealand at Royal Bank of Canada, said the central bank's statement showed a  firmly neutral bias  on policy.  Following the shift in global central banking rhetoric in recent weeks, the hawks were disappointed by the RBA today and we expect that to remain the case for some time,  she said. The RBA did sound optimistic about future economic growth, but cautioned against record high household debt in the country's red-hot property market especially as wages growth was stuck at its slowest pace ever. The central bank fears that trend of household debt outpacing income growth was eating into spending elsewhere in the economy. Consumers Show Panache Earlier, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the country's retailers enjoyed another strong month of sales in May as shoppers splurged on household goods, a sign that the economy picked up speed after a disappointing first quarter. Retail sales rose 0.6 in May, beating expectations for a meagre 0.2 percent increase. It also follows a solid 1.0 percent jump in April, marking the best two months of sales since end-2013. The data should comfort the RBA which had feared ballooning debt in the sizzling property sector was pinching consumers' ability to spend elsewhere in the economy.  Two firmer months together do suggest the consumer was doing more of the heavy lifting when it comes to economic growth in the second quarter,  said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank. But  the fundamentals are still poor - people are worried about losing their jobs or ever getting a wage rise. So it's hard to say this is a definitive turning point.

So we have to look at the rest of our indicators in the models that predict inflation,  he added, suggesting that easing off the accelerator is appropriate even before hitting the target. Canada's output gap - the difference between actual and potential output - would likely close sometime in the first half of 2018, suggesting that by then, inflation should be well into an uptrend, Poloz added.

Mejia stayed composed and demonstrated the growth he has made for the Minnesota Twins this season. The left-hander settled in and lasted through the seventh inning, surrendering only one additional run. It was a much-needed start for Minnesota from someone not named Ervin Santana or Jose Berrios, and it led to a 9-5 win over the Angels in the opener of a homestand.  I was always calm,  Mejia said through an interpreter.  I kept thinking about getting the batters out and I just stayed calm.  Minnesota's Max Kepler had four hits, including a solo homer, and drove in three runs, and Joe Mauer added a two-run homer. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at TwinsLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchNamed to his first All-Star game on Sunday, Miguel Sano added three hits and two RBIs for the Twins, who finished an 11-game, three-city road trip on Sunday with their sixth loss in eight games. The Twins started play Monday with the lowest home winning percentage in baseball at .390 (16-25). Mejia (4-3) allowed three runs on nine hits and a walk. He struck out five and became the first Minnesota pitcher to complete six innings since Berrios on June 26, a span of eight games. Mejia was the first Twins pitcher other than Santana or Berrios to record an out in the seventh inning since Mejia did so on May 21. He has stranded 20 of the past 23 baserunners he has allowed.  I just think he's starting to trust that his stuff can play up here,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  It's nice when he's using all his pitches. The changeup's obviously is a good pitch, but the slider when he stays on top, we saw some good swings and misses down and in to the righties.  But, yeah, I think that the more success that comes his way in terms of going deeper in games and putting wins next to his name, I think he feels better about what he's doing.  Angels starter Alex Meyer (3-5) again ran into control issues. He made it through five innings but surrendered five runs on six hits and four walks. He also hit a batter to go with six strikeouts.  There's no doubt that rate is unsustainable. If you're going to give up one hit an inning also, you're going to be in trouble,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  One thing that helps Alex is he's got a high strikeout rate. ... Hopefully as he starts to get refined, (he will) harness what he can do. It's hard to see the forest through the trees sometimes, but look where he was last year at this time.  Luis Valbuena and Martin Maldonado homered for Los Angeles, which has lost four of its past five games. Making his first start in Minnesota since being traded last year by the Twins to Los Angeles, Meyer balked in a run in the second inning. Mauer homered on the next pitch, sending a 2-2 fastball over the heart of the plate deep to the bullpen in left-center field for his fifth of the year.  Frustrated from that (balk), and I let it override me in the next at-bat and a pitch right down the middle and they took advantage of that,  Meyer said.  It's frustrating. I got to be better. You get better at handling it probably than I was. I was confused, I honestly didn't know what I did. Umpire's telling me I was moving my leg, and I didn't think I was. I'll have to look at it.  The Twins kept adding on runs against Meyer and reliever Yusmeiro Petit. Sano scored from first on Kepler's double in the third. Kepler led off the fifth with his 10th homer of the year, and Sano added a two-run double in the sixth off Petit. Valbuena hit a towering homer to right field estimated at 459 feet to start the seventh, his sixth of the season. Andrelton Simmons had his third hit of the game in the eighth, and Maldonado followed with his ninth homer of the year. NOTES: Twins 2B Brian Dozier was scratched from the lineup due to lower back tightness. Manager Paul Molitor said he woke up with back spasms. The team said he is considered day to day. ... The Angels announced OF Mike Trout would be held out of the All-Star game as he recovers from left thumb surgery. Trout was elected to start for the fifth straight year but won't be ready in time. Manager Mike Scioscia said Trout would begin playing rehab games this week at Class A Inland Empire. ... Los Angeles RHP Matt Shoemaker will make a rehab start on Tuesday with Inland Empire as he tries to return from a right forearm extensor strain. Shoemaker is scheduled to pitch three or four innings and around 45 to 50 pitches. ... Following the game, Minnesota reinstated INF Ehire Adrianza from the disabled list after he finished rehab games for abdominal issues. DH/1B Kennys Vargas was optioned to Triple-A Rochester after going 1-for-4 with a walk.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED74JR3W43"},

The government said on Tuesday it appointed Mori, a 60-year-old career bureaucrat, as commissioner for Financial Services Agency (FSA) for his third one-year term, which starts this month. His re-appointment, which was widely expected, will likely mean a continuation of his reform agenda in the sector, which has sought to make financial services more customer-oriented and help improve the distribution of funds throughout the economy. A rarity among Japanese bureaucrats, Mori has become a very visible face of the relatively low-profile agency after he pushed through a raft of changes to the financial industry. In contrast to regulators in the U.S. and Europe, which have predominantly focused on managing and preventing financial crises, Japan's regulator has sought to change the financial system to improve the flow of money from households and businesses into economy. Under Mori, the FSA introduced a set of corporate governance measures to make the stock market more attractive to investors, such as boosting the number of external board directors to make Japanese corporate management more responsive to shareholders. Mori has held the financial industry partly responsible for the vast amount of household money sitting idle in bank deposits and criticised investment professionals for not working in the best interest of their clients.

The launch of the missile, which landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, came days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in Pyongyang's weapons programmes.       We can expect the missile launch to cause some backlash and a bit of risk-off among Asian investors at least for the rest of the week,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with AB Capital Securities.     Global crude oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Monday, but had little impact on Southeast Asian traders.     The Jakarta Composite Index led the losses in the region, falling 0.6 percent as consumer staples and telecommunication shares declined. Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) Tbk PT slipped as much as 2.7 percent and was the biggest drag on the index.     Indonesia is hoping for additional inflows worth $10 billion from pension funds and other institutional investors over the next two years, President Joko Widodo said, after Standard & Poor's on May 19 upgraded the country's credit rating to investment grade.      Philippine stocks also drifted lower, dragged down by real estate and industrial stocks.     A Reuters poll showed that the Philippines' annual inflation likely eased in June, a development that would further reduce chances of an interest rate hike this year.

Duterte, who has been in office one year, has vowed to usher in the  golden age of infrastructure  and spread wealth more evenly in the country of more than 100 million people. The anticipated 2018 budget compares with this year's 3.35 trillion peso spending plan and would be equivalent to 21.6 percent of gross domestic product, spokesman Ernesto Abella told a briefing. Abella did not state a revenue target for 2018. The government has said it plans to keep the country's budget deficit at 3 percent of GDP in the medium-term. The government has programmed a $180 billion spending spree on infrastructure during the president's six-year term to create jobs, lift economic growth to as high as 8 percent, and attract foreign investors turned off by high power prices and transport bottlenecks.

Rockies starter Jeff Hoffman (5-1) gave up three runs and four hits, two of them solo homers, in a career-high-tying seven innings, a distance he went for the first time at Coors Field. Colorado's Raimel Tapia finished a single shy of the cycle. He tripled and scored in the second, doubled in the third and hit his second homer of the season in the sixth to put the Rockies ahead 4-3. Tapia led off the eighth and struck out on three pitches. Hoffman faced just one batter with a runner in scoring position -- Joey Votto, when he hit a sacrifice fly in the first -- in his 90-pitch outing that included three walks and four strikeouts.  I felt like I moved the ball in and out pretty well for the most part,  Hoffman said.  I spun some good curveballs, some good sliders and was able to keep the ball off the barrel.  Hoffman also doubled home the Rockies' first run in the second. It was his first career RBI and extra-base hit. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RockiesCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchHe added to the offense provided by Tapia, who said he has never hit for the cycle and wasn't overly anxious in pursuit of a single on his final at-bat.  I was very normal,  Tapia said through a translator.  I was just kind of going up to the plate the same way I had all the rest of the time in the game, just looking for my pitches and it didn't turn out for me.  Rockies manager Bud Black said,  It's icing on the cake if he gets a single, but tonight was Tap Time.  The win was just the second in 12 games for the Rockies, who are trying to regroup after concluding a 1-8 road trip Sunday. They head into the All-Star break with a seven-game homestand against the Reds and Chicago White Sox, both last-place teams. Charlie Blackmon gave Colorado a 3-1 lead in the fourth with his 18th homer. The Rockies hit just four home runs and batted .211 on their nine-game trip while their starters went 1-5 with a 6.41 ERA. The Reds have lost 15 of their past 17 road games and are 12-27 on the road this season. Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly in the seventh completed the scoring after Blackmon led off with a walk, stole second and moved to third on DJ LeMahieu's hard shot that second baseman Scooter Gennett knocked down. Reds starter Luis Castillo (0-1) gave up nine hits and four runs in 5 2/3 innings with one walk and eight strikeouts. It was his third career start after being promoted to the Reds from Double-A Pensacola on June 23 to make his major league debut.  Really good stuff again,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  Really paid the price for pitching behind. Most of their hitters, when they did their damage, he was behind in the count. He was ahead of Tapia 1-2, ends up going to a full count. The kid sits on a fastball and (Castillo) ends up missing his location and (Tapia) hits it out to give them a 4-3 lead.  That being said, this kid's jumping from Double-A. I think he's got a little bit of trepidation on pounding the strike zone right now, which is not unusual for young pitchers. When he gets on the plate and turns those counts around from 1-0 to 0-1, I think he has a chance to be sensational.  The Reds forged a short-lived tie at 3 on back-to-back homers by Gennett and Votto to open the sixth. Gennett walloped a 1-0 changeup an estimated 452 feet into the second deck in right field for his 13th home run. Votto connected on a 3-0 fastball for his 24th home run that was also his 1,500th career hit. Jake McGee relieved Hoffman in the eighth and gave up a one-out single to Gennett but got the dangerous Votto to ground into an inning-ending double play. Colorado closer Greg Holland struck out two of the three batters he faced in the ninth and earned his 27th save in 28 opportunities.

Beijing is tentatively removing barriers to foreign issuers as it seeks to internationalise its renminbi or yuan currency and open up sources of finance for its planned  One Belt, One Road  trade route that stretches as far as Europe. Portugal, whose location on Europe's Atlantic coast is some 10,000 km (6,250 miles) from Beijing, further away than any of its euro zone peers, plans to sell  Panda  bonds -- debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland China.  In practical terms, the issue aims to diversify the sources of financing of Portugal, opening a new market for its debt, and support the internationalisation of the (renminbi),  a spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Antonio Costa told Reuters. He said strengthening trade links between the two countries would benefit both populations. Just a handful of foreign entities -- including sovereigns Poland and South Korea -- have sold Panda bonds in recent years, although Hong Kong's smaller, offshore, yuan-denominated  dim sum  market is well established. Panda bond issuance increased ninefold last year to 130 billion yuan ($19 billion), and is expected to grow by another 50 percent in 2017, according to JPMorgan. Stronger Ties Portugal's ties with China date back some 500 years to the settlement of Macau, the trading post-turned-gambling hub that was Europe's last colony in Asia until it was handed back to China in 1999, just as Portugal joined the euro. After a crippling recession that pushed the indebted country into a bailout in 2011, Chinese cash helped aid its recovery. Portugal is currently the top destination for Chinese investment in Europe as a share of its economy, according to figures from Spain's ESADE Business & Law School, and a number of Chinese firms have taken stakes in Portuguese companies. China Three Gorges owns 21 percent of Energias de Portugal while private conglomerate Fosun upped its stake in bank Millennium bcp to 24 percent in February. Last year, Costa told Chinese state television that Portugal wanted to  actively participate  in Beijing's plans to develop a maritime sea route as part of the trade route initiative, dubbed the new Silk Road. He highlighted port capacity at Sines in Portugal's south. Hong Kong-based Richard Mazzochi of law firm KWM, who has been involved in a number of Panda bond deals, said linking to a specific project could help get Portugal's planned debt sale off the ground.  Applications are easier to make where there is already an established connection and if an issuer would use the proceeds in connection with One Belt, One Road initiatives, that would be helpful,  he said. A deal could raise eyebrows among European authorities suspicious of China's plans to spread its global influence and concerned about transparency and access for foreign firms to the scheme. Major European countries have even mooted the idea of blocking Chinese investment on the continent. The EU is assessing whether a Beijing-funded rail project in Hungary, which has issued debt in China’s offshore market and is eyeing the onshore market, complies with EU law. Financial Reasons Finance Minister Mario Centeno told Reuters in May that selling a bond in the Chinese currency would allow Portugal to take advantage of growing demand for its debt, especially as a strengthening economy raises hopes for a credit rating upgrade. The planned end in December of the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme means diversifying into China -- the world's third-biggest debt market, behind the United States and Japan -- might appeal to other euro zone states. Contacted by Reuters, the debt offices of Ireland, Italy and Belgium said they were open to issuing in yuan, while France, Spain and the Netherlands said they had no such plans. A German government source said such a transaction  had been on the table one or two years ago  but for  cost reasons  Berlin decided against it. Bankers at Standard Chartered and HSBC told Reuters they were working with European sovereigns on deals, but gave no details. Although China is nervous about capital outflows, a foreign government issuing there would serve as an endorsement of plans to internationalise the currency and its standing as a global economic power. Mushtaq Kapasi, chief representative, Asia-Pacific at the International Capital Market Association, said Portugal's sovereign would also  give Chinese investors a level of trust . In October, the yuan was added to the International Monetary Fund's small basket of reserve currencies, while the ECB added the Chinese currency to its foreign reserves this year. Barriers to Entry Spencer Maclean, a banker at Standard Chartered, said a sovereign bond sale would be a  precursor  for private firms from the country to tap Chinese markets. But barriers to entry remain. Bankers told Reuters that some countries may be nervous about the legal framework under which the bonds would be sold. As Greece and Argentina experienced during their debt crises, it is hard to restructure bonds issued under foreign law. The most common concern expressed by issuers is whether they will be able to get the cash they have borrowed out of China.  The Chinese allow capital to flow in but it is still quite a challenging situation to convince the Chinese to use the proceeds abroad,  said Alexander Liebethal, head of new issues at German development bank KfW, which has issued in the Chinese offshore market.  If you look at the Panda market you will see a lot of issuers active there that have operations in China, like some German car manufacturers.  New guidelines on Panda bonds expected from Chinese regulators should add some clarity, bankers and lawyers said. And for all that Portugal's deal is innovative, it may not be imminent.  These sort of projects take time,  said Portugal's debt agency chief Cristina Casalinho.  It would be a novelty for us.

Fitch has assigned a VR to IBK based on our view that IBK's operations have a significant commercial orientation, rather than being largely driven by its policy role, unlike the operations of the other two banks, which have no assigned VRs. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR, SENIOR DEBT AND MARKET-LINKED NOTES The IDRs and Support Rating Floors of the three key policy banks are equalised with the IDRs of the South Korean sovereign (AA-/Stable). The ratings, along with the Support Ratings of '1', reflect Fitch's expectation that there is an extremely high likelihood the state will provide support to the banks, if needed. The expectation is based on the important policy roles the three banks carry out for the country's economy, the government's controlling ownership of the banks and the government's de facto solvency guarantee stated in their respective establishment acts. Under the acts, the government is obliged to make up for any losses incurred by the banks that are not covered by their reserves. KDB's policy role is to provide credit for fostering local industries, developing social infrastructures and resources and supporting corporate restructuring. Its policy role has been highlighted in recent years as it was part of the government's effort to restructure troubled shipping and shipbuilding companies. KDB is 100% directly owned by the government. KEXIM offers credit to exporters, importers and overseas investment projects. KEXIM specialises in providing loans and guarantees to overseas construction and vessel manufacturing projects with long-term maturity, which commercial banks shy away from. The bank is effectively under full government ownership (73% directly, 16% through KDB and 11% through the Bank of Korea at end-2016). IBK's policy mandate is to build up an efficient credit system for viable SMEs. Its policy function stands out when the financial system is under stress as the bank extends more credit to SMEs when commercial banks reduce their SME exposure. Fitch believes that the government is committed to keeping its controlling ownership of the bank (52% of the common equity directly, 2% through KDB and 2% through KEXIM at end-2016). The Stable Outlook on the three policy banks' Long-Term IDRs reflects that of South Korea's sovereign rating. The ratings of their senior unsecured debt, including global medium-term notes (GMTNs), US commercial paper (CP) and certificate of deposit (CD) programmes, are the same as the respective banks' Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the banks. The rating on KEXIM's senior market-linked notes also reflects the principal-protected nature of the notes while the coupons vary based on market indicators. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Korea Development Bank, New York Branch is a branch of KDB. The rating on the branch's US CP programme is aligned with KDB's short-term debt rating because the CP programme's rating is sensitive to the same factors driving a change in KDB's short-term debt. IBK VR IBK's 'a-' VR is mainly driven by the bank's strong company profile backed by its sound risk-minded corporate culture and South Korea's resilient economy. With a significant local franchise (commanding about 22% and 13% of the system's SME loans and retail funding, respectively), IBK has a strong track record of delivering consistent performance through-the-cycle. The VR also takes into account disadvantages IBK has as a countercyclical policy lender especially when the banking system is under stress, as it is less flexible than the system's pure commercial banks. These disadvantages are in part offset by the ordinary support from its controlling shareholder, the government, particularly in terms of funding and capitalisation. IBK's SME-focused business model with its relatively limited large corporate exposure (5% at end-2016 vs. about 15% average of the local commercial banks) has helped IBK maintain a stable asset quality over the last decade. We view the universe of Korea's SME borrowers as well diversified and deep. Moreover, IBK's low single-borrower concentration in its loan portfolio, together with adequate risk-based pricing, has limited the risk of significant unexpected losses. IBK's ratio of loans classified as precautionary and below (2.9% at end-1Q17) as per the local regulator's loan-quality categorisation is likely to remain worse than the local commercial bank average (1.7%) given the relatively high underlying credit risks of SMEs compared with other stable sectors, such as mortgages. Nonetheless, the ratio has been quite stable, reflecting IBK's fairly diversified SME clientele. IBK's loan book is largely secured with collaterals and guarantees and its impaired loan losses have better reserve coverage than the average of local commercial banks. We expect IBK's Fitch Core Capital ratio (10.0% at end-1Q17) to gradually improve in the medium term given the bank's plan to moderate loan growth. The ratio has been notably lagging behind the local commercial bank average (13.4%), reflecting its relatively strong loan growth and the higher risk weighting applied to its SME exposure compared with household lending, the focus of many commercial banks in recent years. We also expect IBK to benefit from continued ordinary capital support from the government. IBK's loans-to-customer-deposits ratio (adjusted for loans and deposits to/from financial institutions as well as its debentures sold through retail branches) has been worse (130% at end-2016) than the commercial bank average (112%). IBK has strong access to the wholesale capital market, benefiting from investors' strong confidence in potential ordinary support from IBK's controlling shareholder. Fitch estimates IBK's underlying profitability, measured by operating profits/risk-weighted assets, to be about 1.1% in the near term. The ratio (1.0% in 2016) has been marginally better and less volatile than local commercial banks' (0.8%) for the last four years under the low interest rate and stable credit cost environment. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR, SENIOR DEBT AND MARKET-LINKED NOTES The three key policy banks' IDRs, Support Ratings, Support Rating Floors, senior debt and market-linked notes' ratings are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions about the banks' relationship with the South Korean government and the sovereign's rating. They would be directly affected by changes to South Korea's ratings or to the solvency guarantee under the policy banks' establishment acts. Fitch does not expect any significant changes to either in the near to medium term. IBK VR An upgrade may be prompted by sustainable improvement in the operating environment, which may further solidify its business model and financial profile. A significant improvement in its capitalisation may also cause an upgrade. Conversely, downgrade pressure may arise from a significant deterioration in the operating environment and/or its risk appetite, which may pressure asset quality and capitalisation. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES KDB New York Branch's US CP programme rating is sensitive to the factors driving KDB's short-term debt. The rating actions are as follows: KDB Long-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable Short-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F1+' Support Rating affirmed at '1' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'AA-' Senior unsecured debt (including GMTN programme) affirmed at 'AA-' Short-term debt (including US CP programme and GMTN programme) affirmed at 'F1+' KDB, New York Branch US CP programme affirmed at 'F1+' KEXIM Long-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable Short-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F1+' Support Rating affirmed at '1' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'AA-' Senior unsecured debt (including GMTN programme) affirmed at 'AA-' Market-linked securities affirmed at 'AA-(emr)' IBK Long-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable Short-term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F1+' Viability Rating assigned at 'a-' Support Rating affirmed at '1' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'AA-' Senior unsecured debt (including CD programme) affirmed at 'AA-' Short-Term CD programme affirmed at 'F1+' Contact: Primary Analyst Matt Choi Associate Director +82 2 3278 8372 Fitch Australia Pty Ltd, Korea Branch 9F Kyobo Securities Building 97, Uisadang-daero, Yeongdeungpo-Gu Seoul 07327, South Korea Secondary Analyst Heakyu Chang Senior Director +82 2 3278 8363 Committee Chairperson Parson Singha, CFA Senior Director +662 108 0151 Summary of Data Adjustments - The analysts have made the following assumptions in analyzing the loan-to-customer-deposits ratio: - Customer deposits: IBK has a practice of selling its own debentures directly through its retail branches (in an amount which is publicly disclosed). We assume such funding is sticky enough to be considered as a type of customer deposit, and can be included in an adjusted loan-to-customer- deposit ratio.

The CSI300 index fell 0.8 percent, to 3,620.69 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent, to 3,180.03 points.  The recent correction is technical as blue-chips had far outperformed the broader market this year, but we see little chances for a major downturn in industry-leading big-caps as they are not overvalued,  said Xu Wei, an analyst with Hongxin Securities. The robust trend in China's  nifty 50 , the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai, is broadening to the so-called  MSCI222 , and investors could explore opportunities in blue-chips with solid fundamentals as rotation into those stocks is very prominent, Xu added. U.S. index provider MSCI last month decided to add 222 China-listed stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion. The inclusion is widely expected to benefit the long-term development of China's stock market, in particular blue-chips. Worries over tight liquidity conditions have eased after the mid-year macro-prudential assessment (MPA), although sellers have been pressuring Chinese markets over the past week or so on lingering fears of a cash crunch and slowing economic growth. China's central bank injected a net 99.5 billion yuan ($14.64 billion) into the financial system via short-and medium-term liquidity tools in June, up 95 percent from the previous month, to ease tight cash conditions at the end of the quarter. The central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in coming months as a deleveraging drive threatens economic growth and job creation ahead of a leadership reshuffle, policy insiders said. Sectors fell across the board in the morning, led by financials, and the defensive consumer and healthcare stocks. Hong Kong stocks lagged the broader Asian markets, which rose on strength in Europe and the United States. The Hang Seng index dropped 1.1 percent, to 25,497.94 points. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.8 percent, to 10,333.25. Most sectors lost ground, with heavyweight financials and other industry-leading companies mirroring a correction in mainland blue-chips.

Deutsche Bank said in a note that the climb in coal prices came on the back of factors including weather-related mining outages in producers such as Indonesia and South Africa, as well as an Australian strike in June that briefly hit output.  Strikes in the Hunter Valley in Australia (in June) may have given coal prices a boost in the near-term ... Heavy rains and flooding in Indonesia are restricting production and constraining exports ... At Richards Bay port in South Africa, poor weather has prevented loadings and decreased vessels leaving the port,  said the German bank. Meanwhile, huge rainfall in China has forced the world's biggest power station, the around 20,000 megawatt (MW) Three Gorges dam, to reduce its capacity by 6,000 MW to ease pressure from the downpour.  The scale of shutdown is quite unprecedented,  said Li Rong, power analyst with consultancy SIA Energy. Other hydro dams were also affected, bringing the total capacity reduction to 13,500 MW. Traders said that it would take the equivalent of at least a dozen large fossil fuel or nuclear power stations to make up for the hydro restrictions. Similar rainfall last year helped trigger a large coal price rise which took many in the market by surprise and which was compounded by sudden output restrictions on Chinese miners, forcing utilities to turn to imports to meet their demand. Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that accumulative precipitation levels have surged far above the seasonal norms in most of China's southern, southwestern, eastern, and central provinces, where almost all the country's large hydro dams are located. China's northern provinces, by contrast, are experiencing unusually dry and hot weather, which has pushed up power demand in that region, traders said. Despite the current run, coal markets remain well supplied in the long term, and that this could weigh on prices down the line.  The recent strength in coal price may not last as the coal market becomes more balanced in 2017,  Deutsche said.

The deal is also boost for the Hong Kong bourse, which has failed to attract a significant volume of technology deals despite being the world's top destination for new listings in 2016. The company, which is looking to raise funds for potential acquisitions and expand its mobile reading business, has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley as sponsors of the offering, it said in a filing late on Monday. Although the structure of the deal was not disclosed,  Tencent has said it plans to hold at least 50 percent of China Literature after the spin off and that the offering will consist of 15 percent of the firm's enlarged share capital. Thomson Reuters publication IFR has previously reported that the deal could raise between $600 million and $800 million. China Literature has a business akin to Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Store, operating a platform with 8.4 million literary works from 5.3 million writers. The firm saw revenues jump 59 percent last year to 2.6 billion yuan ($377 million), while it posted a net profit of 30.4 million yuan, compared with a loss of 354.2 million yuan a year earlier. It is its first net profit since it began disclosing financial data in 2014. Tencent started its online reading business in 2004 and it grew substantially after the acquisition of Cloudary Corp in 2014 for $729.6 million. Cloudary had filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011 and 2012, before withdrawing the listing application in 2013  due to market conditions , the filing showed.

State lawmakers were finalizing the bill and legislators and the governor said they would stay as long as it took on Monday night and into Tuesday morning to craft and sign it. Christie said all state parks and beaches would be open on Tuesday for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday. He said he was happy a resolution had been reached on the budget impasse, but saddened it came three days late. New Jersey State Senate President Steve Sweeney told a news conference:  None of this was easy.   I think this is a good day because everything will be open,  Sweeney said. Christie became the subject of widespread mockery and derision after a New Jersey newspaper captured photos of the Republican governor and his family sunbathing on a beach that had been closed to the public over the holiday weekend due to the budget standoff. The saga, dubbed  beachgate  by some media outlets, threw a spotlight on stalled budget negotiations that caused partial government shutdowns in New Jersey and in Maine, and led to the suspension of many non-essential services. New Jersey's state parks closed on Saturday, forcing many to alter their holiday weekend plans. More than 30,000 state workers were on furlough on Monday. In Maine, the state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue all planned to work through the shutdown, the state's first since 1991. But the majority of its 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. Members of Maine's State Employees Association rallied outside the State House to demand a budget deal from lawmakers and Republican Governor Paul LePage.  Governor LePage won't answer his door - we want to work!  organizers posted on Twitter, with photos and videos of dozens of the association's members holding placards and chanting. About 10 U.S. states still do not have budgets for the fiscal year that began on July 1, including Illinois, which is in its third year without an enacted budget. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. In some states without full budgets, including Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them. 'I'll Go Back to Beach' On Monday, Christie noted that 119 miles (190 km) of the state's 130 miles (210 km) of beaches were open, and that it was  another beautiful day  at the Jersey shore.  Come and enjoy them - but use sunscreen and hydrate!  he wrote on Twitter. A spokesman for Christie, a former Republican presidential candidate who is in the last year of his final term, said Christie had been on the beach in front of the governor's residence for only 45 minutes. Christie had said he would not sign the state's budget unless it included a reshaping of the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said the agreement to end the partial government shutdown was reached after long talks in  crisis  mode on Monday with Horizon and state legislators. Christie also promised not to remove from the budget any of the $150 million in school funding and other items from the budget that he threatened to veto last weekend if the legislature did not pass a bill to reform Horizon. He seemed unfazed by the controversy over his time at the beach at the weekend.  Whenever I get done tonight, I'll go back to the beach,  Christie told reporters on Monday night.  That's where my family is.

Simultaneously, Fitch has assigned CP ALL's up to THB3 billion of new senior unsecured bonds due in 2027 an 'A-(tha)' National Long-Term Rating. The subordinated perpetual debentures, which are payable upon dissolution and give the issuer rights to early redemption and unconditional interest deferral, qualify for 50% equity credit under Fitch's  Non-Financial Corporates Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria . This categorisation is supported by the subordination of the debentures to other debt, the debentures' deemed effective maturity of more than five years, and the issuer's right to defer coupon payments. Fitch assesses the effective maturity of the subordinated perpetual debentures to be on the 10th anniversary of the issuance, due to the debentures' coupon step-up of over 100bp from year 11. Therefore, the 50% equity credit will change to 0% five years before the effective maturity date. The rating on the senior unsecured bonds is one notch below CP ALL's 'A(tha)' National Long-Term Rating due to a significant amount of prior-ranking debt, which made up 3.7x of the company's EBITDA in the 12 months to March 2017. The proceeds from the bonds will be used for refinancing maturing bonds and for working capital. KEY RATING DRIVERS Rating Reflects Deep Subordination: The perpetual debentures have been notched down by three notches from CP ALL's National Long-Term Rating because of their deep subordination and higher-than-usual loss-absorption. The debentures are notched down from the National Rating by more than the standard two notches due to a significant amount of prior ranking debt, which also results in CP ALL's senior unsecured debt being rated one notch below the company's rating. High Financial Leverage: Fitch expects CP ALL's FFO-adjusted net leverage to gradually decrease to about 4.0x in 2018. CP ALL has been deleveraging more slowly than previously expected (i.e. below 3.5x by 2018) because of a weak domestic economy over the past two years. Sales of shares in subsidiary Siam Makro Public Company Limited (Makro) are also unlikely to be carried out over the next 12-18 months. Moderate-but-Defensive Growth: Fitch expects CP ALL's sales to increase by 9%-10% per year in 2017-2018, driven mainly by new store openings and a recovery in same-store sales growth to 3.0%-4.0% a year for both 7-Eleven and Makro stores (1Q17: 1.2% and 2.4%, respectively), in line with the domestic economic recovery. The company also continues to benefit from the  defensive  nature of its business, which sells daily essentials with low revenue and margin volatility; its medium-term growth potential is still supported by Thailand's immature market for modern-food retailing. Leading Market Position: We believe CP ALL is likely to maintain its leading position despite intense competition. The company has more than 9,700 stores nationwide, and a more-than-60% share of the convenience-store market in Thailand, far more than its closest rival. Its dominance is supported by its large network and coverage area, along with well-established functions such as logistics, supply and maintenance, and staff training and development. Strong Retail Brand: CP ALL operates 7-Eleven stores, a leading international brand of convenience chain stores. CP ALL was granted an area licence agreement for Thailand from 7-Eleven, Inc., USA, with the first store opening in 1989. Thailand is now the second-largest international licensee of 7-Eleven, Inc., after Japan. DERIVATION SUMMARY CP ALL has a strong domestic market position as the largest convenience store chain in Thailand, similar to The Siam Cement Public Company Limited (SCC, A(tha)/Positive), the largest cement and downstream petrochemicals producer in Thailand and Thai Oil Public Company Limited (TOP, AA-(tha)/Stable), the largest oil refiner in Thailand. However, CP ALL has a stronger competitive position, with its market share significantly larger than that of its closest rival. CP ALL also has lower business risk than SCC and TOP, which are exposed to cyclical demand for their products and the fluctuation of commodity price. This is reflected in CP ALL's more stable EBITDAR margin. CP ALL's financial leverage is, however, significantly higher than both peers, due to the debt incurred from the leveraged buy-out of Makro in 2013. Given the sector's low capital intensiveness, CP ALL's financial leverage should decrease over time. CP ALL's lower business risk should compensate for its higher financial leverage than SCC. However, the financial leverage of TOP, which is very low at about 1.0x, warrants a higher rating. TOP's credit rating is also notched up to reflect its linkage to the PTT group. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth of 9%-10% per year in 2017-2018; - EBITDAR margin to improve to 10.2%-10.4% in 2017-2018; - 700 new 7-Eleven stores per year in 2017-2018 and four new large-format stores per year for Makro in 2017-2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - FFO-adjusted net leverage at less than 3.5x (end-March 2017: 5.3x) Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - A failure to reduce FFO-adjusted net leverage to below 4.5x by 2018 - Deterioration in EBITDAR margin to below 7.5% on a sustained basis (1Q17: 10.4%) LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: CP ALL had total debt of THB193 billion as of end-March 2017. About 10.4% will be due in the 12 months from end-March 2017. About 94% of total debt is Thai baht bonds, 69% of which are secured by Makro shares. The liquidity is mainly supported by its cash balance of THB24.7 billion at end-March 2017, its strong cash flow generation as well as its strong access to debt capital markets.

The Outlook is Stable. The fixed-rate bond is due in July 2024, and benefits from a 12-month extendable maturity. Series 10 is issued by BNZ International Funding Limited (BNZ-IF), a guaranteed issuing vehicle used for international funding by BNZ. This brings the total outstanding issuance from the programme to NZD5.1 billion, with offshore issuance through BNZ-IF accounting for 81.3% of total issuance. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on BNZ's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', an IDR uplift of zero notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches, a recovery uplift of one notch and an asset percentage (AP) of 83.3%, which is the highest nominal AP over the past 12 months and provides a substantial buffer of protection compared to Fitch's breakeven AP of 90.5%. The AP supports a 'AA+' tested rating on a probability-of-default basis and a 'AAA' rating after giving credit for recoveries from the cover assets given default of the covered bonds. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds reflects the four-notch buffer against a downgrade of the bank's IDR. The 'AAA' breakeven AP of 90.5% corresponds to a breakeven overcollateralisation (OC) of 10.5% and is driven by the asset disposal loss component of 14.7%, reflecting the significant maturity mismatches modelled in the programme, with the weighted-average residual life of the assets at 13.9 years and the liabilities at 3.2 years. The credit loss component contributes 3.6% and the cash flow valuation component decreases the OC by 8.2%, representing the excess spread modelled by Fitch in the programme. The rating's recovery uplift is capped at one notch, as foreign-exchange risk could affect recoveries given a default of the covered bonds. Although there are swaps in place on the liabilities denominated in euros, we expect those swaps to terminate upon a covered bond default. This would mean the longer-dated New Zealand dollar asset cash flows would be providing recoveries for the euro-denominated covered bonds. RATING SENSITIVITIES Bank of New Zealand's covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the AP we rely upon rises above the breakeven AP of 90.5% or the bank's IDR fell below 'BBB+'. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among other things, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the 'AAA' breakeven AP, which maintains the covered bond rating, will remain stable over time.

LOUIS -- As first big-league homers go, Luke Voit couldn't have picked a better place to launch his. Capping a four-RBI game, the St. Louis-area native blasted a two-run shot in the bottom of the eighth inning Monday night, finishing off the Cardinals' 14-6 blowout of the Miami Marlins. Voit ripped a 3-2 fastball from Jarlin Garcia 429 feet to the grassy knoll behind the center field wall. The crowd of 42,694 showered him with a long ovation, eventually getting the rookie's first career curtain call. Making his third career start at first base as manager Mike Matheny shifted Matt Carpenter to second, Voit also lined an RBI double that started a seven-run third inning and polished off a four-run rally in the first with a run-scoring groundout. However, the long ball was the marquee moment in a game all about offense. The teams combined for 28 hits, none more notable that Voit's last one.  I was looking for something,  he said.  I knew (Garcia) was going to blow it by me, and I was ready for it.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at CardinalsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchVoit knew it was gone when it left his bat, doing a little hop when he left the box that inspired a comparison from winning pitcher Adam Wainwright.  He did a little Sammy Sosa,  Wainwright quipped.  He's hit a few homers; he knows when we gets them. I'm glad he got to do that here.  Voit was one of many offensive stars in a season-high outburst for St. Louis (40-42), which is 7-2 in its last nine games and remained 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Central. Tommy Pham went 3-for-3 with two walks, scoring twice and knocking in two runs. His RBI triple to center past a diving Christian Yelich initiated the scoring. Yadier Molina also went 3-for-3, doubling twice and driving in three runs. Molina came within inches of a five-RBI game, but his drive to right-center with the bases loaded and two outs in the third thumped off the top of the wall, leaving him with a two-run double instead of a grand slam. That was the last act in a forgettable evening for Miami starter Jeff Locke (0-5), who tied a career and franchise high by allowing 11 runs over 2 2/3 innings. Locke, whose ERA soared from 5.52 to 8.16, gave up 11 hits and four walks while striking out two.  They did all the damage they needed to do in the first inning,  Locke said.  It got out of hand real fast.  Wainwright (9-5) couldn't escape the carnage on this night. Miami roughed him up for six runs in the fifth inning, getting a two-run single from Tyler Moore, a three-run double from Marcell Ozuna and an RBI double from Justin Bour. However, all that did was reduce an 11-0 lead to 11-6. Wainwright still qualified for the victory despite giving up six runs on eight hits in five innings. He walked one and fanned eight, punching out Giancarlo Stanton three times. Wainwright also contributed to the St. Louis attack, lacing a two-run single in the third. In his career against Locke, Wainwright is 6-for-13 with seven RBI.  I've faced him a lot,  Wainwright said.  He's struck me out quite a bit, and he got me tonight, but I've seen the ball well against him.  Every Cardinal starter picked up a hit or scored a run. Shortstop Paul DeJong was the only one who didn't hit safely, and he was intentionally passed prior to Wainwright's hit that made it a 7-1 game. J.T. Realmuto rapped out three hits for the Marlins (36-45), while JT Riddle added two. NOTES: St. Louis 3B Jedd Gyorko left the game in the bottom of the fifth for PH Alex Mejia, suffering from a cramp in his left leg. Gyorko went 2-for-2 with a run and an RBI. ... St. Louis recalled RHP Luke Weaver from Triple-A Memphis and optioned RHP Mike Mayers to Memphis. Weaver, who was 7-1 with a 1.93 ERA in 11 starts for the Redbirds, pitched a scoreless sixth inning Monday for the Cardinals. ... Miami OF Marcell Ozuna's two-homer performance Sunday in Milwaukee marked his third of the year. Only the Dodgers' Cody Bellinger (six) and the Mets' Jay Bruce (four) own more multi-homer games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-marlins-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED74JPE831"},

The deal is also boost for the Hong Kong bourse, which has failed to attract a significant volume of technology deals despite being the world's top destination for new listings in 2016. The company, which is looking to raise funds for potential acquisitions and expand its mobile reading business, has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley as sponsors of the offering, it said in a filing late on Monday. Although the structure of the deal was not disclosed,  Tencent has said it plans to hold at least 50 percent of China Literature after the spin off and that the offering will consist of 15 percent of the firm's enlarged share capital. Thomson Reuters publication IFR has previously reported that the deal could raise between $600 million and $800 million. China Literature has a business akin to Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Store, operating a platform with 8.4 million literary works from 5.3 million writers. The firm saw revenues jump 59 percent last year to 2.6 billion yuan ($377 million), while it posted a net profit of 30.4 million yuan, compared with a loss of 354.2 million yuan a year earlier. It is its first net profit since it began disclosing financial data in 2014. Tencent started its online reading business in 2004 and it grew substantially after the acquisition of Cloudary Corp in 2014 for $729.6 million. Cloudary had filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011 and 2012, before withdrawing the listing application in 2013  due to market conditions , the filing showed. Tencent controls China Literature with a 62 percent stake. Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP owns 12.2 percent while Trustbridge Partners, a private equity firm founded by Shujun Li, the former CFO of Shanda Interactive, holds 6 percent. Fundraising by tech firms in Hong Kong accounted for an average 2.5 percent of all IPOs since the global financial crisis in 2008, Thomson Reuters data shows. That compares with 13.6 percent for the New York Stock Exchange.
