But to continue the strong run, it may hope the iPhone maker does better as well.The South Korean tech giant said Friday it expects its operating profit for the quarter ended June to be a record 14 trillion won ($12.1 billion)\u2014a 72% jump from a year earlier. On the other hand, Apple will likely report an operating profit of $10.6 billion for its latest quarter when it announces results next month, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Rising memory chip prices, driven by strong demand from servers and mobile, have likely contributed to Samsung\u2019s strong results\u2014the company hasn\u2019t provided many details at this point. About 60% of its operating profit comes from the semiconductor business, according to Morgan Stanley. The March launch of its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, has also helped. Apple, on the other hand, continues to see slowing iPhone sales.Still, strong sales of the newest iPhone model, expected later this year, could actually benefit Samsung. The Korean company will supply flexible displays, called organic light-emitting diodes, to at least one version of the new phone, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Samsung currently owns nearly the whole market for mobile OLEDs. Apple probably wants to source from other suppliers\u2014like Korea\u2019s LG Display\u2014as well, but supply from such companies won\u2019t likely come until late next year.Even though Samsung supplies memory chips to Apple as well, the business accounts for less than 5% of the company\u2019s operating profit,         Credit Suisse               estimated. The more salient impact from the so-called iPhone \u201csupercycle,\u201d as some analysts call it, is that it will likely keep memory chip prices buoyant.While Samsung and Apple are sometimes depicted as arch rivals, their relationship is actually one of mutual benefit right now.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 23:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worlds-most-profitable-tech-company-not-apple-1499398067", "news_title": "The World\u2019s Most Profitable Tech Company?

He was charged with conspiring to defraud the U.S., violating the Clean Air Act, and wire fraud.Mr. Pamio, described by the Justice Department as a 60-year-old Italian citizen, couldn\u2019t be located for comment. A Volkswagen spokeswoman said the company \u201ccontinues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters.\u201dThe case, filed as a criminal complaint, suggests the Justice Department under President       Donald Trump       is continuing to pursue a case that became a signature prosecution of the Obama administration.Volkswagen agreed to plead guilty in January, after it admitted in 2015 that it had rigged nearly 11 million diesel vehicles world-wide, including some 600,000 in the U.S., to cheat on emissions tests. The cars produced toxic tailpipe emissions up to 40 times the allowable limits during normal road use. The company\u2019s admission set off a whirlwind of civil litigation and a criminal investigation into the company and many of its senior executives.Regulators also found similar conduct at Audi, Volkswagen\u2019s luxury unit. German police raided the homes of two Audi executives earlier this year.Italy has an extradition treaty with the U.S., which could make it easier for U.S. prosecutors to gain custody of Mr. Pamio. A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment on Mr. Pamio\u2019s whereabouts.According to the Justice Department, Mr. Pamio led a team of engineers responsible for designing emissions-control systems to meet regulatory standards from 2006 until November 2015, after the Volkswagen emissions scandal became public.Volkswagen\u2019s legal settlements stemming from its emissions fraud could exceed $25 billion in the U.S. alone depending on how many vehicles the auto maker is forced to repurchase. Volkswagen has reached settlements in the U.S. with consumers, regulators, dealers, state attorneys general and federal prosecutors.Other individuals have been indicted in the U.S. as a result of the emissions deception. A Volkswagen engineer who pleaded guilty to criminal conduct is scheduled to be sentenced later this month. A former head of Volkswagen\u2019s Michigan environment and engineering office is in custody awaiting trial. Several other Volkswagen employees who were charged are believed to reside in Germany and aren\u2019t likely to be extradited.Corrections & Amplifications   Seven people were indicted in connection with the emissions scandal at Volkswagen.

Jerry Moran is usually a reliable supporter of his party\u2019s leadership, but he spent more than an hour Thursday poking holes in the GOP health bill at an overcrowded forum in this town of 278 people.As more than a hundred of Mr. Moran\u2019s constituents from across the state peppered him with questions about the Senate bill, which he said he would oppose, he outlined a range of concerns, from the severity of its Medicaid cuts to the ways it would affect people with pre-existing medical conditions.One attendee, Cheryl Hofstetter Duffy, an English professor from nearby Hays, asked Mr. Moran if he would consider \u201cbuilding on\u201d the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, rather than repealing it. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us who support the ACA think it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Ms. Duffy said. \u201cWhy not work together to take what was a start and in my view an improvement, and make it better?\u201dMr. Moran agreed. \u201cOn the broad array of things, we have no choice but to work together and find a solution,\u201d he said.As such exchanges suggested, GOP leaders, so far, don\u2019t appear to be getting the response they had wanted during Congress\u2019s recess. None of the nine Republicans opposing the health bill has publicly discussed a change of heart; one additional Republican\u2014Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota\u2014said Thursday he, too, was opposed.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who is scrambling to assemble a revised version that can attract more support, can afford to lose only two of the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans and still pass the bill.Mr. McConnell, speaking in Glasgow, Ky., said Thursday that if the GOP bill fails, Congress will have to pass legislation to strengthen the nation\u2019s insurance marketplaces, according to the Associated Press.Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader, seized on those comments. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that Sen. McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the exchanges are fixable and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our health care system,\u201d he said.At Mr. Moran\u2019s town-hall meeting, no one spoke out in support of the Republican bill, though one voter sharply criticized the 2010 law, calling it \u201csocialized medicine.\u201dMr. Moran said that rather than continue to push a flawed bill, GOP leaders should pursue negotiations with Democrats, including public hearings and amendments from both sides. He spoke repeatedly about fixing or repairing the law, saying it has \u201cbenefited some people.\u201dFor Mr. Moran, the first GOP senator to sponsor legislation repealing the ACA after its passage in 2010, his stance marked a stark shift. Uprooting the law was Mr. Moran\u2019s central campaign pledge in 2014 when he served as chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm that helped the party retake the chamber.Mr. Moran\u2019s decision to distance himself from the GOP bill illustrates the depth of Mr. McConnell\u2019s challenge because he is considered close to the party leadership.\u201cHe\u2019s not one of those problematic Republicans you tend to think of,\u201d said Patrick Miller, a political-science professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cThis is weird for him. He\u2019s a team player.\u201dAcross the country, Mr. Moran was one of three Senate Republicans to hold town hall-style meetings this week, along with Sens.       Bill Cassidy       of Louisiana and Ted Cruz of Texas. In the absence of such public events, the law\u2019s supporters have held protests outside senators\u2019 home-state offices and blanketed airwaves with advertisements.There is little public evidence that GOP leaders are close to a revised proposal that would satisfy their party\u2019s vociferous factions. Mr. McConnell is awaiting an assessment by the Congressional Budget Office of a proposal from Mr. Cruz that would let insurers who sell at least one plan that complies with the law\u2019s regulations also sell plans that don\u2019t.Republicans remain divided on that proposal and on how much to cut federal spending for Medicaid, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.Mr. Moran made public his opposition to the GOP bill in late June, after Mr. McConnell had already postponed the vote, saying it \u201cmissed the mark\u201d for Kansas. On Thursday, he elaborated by saying that Medicaid cuts, which he called \u201cunrelated\u201d to the bill\u2019s primary mission, could hurt children and people with disabilities and potentially force many of the state\u2019s rural hospitals to close.Mr. Moran, a proponent of increased federal spending for cancer research, also said he was concerned the bill didn\u2019t offer adequate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cIf we are doing all this research to find a cure for cancer\u2026you also have to have in place the necessary financial ability for people to participate in the program,\u201d he said.Mark Read, a 49-year-old software developer who traveled with his 13-year-old son, Robert, from Kansas City, said he buys insurance for his family from the state\u2019s ACA marketplace and hasn\u2019t heard any persuasive arguments in favor of the GOP plan.Mr. Read, a Republican who voted for Mr. Moran, said he would base future votes for Mr. Moran and other politicians on their stances against the bill.Mr. Moran hasn\u2019t closed the door on voting in favor of a revised bill, and when he said so he was greeted with boos.\u201cIf the bill gets to the point where it satisfies my requirements, it could get my vote,\u201d he said, then paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say about that.\u201d\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Mark Read is a 49-year-old software developer.

AAPL 0.63%       is outdated, China\u2019s big technology companies are innovation-killing monopolies and his company, LeEco Holdings, is the real industry disrupter.That swagger served Mr. Jia in building an empire that sprawled across seven industries, from online video content to smartphones to electric cars. By having the ambition to take on Apple,             Tesla Inc.        TSLA -0.91%       and             Netflix Inc.        NFLX 0.14%       all at once, Mr. Jia seemed to embody the boundless promise of the huge China market. And investors responded favorably.Deal makers like HNA Capital and             Legend Holdings        3396 -0.71%       bought in, as did the city government of tech hub Shenzhen, as well as movie director Zhang Yimou and other celebrities. British sports car maker Aston Martin joined up to develop electric vehicles. The U.S. state of Nevada promised $200 million in incentives for Mr. Jia\u2019s electric car venture, Faraday Futures Inc., to build a $1 billion plant there. And LeEco unveiled a $2 billion deal to buy U.S. TV-maker Vizio Inc.Now, most of those deals are dead or struggling and Mr. Jia\u2019s dreams are fading away due to a cash crunch and worried creditors.On Thursday he resigned as chairman of a listed unit of LeEco, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp., though he will remain the chairman of the holding company. That move comes after a Shanghai court last week\u2014at the behest of             China Merchants Bank Co.      \u2014froze $181 million worth of his assets and $2 billion in shares over a missed interest payment.Rather than being a shining star of visionary entrepreneurship, LeEco is turning into a cautionary tale of the hype surrounding China tech. The lesson for investors: When it comes to Chinese tech companies, the rules of economics still apply.LeEco\u2019s overexpansion and financial problems were well-known in investment circles. Mr. Jia said publicly that his company was perpetually short of cash. Some investors marveled at his ability to spin attractive narratives that boosted the stock prices and private funding valuations of his ventures.Zhang Yiming, managing director of private-equity firm Commando Capital in Beijing, has likened Mr. Jia\u2019s funding methods to \u201cwire-walking between cliffs.\u201d\u201cMany people in the capital market view him as a fraud because his new businesses are burning a lot of cash but he just keeps telling new stories. As long as 10 out of 100 people believe him, he will have investors,\u201d Mr. Zhang told me in an interview last year.Mr. Zhang said he holds the same view now but doesn\u2019t want to say more for fear of being seen as trashing Mr. Jia at a difficult time.In a letter posted on his official social media account Thursday, Mr. Jia noted that he is still LeEco Holdings\u2019 biggest shareholder and he promised to repay loans and overdue payments\u2014if creditors give the company more time.\u2018The fall of LeEco does not come as a surprise. When you use hype to stretch reality, reality usually wins.\u2019\u201cPlease give LeEco some time, please give LeEco car some time, we will pay back creditors, suppliers and any other debts,\u201d Mr. Jia wrote. Neither LeEco nor Mr. Jia responded to requests for comment Thursday.Aston Martin says its partnership with LeEco didn\u2019t carry any financial or technical liabilities for itself. Vizio didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Nevada\u2019s state treasurer\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, though it has said no state bonds will be issued until Faraday proves it can finance the project.China\u2019s tech boom has been looking like a bubble for some time, with vast pools of investment flooding into new ventures since the old manufacture-and-export economy started slowing. Tech blogs, many of them backed by venture capital funds, have churned out hosannas about these new ventures. Among the recent darlings: platforms to share bikes, umbrellas and battery packs to recharge mobile phones.\u201cPeople are saying that LeEco is a fraud, a Ponzi scheme. But what about the many bike-sharing and power bank-sharing ventures? Are their stories more credible?\u201d says a midlevel LeEco executive who\u2019s leaving the company.Started as a video site in 2004, LeEco wasn\u2019t well-known until it became the most valuable internet stock in China\u2019s A-share market during the bull run of 2015. Mr. Jia adopted the look of Apple\u2019s       Steve Jobs      \u2014jeans, black turtleneck\u2014and hosted flashy product launches for his TVs and smartphones.In explaining his vision, Mr. Jia frequently talked about building an ecosystem for consumers that delivered content\u2014from film and online entertainment to sports\u2014and hardware: smartphones, TVs or cars. The result, he explained, would be a \u201cchemical reaction\u201d among the units, propelling each other\u2019s businesses.Those synergies failed to materialize and the rapid expansion led to the cash shortage. How much debt LeEco has piled up isn\u2019t publicly known. Its listed video business is the only profitable unit, while its smart TV is its sole product that leads in market share. Its other businesses, especially the two electric car ventures, burn cash.The 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) that a white knight\u2014in the form of a real-estate developer\u2014pumped into LeEco in January wasn\u2019t enough, though the sum was plowed into repaying loans. At a January news conference, the investor said Mr. Jia didn\u2019t know how much money he\u2019d spent.\u201cThe fall of LeEco does not come as a surprise. When you use hype to stretch reality, reality usually wins.\u201d says Jay Zhao, a partner at San Francisco-based Walden Venture Capital, which is considering investing in Chinese startups and taking on Chinese investors. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful lesson for all that investors should be very cautious chasing shiny objects.

For years, it has pumped tens of billions of dollars into manufacturing the core components that its technology rivals need to make their own devices, helping Samsung emerge as a front-runner in semiconductors and display panels.Analysts predict that sales from Samsung\u2019s semiconductor business will help Samsung surpass         Intel Corp.       this year as the world\u2019s largest chip maker by that metric.On Tuesday, Samsung said it would invest an additional 20 trillion won, or more than $17 billion, in its South Korea semiconductor facilities. At one of the sites, in the coastal city of Pyeongtaek, Samsung had already pumped in close to $15 billion.Samsung also helped pioneer curved displays that are in vogue with smartphone makers because they enable handset designs that look sleeker and less boxy. One sign of its central place in the global smartphone supply chain: Samsung will be an initial supplier of flexible displays for rival         Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPhone coming out later this year, The Wall Street Journal reported in February.Samsung\u2019s financial performance comes after a rocky year for the South Korean conglomerate. Last year\u2019s embarrassing recall of Galaxy Note 7 devices cost the company at least $5 billion and eroded trust with consumers. Samsung refurbished some of those recalled phones using different components and began selling them Friday in South Korea under the name Galaxy Note Fan Edition.Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s de facto leader,       Lee Jae-yong,        is standing trial over his alleged role in a bribery scandal that has roiled South Korea. Mr. Lee, who has denied wrongdoing, has been absent from his role as the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics since February. Mr. Lee has been leading the company since 2014 when his father, Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee, became incapacitated after a heart attack.Samsung on Friday didn\u2019t provide a breakdown of mobile-phone sales. But the firm\u2019s latest flagship device, the Galaxy S8, received positive reviews after its April 21 debut, and some analysts believe robust sales of the handset also helped to fuel earnings.Galaxy S8 shipments could top 15 million units this quarter, Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, told clients in a note Friday. Samsung has previously said that pre-sale orders in the U.S. and sales in South Korea topped those of the prior year\u2019s model, the Galaxy S7.As with other global technology firms, investors have pushed up Samsung\u2019s share price over the past year. Samsung Electronics has jumped 64% over the past year, and Thursday\u2019s close at 2,403,000 won falls just short of last week\u2019s fresh record high. Shares slipped 0.3% in early trading Friday in Seoul.Write to Timothy W.

Those links\u2014from commercial and banking relationships to scientific training, arms sales, monument-building and restaurants\u2014have helped it amass the money and technical know-how to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.The nature and extent of North Korea\u2019s global ties comes from current and former officials, researchers, North Korean defectors, U.N. decisions, NGOs and an analysis of economic statistics.In some cases, North Korea leans on old allies, particularly those like Cuba from the former Communist bloc, or those like Syria that are similarly hostile to the U.S. In others, notably in Africa, it has more transactional relationships to supply items such as cheap weaponry or military training. In the Middle East, it supplies laborers for construction work and pockets almost all their earnings.Sanctions against North Korea haven\u2019t been as broad as those applied to Iran over its nuclear program, nor as rigidly enforced.David S. Cohen, undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence during the Obama administration, wrote in an op-ed in April that \u201cNorth Korea has gotten off relatively easy, especially as compared with Iran.\u201dTrying to crack down on North Korean business activities is like a game of Whac-A-Mole. North Korean defectors have detailed how the regime uses front companies to conceal its commercial activities in foreign countries, or adopts business names that obscure their identity by avoiding using North Korea\u2019s full name, thereby benefiting from confusion over whether the entity is North or South Korean.Pyongyang maintains diplomatic ties with 164 countries and has embassies in 47, according to the National Committee on North Korea, a Washington-based nongovernmental organization, and the Honolulu-based East-West Center.Although it lags far behind China, India has been North Korea\u2019s second biggest trade partner in the past couple of years, buying commodities including silver and selling it chemicals among other goods. Russia has exported petroleum products to North Korea and imported items such as garments and frozen fish. Last year, North Korea attempted to export military communications equipment to Eritrea via front companies in Malaysia, according to a recent U.N. report.Most North Koreans abroad are involved in providing funds for the state, defectors say. One of the primary roles of North Korean diplomats is to help develop and maintain cash flows for the regime, according to former embassy officials. North Korea missions typically have to be self-financed to maximize revenue for the state, these people say.In recent months, under pressure from the Trump administration, there are signs more countries have begun to clamp down on North Korea. In February, Bulgaria had Pyongyang send home two diplomats in its embassy in Sofia, in line with U.N. Security Council resolutions passed in September calling on countries to reduce the number of North Korean diplomats abroad.Italy this year moved four North Koreans studying at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste to switch to less-sensitive majors in line with a Security Council resolution calling for member nations not to provide education that could aid Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program.In March, Senegal said it suspended issuing visas for artisans from North Korea\u2019s Mansudae Art Studio, a state-run organization that has erected monumental sculptures across Africa.More than 50,000 North Korean workers are employed abroad, according to the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a Seoul-based think tank, many in construction or factory jobs. For these workers, wages are paid directly to North Korean officials, raising hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the state, human-rights groups say.These ties are under scrutiny as Pyongyang\u2019s success at launching a missile that could reach Alaska is escalating the crisis over its weapons program. This week\u2019s missile test took place on the back of a Chinese truck imported to North Korea for logging purposes, according to analysts.U.N. sanctions are primarily intended to block North Korea\u2019s illegitimate trade and revenue streams that have a suspected link to its weapons programs. The U.N. doesn\u2019t target all of Pyongyang\u2019s business activities abroad, such as the chain of restaurants it operates in Asia and the Middle East, or its dispatch of laborers.U.S. sanctions go further in trying to disrupt North Korea\u2019s trade and revenue, including a recent move to block access to the U.S. financial system for a bank in China on which Pyongyang relied. The U.S. has sanctioned North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un,        a move that would freeze any of his assets in America.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       on Tuesday called on the global community to stop doing business with Pyongyang.This week, Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s subpanel on East Asia, said he was drafting legislation that he says would create a \u201cglobal embargo\u201d on North Korea.\u201cWe need to shut off North Korea\u2019s access to oil, to trade, to currency, to financial institutions,\u201d he said in an interview Thursday, calling for \u201cIran-style\u201d sanctions. \u201cThey are far from being \u2018sanctioned out.\u2019 They are certainly isolated, but they have to recognize they ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201dChina has had close ties to North Korea since the 1950s when it sent troops to fight U.S.-led forces backing the South in the Korean War.In 2001, China accounted for around 18% of North Korea\u2019s exports and 20% of its imports, ranking behind Japan on both measures, according to customs figures compiled by Harvard University\u2019s Atlas of Economic Complexity.Since U.N. sanctions on North Korea were tightened in 2009, Japan and other countries have curtailed commercial ties with Pyongyang, leaving China as by far its biggest trade partner.For the past five years, China has accounted for more than 80% of North Korea\u2019s imports and exports, providing an economic lifeline even as political relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated.During that period, China has imported mostly industrial raw materials from North Korea, especially coal, but also seafood and clothing such as men\u2019s suits and overcoats.In recent days, President Donald Trump has expressed frustration with China for expanding trade with North Korea despite U.S. appeals to exert more pressure.China says it enforces U.N. sanctions and since February it has banned imports of North Korean coal\u2014one of Pyongyang\u2019s main sources of hard currency.However, U.N. sanctions still allow trade that isn\u2019t deemed to benefit North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, and China\u2019s customs figures show that its exports to North Korea have increased this year. Crucially, China continues to be North Korea\u2019s biggest source of crude oil, according to diplomats and experts on the region.Much of North Korea\u2019s trade takes place over the 880-mile land border with China, which is porous and sparsely guarded. Small Chinese and North Korean companies quietly ferry coal, iron ore and other resources over the border, far from checkpoints.U.N. sanctions introduced in March 2016 banned exports of North Korean iron ore unless they were exclusively for \u201clivelihood purposes\u201d\u2014a loophole China continues to exploit.While North Korea gained notoriety in the early 2000s for state-backed exports of illegal drugs and counterfeit U.S. dollars, Pyongyang has mostly shifted its strategy to allow private North Korean enterprises to take the lead, with the regime collecting bribes from these enterprises in a primitive system of taxation, says Justin Hastings, a lecturer at the University of Sydney who has researched North Korea\u2019s overseas smuggling networks.The shift in strategy means that North Korea can outsource some of the risk involved in the trade while continuing to fill its coffers.\u201cNorth Korea is not infinitely adaptable, but it\u2019s far more adaptable than people have thought and its ability to adapt to sanctions has not been reached yet,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.One informal Chinese trader that Mr. Hastings interviewed for a soon-to-be-published academic paper was importing truckloads and boatloads of North Korean iron ore and other minerals across the river into China for resale as recently as a year ago, when the interview took place.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com, Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com and Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Global Ties Keep Kim in Business.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 20:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-global-web-that-keeps-north-korea-running-1499358538", "news_title": "The Global Web That Keeps North Korea Running", "keywords": "can north korea reach u.s.,kim missile ,kim nuclear weapons,north korea economy,north korea missile reach,north korea missile test,north korea nuclear,north korea trade,north korea weapons,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,nuclear weapons programs,politics,risk news,military action,weapons programs"}, {"content": "A federal court in Washington, D.C., has granted the Justice Department sweeping authority to investigate alleged North Korean money laundering involving a Chinese coal-trading network.A search warrant approved in May and revealed in documents unsealed Thursday allowed federal prosecutors to secretly monitor transactions at eight major banks in the U.S. with accounts owned by a web of entities suspected of evading trade sanctions against North Korea.In court papers, the government said hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal transactions flowed through the banks, most of which are based in the U.S. and haven\u2019t been accused of unlawful activity.Prosecutors alleged in court papers that U.S. currency routed through the banks showed \u201cpatterns of North Korean money laundering identified by\u201d two North Korean defectors and supported North Korea\u2019s weapons programs.The warrants are part of a broader effort by Washington to choke financing for Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program and turn up pressure on China as North Korea\u2019s prime trade and finance partner.Last week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against China\u2019s Bank of Dandong, operating near the North Korean border. The Trump administration accused it of facilitating financing for companies involved in Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program.That move intensified already frosty relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies. U.S. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       also said Washington planned to roll out further penalties.The search warrants approved in May gave prosecutors a two-week window to spy on bank accounts tied to Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material Co., a Chinese coal exporter, and \u201cfour related front companies\u201d\u2014together referred to as the \u201cChi Yupeng Network,\u201d referring to a Chinese national who owns 90% of Dandong Zhicheng. The Chi Yupeng network isn\u2019t itself under U.S. sanctions.The Justice Department sought a special kind of warrant called a \u201cdamming seizure,\u201d a tactic most often deployed against drug smugglers. Unlike a conventional warrant, it was based on probable cause of crime occurring at some future time.The damming seizure functioned like a wiretap, secretly monitoring bank transactions rather than conversations, \u201ccatch[ing] all incoming funds...while preventing any funds from exiting the financial institution,\u201d prosecutors stated in an affidavit cited in court papers.It is unclear whether the searches were fruitful.Initially, prosecutors were denied permission to intercept transactions. A magistrate judge in April blocked the warrants because the targeted funds weren\u2019t currently located in the U.S., according to court papers.On May 22, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of Washington overruled the magistrate, stating that such \u201canticipatory warrants\u201d were constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, citing a 2006 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.David Thompson, a senior analyst at the Washington-based nonprofit that studies transnational illicit threats, C4ADS, said Dandong Zhicheng was the biggest importer of North Korean goods into China, most of which is coal.In an affidavit in support of the warrants, the Justice Department cited a \u201creliable\u201d North Korean defector as saying North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       channels 95% of North Korea\u2019s foreign-currency earnings generated from coal exports toward the country\u2019s military, nuclear missiles and weapons programs.The warrants are latest evidence of the Trump administration attempting to curb the flow of money in and around North Korea.The Justice Department late last year indicted a prominent Chinese businesswoman, three other Chinese nationals and a trading company based in Dandong for helping blacklisted North Korean companies the U.S. said was evading sanctions. That effort coincided with Treasury adding those entities to its sanctions list.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 20:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korean-money-laundering-probe-focuses-on-u-s-bank-transactions-1499387863", "news_title": "North Korean Money-Laundering Probe Focuses on U.S. Bank Transactions ", "keywords": "bank of dandong,china,chi yupeng network,coal,dandong zhicheng metallic material,justice department,money laundering,north korea,u.s.,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,financial crime,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,executive branch,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Campbell Soup Co.        CPB 3.10%       said it plans to buy organic-soup maker Pacific Foods for $700 million, the food stalwart\u2019s latest effort to meet demand for fresher, more natural foods.\u201cThis change is real, and it\u2019s here for good,\u201d Chief Executive       Denise Morrison       said in an interview.Adding Pacific\u2019s butternut-squash soup to Campbell\u2019s familiar line of chicken-noodle and vegetable soups continues a turn toward healthier foods that Campbell has been making since 2011, Ms. Morrison said.Campbell bought Bolthouse Farms refrigerated juices and Plum organic baby food in recent years. The New Jersey company also removed artificial colors and other unpopular ingredients from its big brands.\u201cThis accelerates our efforts,\u201d Ms. Morrison said.Campbell plans to fund the acquisition through a combination of short- and long-term debt, the company said in a press release.Big food companies were late to respond to Americans\u2019 mounting aversion to artificial additives and processed foods. Heavy spending on advertising and grocery store displays didn\u2019t protect their brand advantage as social media and online grocery shopping leveled the playing field for smaller brands.Shoppers also are opting for more hot, prepared meals\u2014including soups\u2014at the supermarket rather than canned and boxed meals that don\u2019t seem as fresh.Other food-making giants have bought faster-growing natural and organic brands to bolster growth. Yogurt giant             Danone SA       last year agreed to buy WhiteWave Foods Co., which makes Silk soy milk and Horizon organic yogurt, for $10.4 billion. In 2015, Spam maker             Hormel Foods Corp.       said it would buy Applegate Farms LLC for $775 million. And in 2014,             General Mills                   bought natural and organic brand Annie\u2019s Inc. for $820 million, and added soup to its product line, competing with Campbell.Campbell has also tried to revive sales in the soup aisle. The 150-year-old company started an organic line in 2015 and more recently added a new brand with simpler ingredients, called Well Yes!Campbell\u2019s said organic-food sales are rising faster than sales in the overall industry. But many of its traditional brands, which also include Goldfish crackers and V8 juices, remain staples in most North American homes.Campbell\u2019s sales of soup in the U.S. fell 1% in the nine past months through April, according to the company. Natural and organic canned soup sales rose by an average of 10% a year between 2013 and 2016, Wells Fargo analysts said.Pacific Foods had $218 million in revenue for the year ended in May. Founded in 1987, the Oregon company also sells organic, diced meats and plant-based beverages.The company\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Chuck Eggert, will remain a supplier of key ingredients through his family farms, according to Campbell\u2019s press release.Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 20:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/campbell-expands-organic-business-with-purchase-of-pacific-foods-1499387468", "news_title": "Campbell Expands Organic Business With Purchase of Pacific Foods ", "keywords": "campbell's soup, organic, pacific foods,Campbell Soup,CPB,Pacific Foods,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,food preserving,speciality foods,food canning,pickling,drying,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "Less than three hours before       Alexander Bonds      fatally shot a New York City police officer in a mobile-command vehicle, a woman who said she was his girlfriend called 911 to report he was acting \u201cparanoid,\u201d said Chief of Detectives       Robert Boyce.The woman, whom police officials didn\u2019t identify, said she was following       Mr. Bond      s at about 9:30 p.m.\u00a0on July 4\u00a0in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, Chief Boyce said. That was 4 miles south of where police say Mr. Bonds later killed Officer Miosotis Familia, a 48-year-old mother of three.\u201cHe was acting erratically and was paranoid,\u201d Chief Boyce said Thursday at a news briefing.The girlfriend didn\u2019t identify Mr. Bonds, 34 years old, by his full name. The 911 operator asked if Mr. Bonds was armed and the woman said no, Chief Boyce said. The girlfriend called 911 near 158th Street and followed Mr. Bonds to the area of Trinity and Westchester avenues in the Bronx, Chief Boyce said, adding that she eventually lost track of him.When police and EMS arrived in Mott Haven, Mr. Bonds was nowhere to be seen. In a second phone call, the police asked the woman where she thought he might be, a senior law-enforcement official said. She said she last saw him walking east, but police couldn\u2019t track him down.It is unclear exactly when the woman stopped following Mr. Bonds. The entire exchange on the phone occurred within 30 minutes, the senior official said.At about 12:30 a.m.\u00a0on Wednesday, Mr. Bonds, dressed in all black, tightened up his hoodie, walked up to the NYPD mobile-command post and fired one shot at Officer Familia\u2019s head in the Fordham Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, police said.Police shot and killed Mr. Bonds a block away from the incident. The silver revolver Mr. Bonds used was stolen from Charleston, W.Va., Chief Boyce said on Thursday.Police later made the connection between the shooting and the 911 calls after the incident when investigators interviewed the woman. She also noted that Mr. Bonds \u201cusually ducks into a hallway or ducks down,\u201d when he would see police, the senior official said.Police categorized the 911 calls as a report of a possibly emotionally disturbed person who was nonviolent, according to the official. The NYPD said it receives about 10,000 such calls a month. \u201cThere was no reason to make a connection before,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cIt was just a 911 call in the Bronx about a guy walking in the street.\u201dMr. Bonds\u2019 girlfriend told investigators he thought the police were following him for about the last two weeks, Chief Boyce said. The girlfriend also brought Mr. Bonds to St. Barnabas Hospital last Saturday for a psychiatric evaluation, Chief Boyce said. Mr. Bonds was released that day.St. Barnabas Hospital didn\u2019t immediately return request for comment.On Thursday, New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       said in a written statement he was ordering a review of the hospital\u2019s \u201cactions and policies in admitting, treating and discharging this individual.\u201dMayor       Bill de Blasio       also announced the city would spend $1.3 million to outfit the city\u2019s 72 mobile command centers with bullet-resistant doors and windows. The funding would come from tax levy and asset-forfeiture funds.The city previously announced similar security measures for patrol cars.Officers recovered six phones from Mr. Bonds\u2019 apartment, some of which contained antipolice statements, he said. Police also found several bottles of medication in the apartment, the chief said.Mr. Bonds\u2019 criminal history and social-media presence further indicate animosity toward police. In 2001, he was arrested for the assault of a police officer in Queens with brass knuckles, police officials said. A video posted on Mr. Bonds\u2019             Facebook                   page last year criticized police treatment of residents, referring to officers in derogatory terms.According to police officials, Mr. Bond\u2019s other arrests include: Narcotics-related crimes in 2001 and 2002; subway fare evasion in 2005; and robbery in 2005. Mr. Bonds violated his parole in 2006 and was in prison until 2013 when he was released, the senior official said. Mr. Bonds was set to be on parole until 2018, officials added.He was visited by his parole officer on June 15, Chief Boyce said.\u201cOfficer Familia is dead because of one reason and one reason only,\u201d Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s Alexander Bonds and his hatred of the police.\u201dWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Gunman Was \u2018Acting Erratically\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 20:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/911-caller-man-who-killed-nypd-officer-acting-paranoid-1499373057", "news_title": "911 Caller: Man Who Killed NYPD Officer Acting \u2018Paranoid\u2019 ", "keywords": "nyc police shooting,nypd cop shot,police shootings,Alexander Bonds,Mr. Bond,Robert Boyce,political,general news,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter"}, {"content": "Ships transporting almost a fifth of Iran\u2019s oil exports in the second half of last year either turned off their radio-signal tracking systems or gave misleading information about the origin of their cargo, red flags for governments seeking evidence of evasion of international sanctions against Tehran.Some 47 of 55 ships carrying\u00a0Iranian\u00a0oil products from Iran to the United Arab Emirates for two U.A.E.-registered companies failed to emit signals from the system that transmits their position and course, for part or all of their journey, according to an analysis of the two firms\u2019 shipments that was completed for The Wall Street Journal by ship-tracker Windward Ltd., an Israeli firm that uses satellite imaging to map shipping routes.The shipments, made by two U.A.E.-registered traders, Silk Road Petroleum FZE and Petrochemix General Trading LLC, accounted for 17% of Iran\u2019s fuel-oil and gas-oil exports during the six-month period, according to records compiled by the oil-product traders.The records, based on information from state-run National Iranian Oil Co. that shipping agents combine with their own information and provide to traders, listed the vessels\u2019 cargo as fuel oil or gas oil. Iranian\u00a0authorities didn\u2019t return calls and emails seeking comment about the shipments.While there is no penalty for not using the systems, shipping guidelines advise ships to use tracking systems to avoid collisions between vessels or locate them if they need to be rescued. Sometimes ships turn of their tracking systems to evade pirates, said Andrew Bardot, chief executive of IGP&I, an association of marine liability insurers.But \u201cthis tactic can also be used to hide the genuine details of a voyage so as to enable the breach of sanctions,\u201d said Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau, a London-based trade body set up to fight maritime crime and malpractice.The U.S. government is analyzing ship movements in the Persian Gulf for any attempts to circumvent bans on funding Iran\u2019s weapons programs or clearing payments for Iranian oil through the U.S. financial system, a U.S. official said.U.S. officials said they weren\u2019t familiar with the particular shipments identified by the Journal.This scrutiny comes amid uncertainty in the U.S. about the future of the 2015 multinational agreement in which Iran pledged to scale back its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.President       Donald Trump       has cast doubt on whether his administration will continue to support his predecessor\u2019s commitment to the deal. U.S. officials said the White House is reviewing its Iran policy and considering stiffer measures. Shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the administration imposed new sanctions related to Iran\u2019s defense and ballistic-missile programs.While the nuclear agreement lifted many obstacles to doing business with Iran, the U.S. maintains sanctions that make it difficult to trade Iranian oil. A ban on clearing payments through the U.S. financial system hinders trade because oil is mostly bought and sold in dollars. The U.S. also prohibits doing business with blacklisted entities including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a military division that is dominant in Iran\u2019s economy.A shipowner, the ship\u2019s master\u2014the person responsible for the navigation of the vessel\u2014or the trader who chartered the vessel could give an instruction to shut off the automatic identification system, or AIS. U.S. investigators would likely look into the trader\u2019s responsibility in such situations in addition to the shipper, said       Richard Nephew,        who served as deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the State Department from 2013 to 2015 and is now a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\u201cIn most cases we assume it\u2019s not plausible that a trader would be ignorant of any attempts to avoid international monitoring of ship movements especially if it occurs on multiple shipping companies with the same trading company,\u201d he said.Oil traders typically monitor the movements of their cargoes and would be in a position to know if the AIS isn\u2019t transmitting location, shipping and sanctions experts said.Of Silk Road Petroleum\u2019s 46 shipments in the period, 40 emitted no tracking signals. The company didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment emailed to an address in the directory of the U.A.E.\u2019s Hamriyah Free Zone Authority, where the company is registered. The email address was recently removed from the directory.In the nine Petrochemix shipments in the second half of 2016, seven ships emitted no AIS radio signals at some point. A Petrochemix co-owner, when asked about the shipments, said the firm had no relations or business with Iranian companies, and that any AIS shut-off was a matter for vessel owners. Petrochemix chartered tankers owned by seven different shippers in the period.The 47 shipments during which AIS was off were handled by 15 vessels. Many of the shipowners couldn\u2019t be reached, and one declined to comment. One shipper said many charterers tell ships to shut off the AIS because \u201cmost major banks don\u2019t want to deal with\u201d such trade.\u201cThe single biggest issue preventing wider trade between Iran and the rest of the world is the continuing reluctance of international banks to process payments to and from Iran,\u201d said       Sue Millar,        partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood LLP.Blue Ocean Shipping Lines, an owner of one of the vessels chartered by both companies for a total of nine shipments, said its ship\u2019s AIS was broken at the time. Another shipper said the AIS was never intentionally switched off, nor was any \u201cAIS deficiency\u201d reported.Apart from tracking cargo, the AIS system is used to provide location information to insurance companies, banks and others. But it can be manipulated to indicate a ship is somewhere it isn\u2019t, by manually entering incorrect coordinates or ports. Radio signals issued by as many as 16 of the 47 ships indicated their Iranian cargo began the journey in a different country, though satellite imagery showed them to have been loaded in Iran, according to Windward. That suggests the signals may have been used to transmit false location information, Windward said.\u201cA misdeclaration of the ports of loading or discharge would be one of the indications that the voyage breached\u00a0sanctions,\u201d Mr. Mukundan said. \u201cIn any case, such a misdeclaration would be improper and misleading.\u201dHiding a cargo\u2019s Iranian origin\u00a0would allow an exporter to be paid more easily in dollars or conceal the involvement of blacklisted entities, according to London law firm W Legal Ltd, which specializes in\u00a0sanctions\u00a0law. \u201cThe U.S. administration is watching\u00a0Iran-related business like a\u00a0hawk,\u201d said       Nigel Kushner,        W Legal\u2019s chief executive.A U.S. Treasury official declined to comment on the shipments identified by the Journal. \u201cWe take allegations of sanctionable conduct seriously but we do not comment on applicability of sanctions in individual circumstances,\u201d the official said.This year, the U.S. government said a Taiwanese shipping company had violated Iran sanctions, and in its finding said the company left ship logs blank and switched off the vessel\u2019s AIS to conceal a ship-to-ship transfer of Iranian crude.Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Ships Carrying Iranian Fuel Raise Sanctions Concerns.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ships-exporting-iranian-oil-go-dark-raising-sanctions-red-flags-1499333402", "news_title": "Ships Exporting Iranian Oil Go Dark, Raising Sanctions Red Flags", "keywords": "iran,iran nuclear,iran oil,iran sanctions,nuclear iran,u.s.-iran,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "Qualcomm Inc.        QCOM 0.87%       is asking federal trade authorities to block imports of some iPhones and iPads, opening a new front in its dispute with             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       and exposing both companies to further risks to their most profitable businesses.Qualcomm said it plans to file a complaint Friday with the U.S. International Trade Commission to halt imports of Apple handsets and tablets that don\u2019t include Qualcomm chips, and to bar sales of those products already in the U.S.Qualcomm said Apple has been infringing several of its patents on wireless technology in iPhones and iPads generally, but that it limited the scope of its request in part to avoid the broad economic impact of blocking sales of the products entirely.Qualcomm said it separately filed similar patent-infringement claims Thursday against Apple in federal district court in Southern California.The moves escalate a legal feud Apple initiated with a federal lawsuit in January accusing Qualcomm of using its dominance in cellular chips unfairly to thwart competitors and extract high patent royalties.Apple in its suit complains that Qualcomm\u2019s royalty\u2014because it is calculated as a percentage of the handset price\u2014rewards the chip maker unfairly when Apple charges higher prices for capabilities that aren\u2019t based on Qualcomm patents.An Apple spokesman said Thursday that the company stands by its previous statement that Qualcomm is seeking payments on innovations it didn\u2019t make.Apple has launched international legal actions and supported regulatory proceedings against Qualcomm in multiple countries, threatening the San Diego, Calif., company\u2019s patent-licensing business, which in 2016 accounted for roughly 80% of its pretax profit.Qualcomm\u2019s latest move isn\u2019t likely to disrupt iPhone sales in the near term, if ever, because the trade commission\u2014an independent, bipartisan federal agency\u2014generally takes about 16 months to reach a conclusion, according to Lyle Vander Schaaf, a former commission general counsel now with law firm Brinks Gilson & Lione. If the commission were to rule against Apple, the iPhone maker could appeal.Still, Qualcomm\u2019s complaint represents its strongest effort to threaten Apple. It comes as Apple, the world\u2019s most profitable smartphone maker, finalizes plans for the next versions of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple\u2019s sales and three-quarters of its gross profit. Those plans are expected to include a new model to mark the product\u2019s 10th anniversary, investor anticipation of which has triggered a jump in Apple\u2019s stock this year.Apple is finalizing the features and components for those new models, expected to be released in the fall. Despite the legal fight, Qualcomm is vying with             Intel Corp.       to supply modem chips for the next-generation iPhones. Apple started including Intel\u2019s chips in some units of the iPhone 7 launched last year. Apple accounts for as much as 30% of Qualcomm\u2019s per-share earnings, according to Macquarie Capital.Qualcomm has two main businesses: selling chips that are used in many smartphones and licensing patents it owns on key cellular technology used in nearly all smartphones sold globally, even those that don\u2019t use its chips.That business model has been increasingly under attack. In addition to the Apple fight, Qualcomm is under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for anticompetitive practices, and late last year was fined by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission over similar claims. It also previously paid a fine to settle with Chinese regulators.Complaints against Qualcomm largely have focused on its licensing practices for a category of patents that are generally acknowledged to be essential to cellular communications. Standards organizations require that holders of such patents offer licenses widely. Qualcomm\u2019s critics claim that the company evades its obligation by refusing to license those patents to rival chip makers.In the new complaint, Qualcomm said the six patents at issue cover technologies not in that essential category and are related to boosting performance while conserving battery life. It said Apple has used the technologies without purchasing a license despite Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to negotiate one.Accusing Apple of violating such nonessential patents reinforces Qualcomm\u2019s position that its patents cover a broad range of valuable technologies beyond its communications chips. Basing the complaint on such patents also dodges pitfalls around the ITC, which in the past has been steered away from decisions bearing on essential patents, Mr. Vander Schaaf said.Still, Qualcomm\u2019s request to the trade commission risks muddying its arguments. By seeking to block only Apple products that don\u2019t contain Qualcomm chips, it could reinforce Apple\u2019s claim that Qualcomm wields its dominance in chips unfairly. Moreover, pressing for a ban on imports of iPhones that don\u2019t include Qualcomm chips as a punishment for patent infringement may appear to contradict Qualcomm\u2019s repeated claims that it strictly separates its chip sales and patent-licensing businesses, and that it doesn\u2019t use its ownership of technology essential to cellular standards to put competitors at a disadvantage.Qualcomm said one reason it is seeking to block only products that don\u2019t include Qualcomm chips is that the commission is mandated to protect the public interest, and blocking all iPhone and iPad imports would affect not only Apple and Intel but telecom carriers and retailers that distribute the iPhone.\u201cYou want to not affect in unnecessary ways competitive conditions in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Qualcomm general counsel       Don Rosenberg.       \u201cWe\u2019re trying to toe the line. We believe in the public interest.\u201dApple and Qualcomm each have come before the trade commission in other cases. The agency in 2013 ruled against Apple in a case brought by             Samsung Electronics Co.       but the Obama administration vetoed a ruling that would have blocked some iPhone imports. The commission in 2007 ruled against Qualcomm in a case brought by then-rival Broadcom Corp., but an appeals court later lifted a ban on imports of some Qualcomm cellphone chips.Write to Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Qualcomm Steps Up Fight With Apple.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qualcomm-steps-up-fight-against-apple-1499373078", "news_title": "Qualcomm Steps Up Fight Against Apple ", "keywords": "apple ,apple legal,apple qualcomm fight,ipad,iphone,patent infringement,qualcomm,qualcomm patents,Apple,AAPL,Qualcomm,QCOM,U.S. International Trade Commission,plans,strategy,patents,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,semiconductors,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,industrial electronics,industrial goods,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is heading to Germany to attend a protest related to the G-20 summit of world leaders, his spokesman said Thursday.\u201cThe Mayor will attend several events surrounding the G20 Summit, including Saturday\u2019s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally,\u201d Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office said. \u201cA more detailed public schedule will be issued with this trip in progress.\u201dMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, will be a keynote speaker at a \u201crally for human rights & democracy,\u201d according to the Hamburg Zeigt Haltung Twitter account.Anticapitalist protesters have clashed with German police at protests surrounding the summit.

Vladeck, a professor at University of Texas School of Law. \u201cHe is taking the absolute cream of the crop when it comes to government lawyers with relevant experiences.\u201dMr. Carr declined to comment on the investigation or staffing decisions beyond confirming the 13 lawyers\u2019 identities, which were provided by people familiar with the inquiry. He said the office recently submitted a budget and expects to release a list of expenditures every six months.Mr. Mueller, a former FBI director, was tapped as special counsel not long after President       Donald Trump\u2019s       abrupt firing of       James Comey       as FBI director. Mr. Comey had been spearheading the federal investigation into the Russian interference.The Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as Senate and House panels are scrutinizing whether Trump associates coordinated with Russian hackers in interfering with the election.Mr. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and Russia has denied meddling in the election. Mr. Trump and some of his allies have questioned the impartiality of Mr. Mueller\u2019s hires.Highlighting the sensitive nature of his work, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office moved a few weeks ago from a nondescript Washington office building to a nearby \u201csecure facility\u201d that Mr. Carr declined to identify.Twelve of the 15 lawyers are Justice Department or FBI employees, and are expected to return to their jobs when the investigation is completed. The other three worked with Mr. Mueller at his law firm of WilmerHale, which he left upon being named special counsel.Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are working closely with FBI agents as part of a broad counterintelligence investigation exploring not only Russia\u2019s alleged interference but any potential crimes associated with it.\u201cWe have a great number of folks who have already been detailed to that team,\u201d Acting FBI Director       Andrew McCabe       told Congress last month. \u201cI have assured Director Mueller that we will do everything necessary to deliver the resources and to meet the needs that he has.\u201dMr. Mueller\u2019s office has taken over the criminal probes of       Michael Flynn,        Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who resigned weeks into the job amid increasing fire over his conflicting statements about his contacts with Russian officials, and       Paul Manafort,        his former campaign manager, according to people familiar with the investigation.Both are being investigated for potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act as a result of their work for foreign interests, and prosecutors have separately subpoenaed business records of Mr. Flynn and the bank records of Mr. Manafort, according to the people, The Wall Street Journal has reported.Mr. Mueller has signaled he expects to keep his prosecution team relatively small and nimble, with the understanding it can grow if it uncovers more facts, according to people familiar with the office. So far, Mr. Mueller has focused on adding lawyers with a background in handling complex cases involving public corruption, national security and financial fraud.Among them are Andrew Goldstein, former chief of the public corruption unit at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York; Zainab Ahmad, a federal prosecutor in New York who has won praise for tackling tough terrorism cases; and Andrew Weissmann, who led the fraud section of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, where he oversaw the department\u2019s probe of the collapse of Enron Corp. and served as Mr. Mueller\u2019s general counsel at the FBI.\u201cThese are three prosecutors who are absolutely at the top of their games in their respective fields,\u201d said David Bitkower, a former federal prosecutor who served as a top official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration.Former Justice Department officials also cited Mr. Mueller\u2019s recruitment of Michael Dreeben, an appellate lawyer in the office of the U.S. Solicitor General. Mr. Dreeben is considered one of the department\u2019s foremost legal experts, especially in criminal matters.Mr. Trump has questioned the neutrality of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, telling Fox News he was concerned that Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors were \u201c      Hillary Clinton       supporters\u201d and that Mr. Mueller and Mr. Comey were friends. Mr. Comey was a top Justice official in the       George W. Bush       administration when Mr. Mueller was the FBI director; both are Republicans.Newt Gingrich, a close Trump ally and a former speaker of the House, tweeted last month that \u201cRepublicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair\u201d because some of Mr. Mueller\u2019s attorneys have donated to Democrats.At least seven members of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team have given to Democratic candidates, including to the presidential campaigns of       Mr. Obama       and Mrs. Clinton, according to Federal Election Commission records. At least one\u2014James Quarles, a member of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force\u2014has donated to politicians in both parties.Kenneth Starr,        whose five-year Whitewater inquiry as independent counsel led to the impeachment and acquittal of former President       Bill Clinton,        faced similar criticism. Mr. Starr was a Republican who donated to GOP candidates before taking on the Whitewater investigation.Mr. Mueller, 72 years old, has held high-ranking posts in Republican and Democratic administrations. He was appointed to lead the FBI in 2001 by President George W. Bush, a Republican, and kept in the job by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.Mr. Mueller has a reputation for enjoying the nitty-gritty work of building difficult cases\u2014so much so that he once gave up a lucrative law practice to prosecute homicide suspects in Washington during some of its bloodiest years.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Probe Hires Range of Talent.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-robert-mueller-taps-broad-range-of-talent-for-russia-probe-1499383873", "news_title": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller Taps Broad Range of Talent for Russia Probe ", "keywords": " attorneys, investigation team, robert mueller,russia probe, special counsel, trump administration,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "At first glance, the new hotel chain on track to be the fastest-growing in the U.S. resembles a boutique brand that might be found in a trendy, urban location.But             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s       new midprice brand, Tru, is pricing rooms at around $100 a night or less and is largely aimed at less-flashy locales like suburban highway exits. The first Tru by Hilton hotel opened in May in Oklahoma City, to be followed by more than 200 locations by the end of 2019.Hilton hopes to expand its customer base by focusing on a lower end of the market than the company has typically operated.To differentiate itself from competitors in the same price range, such as Best Western or Quality Inn, Tru will try to hold costs down by making rooms smaller and easier to clean, while offering millennial-friendly lobby amenities such as craft beer and pool tables.The market is enormous: About 30% of nightly demand at U.S. hotel chains is for rooms below an average of $83 a night, according to STR, a data company that tracks the hotel industry.The challenge, however, is convincing developers that building new hotels in that price range will generate sufficient returns.Most midtier hotels occupy older properties that have been converted from other higher-priced brands. With Tru, Hilton is aiming for brand-new properties.\u201cIt\u2019s the graveyard for old hotels,\u201d said Hilton President and Chief Executive       Chris Nassetta.       \u201cThe reason hotels have gotten to that price point is they were something different and they deteriorated. You\u2019re sort of putting lipstick and rouge on a structure that\u2019s obsolete.\u201dTo make the returns worth the new development costs, Hilton had to rethink the design to get more rooms across a smaller amount of space.Guest rooms are designed to be about 20% smaller than a typical hotel room in the price range. The overall footprint of the property is smaller, too, and will largely be away from big-city centers, keeping land costs down. Openings in coming months are scheduled in places like Farmville, Va., and Cheyenne, Wyo.In exchange, Tru hotels have a lobby that is more than 80% larger than Hilton\u2019s typical Hampton Inn location, which is priced slightly higher than Tru. The brightly colored lobbies have a self-serve market area where guests can get drinks and food, and also boast recreation areas and a separate section with individual pods where guests can work.The rooms are designed in a way to make cleaning easier and faster. Rather than carpet, floors are covered in vinyl that can be mopped, and in-room desks and coffee makers have been banished, also to cut down on cleaning times.\u201cWe have been laser-focused on what numbers we absolutely need to hit,\u201d said Alex Jaritz, global head of the Tru brand, who previously worked at             Choice Hotels International Inc.,       which operates brands like Quality Inn.Other hotel companies are experimenting along the same lines. In recent years             Marriott International Inc.       introduced Moxy hotels, which have smaller rooms and more communal space in the lobby, though it is at a higher price point than Tru.             Intercontinental Hotels Group                   PLC said in June it would launch a new brand in this price range.Best Western Hotels & Resorts introduced a brand called Glo in late 2015, just before Hilton announced Tru, that will operate in the same price range. It has a similar modern design but incorporates elements such as a layout that allows the bathrooms of adjoining rooms to be beside each other in an effort to save space.The difference with Tru is scale. Best Western has 25 development deals in the works for Glo locations, whereas Tru has 425 properties in various stages of development, the biggest pipeline for any newly launched brand since at least 2003, when STR first started consistently tracking the data.\u201cThey are a serious player. We know we have to up our game,\u201d said Best Western CEO       David Kong.       \u201cThey are going to be in markets that we\u2019ve dominated, so we have to protect our turf.\u201dOther competitors cautioned that achieving the right returns can be tricky at more affordable price points.\u201cA lot of people try to enter this marketplace and find it\u2019s not as easy as they believe it is,\u201d said Chip Ohlsson, executive vice president and chief development officer for North America at             Wyndham Hotel Group,       which runs the Ramada and Wingate chains. \u201cWhere we operate, there\u2019s less margin for error.\u201dPat Pacious, president and chief operating officer at Choice Hotels, said his company rolled out a revamped design for new construction on its Sleep Inn brand last year. But he said Choice has been cautious about moving toward smaller rooms, to avoid potentially alienating older guests.\u201cWhen you look at that midscale consumer, a tiny room is not in our view what they are looking for,\u201d he said.He said one way the company keeps costs down is through designs that allow for some part of the construction process to be done offsite.John Chandler stayed at Hilton\u2019s first Tru in Oklahoma City on a recent business trip from Dallas. He was impressed with the design but said he was frustrated by his room\u2019s small workspace.\u201cIt\u2019s very chic and cool, it\u2019s very loft-esque. But for a business traveler it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very European. I live in Texas, I\u2019m from the Deep South. We like it big.\u201dMatt Orlando of Houston, on the other hand, said he enjoyed working in the large lobby and felt his room had exactly what was needed.\u201cWhat do I do when I go into a room? I\u2019m usually just hopping into the bed, watching some TV and going to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it made sense.\u201dWrite to Chris Kirkham at chris.kirkham@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Hilton Sees Room to Expand With Midprice Brand.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hilton-sees-room-for-growth-with-new-low-price-brand-1499342402", "news_title": "Hilton Sees Room for Growth With New Low-Price Brand", "keywords": "Hilton Worldwide Holdings,HLT,InterContinental Hotels Group,IHG,UK:IHG,Choice Hotels International,CHH,Wyndham Worldwide,WYN,Marriott International,MAR,Best Western Hotels & Resorts,marketing,markets,branding,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,generational cohorts,society,community,machinery,agricultural machinery,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,hotels (except casino),motels,industrial goods,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "WARSAW\u2014In a bid to broaden the nationalist vision he has long embraced, President       Donald Trump       on Thursday described the West as locked in a struggle it could lose unless it can \u201csummon the courage\u201d to see it through.Mr. Trump chose Poland as the backdrop for a defining foreign policy speech of his early presidency, calling the country\u2019s perseverance in World War II and afterward a model for Western nations that face sinister threats of their own today.\u201cThe story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never, ever forgotten who they are,\u201d Mr. Trump said at Krasinski Square, site of a memorial to a 1944 Polish uprising against the Nazis. His speech came a day before he was to meet for the first time with Russian President       Vladimir Putin.He exhorted the West to recognize the existential peril embodied by terrorists who have struck repeatedly at centers of Western arts and culture, including Paris, London and New York.\u201cWe are confronted by another oppressive ideology\u2014one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAmerica and Europe have suffered one terror attack after another. We\u2019re going to get it to stop.\u201dWith Thursday\u2019s address, the U.S. president sought to provide an intellectual grounding for some of the controversial policies he has pushed since taking office: the travel ban, building a border wall, and aggressive actions against illegal immigrants.All these initiatives have faced setbacks. Courts have delayed and constrained Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict travel from six Muslim-majority countries he says pose an elevated risk of terrorism. It isn\u2019t clear whether he will win congressional support or funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, a linchpin of his effort to stop illegal migrants.Detractors have said Mr. Trump\u2019s moves reflect an anti-Muslim, nativist bias evident from the earliest days of his campaign. But in Mr. Trump\u2019s telling, his steps are needed to fortify a Western culture at risk of being washed away.\u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,\u201d Mr. Trump said, amid chants of \u201cDonald Trump! Donald Trump!\u201d\u201cDo we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\u201d he asked.A main architect of the speech was Stephen Miller, a senior adviser and part of a populist-nationalist wing at the White House led by strategist Steve Bannon, White House aides said.At times Mr. Bannon\u2019s clout has seemed in doubt. He has clashed with the president\u2019s son-in-law, senior adviser       Jared Kushner,        and at times Mr. Trump has seemed to lose patience with him. But the Bannon-Miller faction doesn\u2019t appear to be in retreat, and White House aides indicated they were pleased with Mr. Miller\u2019s work. As Mr. Trump flew from Poland to Germany for a summit meeting, reporters on the plane could overhear aides congratulating Mr. Miller on the speech.The president told The Wall Street Journal in the spring that Mr. Bannon was merely \u201ca guy who works for me.\u201dIn tone and substance, the speech departed from the typical pattern of Mr. Trump, who relishes the instant impact that Twitter provides in 140-character bursts. A senior adviser who briefed reporters on the speech shortly before its delivery said the aim was to portray Mr. Trump\u2019s positions with more philosophical sweep.Thursday\u2019s address had a loftier ring than his address in Saudi Arabia in May, when Mr. Trump said America\u2019s global role should be guided by what he called \u201cprincipled realism.\u201d That approach, as he described it, emphasizes transactions on economic and security agreements over other concerns, such as human-rights abuses.\u201cWe will make decisions based on real-world outcomes\u2014not inflexible ideology,\u201d he said then in remarks before Muslim leaders.The senior adviser said of Thursday\u2019s address: \u201cThe core theme of this speech is a defense of Western civilization.\u201dThe message isn\u2019t necessarily an easy one for Mr. Trump to pull off. While he celebrated traditions of \u201cfree speech\u201d and \u201cfree expression\u201d in his speech, he has faced mounting criticism over his broadsides against news outlets reporting on election interference and a federal investigation into Trump associates\u2019 possible collusion in attempts by Russia to damage       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       presidential bid.On his trip abroad, he kept up that criticism of U.S. news outlets. At a news conference in Warsaw, Mr. Trump was asked about his dust-up with the CNN after he recently tweeted a video portraying him wrestling a logo of the network to the ground. \u201cWhat we want to see in the United States is honest, beautiful, free press,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want fake news.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Mr. Putin, a figure he praised during his presidential campaign, at a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 leading nations. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia meddled in the election with a goal to elect Mr. Trump.It was unclear whether Mr. Trump would bring up the matter or caution Mr. Putin not to try interfering again. At his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said \u201cno one really knows for sure\u201d who was behind the interference.Far from guaranteeing Western civilizational norms, Mr. Trump could be coaxed into abandoning them if he isn\u2019t careful in his dealings with Mr. Putin, said U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant risk that Putin will play to Trump\u2019s ego and will attempt to pressure him to abandon what are our core American traditions,\u201d Mr. Coons said.In Thursday\u2019s speech, Mr. Trump criticized Moscow for its interference in Ukraine and its support for governments in Iran and Syria.\u201cWe urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, and its support for hostile regimes\u2014including Syria and Iran,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But some European officials wondered if Mr. Trump would carry those criticisms into Friday\u2019s meeting.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that President Trump\u2019s position regarding Russia is, on many occasions, different than what he presented today in Warsaw,\u201d said European Council President Donald Tusk, a former center-right Polish prime minister. \u201cI understand this, the audience one\u2019s addressing often dictates the tone.\u201dGerman Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        who met Mr. Trump on Thursday in Hamburg, said the U.S. leader\u2019s trip to Poland\u2014which some Western European politicians had feared could deepen rifts on the continent\u2014didn\u2019t worry her \u201cat all.\u201d\u201cWe have our agenda here, but there are different conceptions of globalization,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, previewing the G-20 summit. \u201cThere don\u2019t always have to be losers where there are winners.\u201dWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Urges West To Show Courage.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-west-must-defend-its-civilization-1499355200", "news_title": "Trump Says West Must Defend Its Civilization", "keywords": "russia,trump,western civilization,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014Canadian authorities on Thursday proposed further measures to tighten mortgage-financing,\u00a0the latest sign of concern over pockets of overheating in the country\u2019s housing market.The move comes even as activity in frothy markets in Toronto and Vancouver is slowing down and the Bank of Canada is setting the stage for imminent rate rises, possibly as early as next week.Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said it is eyeing rule changes governing mortgage issuance by banks. Most notable is a provision that would require all prospective buyers -- even those with a down payment of over 20% -- to undergo a so-called stress test before a bank can issue a loan. Under the stress test, prospective buyers would have to qualify for a mortgage at a rate roughly 200 basis points above what\u2019s negotiated.According to housing-market analysts, the fresh set of measures could eliminate a number of prospective home buyers from the market and curb borrowing -- which is increasing at an annual rate of roughly 6%, or well above wage gains. The bulk of the borrowing is for mortgages and drawdowns on home-equity lines of credit.\u201cThis is about reducing the rate of credit growth,\u201d said Will Dunning, chief economist for Mortgage Professionals Canada, a lobby group representing mortgage brokers.The superintendent\u2019s office\u00a0is giving stakeholders until\u00a0Aug. 17\u00a0to comment on the proposed changes. In a letter explaining the proposed moves, the banking agency said persistently low interest rates, record levels of household debt and rapid increases in house prices in Vancouver and Toronto \u201ccould generate significant loan losses if economic conditions deteriorate.\u201dThe proposed changes come after Canada\u2019s Finance Minister       Bill Morneau       last fall introduced stress tests for buyers with a down payment of between 5% and 19%.Currently, those making a down payment 20% or higher\u00a0are exempt from any stress test, and are not required to obtain mortgage insurance under Canada\u2019s housing-market regime. Mortgage insurance in Canada is backed by the federal government, and protects banks from the risk of default. Mortgages for homes sold at 1 million Canadian dollars ($770,000) or more are not eligible for the insurance.What Canada\u2019s banking watchdog is proposing \u201cwould take a massive sledgehammer to the mortgage market, because we are so thirsty for debt and for housing, and it\u2019s the topic of everyone\u2019s choice at the dog park,\u201d said Jake Abramowicz, a Toronto-based agent at Mortgage Edge, an independent mortgage broker.He said the tougher stress test means prospective buyers might not be able to borrow as much from the bank, and hence limiting the pool of houses they can put bids on. He added the move could represent a big shift in Toronto, where he conducts much of his business, because most clients he deals with already have a 20% or more down payment.The proposed mortgage guidelines come as housing data for the Toronto market indicates a second-straight month of cooling sales in Canada\u2019s biggest city. Home sales in the Toronto area dropped 37.3% in June from the same month a year ago, while prices rose 6.3% to C$797,915, according to the local real estate board\u00a0on Thursday.In April, Ontario has introduced more than a dozen measures aimed at cooling soaring home-price gains in the Toronto-area market, including a surtax on foreign buyers, after the cost of owning a home in the city rose at 30% on a one-year basis for several months.In Vancouver, whose housing market was fueled for years by foreign buyers, home sales dropped 11.5% in June from last year, while the average home price remained strong, moving up 7.9% to C$998,700.The Bank of Canada warned last month that elevated house-price gains in Toronto exacerbated vulnerabilities posed to financial stability by record household debt and a hot real-estate market.In recent commentary, Canada\u2019s central bank has set the stage for interest rate increases, the first\u00a0in seven years, with a possibility of a jump this coming\u00a0Wednesday, July 12. The central bank hasn\u2019t explicitly cited rising household debt and frothy real estate as a reason to raise rates, although economists say an increase would provide an effective backstop to a number of non-rate tools officials have introduced since the last decade to tamp down housing exuberance.Corrections & Amplifications   In Canada, mortgages for homes sold at 1 million Canadian dollars ($770,000) or more are not eligible for the mortgage insurance.

Mr. Bell is being represented by       Charles Harder,        the lawyer who represented       Terry Bollea,        Hogan\u2019s real name, in a civil case that netted the professional wrestler a $140 million judgment last year and forced Gawker into bankruptcy.\u00a0Mr. Bell is seeking at least $10 million plus punitive damages.\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is without merit and we will contest it vigorously,\u201d       David Ford,        a spokesman for Univision\u2019s Fusion Media Group told The Wall Street Journal in an email Wednesday. Mr. Ford said Univision also will defend the author of the Deadspin story, freelance journalist Ryan Goldberg, who has been sued individually.Mr. Bell\u2019s lawsuit likely will test the preparations Univision and Gawker undertook during the bankruptcy to protect against potential liability arising from stories published before Deadspin and the other blogs were sold in chapter 11. Univision acquired all of Gawker\u2019s blogs, except for its flagship site Gawker.com, for $135 million. The sale was approved by a bankruptcy judge and closed in September.The blogs were sold under a section of the bankruptcy code that provides broad protection to businesses that purchase assets from a bankrupt company. The protection is intended to ensure otherwise valuable assets can be sold for as much money as possible, a benefit to creditors looking to get repaid. For Gawker, money from the Univision sale funded a $31 million settlement to Mr. Bollea, as well as other creditors and shareholders.Univision could argue that the sale prevents Mr. Bell from moving forward with his lawsuit. Gawker\u2019s chapter 11 plan, approved by a bankruptcy judge in December, also included a liability release designed to protect individual writers and editors from lawsuits for stories they wrote before the sale.\u201cWe believe that the writers are protected by the third-party release and injunction set forth in Gawker\u2019s confirmed chapter 11 plan,\u201d said       Dipesh Patel,        a Saul Ewing LLP bankruptcy lawyer who represented former Gawker writers.Mr. Harder didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.Mr. Bell didn\u2019t object to the Univision sale or the Gawker chapter 11 plan. Before the sale closed, Mr. Harder sent letters to Univision demanding that the company take down several stories. In one of these letters, Mr. Harder said Pregame and Mr. Bell would have legal claims against Univision if the Deadspin story wasn\u2019t scrubbed from the web.Univision executives voted last September to take down six posts that at the time were the subject of litigation, according to a story published on Gawker\u2019s Gizmodo site. The union representing Gawker\u2019s editorial staff condemned the decision and said in a statement published on Gizmodo that \u201cit is unacceptable for a publisher to delete legitimate and true news stories for business reasons.\u201dIsaac Lee,        now Univision\u2019s chief content officer, said in an email to Gawker\u2019s staff at the time that the decision to remove the posts arose from the unique circumstances of the bankruptcy and that the decision wasn\u2019t a reflection on the content of those stories. Univision didn\u2019t remove the story about Mr. Bell and other posts Mr. Harder had demanded be taken offline.Mr. Bell\u2019s lawsuit, filed in New York state court, alleges Univision\u2019s Gizmodo Media Group is liable because it either published or has \u201cmaintained\u201d allegedly defamatory statements contained in the Deadspin story. Such an allegation likely will face immediate hurdles. Aside from the bankruptcy sale, Univision as a defense could turn to the single-publication rule, which generally shields publishers from having to face multiple lawsuits following the first publication of a story.A Pennsylvania judge in 2011 blocked defamation actions against a company that acquired through bankruptcy The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News and news site Philly.com.\u00a0Two individuals who were subjects of articles published before that sale argued the company that purchased the newspapers, Philadelphia Media Network Inc., faced new liability because the stories remained on Philly.com.But Judge       Stephen Raslavich       ruled Philadelphia Media Network was protected from new actions because merely keeping the stories online following the sale didn\u2019t mean the company had republished them. Any existing claims these plaintiffs may have had against the papers or their reporters, meanwhile, were extinguished in chapter 11, Judge Raslavich said.Andrew Grossman,        a partner at BakerHostetler LLP, said Univision could point to that decision as a defense to Mr. Bell\u2019s lawsuit. During Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy, BakerHostetler filed a legal brief on behalf of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and more than a dozen other journalism organizations in support of the protection for writers included in Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy plan.\u201cThe fact that they sued Gizmodo is nothing short of baffling,\u201d Mr. Grossman said. \u201cHere, it just seems unimaginable that any claims that would have accrued under the Gawker Media banner would not have been wiped out in bankruptcy.\u201dWrite to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-says-it-will-fight-defamation-suit-over-deadspin-story-1499382641", "news_title": "Univision Says It Will Fight Defamation Suit Over Deadspin Story   ", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,chapter 11,deadspin,defamation,gawker,lawsuit,pregame.com,rj bell,univision,Gawker Media,Univision Communications,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,blogging,political,general news,crime,living,lifestyle,social media,digital content services,broadcasting,television broadcasting,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "Mondelez International Inc.\u2019s        MDLZ 0.78%       sales in the most-recent quarter took a hit from a cyberattack that wreaked havoc across Europe and the U.S. last week, the company said Thursday.While the full impact has yet to be assessed, Mondelez estimates its second-quarter growth rate would be lowered by at least 300 basis points and warned it would book \u201cincremental one-time costs\u201d in the second and third quarters related to the attack.The snack company, whose brands include Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers, didn\u2019t specify any dollar amounts or the projected impact on second-quarter results or financial targets for the year beyond saying it still expects revenue to increase at least 1% organically, which strips out such things as the impact of mergers or acquisitions.The Illinois-based company is slated to release earnings next month.Shares fell 1.3% to $42.50 in after-hours trading.The attack, which security experts dubbed Petya, brought down its IT network, disrupting shipments and the ability to invoice sales during the last four days of the quarter.

The resolution didn\u2019t stipulate any action, but our friends the Russians still objected.The Kremlin excuse is that the draft U.S. statement referred to the rocket as an intercontinental ballistic missile. Never mind that North Korea claims the missile was the equivalent of an ICBM, and the U.S. and other analysis of the trajectory and altitude suggest the same.\u201cThe rationale [for Russia\u2019s rejection] is that based on our (Ministry of Defense\u2019s) assessment we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM,\u201d Russia\u2019s U.N. mission said in an email to other Security Council members. \u201cTherefore we are not in a position to agree to this classification on behalf of the whole council since there is no consensus on this issue.\u201dThe likelier explanation is that Mr. Putin wanted to send a message that he can make trouble if Mr. Trump resists a \u201creset\u201d in U.S.-Russia ties.

While it will be phased in over many years and some obstacles remain, the deal overcomes Japan\u2019s reluctance to open its market to food products as well as Europe\u2019s resistance to a free market for Japanese cars. Some have dubbed the deal \u201ccars for cheese,\u201d but its effects will be more far-reaching than bilateral trade.In particular it contains a message for       Donald Trump,        who pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with Japan and 10 other Pacific nations and has halted negotiations with Europe on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Trade will go on around the world whether or not the U.S. decides to participate. Had the U.S. remained in the Pacific pact, American farmers and other exporters could have enjoyed the increased sales to Japan that are now on offer to Europeans.Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is considering punitive tariffs on imported steel and other products under an obscure provision of a 1962 law. This could lead to tit-for-tat sanctions against American exporters, tie up the U.S. in cases at the World Trade Organization and make it more difficult to secure the opening of foreign markets to American goods.If the U.S. continues on this protectionist path while the rest of the world pursues far-reaching trade deals, the effects are predictable. American exporters will have to pay more for their materials and face higher barriers abroad than their competitors. Consumers will pay higher prices. This will cost American jobs and reduce incomes.The Trump Administration says it still plans to pursue bilateral trade deals, which is in keeping with the President\u2019s transactional view of diplomacy. But this may prove difficult if the U.S. is simultaneously raising tariffs and defending WTO cases brought by trading partners.The U.S. will pay a steeper price if trade blocs such as TPP proceed without America and forge links with other regions. While other countries\u2019 firms will benefit from new multilateral rules, U.S. companies will have to navigate what Columbia University economist       Jagdish Bhagwati       calls a \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d of rules under bilateral agreements.For instance, a preferential tariff on a particular product may only be available if the exporter can show that a certain percentage of the content was made in that country. The bureaucratic complications mean that many companies don\u2019t even apply to use the benefits offered under bilateral deals, and it may mean U.S. companies with global customers must move plants out of America to stay competitive.That\u2019s why multilateral agreements are key to the formation of the complex supply chains trading the components that make up most consumer goods. The Japan-EU deal is still bilateral, but it could become the basis for more deals that exclude the U.S. If Washington cedes trade leadership, it risks being left behind as other countries set the rules and expand trade among themselves.The irony is that the productivity of American manufacturers leads the world, and employment is rebounding. At a moment when U.S. firms could grow their exports, the Trump Administration is burning bridges. The EU-Japan deal is a warning that others will take up trade leadership and capture the prosperity that Americans should enjoy.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-japan-eu-trade-warning-1499382116", "news_title": "The Japan-EU Trade Warning", "keywords": " bilateral trade, donald trump, european union,japan, tariffs, trade, world trade organization,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,tariffs,trade barriers,editorials"}, {"content": "The White House description of       Donald Trump\u2019s       speech Thursday in Warsaw was simply, \u201cRemarks by President Trump to the People of Poland.\u201d In truth, Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were directed at the people of the world. Six months into his first term of office, Mr. Trump finally offered the core of what could become a governing philosophy. It is a determined and affirmative defense of the Western tradition.To be sure, Mr. Trump\u2019s speech also contained several pointed and welcome foreign-policy statements. He assured Poland it would not be held hostage to a single supplier of energy, meaning Russia. He exhorted Russia to stop destabilizing Ukraine \u201cand elsewhere,\u201d to stop supporting Syria and Iran and \u201cinstead join the community of responsible nations.\u201d He explicitly committed to NATO\u2019s Article 5 on mutual defense.But\u2014and this shocked Washington\u2014the speech aimed higher. Like the best presidential speeches, it contained affirmations of ideas and principles and related them to the current political moment. \u201cAmericans, Poles and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty,\u201d he said. This was more than a speech, though. It was an argument. One might even call it an apologia for the West.Mr. Trump built his argument out of Poland\u2019s place in the history of the West, both as a source of its culture\u2014Copernicus, Chopin\u2014and as a physical and spiritual battlefield, especially during World War II. The word Mr. Trump came back to repeatedly to define this experience was \u201cthreat.\u201dDuring and after the war, Poland survived threats to its existence from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Mr. Trump believes that the West today confronts threats of a different sort, threats both physical and cultural. \u201cThis continent,\u201d said Mr. Trump, \u201cno longer confronts the specter of communism. But today we\u2019re in the West, and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life.\u201dHe identified the most immediate security threat as an \u201coppressive ideology.\u201d He was talking about radical Islam, but it is worth noting that he never mentioned radical Islam or Islamic State. Instead, he described the recent commitment by Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations to combat an ideological menace that threatens the world with terrorism. He compared this idea of mutual defense to the alliance of free nations that defeated Nazism and communism.But the speech\u2019s most provocative argument was about our way of life. It came when he described how a million Poles stood with       Pope John Paul II       in Victory Square in 1979 to resist Soviet rule by chanting, \u201cWe want God!\u201d\u201cWith that powerful declaration of who you are,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cyou came to understand what to do and how to live.\u201dThis is a warning to the West and a call to action. By remembering the Poles\u2019 invocation of God, Mr. Trump is clearly aligning himself with the same warning issued to Europe some years ago by Cardinal       Joseph Ratzinger,        who became       Pope Benedict.Cardinal Ratzinger\u2019s argument was that Europe needed to recognize that its turn toward aggressive secularism posed a real threat to its survival. In Mr. Trump\u2019s formulation of that threat, we are obliged to \u201cconfront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.\u201d He warned about a \u201clack of pride and confidence in our values.\u201dMr. Trump is taking a clear stand against the kind of gauzy globalism and vague multiculturalism represented by the worldview of, say,       Barack Obama       and most contemporary Western intellectuals, who are willing, even eager, to concede the argument to critics of the West\u2019s traditions.This is the speech Mr. Trump should have given to introduce himself to the world at his Inauguration. In place of that speech\u2019s resentments, his Warsaw talk offered a better form of nationalism. It is a nationalism rooted in values and beliefs\u2014the rule of law, freedom of expression, religious faith and freedom from oppressive government\u2014that let Europe and then America rise to prominence. This, Mr. Trump is saying, is worth whatever it takes to preserve and protect.It was an important and, we hope, a defining speech\u2014for the Trump Presidency and for Donald Trump himself.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 19:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-defining-speech-1499382025", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Defining Speech", "keywords": "Donald Trump,editorials"}, {"content": "The greatest speeches given in Poland in the modern era were delivered in June 1979 by a pope. Ten months into his papacy, John Paul II sweetly asked the government of Poland for permission to journey home from Rome to visit his people. Europe was divided between the politically free and the unfree, on one side the democracies of Western Europe, on the other the communist bloc. Poland had been under the Soviet yoke since the end of World War II.John Paul knew his people: They did not want dictatorship, and a primary means of resistance was through their faith. Every time you took communion it was a rebellion, a way of reminding yourself and others that you answered to a higher authority. The Catholic Church of Poland survived precariously, within limits, under constant pressure, as John Paul well knew, having been a cardinal in Krakow for 11 years.What would happen when the first Polish pope went home? If Warsaw refused his request it would be an admission of weakness: They feared his power to rouse and awaken the people. But if they invited him they risked rebellion, which would bring on a Soviet crackdown and could bring in Soviet troops. They chose to invite him, calculating that as a sophisticated man he would, knowing the stakes, play it cool. He happily accepted their terms: It would be a religious pilgrimage, not a political event.The Polish government did everything it could to keep crowds down. Parade routes were kept secret or changed. State media would censor word of what was said and done. Grade-school teachers told pupils he was a wicked man in gold robes, an enemy of the state.And so it began. On June 2, in Victory Square in the Old City of Warsaw, John Paul celebrated Mass. Halfway through, the crowd began to chant: \u201cWe want God! We want God!\u201d He asked: What was the greatest work of God? Man. Who redeemed man? Christ. Therefore, he declared, \u201cChrist cannot be kept out of the history of man in any part of the globe, at any longitude or latitude. .\u00a0.\u00a0. The exclusion of Christ from the history of man is an act against man.\u201d Even those who oppose Christ, he said, still inescapably live within the Christian context of history. And Christ is not only the past for Poland, He is also the future, \u201cour Polish future.\u201dThe chant turned to thunder: \u201cWe want God!\u201dJohn Paul was speaking not only to the faithful but to the rulers and apparatchiks of an atheist state. He did not explicitly challenge them. He spoke only of spiritual matters. And yet he was telling the government that Poland is the faith and the faith is Poland, and there is nothing communism can ever do to change that.More, he was saying: God is real. And God sees one unity of Europe. He does not see \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest,\u201d divided by a wall or a gash in the soil. In this way, as I once wrote, he divided the dividers from God\u2019s view of history.The next day he spoke outside the cathedral in the small city of Gniezno. Again, he struck only spiritual themes\u2014nothing about governments, unions, fights for political freedom. \u201cDoes not Christ want, does not the Holy Spirit demand, that the pope, himself a Pole, the pope, himself a Slav, here and now should bring out into the open the spiritual unity of Christian Europe\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.?\u201dOh yes, he said, Christ wants that.At both events he was telling Poles that they should see their position differently. Don\u2019t see Europe divided between free and unfree, see the wholeness that even communism can\u2019t take away. The map makers think they\u2019re in charge. We know who\u2019s really in charge.At the end of the trip, at Krakow\u2019s Blonie Field, a muddy expanse just beyond the city, there was again a public mass. The government refused to publicize it but word spread. Two million people came, the biggest gathering in the history of Poland.It is possible, John Paul said, to dismiss Christ and all he\u2019s brought into the history of man. Human beings are free and can say no. But should they say no to the one \u201cwith whom we have all lived for 1,000 years? He who formed the basis of our identity and has himself remained its basis ever since?\u201d He was telling the communist usurpers: You\u2019ll never win.He extended his hands in an apostolic gesture. \u201cI speak for Christ himself: \u2018Receive the Holy Spirit,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI speak again for St Paul: \u2018Do not grieve the spirit of God.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He urged Poles: \u201cBe strong, my brothers and sisters! You must be strong with the strength that faith gives.\u201dIt sounded like he was telling them to be strong in their resistance to communism.\u201cToday more than in any other age you need this strength.\u201d Love, he said, is stronger than death. Seek spiritual power where \u201ccountless generations of our fathers and mothers have found it.\u201dThis was a reassertion of the Polish spirit, and those who were there went home seeing themselves differently\u2014not as victims of history but as fighters within a new and promising reality. At home they turned on state-run TV, which did not show the crowds and the chants but only a few words by the pope, and a few pictures. They were offended by the lie of it. It was another blow to the government\u2019s claims of legitimacy.Years later I asked Lech Walesa about the impact of the pope\u2019s trip. Poland, he said, always knew that communism could not be reformed but could be defeated. \u201cWe knew the minute he touched the foundations of communism, it would collapse.\u201dAnd so to President Trump\u2019s speech in Warsaw.Near the top he deftly evoked John Paul\u2019s 1979 visit and the sermon that brought on the chants. \u201cA million Polish people did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words: \u2018We want God!\u2019\u00a0\u201d He called the Polish people \u201cthe soul of Europe.\u201dIt was a grown-up speech that said serious things. Article 5, the NATO mutual defense commitment, is still operative. Missile defense is necessary. He called out Russia for its \u201cdestabilizing activities.\u201d He spoke as American presidents once did, in the traditional language of American leadership, with respect for alliances.But he did it with a twist: The West is not just a political but a cultural entity worth fighting for. It is a real thing, has real and radical enemies, and must be preserved.A lovely passage: \u201cWe write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes .\u00a0.\u00a0. and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. We reward brilliance. We strive for excellence. .\u00a0.\u00a0.

This is necessary not because of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 U.S. election but because any compromise of the American deterrent posture toward Russia will make a dangerous international situation even worse.U.S. and Russian officials have cited Ukraine and Syria as areas where agreement may be possible. Yet sanctions against Russians close to Mr. Putin, and against Russia\u2019s banking and energy industries, are necessary to prevent a new outbreak of war in Ukraine. After 10,000 deaths on all sides, including 3,000 civilians, Russia is building a new railway line along its border with Ukraine that would make it possible to transfer troops to the south. At the same time, Moscow is preparing to hold its largest military exercises since 1991, involving an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 troops, in September.Whether or not Russia is preparing to attack, it has not achieved its objectives in Ukraine, including the overthrow of the existing government. The Ukrainian army has improved rapidly. At the same time, American and European sanctions have caused huge losses to Mr. Putin\u2019s cronies, who are believed to be nominal owners of major assets world-wide whose real beneficiary is Putin. That may be why Russia abandoned plans to carve a \u201cNew Russia\u201d out of Ukrainian territory.Last month, Syrian tanks breached the line of separation between the forces of the Russian-backed Assad regime and the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. A Syrian fighter jet began dropping bombs near U.S.-backed forces, and the U.S. shot it down. The Russians then threatened to shoot down coalition aircraft. After several hours of high tension, the Russians agreed to ease the crisis\u2014until next time.Making a new \u201creset\u201d even more inadvisable are signs of Russian involvement with terrorism in Ukraine, Western Europe and in Russia itself. On June 27,       Maksim Shapoval,        a colonel in Ukrainian military intelligence, was killed by a car bomb in central Kiev.       Pavel Sheremet,        a Kremlin critic who wrote for the site Ukrainskaya Pravda, was killed in an identical manner in Kiev on July 20, 2016. Russia said Ukraine \u201chad failed to protect him.\u201dOn March 23,       Denis Voronenkov,        a former Russian legislator who fled to Ukraine, was shot dead outside the Premier Palace Hotel. There was also an attempt to kill       Amina Okueva       and her husband,       Adam Osmayev,        Chechens who fought for Ukraine in the Donbass.       Artur Denisultanov-Kurmakyev,        a Chechen assassin posing as a French journalist, opened fire on them, but Mrs. Okuyeva shot the assassin four times. Both were wounded but survived.Mr. Denisultanov-Kurmakyev earlier worked in Western Europe for the pro-Russian Chechen leader       Ramzan Kadyrov,        and many members of the Chechen diaspora are living in fear of Russian supported assassins.There are also questions about terror in Russia. On April 3 a bomb exploded in the St. Petersburg metro, killing 14, many of them students. The bombing came a week after nationwide anticorruption protests in which young people played the main role. In the aftermath of the attack,       Yuri Shvytkin,        a Duma deputy, proposed a moratorium on public protests.Opposition leaders in Russia noted that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations reported two explosions, one near the Technical Institute station and the other on the red line. A second bomb was later found unexploded in a train on the red line, raising the question of how the authorities knew about the second bomb before it was discovered.Mr. Trump must stick to a formal exchange of positions to avoid being drawn into a false logic. The Putin regime treats the interests of the state, which it identifies with itself, as more important than any objective reality. When Mr. Assad used chemical weapons, Mr. Putin said the charges against Syria were a \u201cprovocation.\u201dAfter Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing 298, the Russians said it was destroyed by a Ukrainian missile and accused the Dutch investigators of bias. In fact, the missile came from a Russian supplied Buk antiaircraft battery, and its path from separatist-held territory was identified by satellite data.More recently, when the U.S. announced plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile-defense system in South Korea,       Sergey Ryabkov,        Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, declared it was time to halt the \u201cdemonization of North Korea.\u201dFaced with this type of mendacity, Mr. Trump needs to show that attempts at deception will not work and that while specific, narrow agreements may be possible, the U.S. is prepared to deter Russian aggression.The protest movement has reappeared in Russia.       Denis Volkov,        a researcher with the Levada Center, has explained the popularity of protest leader       Alexei Navalny       among young Russians. \u201cHe focuses on simple but crucial issues: it is bad to lie, steal, and to be a hypocrite,\u201d Mr. Volkov writes. \u201cCorruption and bribes are wrong.\u201d In the face of this kind of appeal, the U.S. cannot seek an unprincipled deal with Mr. Putin if it wishes to have some influence over Russia\u2019s fate in the years ahead.Mr. Satter is affiliated with the Hudson Institute and Johns Hopkins University. His book, \u201cThe Less You Know, the Better You Sleep: Russia\u2019s Road to Terror and Dictatorship under       Yeltsin       and Putin\u201d (Yale), will be out in paperback this summer.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-must-stand-strong-against-putin-1499381866", "news_title": "Trump Must Stand Strong Against Putin", "keywords": "g20,kiev,putin,russia,trump,ukraine,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "An oft-repeated observation is that government works best when it is closest to the people. But when local and state governments are unduly influenced by special interests, the people may benefit from the checks and balances of the federal government. The Federal Trade Commission furnishes a striking recent example.Tasked with keeping American markets open and competitive, a large part of the FTC\u2019s mission is to enforce the antitrust laws that prevent businesses from hurting consumers with anticompetitive practices. However, not all threats to a free and competitive economy come from the private sector. A new initiative by the FTC, the Economic Liberty Task Force, will combat excessive and anticompetitive occupational licensing regulations at the state and local levels.Nearly one-fourth of American workers are required by law to obtain an occupational license to do their jobs. Ideally, licensing is a regulatory tool of last resort to be used when other approaches are insufficient to protect public health and safety.But licensing has become much more prevalent in recent decades, creating a patchwork of barriers to work that are often arbitrary, costly to workers and consumers, and bad at protecting public safety. Many states require licenses for activities with almost no public risk, such as flower arranging, auctioneering, tour guiding and interior decorating. A 2015 Obama administration report on occupational licensure found little evidence that licensing improved quality, and abundant evidence that it raises consumer prices.The burden of licensing requirements falls especially hard on certain communities. Military spouses are likelier than the general population to work in licensed professions. Immigrants also face a higher burden, since many states require domestic work experience or education to obtain a license. And many states make it difficult or impossible for those with criminal records to obtain a license.Despite an emerging cross-ideological consensus that occupational licensure is often unnecessarily burdensome, excessive licensure persists\u2014and in many instances it is expanding in size and scope. This should come as no surprise: Many of the benefits of licensing accrue to well-organized groups of industry insiders, while the costs are more diffuse. These insiders are able to out-lobby the much larger group of consumers and aspiring professionals who bear the costs of licensure (often unknowingly) and who stand to gain from liberalization.This is where the FTC task force comes in. Building on the FTC\u2019s excellent work related to occupational licensing\u2014including friend-of-the-court briefs, staff research and public statements during both Republican and Democratic administrations\u2014the task force will provide a repository of research accessible to policy makers and the general public. The task force will also solicit reform ideas from a range of licensing stakeholders, using professional input to refine their approach. State and local policy makers often lack the time and resources to conduct their own in-depth analyses of licensing regulations and can benefit substantially from the hands-on assistance the agency will provide.This assistance is all the more needed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC (2015). In that case, a state board controlled by practicing dentists attempted to bar unlicensed nondentists from whitening teeth. The FTC objected to this anticompetitive regulatory action and ultimately prevailed in the Supreme Court.Historically, certain state actions have been immune from antitrust scrutiny\u2014i.e., if the state organizes the anticompetitive activity, it\u2019s not illegal. In the North Carolina case, however, the high court held that if members of an occupation dominate a licensing board, then the state\u2019s political branches must \u201cactively supervise\u201d the board in order to claim immunity. This decision has spurred policy makers everywhere to rethink licensing regimes and presents additional opportunities for FTC enforcement.The new FTC initiative can help give a voice to the diffuse groups harmed by anticompetitive licensing regulations. And the Federal Trade Commission is uniquely positioned to tackle this issue, with its longstanding and bipartisan tradition of promoting competition, and a professional staff well-versed in the economic evidence.As a federal agency with broad responsibilities, the FTC is also less susceptible to undue influence than local regulatory boards, which tend to be dominated by the professions they regulate. For the sake of consumers and workers everywhere, we wish them luck.Mr. Mitchell is a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.

Among these were a proposal against the company\u2019s use of antibiotics in its meat supply, brought by the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas; and one by the nonprofit Holy Land Principles, which wanted the company to modify its employment practices in Israel. The Boerne Sisters own 52 McDonald\u2019s shares. The Holy Land group owns 47. None of this year\u2019s sponsoring shareholders owned more than 0.0001% of the company\u2019s stock.All seven proposals failed. Four were opposed by more than 90% of shareholders. Still, all but two of the proposals could be introduced on McDonald\u2019s proxy ballots next year. Holy Land Principles introduced the same anti-Israel proposal in 2016, and almost 97% of shareholders voted against it.The Securities and Exchange Commission has long enabled small shareholders to pursue such agendas. Under current SEC rules, any shareholder in a publicly traded corporation that has held at least $2,000 in stock for at least a year may place a proposal on the company\u2019s proxy ballot. A shareholder can introduce the same proposal year after year, even when 90% of all voting shareholders consistently oppose it.Such permissive rules come at a cost. According to an SEC survey, it costs more than $100,000 merely to respond to a shareholder proposal and include it on the ballot. The far greater cost comes from the distractions such proposals create for directors and senior executives, as well as the risk that companies will change their policies under pressure.McDonald\u2019s is unlikely to change its food-supply practices based on a few nuns\u2019 activism, but in many cases boards have capitulated even when most shareholders rejected a proposal. Since the start of 2006, the 250 largest publicly traded companies in America, tracked in the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Proxy Monitor database, have faced 515 proposals to change how they disclose or engage in political activity and lobbying. Only one of these received majority shareholder support over board opposition. But the Center for Political Accountability, the group leading the shareholder-proposal push, claims 305 companies have changed their approach to politics as a result of its efforts.Shareholder-proposal activism can hurt other stockholders. A 2015 Manhattan Institute study by       Tracie Woidtke       of the University of Tennessee found that social-investing activism on the part of public pension funds was significantly associated with lower share values\u2014costing shareholders hundreds of billions of dollars in total.This could all change if Congress enacts the Financial Choice Act 2.0. Principally an overhaul of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial legislation, the 602-page bill, which the House passed last month, would also make it harder to resubmit failed shareholder proposals. Although a proposal could be resubmitted if only 6% of voting shareholders support it in its first year, that threshold would rise to 30% of voting shareholders by its third year.The reform is modest. Historically, the 30% threshold would exclude only about one-third of all resubmitted shareholder proposals. Still, the new rule would prevent activists pushing agendas with minuscule shareholder support from co-opting corporate annual meetings year after year.The Choice Act\u2019s approach to shareholder ownership is more sweeping and more controversial. The legislation would eliminate the $2,000 ownership threshold and require shareholders to own 1% of the company\u2019s stock to introduce a shareholder proposal. In addition, the shareholder would need to have held the stock for three years, not just one.For most companies, the new ownership rule makes sense, but as the legislation proceeds, legislators may wish to lower the threshold for larger corporations, for which a 1% threshold would preclude all but the largest investors from submitting proposals. In a proposal last year, the Business Roundtable suggested a 0.15% threshold for the biggest companies.Overall, the Choice Act does not go far enough. As I have previously urged in these pages, the SEC should go back to its former rule allowing companies to exclude social- and policy-oriented shareholder proposals from proxy ballots altogether\u2014a result consistent with the overwhelming majority of shareholder votes and Ms. Woidtke\u2019s research demonstrating the market cost of such activism.Most shareholder proposals, like each of those faced by McDonald\u2019s, are sponsored by individual \u201ccorporate gadfly\u201d investors who repeatedly file similar proposals across a broad set of companies, or groups with religious, policy or pro-labor agendas. Shareholder proposals can be a useful way for stockholders to communicate with corporate boards about business concerns. But in each of the past 12 years, institutional investors without an ideological purpose or an affiliation with public or private labor interests have sponsored less than 1% of all shareholder proposals.The Choice Act\u2019s proposed new rules are largely consistent with this reality and would better orient the shareholder-proposal process toward most stockholders\u2019 economic interests.Mr. Copland is the Manhattan Institute\u2019s director of legal policy.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-shareholder-proposal-mcdonalds-deserves-a-break-today-1499381801", "news_title": "Another Shareholder Proposal?

From the beginning, they warned me. The Sox always lose when it counts the most, they would say. Always. And the team did keep losing in the clutch, the worst example being its collapse against the New York Mets in 1986. (I watched Game Six as a nervous 10-year-old, my head and body covered in a knitted blanket.) By 2013, the world had changed. The Sox had won the World Series in 2004 and 2007 and now would fight for a third crown. My oldest brother, Leo, and I went to Game Two in Boston and saw the Sox lose 4-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Unlike the tortured Sox fans we once were, the two of us by now had no worries or doubts. In Game Six, which we again saw from Fenway seats, the Sox closed the deal. We slapped hands with everyone, raised our arms and yelped for another title. Leo and I enjoyed every minute of that night and know who is responsible: David Ortiz.The players gathering next week in Miami\u2019s All-Star Game will dazzle with home runs, nasty pitches and stolen bases. But overall the game will lack pizzazz without a visit from Mr. Ortiz, whose final All-Star appearance last year inspired enough cheers and claps to flood the ears. The player was as charismatic then as ever before: To me, he has always seemed like       Babe Ruth       reincarnate. His cheeks and nose, like Ruth\u2019s, were big and his smile broad. Like Ruth\u2019s, his swing was vicious (he hit 541 home runs in his career). And when baseball counts the most, in the playoffs, he played his best: 17 home runs in 85 games with 61 runs batted in. In 14 World Series games, Mr. Ortiz smacked hits at a .455 average. In the 2013 World Series, he hit .688 with eight walks, two homers and a 1.188 slugging percentage.In \u201cPapi: My Story,\u201d Mr. Ortiz talks with longtime sports writer       Michael Holley       about that historic series and a lot more. Mr. Holley writes crisp, straightforward and organized prose, moving swiftly from the player\u2019s childhood in the Dominican Republic to his early failure with the Minnesota Twins and then, at Boston, his eventual dominance. Yet the book sounds a lot like Mr. Ortiz\u2019s voice, especially when it comes to the people the player adores\u2014the pitcher       Pedro Mart\u00ednez,        for example\u2014and the ones he dislikes.By David Ortiz  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 262 pages, $28Often these are managers. There\u2019s his disdain for Twins manager       Tom Kelly       (\u201cI know he\u2019s recognized as a good baseball man, but he struck me as a guy who believed his players were dumb.\u201d) There\u2019s his disrespect for onetime Red Sox manager       Terry Francona,        who once embarrassed Mr. Ortiz in the middle of a slump by pinch-hitting for him in an unimportant regular-season game. Remember temperamental manager       Bobby Valentine      ? Once he cussed so wildly at a teammate that Mr. Ortiz felt it went too far. \u201cListen,\u201d he writes, \u201cif it had been me, I would have gone up to him, right in front of the fans, and dropped a punch.\u201dMr. Ortiz also talks about his 2003 positive drug test, revealed in 2009. Like most writers who have covered sports for years, I\u2019m skeptical when athletes make claims of innocence. With Mr. Ortiz, my heart\u2019s too big. I want to believe it when he says that he was careless about supplements and vitamins, but \u201cI never bought steroids or used steroids.\u201d High-ranking baseball officials back him up, too. In the book, Mr. Ortiz says that major-league baseball tested him for drugs \u201cmore than anybody\u201d over the period from 2004 until his retirement in 2016. Does that clinch it? Most would say, \u201cno way.\u201d As for me, I\u2019m sticking with him. \u201cI had done my best work in the testing era, not the steroid era,\u201d he writes.Of all Mr. Ortiz\u2019s efforts, his best by far came in 2013. He was 37 years old at this point, and he had to loosen up more before at-bats, often struggling with stiff and sore muscles. But he still could hit the ball. This was also the year that terrorists bombed the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring hundreds. In a speech Mr. Ortiz ripped the attack with one of his often-used F-words and made everyone cheer.On paper, the 2013 Sox were beatable, just like any high-scoring team that had so-so starters. They didn\u2019t have the best defense, though it was solid. They stole bases better than most teams. They also struck out a lot. They had two excellent pitchers:       Jon Lester,        who came up with the Red Sox and survived a cancer diagnosis early in his career; and the magical reliever       Koji Uehara,        signed as a free agent the year before. Every other pitcher could be hit. Yet in every game, no matter the score, they were calm, cheerful and relentless. Mr. Ortiz led the way, especially in a playoff game against the Detroit Tigers that defined him.The Sox had lost the opening game at home and in the second game trailed 5-1 in the eighth inning. After Sox second baseman       Dustin Pedroia       loaded the bases, the Tigers brought in       Joaqu\u00edn Benoit,        who had struck out Mr. Ortiz earlier in the season with a deadly change-up (the pitch looked like a 96-mph fastball but was only 86 mph and had some fade).Papi had slumped so far, going zero-for-six in the series, with four strikeouts. But Mr. Ortiz\u2014in part from studying video\u2014was ready for Mr. Benoit. He guessed that the change-up would come first, and when it did, he smacked the ball, low and fast, to right field.

Truly believing in God, Buddha, Allah or Shiva should inspire one to be an honest human being. Some people claim to have faith in their religion but act counter to its ethical injunctions. They pray for the success of their dishonest and corrupt actions, asking God or Buddha for help in covering up their wrongdoings. There is no point in such people describing themselves as religious.Today the world faces a crisis related to lack of respect for spiritual principles and ethical values. Such virtues cannot be forced on society by legislation or by science, nor can fear inspire ethical conduct. Rather, people must have conviction in the worth of ethical principles so that they want to live ethically.The U.S. and India, for example, have solid governmental institutions, but many of the people involved lack ethical principles. Self-discipline and self-restraint of all citizens\u2014from CEOs to lawmakers to teachers\u2014are needed to create a good society. But these virtues cannot be imposed from the outside. They require inner cultivation. This is why spirituality and religion are relevant in the modern world.India, where I now live, has been home to the ideas of secularism, inclusiveness and diversity for some 3,000 years. One philosophical tradition asserts that only what we know through our five senses exists. Other Indian philosophical schools criticize this nihilistic view but still regard the people who hold it as rishis, or sages. I promote this type of secularism: to be a kind person who does not harm others regardless of profound religious differences.In previous centuries, Tibetans knew little about the rest of the world. We lived on a high and broad plateau surrounded by the world\u2019s tallest mountains. Almost everyone, except for a small community of Muslims, was Buddhist. Very few foreigners came to our land. Since we went into exile in 1959, Tibetans have been in contact with the rest of the world. We relate with religions, ethnic groups and cultures that hold a broad spectrum of views.Further, Tibetan youth now receive a modern education in which they are exposed to opinions not traditionally found in their community. It is now imperative that Tibetan Buddhists be able to explain clearly their tenets and beliefs to others using reason. Simply quoting from Buddhist scriptures does not convince people who did not grow up as Buddhists of the validity of the Buddha\u2019s doctrine. If we try to prove points only by quoting scripture, these people may respond: \u201cEveryone has a book to quote from!\u201dReligion faces three principal challenges today: communism, modern science and the combination of consumerism and materialism. Although the Cold War ended decades ago, communist beliefs and governments still strongly affect life in Buddhist countries. In Tibet, the communist government controls the ordination of monks and nuns while also regulating life in the monasteries and nunneries. It controls the education system, teaching children that Buddhism is old-fashioned.Modern science, up until now, has confined itself to studying phenomena that are material in nature. Scientists largely examine only what can be measured with scientific instruments, limiting the scope of their investigations and their understanding of the universe. Phenomena such as rebirth and the existence of the mind as separate from the brain are beyond the scope of scientific investigation. Some scientists, although they have no proof that these phenomena do not exist, consider them unworthy of consideration. But there is reason for optimism. In recent years, I have met with many open-minded scientists, and we have had mutually beneficial discussions that have highlighted our common points as well as our diverging ideas\u2014expanding the world views of scientists and Buddhists in the process.Then there is materialism and consumerism. Religion values ethical conduct, which may involve delayed gratification, whereas consumerism directs us toward immediate happiness. Faith traditions stress inner satisfaction and a peaceful mind, while materialism says that happiness comes from external objects. Religious values such as kindness, generosity and honesty get lost in the rush to make more money and have more and \u201cbetter\u201d possessions. Many people\u2019s minds are confused about what happiness is and how to create its causes.If you study the Buddha\u2019s teachings, you may find that some of them are in harmony with your views on societal values, science and consumerism\u2014and some of them are not. That is fine. Continue to investigate and reflect on what you discover. In this way, whatever conclusion you reach will be based on reason, not simply on tradition, peer pressure or blind faith.The 14th       Dalai Lama,       Tenzin Gyatso,        is the spiritual leader of Tibet.

The best doctors in the world are racing to find a cure. Meanwhile, legislation promoting assisted suicide all over the nation would dismantle essential protections and care on which I, and so many others, depend as we fight terminal illnesses. Bills that would legalize or expand assisted suicide have been introduced in 29 states.Three years ago, I was living the American dream. I was happily married, our son had just turned 1, and I had a job I loved. My life changed in an instant. I had a grand mal seizure at work and went to the hospital. Doctors ran tests, including a CT scan, but could not find anything wrong. As they were preparing to send me home, my wife demanded an MRI.That\u2019s when they found the cancer\u2014grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme. The neurosurgeon told me it was inoperable; my prognosis was four months to live. Three doctors told me there was nothing they could do. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation rarely work on this type of brain cancer.I\u2019m a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of Iraq. I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life and always resolved never to give up, but there was a moment after my diagnosis when I felt despair. In that moment, had assisted suicide been an option, I might have taken it. With my family\u2019s support, I came through that depression. But not everyone is lucky enough to have that kind of support.So despite the doctors\u2019 pessimistic prognosis, I pursued standard and experimental treatments. I knew doctors weren\u2019t always right and I was going to fight for every moment of life I had left. That was three years ago. Today our second child is on the way.Sadly, too many others\u2014thrown into clinical depression by a grim prognosis, illness-induced disability or fears of being a burden\u2014lose hope and become willing to take their own lives. A study conducted in Oregon in 2006 found 25% of patients requesting assisted suicide were depressed, and several of them went on to receive the lethal medication.Legislation being pushed throughout the country promotes assisted suicide for cases like mine. Instead of providing support and working to make life more comfortable, this legislation would encourage victims to choose the least expensive option\u2014death. We cannot trust insurance companies, which are profit-driven businesses, to continue offering quality care to terminally ill patients. They will choose the cheaper option every time.I\u2019ve seen the danger of assisted suicide, and that is what moved me to dedicate the last year and a half to fighting assisted-suicide legislation across the country with the Patients Rights Action Fund. If suicide becomes a normal medical treatment for terminally ill patients, lives will be tragically shortened, as patients who might have outlived their prognoses by months or even years kill themselves prematurely.Mr. Hanson is president of the Patients Rights Action Fund.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-want-my-doctors-to-help-me-live-not-die-1499381064", "news_title": "I Want My Doctors to Help Me Live, Not Die", "keywords": "assisted suicide,brain cancer,euthanasia,terminal illness,cancer,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,medical conditions,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,suicide,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Today\u2019s Washington is overrun by two kinds of crimes.The first is the still-speculative kind, which the Washington press corps obsesses over\u2014      Trump      -Russia collusion, obstruction of justice\u2014despite no evidence of its existence. By all accounts, special counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       growing team of Democratic lawyers intends to devote itself to this fiction.Yet if Mr. Mueller were serious about bringing down a threat to the nation, or even carving himself a place in history, he\u2019d be tackling the second kind of crime, the real kind. These are the crimes that occur constantly and actually harm national security, even if they\u2019re routinely ignored by a self-interested media. We are talking of course about the serial leaking of sensitive information, the daily profession of a new government elite akin to an organized crime network.Lucky for Mr. Mueller, he doesn\u2019t even need his army of legal investigators to get an immediate handle on this mafia. He can instead stroll down to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. That\u2019s the purview of Sen.       Ron Johnson,        who keeps dogged oversight of government among his many self-set tasks.That mission resulted this week in a shocking staff analysis of the recent deluge of secret-spilling, and the manner in which these unauthorized disclosures are harming national security. It\u2019s the first congressional scrutiny of the leaks\u2014and notable for its straight-up nature. This is no partisan document. It\u2019s a bloodless accounting of a national-security failure, perpetrated by dozens of government employees willfully breaking the law.The first 126 days of the Trump administration featured 125 stories that leaked harmful information. Just under one a day. The committee staff judged the stories against a 2009       Barack Obama       executive order that laid out what counted as information likely to damage national security. And as it chose to not include borderline leaks or \u201cpalace intrigue\u201d stories, that number is an understatement.For reference, the first 126 days of the Obama term featured 18 stories that met the criteria. Ten of those were actually leaks about       George W. Bush\u2019s       \u201ctorture memo,\u201d which Mr. Obama released.The Trump leaks show the sweeping nature of this enterprise, coming as they have from \u201cU.S. officials,\u201d \u201cformer U.S. officials,\u201d \u201csenior U.S. officials,\u201d \u201cintelligence officials,\u201d \u201cnational security officials,\u201d \u201cJustice Department officials,\u201d \u201cdefense officials\u201d and \u201claw-enforcement officials.\u201d One story cited more than two dozen anonymous sources. Alarmingly, the titles, and the nature of the information disclosed, indicate that many leaks are coming directly from the U.S. intelligence community.What\u2019s been disclosed? The contents of wiretapped information. The names of individuals the U.S. monitors, and where they are located. The communications channels used to monitor targets. Which agencies are monitoring. Intelligence intercepts. FBI interviews. Grand jury subpoenas. Secret surveillance-court details. Internal discussions. Military operations intelligence. The contents of the president\u2019s calls with foreign leaders.The analysis lays out the real and the assumed fallout. One clear example is the May stories hyperventilating that Mr. Trump shared classified intelligence with the Russians. Subsequent leaks suggested Israel provided the intelligence, about Islamic State. This revelation caused a diplomatic incident, and reportedly a change in the way Israel shares with the U.S. Even former Obama CIA Director       John Brennan       called the leak \u201cappalling.\u201dHow many foreign allies are pulling back? How many will work with a U.S. government that has disclosed military plans, weapons systems and cybersecurity tactics? What have our enemies learned? One March story divulged sensitive FBI data on U.S. border vulnerabilities, in hopes of undercutting Mr. Trump\u2019s travel order.The Johnson report doesn\u2019t go here, but let\u2019s go ourselves: This is lawbreaking, in the aid of a political hit job. The leaking syndicate can\u2019t claim whistleblower status, since it has yet to leak a piece of evidence showing Trump wrongdoing. This is about taking out a president. And with a role model like       James Comey      \u2014who wrote secret memos with the express purpose of leaking and launching a special counsel\u2014that\u2019s no surprise.But as Mr. Mueller surely knows, the Espionage Act doesn\u2019t trifle with intentions. As even the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has noted, leaks enjoy \u201cno First Amendment protection, regardless of the motives,\u201d and no accused leaker \u201chas ever been acquitted based on a finding that the public interest was so great\u201d that it justified unlawful disclosure.Mr. Mueller is sitting astride a leak crime wave, run by a bureaucratic underworld that is happy to harm U.S. interests if it maims a president. He can dig four years into Trump hearsay and innuendo. Or he can, more immediately, take action that would rein in the lawbreakers and restore some calm to the Capitol and the media.

An instructor even gave the crowd a pre-party lesson in how to execute the perfect hustle, the signature disco dance.The disco night was part of a much larger event in the center\u2019s more traditional-minded lineup. Dubbed Midsummer Night Swing, the three-week affair, which runs through July 15, has become one of the venue\u2019s hotly anticipated annual features.Each night brings some of the city\u2019s top amateur dancers\u2014and those who just like to move to the beat of a live band\u2014to Damrosch Park on the southwestern edge of the center\u2019s campus. Crowds typically number in the thousands, including those who opt to pay up to $20 to dance on a floor the center installs under the bandstand. The center also sells season passes, good for all 16 nights of the event, for $170.As the disco night attested, Midsummer Night Swing, now in its 29th\u00a0year, isn\u2019t just about swing. Dance styles vary from night to night: Ballroom and salsa are the biggest draws, say center officials, but the affair ventures into more eclectic territory. Consider the Texas two-step event on\u00a0July 14, with honky-tonk veterans       Ray Benson       and       Dale Watson       providing the music.No matter what the style, Midsummer Night Swing attracts a fair number of regulars such as       Sidney Chaklai,        a remarkably limber 87-year-old who has been attending for at least a decade. He said he prefers the tango, waltz and salsa, but he doesn\u2019t get too particular: \u201cIf the music is great, I can do that dance.\u201dBecause of the intimate nature of dancing, it is perhaps no surprise that over the years, Midsummer Night Swing also has seen a number of romances blossom.Last year, dance enthusiast       Richard Kurtzer       proposed to his similarly dance-obsessed girlfriend       Jennifer Euler       at the event. Sure enough, she accepted.\u201cIt was a wonderful, wonderful moment,\u201d said Mr. Kurtzer, who works in software sales.He noted how he and Ms. Euler, both regulars at the event, know dozens of other Midsummer Night Swing attendees, so the occasion became something of a community celebration.The party doesn\u2019t stop at the dance floor\u2014or at least the official dance floor. For those who would prefer not to pay the nightly fee, the Damrosch Park area is fully open for a little waltzing, or disco dancing, on the concrete.That is where Tyeweed Turner, aka Stiletto, can be found most nights during the event.       Mr. Turner,        54 years old, can afford the ticket. It is just that he prefers the relaxed, fun-loving vibe away from the floor.\u201cWe\u2019re street dancers. We learned out here on concrete,\u201d he said.For Lincoln Center, Midsummer Night Swing is a chance to welcome an audience beyond those who usually attend its offerings of symphonic music, ballet, opera and the like.Officials at the nonprofit center won\u2019t say if the event is a moneymaker, but they hint that isn\u2019t a top concern. If anything, they are thinking about ways to heighten the experience.In recent years, the center, in partnership with Restaurant Associates, its food-and-beverage operator, has beefed up the culinary side of the event, welcoming food trucks and specialty caterers to the affair.Still, Restaurant Associates general manager       Thierry Sighel       says the event\u2019s biggest seller remains bottled water\u2014just what those thirsty dancers need during breaks in the action. \u201cWe have cases and cases in the back,\u201d he said.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dance-event-in-full-swing-at-lincoln-center-1499380349", "news_title": "Dance Event in Full Swing at Lincoln Center", "keywords": "lincoln center dancing,midsummer night swing,nyc dance event,Dale Watson,Jennifer Euler,Mr. Turner,Richard Kurtzer,Sidney Chaklai,political,general news,dance,ballet,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "Entertainer       Bill Cosby       will be retried on sexual-assault charges starting\u00a0Nov. 6, a Pennsylvania judge ruled\u00a0Thursday.Last month\u2019s trial in suburban Philadelphia ended in a mistrial when a jury couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict after six days of deliberations.Montgomery County, Pa., District Attorney       Kevin Steele       quickly announced plans for a fresh trial following the decision, saying he remained confident in the prosecution\u2019s case.Mr. Cosby, 79 years old, faces three counts of indecent aggravated assault and up to 10 years in prison.

At a joint news conference in Warsaw with his Polish counterpart,       Andrzej Duda,        Mr. Trump said that North Korean leaders were \u201cbehaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done about it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say what steps he might take or if he was contemplating military action. Later in the same forum, Mr. Trump said \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to do them,\u201d adding, \u201cI think we will just take a look at what happens over the coming weeks and months with respect to North Korea.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s successful launch Tuesday of what experts say was its first ballistic missile capable of reaching the continental U.S. escalated the diplomatic face-off. The actual threat is still unclear. Many experts doubt North Korean claims that it has the ability to mount a nuclear bomb on such a long-range missile.Military reprisal by the U.S. carries substantial risks not only to U.S. forces, but to American allies in Asia, especially to North Korea\u2019s neighbors in South Korea and Japan.The Trump administration has sought other avenues to choke off North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, above all trying to persuade China to use its sway as the country\u2019s largest trading partner to rein in Pyongyang.U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       has pressed China and other countries that host North Korean guest workers and conduct business with Pyongyang to scale back those ties, a department spokeswoman said. Washington remains in a \u201cdiplomatic phase\u201d to address Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program and is considering fresh sanctions to against the country and others that do business with it, she said. Last week the Trump administration said it would cut China\u2019s Bank of Dandong off from the U.S. financial system.\u201cIf you are doing business with North Korea that is $2 million worth, for example, a lot of countries will say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not much money,\u2019\u201d said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman. \u201cThis secretary and other folks in this administration have come back and they say, \u2018Cut that in half.\u2019\u201d\u200bNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the Trump administration would introduce new sanctions against North Korea in the Security Council. She said the U.S. would be willing to use military force if punitive restrictions fail. Ms. Haley also said the U.S. would target countries that have trade partnerships with North Korea, pointing specifically to China.Both China and Russia have balked at new sanctions or military pressure against North Korea. Beijing is worried such actions could spark a humanitarian crisis on its doorstep.On Thursday, U.S. efforts in the Security Council hit a hurdle when Moscow disputed conclusions that Pyongyang had fired an intercontinental ballistic missile.Mr. Mattis said the lack of a consensus didn\u2019t suggest an absence of international concern. \u201cI think everyone is trying, some have different ideas of approaches, that\u2019s the normal part of diplomacy to work this out,\u201d he said.The U.S. defense chief called North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un\u2019s       launches a \u201cvery serious escalation, this provocation, this affront\u201d to U.N. Security Council resolutions that forbid them.But diplomacy, Mr. Mattis said, hasn\u2019t failed. Self-restraint, he said, has prevented war as the U.S. engages with allies and pushes toward a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach, along with allies.He also issued a caveat: \u201cObviously, any kind of effort by North Korea to start a war would lead to severe consequences.\u201d\u2014Felicia Schwartz in Washington and Farnaz Fassihi at the United Nations contributed to this article.Write to Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Sticks to Diplomacy on North Korea.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-considers-severe-things-over-north-korea-threat-1499335636", "news_title": "U.S. to Give Diplomacy More Time to Resolve North Korea Threat ", "keywords": "g-20,group of 20,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,trump trip,us-north korea,us-poland relations,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,nuclear weapons programs,politics,risk news,military action,weapons programs"}, {"content": "Illinois has a budget for the first time in more than two years, ending a standoff that threatened to downgrade the state\u2019s debt to junk status and was wreaking havoc with cities, colleges and school districts across the state.The state\u2019s House of Representatives, led by Democratic Speaker Michael Madigan, voted Thursday to override Republican Gov.       Bruce Rauner\u2019s       vetoes of revenue and spending measures the chamber passed Sunday.The House\u2019s repudiation of the governor marked the final hurdle in enacting a budget for Illinois\u2014the first state in the union to have gone without a budget for more than a year since the Great Depression. Illinois entered its third fiscal year without a budget on July 1.\u201cThe people in this chamber did not do what was easy today, but they did do what was right for the future of our state,\u201d Mr. Madigan said on the House floor following the votes.\u201cToday was another step in Illinois\u2019 never-ending tragic trail of tax hikes,\u201d Mr. Rauner said in a statement after the vote. \u201cIt proves how desperately we need real property tax relief and term limits.\u201dThe new budget funds a more than $36 billion spending proposal with a roughly $5 billion income tax increase. The state brings in roughly $32 billion a year.The plan also includes a provision that would allow Illinois to borrow billions of dollars through the sale of state bonds. Those funds would go toward paying down the $14.6 billion in unpaid bills the state has accrued since 2015.Illinois bond prices have climbed this week as lawmakers made progress toward a budget. A 2014 Illinois general obligation bond maturing in 2030 traded at 99.5 cents on the dollar Thursday, up from 99 cents Wednesday.Mr. Madigan achieved \u201cyes\u201d votes from 10 Republican lawmakers, many of whom represent districts with struggling universities or beleaguered state facilities reliant on state funding.Backlash against Republicans who broke with the governor was so intense this week that House GOP lawmakers received a memo from the leader\u2019s office Wednesday instructing members on what to do if they receive abusive or threatening messages on social media.Ahead of the House action Thursday, the Capitol was put on lockdown while a Hazmat crew investigated reports of a woman throwing an unidentified white powder into the offices of the governor and other areas.The record-breaking impasse is the result of a political standoff between Mr. Rauner, a wealthy businessman elected in November 2014 on a promise to shatter the status quo in Springfield, and Mr. Madigan, a powerful Chicago Democrat who has served as House Speaker for all but two years since 1983.On Tuesday, the Senate granted approval to the House\u2019s budget, written primarily by Democratic Rep. Greg Harris, Mr. Madigan\u2019s top lieutenant in budget negotiations.That same day, the governor vetoed the package that cleared the Democratic legislature. The Senate reconvened to override Mr. Rauner\u2019s rejection within the hour, sending the budget back to the House for its last hearing.Debate at the Capitol this week has centered on the budget\u2019s revenue bill, which increases the state\u2019s personal income-tax rate from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate income-tax rate from 5.25% to 7%.The roughly $5 billion generated from those tax increases funds a spending bill that includes a 5% cut to government agencies and reduces state higher education funding by 10%.The governor preferred the income-tax increase be temporary.\u201cDo not push for a tax hike with no fundamental reforms. Don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Rauner said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cThis income tax hike is booby-trapped. It\u2019s got land mines all over it.\u201dMr. Madigan overrode the governor\u2019s veto of the tax increase Thursday with the minimum three-fifths-majority of 71 votes.The Senate, which has a Democratic supermajority, overrode the governor\u2019s veto of the revenue measure with the minimum number of required votes Tuesday. Only one Republican member, representing Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, voted in favor of the tax increase.Despite Thursday\u2019s progress, a budget may not be able to stave off Wall Street bond houses from downgrading the state\u2019s credit rating to junk status.Moody\u2019s Investors Service announced Wednesday it was officially placing Illinois\u2019s rating on review for a possible downgrade, even after factoring in the House\u2019s likely override of the governor\u2019s vetoes.\u201cDespite the progress toward budget balance that the emerging fiscal plan embodies, the plan entails substantial implementation risk,\u201d said Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe plan\u2026 appears to lack broad bipartisan support, which may signal shortcomings in its effectiveness once implemented.\u201dIllinois must also address its roughly $126.5 billion in unfunded pension liabilities\u2014an evaluation from the state based on more optimistic investment assumptions. Moody\u2019s estimates the actual pension shortfall to be roughly $250 billion.Negotiations among lawmakers will continue in coming days.

Against all odds, one relatively niche segment of the market is thriving: namely, custom-made traditional bows, whose ages-old designs are rendered in expertly crafted wood.\u201cThere is definitely a movement back towards traditional archery and its history and artistry,\u201d said Alan Pope, president of Blacktail Bow Company. Blacktail\u2019s custom bows run from $1,195 to upward of $10,000, depending on the materials and the intricacy of the carvings. The company currently has an eight-month waiting list.So strong is demand for old-school, handcrafted bows that makers have been scrambling to find and train enough apprentices to keep up with orders. Blacktail\u2014founded in Reedsport, Ore., 26 years ago\u2014recently added a workshop in Indiana and is in the process of expanding to a larger facility.Similarly, Montana-based RER Bows is searching for new apprentices and a larger space.\u2018\u2018Shooting [a classic bow] isn\u2019t about strength; you have to be extremely focused.\u2019\u2019\u201cEvery month I sell more and more bows,\u201d said RER co-owner Chester Floyd. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is going to slow down.\u201d His company is projected to sell 200 bows this year, double last year\u2019s figures. The company currently has a five-month waiting list.Mr. Floyd, 25, has been struck by the popularity of traditional archery among his millennial peers. \u201cI think it used to be a niche sport for older guys, but now a lot of our sales are to people in their teens, 20s and 30s,\u201d he said. As \u201ceverything gets more tech-based and complicated, from our phones to bikes,\u201d he added, \u201cpeople are looking for simplicity. A wood bow is simplicity.\u201dOverall, about 18.9 million adult Americans participated in the sport in 2012, including target archers and hunters, according to the Archery Trade Association. By 2015 (the most recent figures), the number had risen to 21.6 million.To Eva Shockey, a professional bow hunter and author of the forthcoming book \u201cTaking Aim: Daring to Be Different, Happier, and Healthier in the Great Outdoors,\u201d the sport has deep appeal. \u201cStick and string is a way men and women have hunted\u201d for millennia, she said. \u201cTo know that many of your ancestors hunted and shot the same sort of weapon to put food on the table for their families is something everyone can relate to.\u201dThe majority of archers today use a compound bow, a highly technical-looking contraption with only a faint resemblance to its wooden forebears. Produced using fiberglass and lightweight metals like aluminum or magnesium alloy, compound bows are outfitted with sights and levels to aid shooting accuracy.But many archers are forgoing fancier compound bows for traditional wooden ones. \u201cThere is a lot of effort to draw people into the compound-bow world, but once people master that, they often want the next challenge, with no gadgets or aids,\u201d said Blacktail\u2019s Mr. Pope.Most traditional bows are made primarily of wood, and they lack any sighting aids. To hit a target, you need the right state of mind. \u201cShooting [a classic bow] isn\u2019t about strength; you have to be extremely focused,\u201d said Ms. Shockey. \u201cI love the challenge of it.\u201dYou can find these bows in two basic shapes: a parenthesis-shaped \u201clongbow\u201d (with a single curve) and a \u201crecurve\u201d bow, a more elaborate shape with ends that curl away from the archer. One relatively modern advance: models that can be broken down into three parts for easier transport. Known as \u201ctake-down-styles,\u201d these require careful craftsmanship to ensure the parts align perfectly when bolted back together.Even within the traditional category, there are material innovations, too. Bow makers, known as bowyers, layer the wood with fiberglass, resin and occasionally some carbon (similar to what\u2019s done in ski construction). As well as making the bow more resilient, this facilitates a faster snap, more consistency and better accuracy. These beefed-up traditional models\u2014while not as powerful as compound bows\u2014can still send arrows sailing at about 120 to 150 mph.\u201cIt\u2019s just a pure sport with alluring simplicity,\u201d said Jim Willems, a traditional-bow fan for over 30 years and the president of the Pope and Young Club, a bowhunting and conservation nonprofit. \u201cThe flight of the arrow is still an art.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/archery-the-ultimate-antidote-to-information-overload-1499432401", "news_title": "Archery: The Ultimate Antidote to Information Overload", "keywords": "archery,arrow,bow,bowhunting,hunting,recreation,sports,routine general news,reviews"}, {"content": "Cirque du Soleil Canada Inc. said Thursday it has acquired the experimental-theater company Blue Man Group, as the Montreal-based organization continues to expand its range of entertainment offerings beyond highflying aerial stunts.Cirque du Soleil\u2019s purchase of the Blue Man Group adds six resident productions in the U.S. and Germany, as well as two touring productions.

Such statements have to be endorsed by all 15 member states of the Security Council.The Russian U.N. mission statement said the Moscow delegation \u201ccannot agree with the designation of the launch in question as a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.\u201dRussia said in its statement that it had asked the U.S. mission to adjust the text of the proposed Council statement so it wouldn\u2019t characterize the missile as an ICBM. U.S. diplomats said that was a non-starter.\u201cWe\u2019ve run into obstacle. We are pressing to not get this killed,\u201d said a Security Council diplomat who supports taking action against North Korea.Security Council diplomats said the U.S. was still negotiating with the Russians and asking the Chinese to intervene and bring Russia on board. The U.S. has pursued a dual-track strategy at the Council: first, issue a press statement and, then, negotiate and put to vote a resolution tightening and expanding sanctions on North Korea.But in the absence of even a statement, diplomats said, it was difficult to gauge prospects for a resolution. Diplomats said meetings in Hamburg at the summit of leaders from Group of 20 leading nations would be crucial to the outcome of a potential U.N. resolution.President       Donald Trump       is scheduled to meet Russia\u2019s President       Vladimir Putin       on Friday, and North Korea is expected to be on the agenda. Mr. Trump said in a speech in Poland that he is planning unspecified \u201csevere\u201d action against North Korea.Russia\u2019s strategy of questioning Council findings as a way to block action is a familiar tactic. In August 2016, Russia questioned the findings of a U.N. report that blamed Syria\u2019s government for two chlorine gas attacks.During Wednesday\u2019s emergency Security Council meeting about North Korea, Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador       Vladimir Safronkov       told the Council \u201cthe situation requires thorough clarification and investigation,\u201d and that the parameters and data from his government were in line with the \u201ctactical criteria of a midrange ballistic missile.\u201dU.S. ambassador       Nikki Haley       replied then that she would be happy to provide Russia with intelligence information \u201cto let you know that the rest of the world sees this as an ICBM.\u201dWrite to Farnaz Fassihi at farnaz.fassihi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 18:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-at-u-n-disputes-findings-that-north-korea-launched-an-icbm-1499378504", "news_title": "Russia, at U.N., Disputes Findings That North Korea Launched an ICBM", "keywords": "icbm,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons, russia, united nations, un security council,United Nations,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day drop since May as U.S. stocks fell broadly Thursday.The losses hit all 11 sectors of the S&P 500, ending a three-day winning streak for the index and putting it on course to decline in the first week of July.Some investors and analysts have said the 2017 stock rally could stall in the second half of the year, especially if borrowing costs rise but economic growth is mediocre.In recent weeks, government bond yields have climbed as central banks have signaled the end of monetary stimulus is coming.\u201cThere is a near-unanimous view coming out of central banks for an unwinding of this unconventional policy, either through interest rate rises or pulling back on quantitative easing, or in the United States, selling down some of the central bank holdings,\u201d said       Paul Flood,        multiasset portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management.\u201cPeople have finally woken up to the fact there\u2019s not a backstop, a forced buyer in the marketplace anymore,\u201d he said.The S&P 500 fell 22.79 points, or 0.9%, to 2409.75\u2014its biggest loss since May 17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 158.13 points, or 0.7%, to 21320.04 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 61.39 points, or 1%, to 6089.46, pressured by declines in technology and biotech shares.Both indexes notched their biggest declines in a week, and it was the Nasdaq\u2019s sixth decline in eight sessions.Energy stocks, the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 in 2017, fell 1.8%, with             Newfield Exploration, Apache                   and             Noble Energy                   among the biggest decliners.The moves came even as oil prices rebounded from Wednesday\u2019s slump.

U.S. intelligence and security agencies pinned the blame exclusively on Russia.Mr. Trump\u2019s critique of the U.S. intelligence community came the day before his high-profile meeting with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       at the G-20 summit in Germany. Mr. Putin has denied interference in the campaign but has said patriotic Russian hackers could have acted on their own without state direction.Mr. Trump\u2019s chastisement of his country\u2019s own intelligence capabilities in front of a foreign audience marked a rare action for a U.S. president heading into a high-profile international summit. It is the latest point of tension between Mr. Trump and the U.S. intelligence community, whose behavior he likened to that of the Nazis in a tweet ahead of his inauguration.\u201cThe president\u2019s comments today, again casting doubt on whether Russia was behind the blatant interference in our election and suggesting\u2014his own intelligence agencies to the contrary\u2014that nobody really knows, continue to directly undermine U.S. interests,\u201d said Rep.       Adam Schiff       (D.,Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThis is not putting America first, but continuing to propagate his own personal fiction at the country\u2019s expense.\u201dMieke Eoyang,        vice president for the national security program at the Third Way think tank, and a former Democratic staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Trump has carried to the presidency a hostility toward the intelligence community he showed on the campaign trail.\u201cI don\u2019t think he realizes that now that he\u2019s president, it\u2019s his intelligence community,\u201d Ms. Eoyang said. \u201cContinuing to denigrate them and throw doubt on the assessments that they are making also undermines his own foreign policy when he\u2019s doing things based on their assessments.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The president\u2019s comments came at a news conference here Thursday morning, when he was asked if he accepts the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s verdict that Russia interfered in the U.S. election in a bid to help his candidacy and defeat Democratic rival       Hillary Clinton.\u201cI think it was Russia, and I think it could have been other people and other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump responded. \u201cA lot of people interfered. I think it\u2019s been happening for a long time.\u201dThe meeting with Mr. Putin will take place against a backdrop of intensifying federal investigations into Russian meddling. Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       is probing whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russian operatives to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects and damage Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia.Mr. Trump also said the U.S. intelligence community has made mistakes in the past and that its judgment is open to question. He mentioned the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, when intelligence assessments saying Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction turned out to be inaccurate.\u201cI remember listening about Iraq,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He added, speaking of Russian election interference: \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s public questioning of the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s accuracy could come back to haunt him when he needs to make a case for a policy shift or military action on the basis of such intelligence, said       Gary J. Schmitt,        resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Senate Intelligence Committee staff director.For example, Mr. Trump said Thursday he was considering \u201csevere things\u201d in response to North Korea\u2019s test launch this week of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Schmitt said any such actions, from military intervention to new sanctions, would likely be based on U.S. intelligence assessments. The president also may need to persuade allies to contribute to foreign policy initiatives on the basis of U.S. intelligence assessments, Mr. Schmitt said.\u201cHe\u2019s going down a road that\u2019s not going to be helpful to him as president in the future,\u201d Mr. Schmitt said.Members of Congress from both parties have called on Mr. Trump to confront Mr. Putin about what intelligence officials say is conclusive proof that Russia hacked Democratic computer systems and leaked emails from them in a bid to influence the election.The White House hasn\u2019t said whether Mr. Trump will raise the issue.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus  and Byron Tau  contributed to this article.The president didn\u2019t raise the matter in his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       at the White House in May, according to Mr. Lavrov.At Thursday\u2019s news conference, Mr. Trump also took a swipe at his predecessor,       Barack Obama.       Mr. Trump said the former president took no action on Russia\u2019s activity in the election because of the mistaken belief that Mrs. Clinton would win anyway.In October 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies issued a joint statement directly accusing the Russian government of trying to interfere in the election by leaking emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and other entities. The Obama White House at the time vowed to hit Russia with a \u201cproportional\u201d response.Former Homeland Security Secretary       Jeh Johnson      said in testimony before a House panel last month that the administration initially sought to avoid making announcements about Russian meddling efforts so not to give the appearance it was taking sides in the election.When the administration did publicly address the efforts in October, Mr. Johnson said the news was pushed \u201cbelow the fold\u201d by another story that day: the release of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes that revealed Mr. Trump making lewd comments in 2005.Despite his comments at the news conference, in his speech later Thursday at a Warsaw square Mr. Trump urged Russia to change course on its foreign policy.\u201cWe urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, and its support for hostile regimes, including Syria and Iran, and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and defense of civilization itself,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump praised Poland for spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense and again urged other European allies to spend more. Unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s speech in Brussels in May, however, he also stated his commitment to the mutual defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\u201cTo those who criticize our tough stance, I would point that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But, he added, \u201cEurope must do more.\u201dWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com, Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Knocks U.S. Intelligence.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 17:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-russia-interfered-in-election-but-may-not-have-acted-alone-1499358195", "news_title": "Trump Says Russia Interfered in Election, But May Not Have Acted Alone ", "keywords": "2016 election,democratic party,democrats,election hacking,hillary clinon,presidential campaign,putin,russia,russian hacking,trump,Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,presidential elections"}, {"content": "CLEVELAND\u2014Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President       Loretta Mester       said in an interview\u00a0Thursday\u00a0she supports implementing \u201csooner rather than later\u201d the Fed\u2019s plan to slowly shrink its $4.5 trillion portfolio of assets and other holdings this year.Minutes of the Fed\u2019s June meeting released\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0and comments from Fed officials have indicated a strong chance the central bank will announce the start of the process at its September meeting.Ms. Mester said it would be \u201ctotally appropriate\u201d for the central bank to initiate the plan this year but didn\u2019t specify exactly when that should occur. \u201cThe change in the reinvestments policy\u2026can be done sooner rather than later,\u201d she said.\u201cGet it going, and then we\u2019ll focus on our funds rate as being the main policy tool,\u201d she said, referring to the Fed\u2019s benchmark short-term interest rate, the federal-funds rate.Ms. Mester isn\u2019t a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which last month raised the rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25%. The increase was the third such move since mid-December, and projections released after the Fed\u2019s policy meeting showed officials have penciled in one more quarter-point rate increase this year.Some officials have said the Fed should consider pausing interest-rate increases when it implements the balance-sheet reduction plan to study the market\u2019s reaction. Others have said the Fed should hold off on rate increases until they see more evidence that a recent slowdown in inflation is transitory, though these officials have said the inflation weakness need not delay the start of the portfolio wind-down.Ms. Mester said it is still possible the Fed could raise rates and launch the balance-sheet plan at the same meeting, though she said officials could \u201cvery well\u201d conclude that they want to gather more data before raising rates. In that scenario, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason not to start\u201d reducing the portfolio by curtailing the pace of bond reinvestments. \u201cIt\u2019s in the background. We could just start it,\u201d she said.Fed officials meet next on\u00a0July 25-26.Markets have questioned the Fed\u2019s rate plans because of a recent slowdown in inflation, keeping it below the central bank\u2019s 2% target since touching that level briefly earlier this year. The meeting minutes published\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0show officials debated the degree to which continued declines in the unemployment rate, which could force firms to raise wages to compete more aggressively for workers, would ultimately lead price pressures to firm up.Several Fed officials, including Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       and Ms. Mester, have said the inflation declines reflect transitory factors, such as idiosyncratic declines from wireless phone plans and prescription drugs.Ms. Mester said she expects inflation to resume an upward climb toward the central bank\u2019s 2% target, but that a string of three relatively weak reports meant the data to come should be studied closely. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my outlook yet, but certainly when you see a couple of weak reports, you\u2019ve got to look at it seriously,\u201d she said.Other Fed officials have said the central bank should consider a slower pace of rate increases until the data show a pickup in inflation.\u201cI sometimes wonder if there isn\u2019t something more global, more technological that\u2019s taking place that we don\u2019t quite have our arms around very well,\u201d said Chicago Fed President       Charles Evans       in an interview last month. Mr. Evans, an FOMC voter this year, said he would prefer to hold off on raising rates until the end of the year to make sure the Fed wasn\u2019t falling further behind on its inflation goal.The Fed bought more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities during and after the financial crisis to stimulate the economy by holding down long-term rates. Allowing the balance sheet to decline could cause long-term rates to rise.The Fed stopped adding to its balance sheet in late 2014, but the central bank has been reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets to keep the holdings steady.Under the plan to reduce the portfolio, the Fed would set guardrails to allow a preset amount of holdings to mature every month without reinvestment. The guardrails would initially be set at a relatively low level\u2014$10 billion a month\u2014and they would increase every quarter by $10 billion up to a maximum of $50 billion.Officials have said they want the plan to run quietly in the background once it starts. Ms. Mester said she didn\u2019t expect a long-lasting market reaction to the start of the wind-down because officials have gone to great lengths to communicate the move isn\u2019t part of a broader shift in Fed policy.\u201cThe intention is well understood. We\u2019re not trying to change everyone\u2019s expectation about policy,\u201d she said.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 17:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mester-says-fed-should-start-portfolio-runoff-sooner-rather-than-later-1499378037", "news_title": "Mester Says Fed Should Start Portfolio Runoff \u2018Sooner Rather Than Later\u2019", "keywords": "cleveland fed,cleveland fed president,fed,fed balance sheet,fed mester,fed portfolio,fed rates,fomc,inlfation,mester,mester cleveland,mester interview,The Fed,Loretta Mester,Janet Yellen,Charles Evans,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "\u201cYOU\u2019RE LATE,\u201d said       David Lillie       to me when I arrived at his store, Chambers Street Wines in Manhattan, at half past ten in the morning a few weeks ago. (The store opens at 10 a.m.) \u201cYou missed an elegant ballet of inventory,\u201d he added, referring to the cases of wine his staff had to carry into the store when the conveyor belt in the basement broke. That\u2019s how they talk at Chambers Street Wines; the staff slips in terms like \u201cschist\u201d and \u201cwhip-crack acidity\u201d when speaking with customers who know what they mean. A cardinal staff rule: Never pretend to know more than you do, because the customer is likely to know even more.I\u2019d opted to spend some time in a wine shop as I\u2019d been thinking a lot about the retail wine world and the fact that there is practically a story a day about the perilous state of the retail today. How does a Manhattan brick-and-mortar wine shop compete with its local peers, let alone the rest of the world?The owners of Chambers Street Wines have crafted a highly successful sales formula: Buy mostly from small producers with whom they have personal relationships and who practice natural, biodynamic or organic winemaking; hire passionate, knowledgeable salespeople; sell to both local and national customers via their informative, constantly updated website; and, of course, provide attentive service and regular (free) in-store wine tastings.Though the store carries wines and spirits from all over the world, it is particularly strong in wines from France, especially the Loire Valley. It also sells a great deal of aged Barolo sourced from private cellars in Italy. And there are lots of interesting wines for $15 and under that can\u2019t be easily found elsewhere. Most of the 1,900 or so bottles in the 950-square-foot space have been sourced from producers personally known to the staff.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can successfully open a wine shop today without a point of view,\u201d said Mr. Lillie as we repaired to the tiny back-office space that he shares with several other staffers, including his business partner,       Jamie Wolff.       Mr. Lillie had extensive retail experience when they opened the store; Mr. Wolff was an alumnus of the wine division of Christie\u2019s auction house. The two men met in 2000 and opened their store in 2001.Mr. Lillie worked as a buyer and manager at Garnet Wines & Liquors on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side for 15 years when it was one of the leading retailers in New York. The store\u2019s monthly full-page newspaper ads attracted masses of customers. \u201cThese days no one does conventional advertising,\u201d he observed.Instead, many retailers rely on sales tools such as offers sent via email. Staff members email out several offers each week. One of Mr. Lillie\u2019s tasks the morning I visited was to send an email offering of ros\u00e9s to the 14,000 or so customers on his list\u2014illustrated with a photograph of his Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Gwenny, walking on the beach, to convey a summery mood.Mr. Lillie\u2019s emails abound with details about featured regions, wineries and makers, related from a personal perspective. The average offer accounts for 5-15% of the day\u2019s sales, according to Mr. Lillie\u2014though a recent one featuring old, rare wines from Italy\u2019s Piedmont accounted for 80% of that day\u2019s sales.The profit margins in a retail business are not large, said Mr. Lillie. The standard retail markup on a bottle is about 30%. And yet, though they weathered a few unprofitable years thanks to 9/11 and the market crash in 2008, Mr. Lillie estimates their profit margin today is 4-8% and further noted that he and Mr. Wolff draw small salaries and put the rest back into the business.The key sales tool today is wine-searcher.com, the most commonly used database and search engine for wine lovers and merchants alike. Retailers pay large sums to have their store inventories included in its matrix. At one point Messrs. Lillie and Wolff were so perturbed by the high cost\u2014they are paying $6,500 for the service this year alone\u2014they took their store off the site. But they went back a few months later, after they decided it was \u201can important source of new referrals,\u201d said Mr. Lillie.The store is usually quiet in the morning, but the back office is busy with the sales action taking place online. Mr. Wolff, who came in shortly after I did, joked that he spends most of his time on his computer. \u201cWhat did I do before email?\u201d he asked rhetorically. Some of the bottles surrounding his computer were from private cellars that Mr. Wolff has purchased, while others were new arrivals yet to be shelved.The greatest challenge facing Chambers Street Wines: an extreme shortage of space (a perennial New York problem). Unpacked boxes are forever stacking up, said stock manager       David Schwartzberg.Although the website attracts customers from all over the world, the store\u2019s physical location\u2014close to several subway lines that converge at Chambers Street in the Tribeca neighborhood\u2014is key to its success, as is the ongoing development of the surrounding area. \u201cChambers Street has become a high-density neighborhood,\u201d said Mr. Lillie.More customers began drifting into the store around 4 p.m., and by 6 p.m. there was a bit of a din as customers and staff members mingled and talked. I overheard one of the store\u2019s more voluble salespeople, John McIlwain\u2014also a French wine buyer; nearly all sales staff also hold wine-buying jobs\u2014explaining the difference between two Muscadets to a Muscadet fan: \u201cThis one is more granite, while this one has more broadness to the palate and some shoulders.\u201d Meanwhile,       Ariana Rolich,        the store\u2019s Spanish-wine buyer, chatted with       Roger Valls,        who is in charge of sales for wineries in Priorat and Montsant. Mr. Valls lingered for nearly an hour.Ms. Rolich knows the preferences of her clients by heart. \u201cAn important part of learning someone\u2019s taste is learning their vocabulary,\u201d she said. For example, she had a customer whose \u201cprofoundly balanced palate\u201d required wines that \u201cwere bright-fruited but not full-fruited.\u201d (Translation: lots of acidity and not much oak.)\u2018\u2018The store is like a family, and it has a beautiful feeling of being part of something.\u2019\u2019Steve Edmunds       of Edmunds St. John winery in California was the featured winemaker pouring his wines the evening I was there. The genial Mr. Edmunds is a staff favorite, and his wines fit the Chambers Street profile: minimal intervention, pure and expressive. Would-be tasters queued up, including a man in L.L. Bean boat shoes who asked Mr. Edmunds if he was \u201cone of those biodynamic producers.\u201d As if in warning, the questioner added, \u201cI like conventional wine.\u201d Mr. Edmunds smiled. \u201cWe use a little sulfur in the winery,\u201d he said. \u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d the man said, and after tasting Mr. Edmunds\u2019 reds, he walked away with a couple bottles.Staff and customers crowded around, tasting and talking wine. I thought about what one of the store\u2019s newest employees,       Caroline Coursant,        had said to me earlier. The Paris-born former attorney left a lucrative career to work at Chambers Street Wines about eight months ago. \u201cThe store is like a family, and it has a beautiful feeling of being part of something,\u201d she said.More than a great wine selection or fair pricing or an optimal location or even a subscription to wine-searcher.com, imparting this feeling is perhaps the best sales tool of all.Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 17:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-sells-wine-today-how-one-manhattan-retailer-is-thriving-1499377311", "news_title": "What Sells Wine Today: How One Manhattan Retailer is Thriving", "keywords": "best wine store,how to buy wine,manhattan wine store,new york wine store,wine buying,wine economy,wine retail,David Lillie,Jamie Wolff,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,reviews,retail,wholesale"}, {"content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Sales at             Wal-Mart de Mexico SA        WMMVY -1.01%      B, Mexico\u2019s biggest retailer, rose in June from the previous month, with contributions from same-store gains in both Mexico and Central America, the company said Thursday.Walmex, as the unit of Bentonville, Arkansas-based             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       is also known, said sales in June rose 8% from a year earlier, to 43.4 billion Mexican pesos ($2.4 billion).

(They were, it seems, distantly related.)But to paraphrase Polonius (\u201cHamlet,\u201d Act 2, Scene ii) there is method to all this madness. There\u2019s even a makeshift defense of the playwright against the class-rooted Oxfordian argument, which says Shakespeare couldn\u2019t possibly have written the sophisticated plays for which he\u2019s credited because he was, well, a bumpkin.

Ewen Bremner       is deliciously, excessively vile as a sadist in service to the queen and, worse, a true believer. But the whole cast is, verily, first-rate and clever. \u201cLive fast, die young and leave a pox-ridden corpse,\u201d announces the peacocky       Richard Burbage       (      Mattias Inwood      ), who with his pal the playwright will eventually enjoy one of the most successful actor-author relationships in the history of theater. The quip above does not make it into any plays\u2014like the show\u2019s soundtrack, it is a decidedly 20th-century construction. But that\u2019s one of the clever things about \u201cWill\u201d: Not every familiar-seeming statement is destined for a Shakespeare play.

Bond yields also climbed in the U.K., Denmark, Sweden, Canada and the U.S. Yields rise as bond prices fall.The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.369%, compared with 2.334% Wednesday. That marked the yield\u2019s highest closing level since May 11.\u201cSentiment for bonds has gone from the rooftop to the basement,\u2019\u2019 said Jim Vogel, market strategist at FTN Financial.A key factor driving the selling has been investors\u2019 concerns over possible shifts in monetary policy throughout the developed world, triggered by hawkish signals from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada last week.Some of Thursday\u2019s moves came after the release of minutes from the ECB\u2019s recent policy meeting. Those showed ECB officials in June discussed how to signal their increasing confidence in the eurozone economy and considered dropping a pledge to accelerate their massive bond-buying program. That came after the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes Wednesday afternoon suggested U.S. policy makers may start paring back the central bank\u2019s large bondholdings in coming months.Fresh new debt sales from Spain, France and the U.K. added to the selling pressure, traders said.Bond buying and other stimulus from the ECB and the Bank of Japan have helped push global government bond yields to historically low levels over the past years. Analysts have warned that the value of government bonds, propped up by these big buyers, would drop once central banks reduce support.The selloff, which has persisted in the U.S. for six of the past seven sessions, shattered months of relative calm in bond markets. The 10-year Treasury yield had fallen to 2.135% on June 26, the lowest closing level this year. Since then, the yield has risen more than 0.2 percentage point.The yield on the 10-year German bund has more than doubled since June 26 and traded at 0.569% Thursday afternoon, the highest close since January 2016, according to Tradeweb.Some investors said higher bond yields reflect optimism toward the economic outlook. Recent data have pointed to broad improvement in the global economy, which supports the case for major central banks to become less generous in providing monetary stimulus. A monthly gauge of the U.S. service sector Thursday continued to point to solid expansion.Investors also are looking to Friday\u2019s jobs report for signals on the Fed\u2019s timing for possible future interest-rate increases. Some analysts said a strong report could spark further selling.Bond yields remain at very low levels from a historical standpoint. The 10-year Treasury yield is still below 2.446%, where it settled at the end of last year. And previous selloffs in recent years have proved short-lived. Now debate is growing among investors about whether the current bout may soon fade or gain more momentum.In May 2013, then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank could start cutting bond buying in coming months, which caught some investors off guard, sending the 10-year Treasury yield soaring and causing a record pace of outflows from bond funds.\u201cThe bond market has priced for very low yields for a long period of time driven by monetary stimulus, which makes it vulnerable when sentiment shifts,\u2019\u2019 said       Nigel Jenkins,        senior portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel in London.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 17:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-bonds-sell-off-deepening-losses-1499352282", "news_title": "Global Bonds Sell Off, Deepening Losses", "keywords": "bank of england,bond interest,bonds,bond yields,central banks,ecb,global bonds,global economy,treasurys,u.s. bonds,German government,Larry Milstein,monetary policy,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "His Restaurant: Miller Union in Atlanta, Ga.What He Is Known For: A deep affinity for vegetable cookery, from root to stem.

Chemical residue from the floodwaters remains in the tunnel walls and railroad bed eating away at steel and track as well as mechanical and electrical systems.About 500 trains a day pass through the tunnel, which Mr. Porcari described as a \u201csingle point of failure for 10%\u201d of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.If one of the current tubes must be shut down before the new tunnel is built, it will reduce rail capacity into Penn Station by 75%, creating travel disruption across the region.The draft report says the new tunnel could be completed by 2026 and the existing tunnel refurbished by 2030.Mr. Porcari took pains to emphasize the \u201cextraordinary\u201d level of federal cooperation on the tunnel work so far.Last week, the U.S. Transportation Department withdrew from the development corporation board citing potential conflicts of interest because the program relies upon federal grants.Under an agreement brokered several years ago, the federal government committed to funding half of Gateway with New York and New Jersey making up the rest of the cost of the program.The revised price tag for the work on the tunnels would increase the estimated total program cost to $29.1 billion from $23.9 billion.Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Cost Estimate Soars For Hudson Tunnel.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 17:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tunnel-portion-of-gateway-project-estimated-at-12-9-billion-1499375187", "news_title": "Tunnel Portion of Gateway Project Estimated at $12.9 Billion ", "keywords": "gateway program,hudson river rail tunnel,hudson river tunnel,nj transit,penn station,heavy construction,tunnel construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "HAMBURG, Germany\u2014The U.S. president has accused her of ruining Germany. The Turkish president says she harbors terrorists. The Russian president, her spy agencies warn, may be about to interfere in her re-election campaign. In the coming days, German Chancellor       Angela Merkel      meets all three of themIn Hamburg, her birthplace, the 62-year-old pastor\u2019s daughter hosts the Group of 20 summit thrust into a role no German chancellor has had to navigate in the postwar era. The leader of a country that generally disdains international confrontation is now the foil to three of the world\u2019s most polarizing heads of state. Three countries that Germany had prized as partners have, in different ways and to varying degrees, become antagonists.\u201cThe world is turbulent,\u201d Ms. Merkel said in a speech to parliament last week. \u201cIt has become less united.\u201dGermany, with its export-oriented businesses and its bloody past, long shied away from global power struggles or military engagements and instead sought to build deep ties with a variety of states. Like no other country, German officials often say, Europe\u2019s largest economy relies on a harmonious, rules-based world order.But at the two-day gathering in Hamburg, which officially begins Friday, global disunity that has been years in the making will become personified. Ms. Merkel will be in the middle of it, and her patient, deliberate style of diplomacy will be put to the test.U.S. President Donald Trump, whom she met Thursday evening, castigated Ms. Merkel for her refugee policy during the election campaign. He is threatening to slap tariffs on German steel exports and has undermined one of Ms. Merkel\u2019s top priorities by exiting the Paris climate accord. After the meeting, a spokesman for her said the two had spent an hour discussing G-20 issues and foreign crises.Then she sat down with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said this week that \u201cGermany is committing suicide\u201d by not allowing him to deliver a speech to his countrymen on the sidelines of the summit. Later on, she will join French President Emmanuel Macron to face Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose annexation of Crimea three years ago now looks like the opening act in Europe\u2019s era of geopolitical instability.German lawmaker Cem \u00d6zdemir of the opposition Greens, recently referred to Messrs. Trump, Putin, and Erdogan as \u201cthe new authoritarian axis of testosterone.\u201d But Ms. Merkel plays down the personal contrasts.\u201cEven if likability perhaps doesn\u2019t come on a silver platter, I have the responsibility to take care of things and to try to understand the person, the partner, across from me,\u201d the chancellor       \ufeff      said in an interview with women\u2019s magazine Brigitte last week.In dealing with difficult counterparts, people who have worked with her say, Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist, can be relentless in presenting her demands and the facts to back up her point of view. She is also willing to listen through sometimes angry monologues and to seek compromise to inch toward a solution, they say. The approach means that even adversarial leaders are willing to engage with her, analysts say, though it opens her up to criticism for being soft.\u201cShe knows exactly what she wants, but because of her relatively quiet and mediating manner, it doesn\u2019t come across as very threatening,\u201d said Claudia Major at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. \u201cMuch of Germany\u2019s increased power, or responsibility, in recent years was extremely well framed by Merkel\u2019s calm and measured demeanor.\u201dThat was her approach as she led the West\u2019s response to the Ukraine crisis, holding dozens of phone calls and meetings with Mr. Putin in which she repeatedly confronted him with evidence of Russian intervention in Ukraine while taking in his frustration over an alleged Western plot against Russia. Her government is now girding for possible Russian interference ahead of the Sept. 24 national election, and German intelligence officials say that the same suspected Russian hackers who stole Democrats\u2019 emails in the U.S. campaign broke into the German parliament\u2019s network in 2015.\u201cI don\u2019t count myself as a fearful person,\u201d Ms. Merkel said when asked about Russian hacking at a news conference alongside Mr. Putin in May.Amid growing tensions with Mr. Erdogan, Ms. Merkel is also banking on repetition\u2014stating over and over, for instance, that an imprisoned Turkish-German journalist, Deniz Y\u00fccel, needs to be set free because Turkey\u2019s terror charges against him are without merit.\u201cThe fact that Ms. Merkel placed the saving of a terror suspect on the agenda was something I found very, very peculiar,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper in an interview published this week.With Mr. Trump, she tried to lay out facts to convince him of the merits of open markets when the two met in March, bringing German CEOs to the White House to underline her country\u2019s investment in the U.S. But she has sounded increasingly disappointed with the U.S. president\u2019s moves. In the Brigitte interview, she cited an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by two Trump aides as evidence that Mr. Trump sees globalization as a zero-sum gain, not a \u201cwin-win\u201d opportunity.\u201cPresident Trump was certainly elected by many who are skeptical of globalization, and he feels he has a duty to those voters,\u201d she told Die Zeit. Asked whether she could have imagined a year ago a G-20 meeting with Messrs. Putin, Trump, and Erdogan, she responded: \u201cWe have to accept these constellations as they are.\u201dWrite to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Diplomatic Tests for Merkel.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-merkel-manage-the-axis-of-testosterone-as-trump-putin-and-erdogan-descend-on-germany-1499337093", "news_title": "Merkel\u2019s Patient Diplomacy Is Tested by Trump and Putin\u2019s \u2018Axis of Testosterone\u2019", "keywords": " erdogan, foreign policy,g20, geopolitics, german politics, international relations, merkel,putin, trump,Angela Merkel,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,cybercrime,hacking,politics,domestic politics,risk news,military action,elections,presidential elections"}, {"content": "The dollar slid Thursday while the euro rallied as investors continue to assess the outlook for tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, slipped 0.2% to 88.17.

Aecom will take on the 27-year-old firm\u2019s $1.35 billion project backlog, including a large project to replace a highway bridge near the Port of Long Beach.The Trump administration has proposed spending $200 billion over 10 years on infrastructure programs, with a goal of spurring a total of $1 trillion in financing with the inclusion of private investment.

As officers ordered people to uncover their faces, some of the protesters responded aggressively with bottles, sticks, and metal rods, according a statement from the Hamburg police. Officers responded with water cannons, pepper spray, and batons, the police said.As twilight fell on the port city, violent protesters had dispersed across town and were attacking officers and setting objects on fire, according to the police. One person was arrested and seven officers injured, the police said.\u201cAt the moment things are happening everywhere\u2014there is no demonstration anymore people are everywhere by now,\u201d said one police officer walking a colleague injured by pepper spray to an ambulance.German politicians have voiced concern for months that violence could accompany the Group of 20 summit, which officially starts here on Friday. The annual meeting of world leaders typically draws anti-globalization protests, but this year tensions are particularly high\u2014with Mr. Trump, Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan,        and Russian President       Vladimir Putin       all provoking discontent. In addition, the meeting is taking place in the middle of a northern German metropolis that has long been a hot spot for anarchists.In what officials have been described as the city\u2019s largest police action in history, some 20,000 officers are on the ground to provide security for the 36 summit delegations and roughly 6,500 participants. Security officials said they expected 8,000 potentially violent, left-wing extremists to travel to Hamburg.In all, as many as 100,000 protesters from Germany and Europe are expected to take to the streets to vent their anger at a range of topics, including political leaders, globalization and the governments of China, India, Turkey among other nations.\u201cWe demonstrate because we reject this capitalistic system and don\u2019t want rich countries to decide about the future of the world,\u201d said 38-year-old J\u00f6rn Meier, who traveled from Berlin to protest.Benedikt Mietner, 30, who planned to demonstrate on Friday, said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that they are meeting, but if they really want to talk about helping people make their lives better then they shouldn\u2019t talk about helping a few people get richer.\u201dAround 16 political rallies against the G-20 have been planned, including protests against the U.S. intentions to build a wall to Mexico and anticapitalism rallies.Tensions flared up ahead of the summit, particularly after a regional court and police banned a tent city to house demonstrators, fearing it could host potential violent protesters.The first clashes took place Tuesday night, when police cleared a campsite of protesters. Three people were arrested Wednesday and four detained. But some small rallies, including an anti-G-20 rave and a \u201cWomen\u2019s March Against Trump\u201d ended largely peacefully on Wednesday.Officials in Hamburg and in the German government have said they welcomed peaceful protesters but would crack down on violent activists.\u201cThose becoming violent mock democracy,\u201d said German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       in an interview this week with the Die Zeit newspaper.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/demonstrators-clash-with-police-ahead-of-german-summit-1499373183", "news_title": "Demonstrators Clash With Police Ahead of German Summit ", "keywords": "g-20, g-20 summit, geopolitics, german demonstration, group of 20, hamburg protests, summit protests,German government,Group of 20,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,risk news"}, {"content": "The economy\u2019s fine, inflation\u2019s nowhere to be seen, deflation risk has abated, interest rates are low and fears over European politics\u2014Britain aside\u2014have so far proved unfounded. It\u2019s easy both to explain why markets have been celebrating, and why so many people are worried that everything\u2019s just too perfect.The state of the economy easily explains high stock prices, low volatility and low bond yields. We\u2019re in what\u2019s increasingly being called a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy, which like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge is not too hot and not too cold. Things have changed a lot since the term was coined in the early 1990s, as back then growth was a lot higher and acceptable inflation was about double the current level. But the principle is the same, with global growth reasonable and little sign of inflation that might push central banks into a sudden market-squeezing monetary tightening.Explanation is not the same as justification. The fact that everything\u2019s been awesome recently is little guide to the future of the economy or inflation\u2014and the rise in stocks makes it less likely the general awesomeness will continue.The market adage has it that markets climb a wall of worry and slide down a slope of hope. Worry has all but disappeared this year. As       Simon Smiles,        chief investment officer for ultrahigh-net-worth clients at UBS Wealth Management, says, if the only thing to worry about is North Korea, there really isn\u2019t anything serious to worry about: \u201cHow does it get better than this?\u201dOf course, everything might continue to be wonderful. The geopolitics of Korea, Qatar and the South China Sea aside, it\u2019s hard to see anything especially threatening on the horizon. The trouble is that it\u2019s almost by definition the unexpected events that hit markets, and the calm has left investors less prepared for bad news than usual. As investors step further outside their comfort zone in the pursuit of gains, their resilience to bad news is reduced. The frothier the market, the less bad an unexpected event has to be to shake confidence.A reasonable push back against this view is that there are few signs of irrational exuberance. This isn\u2019t March 2000, or even October 1987.       Robert Buckland,        a strategist at             Citigroup,       says only two of his 18 bear-market warning signs\u2014U.S. corporate indebtedness and global price/earnings ratios\u2014are flashing, which he says means investors should buy any dips.It feels as though a lot of investors are waiting for dips to buy back in to the market, one reason that volatility has been so low. Anyone who waited this year has missed out on gains of 7.6% in the S&P 500 through Wednesday and 16.4% in eurozone stocks in dollar terms, painful for those who held back.A look at the past can tell us a bit about dips. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t had a 5% dip since the post-Brexit vote drop, only the third time since the mid-1960s it has managed more than a year without such a pullback. The gaps between 10% corrections have sometimes been a lot longer; seven years in the 1990s and four years in the \u201cgreat moderation\u201d of the 2000s, compared with less than 18 months since the last such drop. But the real pain comes with a 20% drop, the usual definition of a bear market.Investors like to believe that bear markets only come with recessions, and so reassure themselves that there\u2019s no sign a recession is imminent, repeating the mantra that \u201ceconomic cycles don\u2019t die of old age.\u201d Unfortunately, this is both wrong and useless. First, 20% drops sometimes happen outside recessions, as in 1987 and 1966. Second, economic cycles can be killed by a financial crash, and as the late economist       Hyman Minsky       pointed out, the longer a financial cycle goes on, the more likely it is to turn to excess and end badly. Worse, there\u2019s no reliable method of forecasting a recession, so even if it were true that only a recession could end the bull market, that isn\u2019t a lot of use to investors.There\u2019s no way to be sure when the next dip will come. Investing is about probabilities, and the chances of a nasty reaction to a relatively minor surprise are higher than they were\u2014but still not nearly as high as they have been at times of peak complacency in the past. When everything is awesome it\u2019s best to prepare for things to be a little less awesome in the future, even at the cost of missing out on some of the gains if investors get still more complacent from here.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/everything-is-awesome-now-is-the-time-to-sell-1499353548", "news_title": "Everything Is Awesome!

Opana ER is one of many opioid painkillers that became widely prescribed in recent decades amid heavy company marketing and a desire in the medical community to better treat pain. Public-health officials say the prescribing was often lax, and helped spark widespread addiction and abuse of both prescription and illicit forms of opioids, including heroin.The FDA said it was concerned about Opana ER\u2019s safety because data showed a 2012 reformulation of the pill caused more people to abuse the painkiller by liquefying and injecting it, a form of abuse that can heighten the high. Abuse of the drug via injection was linked to a \u201cserious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C,\u201d the FDA said. The outbreak occurred in Indiana in 2015, where addicts shared needles while injecting the drug.\u201cThe agency is strongly committed to taking forceful action to address this public health crisis\u2014as reflected by FDA\u2019s recent moves to request that [Opana ER] be taken off the market,\u201d FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       and the director of the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Janet Woodcock, wrote in an opinion piece published Thursday by JAMA, a journal of the American Medical Association.Drs. Gottlieb and Woodcock said the FDA is boosting its efforts to base its regulatory decisions on \u201cthe reality of how opioids are used\u2014and misused and abused.\u201d They said the FDA has asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to advise the FDA how it can improve its process for weighing the benefits and risks of opioids, including the public-health consequences of inappropriate use.Endo, based in Dublin, Ireland, said it expects to record a pretax charge of $20 million in the second quarter to write off the drug\u2019s remaining net book value. Opana ER had sales of $159 million in 2016.

Then she kept walking.She wove her way through the crowds, past a gift shop, all the way out to Court 18, where she was playing last. Most fans were heading home. Then in the second round on Wednesday, Ostapenko suffered the same indignity again, this time on Court 12. Any further away and she\u2019d have been running around a parking lot.\u201cIt was not amazing to play on those courts, because I won a Grand Slam just a couple weeks ago and I think I deserve to play on a better court,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t like to play when there is no one watching the match\u2026it\u2019s not really fun.\u201dWimbledon, it turns out, doesn\u2019t care what you\u2019ve just won when it comes to scheduling. You\u2019ll play where they tell you to play.What the show-court crowds have been missing, however, is one of the most recklessly entertaining players in the game. The 20-year-old Latvian isn\u2019t merely aggressive. She goes for broke on every shot.How recent first-time Grand Slam winners fared in their next Slam.In the French Open final last month, Ostapenko made a downright irresponsible 54 unforced errors, but compensated by smacking 54 winners. Now, at Wimbledon, she\u2019s sticking to her guns with one significant adjustment: she wants to be even wilder.\u201cI was playing a little bit less risky on clay,\u201d Ostapenko said. \u201cBut here you have to play aggressive because it\u2019s very hard to move on grass.\u201dShe is so erratic, even within a single match, that her last eight matches have all sprawled into third sets. But over that span, she has lost just one match.In her first-round win here, Ostapenko posted 24 winners to 23 unforced errors, while losing her second set 6-1 in the process. Then on Wednesday, she had 39 unforced errors (18 more than her opponent) and 31 winners to rally from one set down.What she lacks in power on her serve, she makes up for in free-swinging groundstrokes that either land in the corners or miss by a mile. On more than one occasion, after walloping a ball straight into the net, she simply turned to her team in the bleachers and shrugged as if to say, \u201cLook, even I don\u2019t know sometimes.\u201dBut Ostapenko is just following the grass-court advice she got before the tournament from her coach\u2014Anabel Medina Garrigues\u2014who happens to be a clay-court expert.\u201cShe told me that on grass mostly the player who is playing more aggressive or trying to play aggressive from the first couple of shots is winning,\u201d Ostapenko said, adding that she felt the grass was even slower these days than it was when she won the Wimbledon juniors in 2014.High-risk as her approach may be, it has helped her ward off the hangover that tends to affect first-time Slam winners in their next major tournament.Of the 10 women before Ostapenko to claim their first career Slams, dating back to 2008, eight failed to reach the third round of the next one on the calendar. Garbine Muguruza, for instance, broke through at Roland Garros last year, only to slip up in the second round of Wimbledon.Two players, Flavia Pennetta and Marion Bartoli, preferred to retire from the sport before playing another one. And four crashed out in the first round.So Ostapenko is already ahead of the curve, just as she was in Paris where she arrived unseeded, having never reached even the fourth round of a Slam. There, she ran through a depleted women\u2019s field that was missing its center of gravity in the absence of the pregnant       Serena Williams.       But this will be the reality of women\u2019s tennis for a while to come: wide open Grand Slam fields and opportunities for first-time winners.\u201cI knew I can make it one day,\u201d Ostapenko said of winning the French. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it [was] going to happen, like, when I was still 19 years old.\u201dLess than four weeks on, she\u2019s noticing some subtle differences. On her Air Baltic flight from Paris back to Latvia, she said she was allowed to fly in the cockpit. In her news conferences, she\u2019s also getting more frivolous questions\u2014a sign of making it in pro tennis. For instance: has she heard from Latvia\u2019s most famous athlete, the NBA\u2019s Kristaps Porzingis, since winning Roland-Garros? (She hasn\u2019t.)And on Thursday evening, Ostapenko found one more change: her third-round match had landed on a Wimbledon show court, No. 2. it isn\u2019t Centre Court, but it\u2019s a whole lot closer than Court 12.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jelena-ostapenko-is-still-going-for-broke-1499372417", "news_title": "Jelena Ostapenko Is Still Going for Broke", "keywords": "french open,jelena ostapenko,ostapenko,tennis,wimbledon,wimbledon grass,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "A coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia announced\u00a0Thursday a lawsuit against the U.S. Education Department and Education Secretary       Betsy DeVos       regarding the end of\u00a0Obama-era rules intended to punish colleges and universities that use deceptive recruiting tactics and charge high prices for dubious degrees.The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the Education Department violated federal law by abruptly rescinding its \u201cBorrower Defense\u201d and \u201cgainful employment\u201d rules, which were designed to hold abusive higher education institutions accountable for cheating students and taxpayers out of billions of dollars in federal loans.U.S. Department of Education press secretary Liz Hill slammed the suit in a statement.\u201cWith this ideologically driven suit, the state attorneys general are saying to regulate first, and ask the legal questions later\u2014which also seems to be the approach of the prior administration that adopted borrower-defense regulations through a heavily politicized process and failed to account for the interests of all stakeholders,\u201d Ms. Hill said.The rules were set to go into effect on July 1 but were frozen by Ms. DeVos in May. She cited a California lawsuit which sought to block them.The rules were completed by the Obama administration late last year after nearly two years of negotiations, following the collapse of Corinthian Colleges Inc., a national for-profit chain. For-profit schools, which generally specialize in two-year degrees and career certificates, taught about a 10th of all undergraduates at their peak but have been a disproportionate driver of the run-up to $1.3 trillion student debt and a sharp rise in defaults.Last month, Ms. DeVos\u00a0said it \u201cwas time for a regulatory reset\u201d because the rules were overly burdensome and would have proved costly to taxpayers. Colleges have argued the rules are so broadly written they would have exposed the schools to frivolous lawsuits and penalties, leading to mass taxpayer forgiveness of student loans even when schools did nothing wrong.\u201cSince day one, Secretary DeVos has sided with\u00a0for-profit school executives\u00a0against students and families drowning in unaffordable student loans,\u201d said Massachusetts Attorney General       Maura Healey,        who spearheaded the coalition. \u201cHer decision to cancel vital protections for students and taxpayers is a betrayal of her office\u2019s responsibility and a violation of federal law. We call on Secretary DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education to restore these rules immediately.\u201dIn addition to Ms. Healey, the attorneys general involved in today\u2019s lawsuit include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia.Write to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'States Sue DeVos Over College Rules.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-district-of-columbia-file-suit-against-u-s-over-college-marketing-rules-1499355258", "news_title": "States, District of Columbia File Suit Against U.S. Over College-Marketing Rules", "keywords": "attorneys general,betsy devos,borrower defense,for-profit colleges,obama administration,obama-era rules,student debt,student loans,trump administration,Corinthian Colleges,COCO,U.S. Education Department,Betsy DeVos,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college,government bodies,education department,executive branch,educational services,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "In the days before he was photographed on Sunday sitting on the sand of an otherwise empty New Jersey beach, Gov. Chris Christie had hoped another state official be blamed for the closure of state government.\u201cThis Facility is CLOSED Because of this Man,\u201d read fliers posted on New Jersey government buildings and at the entrances to state parks last weekend after a budget impasse between the governor and Democratic lawmakers prompted a shutdown of nonessential state services. The fliers, approved by Mr. Christie and paid for with government funds, displayed the photograph and phone number of the governor\u2019s chief adversary in the dispute: Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto.From the beginning of the budget battle, Mr. Christie sought to cast Mr. Prieto, the mild-mannered and mustachioed Democratic leader of the Legislature\u2019s lower chamber, as responsible for the government shutdown. \u201cAll he\u2019s done is pout the last 48 hours. And sweat,\u201d Mr. Christie said Sunday at a news conference in Trenton, referring to Mr. Prieto\u2019s perspiration during a recent television interview.In the end it was Mr. Christie who faced the most criticism after the Star-Ledger newspaper photographed him with family and friends on the beach at a state park that was closed to the public during the shutdown. Mr. Christie said he was on the beach for less than an hour and wouldn\u2019t apologize for spending time with his family.The photo was picked up by national news outlets and mocked in memes on social media, with New Jersey-based public relations executive Karen Kessler saying the image \u201cshifted the sands for Prieto, and suddenly the blame for the shutdown was directed at the governor.\u201dMr. Prieto, meanwhile, received a standing ovation from his Democratic members as they voted to finalize the budget early\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0morning. \u201cThe governor was trying to paint me that I was rigid, that I didn\u2019t want to compromise and that I stormed out of his office, which is really B.S.,\u201d Mr. Prieto said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my style, that\u2019s not what I do.\u201dThe shutdown\u2019s conclusion marked a victory for Mr. Prieto as he fights to stave off a challenge from a central New Jersey assemblyman for the speakership, which is the third-most powerful elected position in New Jersey government. Mr. Prieto said he is confident he has the support of his caucus.Ms. Kessler said she didn\u2019t believe Mr. Prieto\u2019s role in the budget fight would bolster his chances of maintaining his post. \u201cThese leadership positions are unfortunately decided by a few political bosses and there\u2019s a lot of horse trading that goes on. This will be a distant memory,\u201d she said.A Cuban immigrant who came to the U.S. with his mother at age 10, Mr. Prieto is a former body builder who worked as a plumber before entering politics. He lives in the northern New Jersey\u00a0city of Secaucus, where he is a city construction official and chairs the Hudson County Democratic Organization.Mr. Prieto, 56 years old, gets along well with lawmakers from both parties in the state Assembly where he has presided as speaker since 2014. Jon Bramnick, who as minority leader acts as Mr. Prieto\u2019s Republican counterweight in the chamber, said, \u201cI\u2019m friendly with him and I like him. I think he\u2019s generally fair.\u201dThe governor has had a more contentious relationship with Mr. Prieto, including a monthslong public battle last year over the future of Atlantic City. Mr. Christie, who wanted to take over the nearly insolvent city and overhaul its finances, refused to release state aid unless lawmakers passed a bill giving him that authority.Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat from southern New Jersey, supported the governor\u2019s position. But Mr. Prieto, who sided with Atlantic City officials and unions opposed the intervention, refused to advance the bill. In the end he was able to delay but not prevent the state\u2019s intervention.In the two men\u2019s most recent showdown, Mr. Christie wanted legislation that would give the state more control over the finances of its largest insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. Mr. Prieto refused to put the bill up for a vote, saying it shouldn\u2019t be part of the state budget process.Other Democrats in the Legislature then refused to vote to approve the budget, because Mr. Christie said he would likely line-item veto more than $300 million in additional spending for schools and social service programs without the Horizon legislation.

But they\u2019re not created equal. Here, a few tips on finding one that fits your personal style and summer toting needsCONGRATULATIONS, you\u2019ve decided to buy a straw bag. Why the felicitations? Because these bags are usually a relative bargain, a rarity for anything that constitutes a bona fide fashion trend. Sure you could spend four figures on one but it\u2019s far from necessary. You can easily channel Jane Birkin, Audrey Hepburn or whichever woven tote-muse you choose for less than $50 without feeling compromised.The biggest decision may be whether to go plain or embellished. Traditionalist designers tend to prefer the former. \u201cThere is something very honest about a straw bag,\u201d said Yi-Mei Truxes, founder of Bembien, a line of minimalist accessories exclusively made of rattan and seagrass.Plainer bags also have a less ephemeral allure, which can be key to weathering the trend cycle. If it doesn\u2019t fall prey to a major sunscreen or ice-cream spillage, a classic Little Liffner style (\u201cThe Seasider,\u201d above) can last for decades. Simpler bags also don\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m on vacation,\u201d so they can be used in the city more readily than a pompom-strewn piece.Then again, these beautiful descendants of ancient carryalls also provide an irresistible canvas for creative expression. Paris designer Vanessa Seward took the canvas concept quite literally, asking American artist Jason Glasser to hand-paint geometric motifs on the round Moroccan straw bags she made for spring. \u201cWorking with cheaper materials makes you freer,\u201d said Ms. Seward. \u201cYou\u2019re less in awe of the raw materials.\u201d Priced at $290\u2014roughly half of what her leather bags fetch\u2014they proved more popular than the designer predicted. \u201cI promised Jason we\u2019d never sell more than 100,\u201d she said.

Companies such as Brazilian brand Nannacay make a point of celebrating their artisans. \u201cThere is a story behind the pieces,\u201d said founder Marcia Kemp. \u201cI think people connect to the story.

It authorizes the Maryland attorney general to sue companies to try to roll back certain price hikes and seek civil penalties of $10,000 per violation.It was enacted in response to what supporters said were unjustified price increases for older drugs that are essential to patients\u2019 health, such as Turing Pharmaceuticals\u2019 5000% increase in the price of the antiparasitic drug Daraprim in 2015.The Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents more than 20 generic-drug companies including             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.        TEVA -0.09%       and Mylan NV, filed its lawsuit in federal court in Maryland against the state\u2019s attorney general and secretary of the health department.The lawsuit argues the law overreaches because it would affect pricing decisions in other states, and that it too vaguely defines what constitutes price gouging. It also alleges the law violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s commerce and due-process clauses.The new law defines price gouging as an increase that is \u201cexcessive and not justified by the cost of producing the drug or the cost of appropriate expansion of access to the drug to promote public health.\u201dThe lawsuit says the law amounts to a \u201csweeping price restraint\u201d with terms \u201cso vague as to leave the state officials tasked with implementing and enforcing the law nearly unbounded discretion.\u201d\u201cThere are absolutely no criteria, no guardrails, no parameters of what constitutes an appropriate price increase or an excessive price increase,\u201d Chip Davis, president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, said in an interview.The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue an injunction against the implementation and enforcement of the law, and a declaration that it\u2019s unconstitutional and invalid.A spokeswoman for Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said the office is reviewing the lawsuit. Maryland Gov.       Larry Hogan,        a Republican, allowed the law to become enacted without his signature because he had concerns it wouldn\u2019t withstand legal challenges, he said in a letter to the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates in May.Mr. Frosh was a supporter of the new law. Last year, he was one of 20 state attorneys general to sue several generic-drug makers, including units of Mylan and Teva, accusing them of colluding to fix prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes medication. Mylan and Teva denied the allegations.While steep price hikes for newer, brand-name drugs have sparked criticism from patients and politicians, pricing for generic drugs also is increasingly coming under scrutiny. The federal Government Accountability Office issued a report in August finding that more than 300 of 1,441 established generic drugs analyzed had at least one extraordinary price increase of 100% or more between 2010 and 2015.Maryland is one of about 30 states in which bills targeting high drug prices have been introduced this year. Lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry have mounted aggressive campaigns in state capitals to fight the legislation.In June, Nevada\u2019s governor signed a bill to require manufacturers of diabetes drugs, as well as industry middlemen known as pharmacy-benefit managers, to disclose certain information about costs and profits associated with the drugs.Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maryland-sued-by-generic-drug-trade-group-over-new-pricing-law-1499370135", "news_title": "Maryland Sued by Generic-Drug Trade Group Over New Pricing Law", "keywords": "association for accessible medicines, drug companies,drugmakers,generic drug companies, generic drugs, lawsuit,maryland,maryland attorney general,maryland state law, mylan, pharmaceuticals,teva,turing,Teva Pharmaceutical,TEVA,Turing Pharmaceuticals,Association for Accessible Medicines,corporate crime,legal action,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,professional bodies,business,consumer services,generic,biosimilar drugs"}, {"content": "Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub said Thursday he plans to resign later this month, ending a tenure that was marked by frequent tangles with the       Trump       administration.\u201cThe great privilege and honor of my career has been to lead OGE\u2019s staff and the community of ethics officials in the federal executive branch,\u201d Mr. Shaub wrote in a letter to the president that the director posted to his             Twitter                   account. \u201cThey are committed to protecting the principle that public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles above private gain.\u201dMr. Shaub said he would resign on July 19, six months before his term was set to conclude. He plans to join the Campaign Legal Center as senior director of ethics, according to the group, which advocates for transparency and ethics in government.In the months since President Donald Trump took office, the GOP president has repeatedly clashed with Mr. Shaub over issues including the steps Mr. Trump took to distance himself from his business empire and his administration\u2019s disclosure of ethics waivers for former lobbyists serving in the White House.Mr. Shaub said in an email to The Wall Street Journal that he hadn\u2019t been pushed out by the White House.He said he was leaving before the end of his term because he felt the Campaign Legal Center would offer him the best platform and he wanted to take the job before it was filled.

In November, the ethics office sent a series of tweets at Mr. Trump urging him to divest fully from his business interests.In January, about 10 days before the inauguration, Mr. Shaub denounced as insufficient Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to guard against conflicts of interest, saying it did \u201cnot comport with the tradition of our presidents over the past 40 years.\u201dMr. Trump placed his assets into a trust and turned over management of his business to his adult sons, but retained ownership of the business. He can withdraw funds from the trust if its trustees\u2014his eldest son and a longtime company lawyer\u2014deem it appropriate.In an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Mr. Shaub again criticized the president for not taking adequate steps to distance himself from his business. Asked whether Mr. Trump and his family were using the presidency to enrich themselves, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t know what their intention is. I know that the effect is that there\u2019s an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency.\u201dIn March, Mr. Shaub criticized the White House for not taking more aggressive action against senior adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers in a television interview to \u201cgo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff,\u201d referring to the brand owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter. The White House said it had counseled Ms. Conway on the issue and determined she was unlikely to again break the federal law barring government officials from endorsing brands.In May, Mr. Shaub issued an unusually forceful response to an effort by the White House to block the ethics office\u2019s attempt to obtain its ethics waivers, which allow administration officials to work on issues they handled in their previous private-sector jobs. Mr. Shaub declined the request that his office suspend its effort to obtain the waivers and included hundreds of pages of material backing up his right to request them. The White House ultimately provided the waivers to the agency, which publicly disclosed them.Shortly after Mr. Shaub posted his resignation letter on Twitter, the Office of Government Ethics staff was gathered for an \u201call-hands meeting,\u201d according to an agency official.The departure of Mr. Shaub, who was appointed by former President       Barack Obama,        a Democrat, in 2013, means that Mr. Trump has the power to appoint a successor. A director must be confirmed by the Senate and is appointed to serve a five-year term. Mr. Shaub\u2019s term was set to expire in January.Don Fox, who served as the ethics office\u2019s general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, said Mr. Shaub was \u201cfar more outspoken\u201d than his predecessors about \u201cwhat he perceived as the ethical shortcomings of this administration.\u201d\u201cWalt spoke out because he felt he had to,\u201d said Mr. Fox, adding he couldn\u2019t think of another administration \u201cthat was ever this disdainful of government ethics.\u201dA White House spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Fox\u2019s criticism.In a statement released by the Campaign Legal Center, Mr. Shaub said he hoped in his new role to bolster federal ethics rules.\u201cIn working with the current administration, it has become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working toward that aim at Campaign Legal Center, as well as working on ethics reforms at all levels of government.\u201dWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Federal Ethics Watchdog To Resign.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/office-of-government-ethics-director-walter-shaub-resigns-1499361406", "news_title": "Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub Resigns   ", "keywords": "conflicts,director,donald trump,ethics,office of government ethics ,resignation,resigns,usoge,walter shaub,Office of Government Ethics,Trump,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues"}, {"content": "Europe is doing taxes all wrong.That\u2019s not a comment on the rates. Those are still too high to foster the entrepreneurship and innovation the Continent so desperately needs. But many European countries have cut rates in the past decade, and most of them are now below America\u2019s top corporate rate of 35%.Rather, the problem is that hardly anyone talks about taxation the right way. Europe\u2019s smarter leaders harbor a simplistic understanding that lower tax rates can stimulate economic growth. Missing is the more important debate about the proper role of the state in the economy, without which it\u2019s impossible to have a meaningful discussion about taxation.Britain is Exhibit A. The reduction in corporate rates\u2014to 17% by 2020 from 28% in 2009\u2014was a cornerstone of the strategy former Prime Minister       David Cameron       and Chancellor       George Osborne       adopted to save the economy from the crisis.Yet London now is embroiled in a debate about increasing government-employee pay after years of nominal wage growth capped at 1% a year. The leftward-drifting Labour party obviously supports more spending. More alarming, so do a nontrivial number of the same Conservatives who ostensibly supported the Cameron-Osborne tax cuts.It seems the Tories have forgotten everything       Margaret Thatcher       taught them. By the numbers, the Cameron-Osborne record isn\u2019t so far different from Thatcher\u2019s in terms such as reduction in government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product relative to what they inherited from Labour. But Thatcher explained her policies better, with a view to creating a durable electoral consensus for smaller government that could sustain lower tax rates.\u201cI came to office with one deliberate intent,\u201d she told a small-business group in 1984, \u201cto change Britain from a dependent to a self-reliant society\u2014from a give-it-to-me, to a do-it-yourself nation.\u201d Her taxation policies followed from this, and not the other way around. \u201cThe pressures for more public spending are remorseless,\u201d she said in the same speech. \u201cBut the Government will resist them. In a free society, government must leave more in the pockets of the people, to spend as they decide.\u201d This wasn\u2019t tax cutting as technocratic stimulus. It was tax cutting as philosophical choice.It worked. The reduction in spending as a percentage of GDP, which was above 50% in the early years of the Thatcher government, continued after she left office and reached a low point in 1999 and 2000 after       Tony Blair\u2019s       Labour had won power again. So deeply had Thatcher changed British minds that Mr. Blair could win only by promising that Labour would eschew its big-government past.In contrast, Messrs. Cameron and Osborne presented their tax cuts as part of an \u201causterity\u201d strategy sold to voters as a temporary crisis-recovery and fiscal-adjustment plan.So if the economy is growing now, why not raise tax rates a little bit more to restore some funding to the government? Thatcher could have told voters why not. Nowadays only a weakening faction within the weakened Tory party is making the case.At least Britain has that much. This week it became clear no mainstream politician in Germany thinks it\u2019s a problem that a government reducing its debt and with record fiscal surpluses isn\u2019t returning more money to taxpayers. Both the center-right Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats are offering only \u20ac15 billion ($17.02 billion) in annual tax relief, well under one-third of last year\u2019s \u20ac54 billion surplus. That\u2019s a grudging concession to, not a philosophical embrace of, the productive private economy.And this weekend\u2019s G-20 summit will renew discussion of global leaders\u2019 crackdown on legal corporate-tax planning. The crusade against \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d or BEPS, is premised on the notion that although governments can be allowed to reduce their tax rates a bit, companies should be prohibited from availing of the relief too much. It\u2019s a long way from Thatcher.This philosophical debate matters more than you think. An executive at a U.S. company this week offered an insight into why Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate rate has been so successful. What matters isn\u2019t only the rate, he told me, but the fact that there\u2019s broad agreement about that rate in Dublin. Other European governments struggle to convince businesses that their political commitment to low tax rates will last the lifespan of a capital investment.This sets up a major test for       Emmanuel Macron,        whose determination to cut French tax rates is one of the best things going for the European economy right now. He and Prime Minister       Edouard Philippe       deliver impassioned speeches about slashing both spending and taxes to break France\u2019s \u201caddiction\u201d to government. Can they transform public attitudes and mold the political class accordingly?More rides on the answer to that question than hangs on exactly what corporate-tax rate they manage in coming years.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 16:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-europe-doesnt-know-about-taxes-1499371323", "news_title": "What Europe Doesn\u2019t Know About Taxes", "keywords": "britain, corporate taxes, david cameron, europe, germany, margaret thatcher, tax policy,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A few days after President Donald Trump gave his Pentagon chief the unilateral authority last month to send thousands of American troops to Afghanistan at his own discretion, the White House sent classified guidance that effectively limits the number of forces.The memo, sent by national security adviser Lt. Gen.       H.R. McMaster       to a small group of administration officials, said that the president would let Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       send no more than 3,900 troops to Afghanistan without coming back to confer with the White House, according to people familiar with the document.The conflicting messages reflect divisions that have surfaced in the Trump administration as it tries to develop a comprehensive new strategy for Afghanistan, amid concerns about diving deeper into a 16-year-old conflict that has claimed more than 2,400 American lives and cost the U.S. $2.4 trillion.Mr. Mattis said he hopes to present a plan to the White House by mid-July that will give the U.S.-led coalition the forces it needs to blunt Taliban momentum. The rise of Islamic State in Afghanistan and the Afghan army\u2019s failure to keep Taliban forces from gaining momentum have created more urgency in Washington for a new strategy in a conflict U.S. officials say is at a dangerous stalemate.But the strategic planning is tangled in disagreements between factions in the White House and across the administration. They differ on what the U.S. goals should be in Afghanistan, whether to jump-start peace talks with the Taliban and how much pressure to put on Pakistan, according to current and former U.S. officials.Administration officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s move last month handing Mr. Mattis the authority to decide how many troops to send to Afghanistan was an outgrowth of the president\u2019s belief that the White House shouldn\u2019t micromanage wars\u2014a criticism he leveled at President       Barack Obama.Mr. Mattis announced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in a statement on June 14, saying it \u201cwill enable our military to have greater agility to conduct operations.\u201dThe subsequent memo limiting troop levels came as a surprise to some administration officials who said they were under the impression that the White House would impose no such restrictions. The White House\u2019s National Security Council declined to comment.Dana White, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokeswoman, said she couldn\u2019t discuss details of any classified memos, but suggested that the troop number isn\u2019t as important as the broader strategy.\u201cA number doesn\u2019t really tell you anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires a greater context, and if you are sending sons and daughters to Afghanistan, you owe it to them to lay out what\u2019s the way forward, not just a number.\u201dThe Pentagon has been weighing options to send between 2,000 and 5,000 U.S. troops to help the more than 8,400 American forces currently in Afghanistan, many of whom are focused on advising and training Afghan forces.To help the Afghan security forces seize the advantage, the U.S. is expected to send American troops closer to the fighting and carry out more airstrikes, according to U.S. officials.Defense officials said the White House memo wasn\u2019t likely to hamstring Pentagon planning, even though it puts constraints on military decision-making.At this point in the strategy review, according to current and former U.S. officials, the administration has agreed to one key understanding on troop levels: U.S. troops will stay in Afghanistan for as long as they are needed. There will be no timelines for withdrawal\u2014a key break with an Obama administration approach seen by some Trump administration officials as a strategic mistake.Instead, the officials said, the U.S. is now likely to scale back its military presence only when Afghan forces are able to secure most of the country and the Taliban threat is contained.Pentagon officials openly accept that the fight with the Taliban is at a stalemate. The Taliban have moved to govern territory under their control, putting millions of Afghans under Taliban rule. Growing Russian involvement with the Taliban has complicated matters.Efforts on another U.S. priority in Afghanistan, to deny extremist groups sanctuary, have fallen short: The Pentagon estimates that Afghanistan and Pakistan now are home to more than 20 extremist groups, the highest concentration in the world.For months, the American commander of the U.S.-led military coalition in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, has been asking the new administration to send more U.S. troops to help turn the tide.That decision has been delayed as the strategy review continues. It has been slowed in part by staffing shortages that have left the State Department with few high-level specialists to craft plans for diplomatic, economic and political pillars of the strategy.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       recently scrapped the post of special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department\u2019s bureau of South and Central Asia affairs has been hobbled by the departure of key leaders. And Mr. Trump has yet to name new ambassadors for Afghanistan and Pakistan.A senior State Department official said the agency places a premium on making sure it has the right people leading its policy on Afghanistan and has hundreds of people working in Afghanistan to help achieve U.S. goals.The strategy review, which initially focused primarily on Afghanistan, has been expanded to explore the possibility of tougher steps against Pakistan. Many officials in Washington and Kabul view Islamabad as an unreliable partner and want to punish Pakistan for providing sanctuary for extremist leaders.The idea is resonating in the White House, where Mr. Trump has told aides that he doesn\u2019t like the idea that Pakistan takes billions from the U.S., provides sanctuary for insurgent groups and may be \u201claughing\u201d at Washington, according to current and former officials.This faction of the Trump administration wants the U.S. to gradually ratchet up pressure on Islamabad by slowing military deals, reducing economic support and imposing sanctions on the country\u2019s intelligence service, which has been accused by top U.S. officials of backing extremist fighters that have carried out deadly attacks on American forces in Afghanistan. Pakistan has denied that it supports or shelters insurgents.But there is no agreement yet on how far to push Islamabad, and Mr. Trump and aides are wary of putting too much pressure on Pakistan and making things worse, officials said.Administration officials also are at odds over how aggressively to push Afghanistan peace talks with the Taliban.Mr. Mattis is among those who have indicated they see little value in that, when Taliban fighters have battlefield momentum.The Pentagon chief and others have said they want to pump in more American troops to help the Afghan army push back Taliban advances to give the government more power at the bargaining table.That could take years, and gains by similar campaigns in the past have been fleeting.\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s going to happen overnight,\u201d said Ms. White, the Pentagon spokeswoman. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet. It\u2019s going to take a comprehensive approach to move forward.\u201dWrite to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Pentagon Curbed on Afghan Troop Level.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 15:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-limits-pentagon-on-afghan-troop-level-1499357547", "news_title": "White House Limits Pentagon on Afghan Troop Level", "keywords": "afghan war,daesh,isis,islamic state,u.s. troops,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,state security measures,policies,military action"}, {"content": "Longtime rivals QVC and the             Home Shopping Network        HSNI 2.75%       have agreed to merge as two retailers built around cable television adapt to a world where impulse buying and video watching is moving to smartphones.The companies, famous for pitching products such as the Miracle Mop and George Foreman grill, said Thursday they have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction valued at about $2.1 billion. QVC parent Liberty Interactive Corp., controlled by cable magnate       John Malone,        already owns a 38% stake in HSN.While the home-shopping channels were early adopters of e-commerce and don\u2019t face the same pressures as chains with brick-and-mortar stores, they are increasingly competing for consumer dollars with Amazon.com Inc. QVC\u2019s sales in the U.S. have declined in each of the last three quarters. Revenue at HSN has declined for six straight quarters, and the company has been searching for a new CEO.QVC Chief Executive Officer       Mike George,        who will run the combined company, said the retailers face a \u201ctough environment\u201d but that QVC and HSN are different from typical e-commerce companies, which tend to be more transactional. \u201cOur customers engage with us most days over TV or digital platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cThey form a connection with the hosts of our shows.\u201dThe merger gives the business greater scale to invest in emerging technologies, Mr. George said. While the combined companies will operate 17 cable channels around the globe, both QVC and HSN also sell online and stream their videos over the internet. The combined entity will have annual revenue of about $14 billion, of which slightly more than half comes from e-commerce.\u201cLiberty had been interested in buying the rest of HSN for years, even before the retail armageddon,\u201d said       Victor Anthony,        an analyst with Aegis Capital. But for a long time, HSN\u2019s shares traded at a premium to Liberty\u2019s, making a deal untenable, Mr. Anthony said. In the last month, however, the stock multiples inverted.HSN, which is more heavily dependent on the U.S. market and has about a third as much revenue as QVC, has been struggling with shrinking sales. In April, the company said its longtime CEO       Mindy Grossman       was leaving to run             Weight Watchers International Inc.HSN launched the idea of home shopping in 1977, when it began airing programming that showcased inventors, entrepreneurs and designers plugging their wares. Its better known personalities include Miracle Mop inventor       Joy Mangano,        who got her start on QVC before switching to HSN, and celebrity chef       Wolfgang Puck.QVC, which was founded in 1986, has focused on fashion and beauty. Among the beauty labels it helped to launch are Philosophy, BareMinerals and       Josie Maran.Together, they have 23 million global customers, including about 2 million customers that shop on both QVC and HSN. The business model counts on getting just enough viewers who may be tuning in throughout the day or unwinding at night to make impulsive purchases. The majority of QVC customers are women who on average each make about 25 purchases a year.\u201cThere are some clear advantages to scale,\u201d Mr. Anthony, the analyst said. \u201cThey can negotiate better pricing with suppliers, better shipping costs and other back-end synergies.\u201dCord-cutting, or the canceling of home cable packages, also poses a risk. But QVC said consumers who are opting out of pay-TV packages\u2014generally younger and lower-income consumers\u2014aren\u2019t its core shoppers. The company also said it increasingly is reaching customers on different types of devices.\u201cWe see a role for engaging live video experiences,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cPeople are consuming more video content than ever\u2026not just on TV, but on tablet and mobile devices.\u201dFollowing the merger, Liberty plans to spin off its cable operations into an independent company and rename itself QVC Group. The business will include the flash-sale website Zulily, which QVC bought for $2.4 billion in 2015, and HSN\u2019s Cornerstone division, which includes home retailer Ballard Designs among other brands.QVC, which has its main offices in West Chester, Pa., expects to get cost savings of $75 million to $110 million annually from the deal in three to five years. HSN\u2019s headquarters will remain in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Mr. George said it would continue to operate as an independent brand.Under the terms of the proposed deal, HSN shareholders will receive 1.65 shares of QVC\u2019s Series A stock for each share of HSN. Based on Wednesday\u2019s closing prices, the companies said the offer valued HSN at $40.36, or a 29% premium.Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 15:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qvc-to-acquire-rival-hsn-for-more-than-2-billion-1499343460", "news_title": "QVC to Acquire Rival HSN for More Than $2 Billion ", "keywords": "e-commerce, home shopping network, hsn, liberty interactive,qvc, qvc hsn merger,Liberty Interactive,QVCA,LINTA,HSN,HSNI,QVC,Zulily,ZU,Liberty Interactive ,Amazon.com,AMZN,John Malone,corporate changes,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,new companies creation,demergers,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,retail,wholesale,etailing,broadcasting,television broadcasting,cable broadcasting,internet,online,media,technology"}, {"content": "Oil prices rebounded slightly Thursday after data showing a drop in U.S. stockpiles reignited a two-week-long rally.Light, sweet crude for August settled up 39 cents, or 0.9%, at $45.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent gained 32 cents, or 0.7%, to $48.11 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both are up nine sessions in the past 11.The gains canceled out some the big losses from Wednesday\u2019s session. But gains had been much larger early in the day only to retreat almost all the way back to unchanged in the last 90 minutes before settlement.Crude levels in U.S. storage fell by 6.3 million barrels in the week ended Friday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Thursday morning. That is almost three times the expectations of a 2.5 million-barrel increase from analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. And it exceeded an industry estimate of a 5.8 million-barrel decline that was released Tuesday and had initially sent crude prices inching higher.Storage levels are often a widely watched measure of supply and demand, but have drawn even more interest in recent months as traders try to gauge the impact of cutbacks pledged by the world\u2019s biggest exporters. Stockpiles have been holding near record highs world-wide despite those cuts and traders have been waiting for more evidence that can change.\u201cIt is giving people short-term hope,\u201d       Mark Waggoner,        president of brokerage Excel Futures, said of Wednesday\u2019s report.EIA also said gasoline stockpiles fell by 3.7 million barrels, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of a 1.4-million-barrel decrease. API had estimated a 5.7-million-barrel fall in gasoline stocks.Distillates in storage, including heating oil and diesel, declined by 1.9 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 100,000-barrel decrease. API had estimated a 372,000-barrel increase in distillate stocks.Both gasoline and diesel futures added to gains after the data release. Gasoline futures gained 2.63 cents, or 1.8%, to $1.5287 a gallon. Diesel gained 0.34 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.4819 a gallon.\u201cThis number is just bullish across the board,\u201d said       Scott Shelton,        broker at ICAP PLC. But he also added that he expected prices to retreat in the afternoon, echoing more long-term concerns also shared by Mr. Waggoner. \u201cI think the market is still kind of afraid of its own shadow,\u201d Mr. Shelton added.Oil\u2019s rally in recent weeks was spurred in part by early signs that U.S. production may not be as resilient in the face of low prices as many believed. But that rally was always tentative and fueled largely by investors trying to cover short positions, rather than a real shift in sentiment, said       Michael Hiley,        a trader at LPS Futures LLC.And, in fact, U.S. production rose 88,000 barrels a day last week, EIA said. Now beyond 9.3 million barrels a day, it is up nearly 11% from a year ago and nearly back at its 10-month high.Reports Russia wouldn\u2019t support more production cuts with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had pressured the price Wednesday. Adding to oil\u2019s headwinds, Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members that were exempt from production quotas, have been continuing to ramp up output, undermining the effect of the production caps from other members.Those same concerns likely played a role in Thursday afternoon\u2019s retreat, said       Peter Donovan,        broker for Liquidity Energy LLC in New York. It will take several more weeks of falling U.S. stockpiles to accelerate the rally, he added.\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve seen in these market is rarely do these [EIA] stats have holding power unless it\u2019s going on for a sustained period of time,\u201d Mr. Donovan said.\u2014Justin Yang and Alison Sider contributed to this article.Write to Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 15:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-gains-on-report-of-inventory-draw-1499339361", "news_title": "Oil Prices Rally on Report of Drop in U.S. Inventory", "keywords": " american petroleum institute, brent crude, commodities, gasoline,oil markets,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "The city of Hartford, Conn., has retained the law firm of Greenberg Traurig LLP as restructuring counsel as it weighs whether to file for bankruptcy, officials said Thursday.Hartford has a deficit approaching $50 million and has asked the state for help managing its fiscal crisis. But the state has its own budget troubles and failed to pass a spending plan to close a two-year hole of $5.1 billion before the fiscal year ended on June 30.The city has \u201cadvocated for a State budget that puts our cities in a position to be strong and vibrant, for the sake of Connecticut\u2019s economic competitiveness,\u201d Mayor       Luke Bronin       said. \u201cIn the meantime, as we start a new fiscal year without a State budget and with significant uncertainty, we will have the advice and counsel of an experienced and highly respected restructuring firm.\u201dGov.       Dannel Malloy       said Wednesday it appeared that July 18 was the earliest the state Legislature was prepared to vote on a budget.Greenberg Traurig, led by       Nancy Mitchell,        one of the co-chairs of the firm\u2019s restructuring practice, will help the city evaluate options to put the city on a path to long-term fiscal stability, city officials said. Over the past 18 months, the city has made deep spending cuts and continues to seek concessions from public-employee unions to address the deficit, Mr. Bronin said.Mounting debt and a declining population are problems for many U.S. cities. Detroit officials had also blamed its financial problems on the loss of residents, who fled in large numbers for its safer suburbs. The 680,000-resident city filed for bankruptcy in July 2013 to negotiate cuts to $18 billion in debt, blaming tax revenue that fell after the real-estate crash.Earlier this year, U.S. territory Puerto Rico filed for a form of bankruptcy that incorporates parts of chapter 9 law, the type of protection used by struggling cities and counties. The Caribbean island of roughly 3.4 million people has an unemployment rate that tops 12%, more than twice the U.S. average.In California, the cities of San Bernardino and Stockton filed for bankruptcy in 2012.Hartford\u2019s fiscal woes have been driven by rising fixed costs on things like health care and pensions. It must pay nearly $180 million on debt service, health care, pensions and other costs for the current fiscal year. That amounts to more than half of the city\u2019s budget, excluding education.Mr. Malloy and other top lawmakers have said it is in the state\u2019s best interest for Hartford to avoid bankruptcy, but financial assistance from the state would come with more oversight of the city\u2019s finances.

But the value of the remaining ticket inventory is estimated to cover only a fraction of the company\u2019s debts.Traditionally kicking off on the last Monday of August, the U.S. Open is the final tournament of the four tennis Grand Slam events, attracting the world\u2019s top players to New York and annually bringing more than a half million fans to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens over its two-week run.The tickets to the nation\u2019s most popular tennis tournament are the last remaining assets the company says it may be able to sell to raise money for businesses and individuals caught up in Mr. Nissen\u2019s allegedly fraudulent enterprise.In a letter last month, a lawyer for Mr. Nissen indicated he would fight the lawsuit, insisting the bankrupt remnants of the ticketing business \u201chas no claim\u201d to the U.S. Open tickets. The lawyer didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Thursday. Mr. Nissen missed a deadline last month for him to turn over the disputed tickets, according to court papers.Mr. Nissen was fired as chief executive of National Events in May and arrested later that month on a federal fraud charge. He raised money that was supposed to be used to buy blocks of premium and VIP tickets to sporting and theatrical events such as the Super Bowl and the Broadway hit \u201cHamilton.\u201d But much of the money was used to pay off earlier investors or to line Mr. Nissen\u2019s pocket, according to prosecutors.Mr. Nissen intends to plead not guilty in the pending criminal case, according to his defense attorney. Court papers say there is no evidence investors or other company executives participated in the alleged scheme.Federal bankruptcy watchdogs have moved to convert National Events\u2019 chapter 11 case to a chapter 7 bankruptcy, where an independent, court-appointed outsider would steer a probe that will ultimately determine who gets paid and who gets sued in the fallout from the alleged scheme.A hearing on the matter is set for later this month.\u2014Peg Brickley contributed to this article.Write to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 15:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/battle-over-u-s-open-tickets-lands-in-bankruptcy-court-1499369549", "news_title": "Battle Over U.S. Open Tickets Lands in Bankruptcy Court", "keywords": " bankruptcynews, ponzi scheme, ticket broker,us open tickets,National Events Holdings,Jason Nissen,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,ponzi,pyramid scheme,securities fraud,sports,recreation,tennis,routine general news,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,ticket agents"}, {"content": "Turkish police have detained 10 senior human-rights workers, including the head of Amnesty International\u2019s Turkey chapter and two Europeans, during a training conference outside Istanbul, the head of the international organization said.Amnesty says the activists are being investigated on allegations of membership in a terror organization after police on the tourist island of Buyukada interrupted a training session on digital security late Wednesday. The group, including the German and Swede who were leading the training, are being held in separate detention facilities, the organization said.Turkish authorities didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment about the reasons for the detentions.Amnesty said their chapter head, Idil Eser, was remanded in custody for seven days. The identities of the Europeans haven't been released, and it is unknown whether they have received consular assistance.Turkey is currently under a state of emergency that gives authorities extraordinary powers to detain suspects without access to a lawyer for extended periods. The state of emergency also bans most public political gatherings and compels groups to inform police of private meetings of all kinds organized in hotels or conference centers.Those detained include eight Turkish human-rights workers and lawyers, as well as the Turkish owner of the hotel where the training was taking place, according to Amnesty.The news of the detentions comes as President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       prepares to meet European leaders at the Group of 20 meetings in Hamburg, Germany, where he is expected to face criticism for what many allies and Turkish opposition leaders see as a crackdown on all civil liberties since last summer\u2019s failed military coup.Salil Shetty,        Amnesty International\u2019s secretary-general, said he is \u201cprofoundly disturbed and outraged\u201d about the detentions, which he said were \u201cblatantly without cause.\u201d He called on world leaders in Hamburg to call for the group\u2019s immediate and unconditional release.\u201cWorld leaders currently sitting in Hamburg have been remarkably tolerant of Turkey\u2019s human-rights meltdown.

Like many such enterprises, the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival is in the process of broadening its once-sacrosanct repertory, so much so that two of its three current mainstage productions are premieres. One, however, is a play about Shakespeare, while the other is a new adaptation of a novel as classic\u2014and familiar\u2014as anything the Bard ever wrote. The biggest and best news, though, is that both plays are the stuff hits are made of, and Hudson Valley has brought off a first-class coup by launching them in the same season.Hudson Valley Shakespeare FestivalBoscobel House and Gardens, Garrison, N.Y.  $21.75-$64.75, 845-265-9575Pride and Prejudice  Closes Sept. 4The Book of Will  Closes July 28Kate Hamill,        whose stage versions of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d and \u201cVanity Fair\u201d were deservedly successful, has now turned her hand to a second       Jane Austen       novel, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d have anything fresh to say about a book that to date has been filmed a half-dozen times (not counting \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d) and put on the stage at least as often. You\u2019d be wrong, though, for the ever-ingenious Ms. Hamill has given us something completely and delightfully different, a smallish-cast period-dress \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d that she\u2019s done over in the revved-up manner of a Hollywood screwball comedy. The language is traditional but the approach is thoroughly modern, with six of the eight actors playing multiple roles, several of them in drag. Cleverly compressed\u2014one of the five Bennet sisters has vanished into the memory hole\u2014and adapted with fizzy, festive freedom, Ms. Hamill\u2019s \u201cP&P\u201d is full of \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d-style slapstick and the kind of barely controlled chaos that you\u2019d expect to see in a five-door Feydeau farce.Such a show demands worthy staging, and       Amanda Dehnert,        a prodigally gifted director whose work is not yet widely known on the East Coast, delivers the goods with gusto. Having previously seen her Oregon Shakespeare Festival productions of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Ms. Dehnert also has a knack for pratfalls and spit takes, but her way with \u201cP&P\u201d is so adroit as to make me wonder what she\u2019d do with a full-fledged farce like \u201cLoot\u201d or \u201cNoises Off.\u201d At the same time, she also makes sure to darken the mood just before intermission, reminding us that in the 19th century the finding of a husband was no laughing matter for unmonied women like the Bennet sisters.In addition to having written the script, Ms. Hamill plays Lizzy Bennet with winning impishness, and       Jason O\u2019Connell,        a well-known Hudson Valley face, is wonderfully, almost incapacitatingly shy as Mr. Darcy. Top comic honors, though, go to       Mark Bedard,        who doubles as the fathomlessly snooty       Miss Bingley       and the disgustingly obsequious Mr. Collins. Either one of his performances would have been noteworthy, but that the same person should be playing both parts (as well as that of Mr. Wickham) is a truly stupendous piece of quick-change clownery.If you can\u2019t make it to Hudson Valley, Ms. Dehnert\u2019s production will be transferring to New York\u2019s Primary Stages in November. I can\u2019t imagine that it will stop there: Like \u201cVanity Fair\u201d before it, Ms. Hamill\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is the kind of show that would flourish in a small Broadway house. Should \u201cP&P\u201d fail to receive the commercial production it deserves, you can bet that it\u2019ll be the toast of the regional-theater circuit.Lauren Gunderson\u2019s       \u201cThe Book of Will,\u201d Hudson Valley\u2019s second premiere, is a different sort of period piece, a play about the posthumous publication in 1623 of the First Folio, in which fully authentic texts of most of Shakespeare\u2019s plays saw print for the very first time. If that sounds like dry-as-dust pedantry to you, fear not: Ms. Gunderson, whose plays are hugely popular outside New York but has yet to receive a major production in Manhattan, has given us a serious comedy, by turns charming and darkly poignant, in which a history lesson is embedded so gracefully that you\u2019ll scarcely know you\u2019ve been schooled.Davis McCallum,        Hudson Valley\u2019s artistic director, has given \u201cThe Book of Will\u201d a lively staging that\u2019s as close to ideal as it\u2019s possible to get, but the play is so soundly made that it would come off as well in a less deft production. \u201cThe Book of Will\u201d is a cinch to be taken up by Shakespeare festivals all over America\u2014as well it should be.\u2014Mr. Teachout is the Journal\u2019s drama critic. \u201cBilly and Me,\u201d his new play, opens at Palm Beach Dramaworks on Dec. 8.

That was a 7% improvement from May, when truck orders retreated after several stronger-than-expected months, and up 39% from a year ago.The June expansion signaled renewed confidence in a trucking industry that had started 2017 by ramping up orders, and it suggests equipment makers are on track to maintain a rate of production set to hit 236,000 units this year, slightly ahead of last year\u2019s production of 226,500 trucks, according to freight transport analysts FTR.The flow of new truck orders tends to be weakest in the summer months, with the biggest trucking companies bulking up orders in October and November. That shifted last year as tepid manufacturing growth and high retail inventory levels curbed freight demand, and truck orders fell 46% year-over-year at the start of the ordering season in October. That triggered layoffs at several factories as equipment makers and engine providers pulled back production.Shares in truck-engine maker             Cummins Inc.,       which have risen 22% this year, were up $1.22 a share in trading Thursday, to $165.25. Truck maker             Navistar International Corp.       was up 52 cents a share in midday trading, to $27.01.Kenny Vieth,        a senior analyst with ACT, said rising consumer confidence and talk of new infrastructure spending under the Trump administration helped drive growth in truck orders early in the year. The bump was notable, he said, because trucking companies committed to buying new vehicles well before solid signs of improvement in the freight market.\u201cUsually you get the freight, then the freight rates, then the truck orders,\u201d Mr. Vieth said. \u201cThis time we bypassed those and went straight to orders.\u201dThere are signs that shipping demand has strengthened in the early part of the summer.

The \u20ac60 billion-a-month program has bolstered asset prices and pinned down interest rates across the 19-nation eurozone since it was launched more than two years ago.The ECB took a tiny step toward reducing its massive stimulus at its June policy meeting, signaling its increased confidence in the region\u2019s economic recovery and indicating it was unlikely to cut interest rates again.The minutes of the June meeting, published Thursday, show policy makers considered going even further by dropping a pledge to accelerate QE if the economic outlook darkens. Removing the pledge would be a final step toward scaling back the program.The euro rose more than a quarter-cent against the dollar to $1.14 after the minutes were published. Germany\u2019s 10-year government-bond yield rose to 0.57%, the highest level since January 2016.Analysts said the ECB is inching toward tapering QE, a move that is expected to have a far-reaching impact on eurozone asset prices and interest rates.\u201cIt\u2019s evolution, not revolution, but the direction of travel is clear,\u201d said Ken Wattret, an economist with TS Lombard in London.The ECB\u2019s large-scale purchases have increased the demand for eurozone government bonds, boosting their prices and reducing their yields, or the return paid for holding them. As the ECB is expected to buy fewer bonds, the demand for them will fall and their yields will rise. Investors have already started to price that in.ECB President       Mario Draghi       rocked financial markets last week by suggesting that the central bank might ignore temporarily weak inflation data and start reducing its stimulus as the economic recovery gains traction.The economy in the 19-nation bloc has expanded for 16 straight quarters and its unemployment rate has fallen to an eight-year low of 9.3%. Consumer and business sentiment indicators are flashing green.Some ECB officials have pounced on Mr. Draghi\u2019s message to call for a prompt end to QE bond-buying. Speaking in Vienna on Thursday, German central-bank governor       Jens Weidmann       argued that the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery \u201copens the possibility for a normalization of monetary policy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about slamming on the brake\u2026but about taking one\u2019s foot off the gas a bit,\u201d Mr. Weidmann said.Still, other policy makers have urged caution. Despite stronger growth, the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate fell to 1.3% last month, short of the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. The bank\u2019s chief economist,       Peter Praet,        warned twice this week that it must push on with its monetary stimulus until the job is done.\u201cOur mission is not yet accomplished. We need patience and persistence,\u201d he said in Paris on Thursday.Many ECB officials worry that a sudden policy move might trigger a sharp rise in borrowing costs across the region, which could upset the economic recovery. Bond yields rose dramatically after the Federal Reserve signaled four years ago that it would wind down its QE program, in an episode that became known as the taper tantrum. The ECB also has a history of raising interest rates too soon.Most economists nevertheless expect the ECB to signal in September or October that it will start winding down its bond purchases early next year. One key reason: The ECB is expected to struggle to find enough bonds to buy next year, especially in Germany, due to constraints on its exposure to individual governments.\u201cOn balance, we still see the bank tapering its asset purchases from the current pace of \u20ac60 billion a month to zero by June [2018], starting in January,\u201d said       Jennifer McKeown,        an economist with Capital Economics in London. \u201cBut if the euro or bond yields rise significantly further in the meantime, the pace may be even slower.\u201d\u2014Todd Buell in Vienna contributed to this article.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 14:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-officials-considered-dropping-a-pledge-to-accelerate-qe-at-june-meeting-1499341290", "news_title": "ECB Considered Dropping a QE Guarantee at June Meeting", "keywords": "bond buying program,ecb,mario draghi,monetary policy,monetary stimulus,negative rates,qe,quantitative easing,tapering stimulus,European Central Bank,German government,Federal Reserve,central bank intervention,interest rates,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Dish Network        DISH -0.67%       has a lot to gain from an alliance with             Amazon.com        AMZN 0.24%       as it faces a government deadline to develop its wireless airwaves. For Amazon, the benefits are less clear and could be costly.Dish Network Chief Executive       Charlie Ergen       has been discussing a potential partnership with Amazon CEO       Jeff Bezos       that could involve the e-commerce giant helping to finance a wireless network on Dish\u2019s airwaves, The Wall Street Journal reported. Under that scenario, Amazon could use the network to power web-connected devices, including its Echo home speaker, delivery drones and other products in the works. Another idea would have Amazon invest in a Dish wireless network in exchange for the ability to offer Prime members special pricing for wireless service.For Dish, which has said it plans to build a bare-bones network in order to comply with a government-imposed deadline of March 2020, an investment by Amazon would go a long way toward convincing bears it can offer a substantive service by then. The threat that Dish\u2019s trove of airwaves could fall into Amazon\u2019s hands could also push             Verizon Communications                   or             T-Mobile USinto talks with the satellite company.The question is how deeply Amazon wants to tread into the wireless industry, where an increasing number of players, including traditional wireless carriers and cable companies, are competing for a shrinking pool of profits.If Amazon needs wireless capacity to operate its drones and other devices it could easily buy that from an existing carrier. Such devices likely wouldn\u2019t require huge amounts of bandwidth unless they involved streaming video. And if Amazon wants to use Dish\u2019s network for video, it will have to invest considerably more.Indeed, while Dish would give Amazon access to wireless capacity, and let it tap its base of Prime members to build a subscriber base, clearing the final barrier to entry\u2014willingness to spend massive amounts to build and maintain a network\u2014could be more of a stretch. Verizon and             AT&T                   are each investing more than $10 billion in wireless alone this year, according to UBS. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s overall capital expenditures to be $7.86 billion in 2017, not including capitalized leases.Of course, Mr. Bezos has a long investment horizon. He could still opt to do a low-stakes deal that would give Amazon some future options in wireless as technologies shift. That would allow Mr. Ergen\u2014who also likes to keeps his options open\u2014to meet his deadline and then decide whether try to deepen his company\u2019s relationship with Amazon or find another partner or buyer.Amazon gives Dish more credibility in its quest to build a wireless network.

While I personally like the idea of concealed-carry reciprocity, it does fly in the face of individual states\u2019 rights.The evil man who attempted to kill our congressmen simply because they were Republicans wasn\u2019t stopped by laws and policies. He was stopped by two brave people who could legally carry guns in those circumstances.Richard T. YoungGreenville, Ill.We already have federal laws that demand a background check on the sale of firearms. What is Rep. Beyer talking about when he says he fears people can buy guns without a background check? Shooter James Hodgkinson brought a handgun and rifle into Virginia despite its existing gun laws and lack of reciprocity, which confirms precisely the logic of the pro-gun lobby. Gun laws do very little to deter criminals and simply serve to hamper law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves.The best lesson from the Hodgkinson case is to implement better background checks to deny guns to people with mental-health or domestic-violence issues and to extend concealed-carry reciprocity so that if the background checks do fail, at least citizens can defend themselves. There is also good statistical evidence supporting the observation that concealed-carry states have lower murder rates, and that\u2019s a good start for a nonideological debate.Ari WeitznerNew YorkStudies have shown that firearms are used more than two million times a year for personal protection and that the presence of a firearm, without a shot being fired, prevents crime in many instances. How is this idea so terrible?Joel WilkersonAtlantaRep. Beyer claims reciprocity would decimate public safety. That\u2019s simply ridiculous and not supported by the facts. More states allow concealed carry now than 20 years ago, and over that time violent crime has steadily decreased.I must correct Rep. Beyer\u2019s inaccuracies regarding, as he puts it, \u201csilencers.\u201d Silencer is a Hollywood term. The devices referred to don\u2019t silence a firearm, they simply reduce the decibel level of a firearm to levels that don\u2019t damage hearing.

Security forces on Thursday heightened their presence in cities across the country, with mounted foot and motorized patrols visible in the capital Lusaka, according to witnesses and officials.Mr. Lungu on Thursday defended his move to impose emergency measures, saying he needed to restore \u201csanity \u201c to Africa\u2019s second largest copper producer. \u201cThe country is in safe hands, do not panic\u201d the president, who was due to meet foreign ambassadors to explain the move, told reporters in Lusaka. \u201cThese are acts of sabotage by the opposition but they will all fail\u201dMr. Lungu\u2019s supporters have for weeks been lobbying for emergency legislation after a spate of violent attacks and arson, culminating in a fire ripping through Zambia\u2019s largest market on Tuesday.The opposition United Party for National Development decried Mr. Lungu\u2019s move as an illegal power grab.\u201cThe state of emergency, if mishandled, can backfire [on] all of us, regardless of our political affiliation, and we could lose peace forever, \u201c the party said in a statement. \u201cThere is need that the situation in the country is handled with care.\u201dPolitical analysts said the president\u2019s move suggests the government will likely intensify its suppression of dissent and could jeopardize talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $1.3 billion bailout plan that are at an advanced stage.\u201cThe actions of Mr. Lungu indicate that risks are being driven up quicker than previously expected,\u201d       Gary van Staden,        a political analyst with NKC African Economics, said. \u201cSporadic outbreaks of violence will inevitably grow more frequent.\u201dMr. Lungu has closed opposition media outlets and in February pledged to pull his country from the International Criminal Court. In June, the ruling-party-dominated parliament suspended 48 members of the opposition for boycotting the president\u2019s annual state of the nation address.The tension in Zambia, Africa\u2019s largest copper and cobalt producer after Congo, comes after decades of relative stability and rising foreign investment that have contrasted with the upheaval and insurgencies in some neighboring states.Relations between the government and opposition have been tense since August, when Mr. Lungu\u2019s Patriotic Front beat       Mr. Hichilema\u2019s       United Party for National Development in a vote the opposition says was rigged.The U.S. and the European Union have expressed concern over Mr. Hichilema\u2019s arrest, as have opposition party leaders from across the region, including Kenya and South Africa.

Squeezed in the middle are             Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s       venerable blue-and-yellow boxes.The pressure has set off a bout of soul searching in the industry as well as some dramatic restructuring. Some companies are shedding underperforming brands, others have contemplated mergers.

It\u2019s the sixth \u201cSpider-Man\u201d feature, but the first to spin forth from Marvel Studios, and Marvel has done the improbable by breathing big puffs of life into a declining franchise. The biggest is giving the title role to       Tom Holland,        who is supported by consistently bright writing (six writers get screenplay credit) and sharp-witted direction by Jon Watts. (He did \u201cClown\u201d and the lean thriller \u201cCop Car.\u201d) Here, as in Marvel\u2019s 2016 \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d the concept of a comic-book universe\u2014diverse superheroes populating interlinked films\u2014represents more than a vast merchandising venture. This universe seems like an expansive superfamily.Mr. Holland\u2019s success is less than surprising because he made a brief but impressive debut in the role during the climactic battle of \u201cCivil War.\u201d The new film picks up the hero\u2019s story a few months later in New York. A high school kid, as he has been before,       Peter Parker      \u2014the third Peter Parker, after       Tobey Maguire       and       Andrew Garfield      \u2014is younger in spirit than his predecessors, meaning he\u2019s a convincingly real high school kid within the kind of buoyant reality established for an earlier generation by the filmmaker       John Hughes.       (Peter is still living with his Aunt May, who, as played by       Marisa Tomei,        is younger in body as well as spirit.)The main appeal of this latest iteration is how quick, earnest and funny Peter can be. (Quickness pervades the film\u2014all the young actors rush their lines.) The mystery of the central performance is how Mr. Holland, an Englishman only two years out of his teens, has managed to acquire such a quicksilver technique; he\u2019s sure to bring younger audiences back to the multiplexes for a look-see at a series that had been aging fast.Join WSJ+ & Rooftop Cinema Club for a member-only screening on Saturday, July 29, atop the landmark Montalb\u00e1n Theatre in the heart of Hollywood. Featuring WSJ Movie Critic Joe Morgensten\u2019s summer pick, \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the private screening will be followed by a special discussion and Q&A with Morgensten himself.When Peter first takes Spider-Man public as a local crime fighter in the borough of Queens, a pretty girl in his high school is unimpressed with the new superhero on the block: \u201cHe\u2019s probably like 30,\u201d she says. But no, he\u2019s very much like the 15-year-old he is\u2014a hormone-fueled hotshot who is being groomed for the Avengers team through an internship sponsored by Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. As he swings past a platform full of people waiting for a train he asks, with cheerful self-importance, \u201cIs everybody good?\u201dThe interplay between Peter and Tony is extensive. That means the movie benefits extensively from the presence and singular panache of       Robert Downey Jr.      , since Tony is Peter\u2019s role model in what is basically a coming-of-age story, as well as a balance wheel for a kid in a hurry to use superpowers he hasn\u2019t mastered. And Peter gets the formidable villain he deserves: Adrian Toomes, aka the Vulture, a malign birdman played with a flamboyant ferocity that befits his wingspan by       Michael Keaton      \u2014who, of course, played another feathered flyer less than three years ago in \u201cBirdman.\u201dThree other characters distinguish themselves in the densely populated production: Peter\u2019s classmate and best buddy Ned (      Jacob Batalon      ), a chubby, scene-stealingly charming nerd;       Chris Evans\u2019s       Captain America, who turns up as, of all things, a killingly earnest motivational speaker in classroom videos (and who demonstrates why it\u2019s worthwhile to wait for end-title cameos); and Spider-Man\u2019s suit, which is less a garment than a weapons system with a personality, thanks to       Jennifer Connelly\u2019s       Suit Lady, a sort of Siri with genuine smarts. (During Peter\u2019s apprenticeship, almost all of the suit\u2019s advanced functions have been turned off by what\u2019s called a Training Wheels Protocol.)For all its quirky wit and distinctive texture, \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d which was photographed by       Salvatore Totino,        comes through with several conventionally spectacular action sequences. One of them is set in a high school homecoming dance. (The movie\u2019s title allows for another interpretation\u2014Spidey\u2019s homecoming to Marvel Studios.) Others grow out of an academic decathlon in Washington, D.C. (Spidey atop the Washington Monument recalls King Kong atop the Empire State Building), and a bifurcated transit of the Staten Island Ferry.The film has its lapses. The story zips along zestfully until a plot development involving Adrian Toomes illustrates how too many interlocking pieces can turn arbitrary, breaking the narrative spell. Product placements for Audi cars are insistent, and shameless. And this production loses its way for a while, just as \u201cWonder Woman\u201d did, in one of those repetitive, out of scale and relentlessly generic climactic battles that seem to be the price one must pay for excellent comic book epics as well as dull ones.Happily, though, the production regains its buoyancy toward the end. (      Michael Giacchino\u2019s       score never for a moment loses its brilliant luster.) The usual evolution in long-running superhero franchises is from thrilling action with a clever edge to bloated action with increasingly toxic doses of self-comment and self-irony. That\u2019s not the case with \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d which is genially aware of itself and terrifically likeable.

And seems to be asking us to take it seriously when the ghost is nothing more than a Halloweenish presence under a white sheet? A serenely poetic filmmaker, as it turns out.       David Lowery       has made a haunting film about, among other more elusive things, a ghost that haunts a bungalow. At first I thought it was odd, then silly, though maybe meant to be droll. I ended up thinking that \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d is deeply affecting, and I won\u2019t forget it for a long time to come.Mr. Lowery\u2019s previous feature, a remake of Disney\u2019s \u201cPete\u2019s Dragon,\u201d was notable for its humanity.

He dies, and goes back to their suburban house to find her, reconnect with her and console her.They don\u2019t have names and don\u2019t need them, for the essence of the film isn\u2019t literal. Rather, it has to do with longing\u2014hers, but also his, after the woman he loves slips away from him and he finds himself not only out of body but adrift in time. I\u2019m afraid of making the film sound pretentious by overdescribing it when the startling thing is how simple it is, and how powerfully it evokes the flow of time. A familiar apparition in a sheet, the ghost is witness to a succession of extraordinary apparitions who, alive and thoroughly human, are working, talking, cooking, homesteading, striving to be remembered and, inevitably, dying.

But the visit also reflects deep changes in India\u2019s domestic politics. Traditional opponents of a closer India-Israel relationship have lost in the court of public opinion.Mr. Modi\u2019s three days in Israel, the first visit ever to the Jewish state by an Indian prime minister, unfolded as a series of carefully choreographed photo-ops designed to emphasize the warmth that exists between New Delhi and Jerusalem. Accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu,        Mr. Modi paid tribute to Holocaust victims and to       Theodor Herzl,        the founder of modern Zionism.The two leaders underlined their common opposition to Islamic terrorism by meeting a 10-year-old Israeli boy whose parents were murdered by Pakistani terrorists during the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which claimed 166 lives. Mr. Modi also traveled to Haifa to honor Indian soldiers who died helping liberate the city during World War I.It\u2019s easy to attribute India\u2019s dramatic shift over the past quarter century\u2014from reflexive support for the Palestinians to an intense partnership with Israel\u2014to changing global circumstances.As the argument goes, the collapse of the Soviet Union led India to warm to Israel, in part as a bridge to the U.S. Common concerns about Islamic terrorism boosted intelligence sharing between the two countries. India\u2019s appetite for high-tech weapons, and Israel\u2019s willingness to sell them, spawned a robust defense-trade relationship. The rise of Bangalore and Tel Aviv as global technology hubs\u2014and their common links with Silicon Valley\u2014deepened commercial ties. The discovery of India by legions of Israeli backpackers decompressing after compulsory military service aided tourism and created mutual goodwill.All this is true enough, but it overlooks a larger point. Mr. Modi\u2019s groundbreaking visit to Israel was possible in part because the Indian prime minister is on the winning side of a debate at home about the Jewish state.The left-leaning leaders of India in the early decades of independence showed no love for Israel. While his country was still a British colony,       Jawaharlal Nehru       opposed the 1917 Balfour declaration in which the British opened the door to a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.Three decades later, after Nehru became prime minister, India opposed the 1948 creation of Israel at the United Nations. New Delhi only recognized the Jewish state in 1950, and didn\u2019t establish full diplomatic relations until more than four decades later.Both international considerations and domestic politics shaped India\u2019s stance. Opposition to Israel gave India a convenient platform for moral grandstanding. It also ensured that New Delhi remained on the right side of the oil-rich Arabs. But behind India\u2019s rhetoric about solidarity with the Palestinians also lay a less high-minded consideration: not running afoul of the orthodox Islamic clerics who claimed to influence the votes of India\u2019s large Muslim minority.Only in 1992, with New Delhi\u2019s foreign policy of nonalignment overtaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union, did India establish full diplomatic relations with Israel.       P.V. Narasimha Rao,        the prime minister at the time, may have belonged to the Congress Party, but he was no member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.Almost immediately, cooperation in defense, agriculture and counterterrorism began to grow dramatically. After the right-of-center Bharatiya Janata Party government took power in 1998, the process only accelerated. In 2003,       Ariel Sharon       became the first (and, so far, only) Israeli prime minister to visit India. But India\u2019s old habit of being overly sensitive to perceived Muslim opinion\u2014there\u2019s little evidence that Indian-Muslim voters care inordinately about this issue\u2014still persisted.Led by       Sonia Gandhi,        Nehru\u2019s granddaughter-in-law, the Congress Party reclaimed power in 2004. That didn\u2019t end cooperation with Israel, but the new government halted its most public aspects. During the party\u2019s 10 years in power, from 2004 to 2014, bilateral visits at the prime ministerial and presidential level between India and Israel were frozen. India didn\u2019t want to forego the benefits of a friendship with Israel, but it didn\u2019t want to flaunt that friendship, either.In hindsight, the Congress Party made a mistake. Many middle-class Indians view Israel not as the neocolonial oppressor of caricature, but as Americans do: A plucky country surrounded by dangerous neighbors that has thrived against the odds.Some are also attracted to Jewish civilization because, like Hinduism, it predates Islam and Christianity. A 2009 survey by the Israeli Foreign Ministry found India to be the most pro-Israel of those countries surveyed, ahead even of the U.S.Close ties with Israel make sense to middle-class Indians. They resent the idea of giving India\u2019s 14% Muslim minority a veto over an important bilateral relationship. The notion of slowing down or underplaying India-Israel ties out of deference to either pan-Islamic sentiment world-wide or domestic Muslim sentiment finds few takers outside India\u2019s rapidly dwindling Left.Mr. Modi appears to have grasped this fact. By publicly embracing Israel\u2014and literally embracing Mr. Netanyahu about a half-dozen times at last count\u2014Mr. Modi has moved India-Israel ties firmly away from the shadows and into the spotlight. This is where they will likely remain.Mr. Dhume is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a columnist for WSJ.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 13:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-gives-israel-a-firm-embrace-1499362125", "news_title": "India Gives Israel a Firm Embrace", "keywords": " benjamin netanyahu, india, international relations,israel, narendra modi, terrorism,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "After             Publicis Groupe        PUBGY 0.55%       announced that it would be pulling out of award shows for a year to fund a new internal communications platform called Marcel, agency staffers expressed their concerns at cocktail parties and on social media.\u201cWhy stay & support your corporation when you\u2019ve made a decision that negatively effects my career for 2+yrs?\u201d tweeted the anonymous account @YngCrtv2017 during a Q&A session last week with Publicis CEO       Arthur Sadoun.Taking a year off from the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and other longstanding events like the Effie Awards is sure to shake more than just a few egos at Publicis. After news of the hiatus, the reaction that rippled across Madison Avenue shed light on how important awards are to creative staffers who value recognition by their peers. But awards can also have an impact on bonuses, client objectives and recruitment prospects, according to industry insiders.For some large marketers, advertising awards are included in key objectives when they\u2019re planning scopes of work with their agencies for the year ahead, according to senior executives at large ad agencies. Award wins add credence to their advertising efforts, which are often expensive and difficult to tie to business results.While it isn\u2019t the number one business priority, \u201cwinning awards in general, and in particular winning at Cannes, has become an ambition and goal for a lot of our clients,\u201d said a senior agency executive. \u201cIt matters to them. It\u2019s something that is talked about inside client organizations.\u201dAnother agency executive said that some large marketers -- up to 20% of the shop\u2019s clients -- count award wins among their marketing goals. While those objectives are incorporated into client agreements with agencies, they\u2019re usually not included in an official contract.Awards can also lead to incentive compensation, such as agency bonuses, but that is \u201cmore the exception than the rule,\u201d the executive said. Still, marketers \u201ctake it seriously as a way to measure the quality of creativity for their brand,\u201d this person said.\u201cSome of those noteworthy awards are great for motivating the team,\u201d said Adrian Parker, vice president of marketing at Patr\u00f3n Spirits Co., which is a Publicis client.Mr. Parker said that while awards aren\u2019t a priority, the brand might consider paying for award submissions on its own next year, if Publicis won\u2019t. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count it out, assuming the work was good and the award was the byproduct of good successes and outcomes,\u201d he said.For large agencies, submitting work in Cannes can cost millions, so cutting back on the festival, among other events, will surely save some pennies that Publicis can reallocate toward building Marcel. The project, which is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars, has been described as an internal communications platform through which the company plans on creating more global collaboration.In an emailed statement, Mr. Sadoun said the pause in participating in awards has sparked beneficial debate about how the ad industry should transform.\u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong: we love awards and the celebration of great creative work,\u201d Mr. Sadoun said. \u201cWe love and celebrate awards, our clients also, and all together we celebrate above all great work that performs.\u201dWinning awards at Cannes may not directly translate to product sales for a lot of brands, but they do have the potential to translate to dollars for some creative agency staffers, whether it\u2019s through a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 boost to help them land a new job or a bonus tied to wins.When looking to fill senior creative roles, nearly all agencies ask for candidates that have won awards, said Anne-Marie Marcus, chief executive of recruitment firm Marcus St. Jean. \u201cIt is one of the rare measurements we have. Of course, as a recruiter, it\u2019s a good thing for me and easier story to tell to my clients.\u201dThere are \u201cnot a lot of ways to measure [creativity] objectively,\u201d she said.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.Ms. Marcus recalls only a few times when awards accounted for a \u201creally serious\u201d calculation of a creative executive\u2019s bonus. Typically, if awards are woven into a bonus agreement, they\u2019re only one of several criteria that determines a bonus amount, she said.An agency incentive program that offers its most senior creative executives points for award wins can lead to bonuses of up to 25% of their annual salary, according to Jay Haines, a founder at recruiting firm Grace Blue.Publicis\u2019s decision also sparked a conversation around the relevance of acclaim for what\u2019s traditionally been considered great creative work\u2014think storied, 30-second ads and longstanding taglines\u2014at a time when ad blocking is on the rise and more advertisers are spending money on new digital advertising formats.Awards are good motivators, but some of the existing awards shows and creatives\u2019 goals are outdated, said Deborah Wahl, former marketing chief for             McDonald\u2019s                   in the U.S.The topic of awards has \u201cbecome an obsession\u201d because \u201cthe whole idea of creativity is being challenged right now,\u201d she said.The focus on data, technology and digital marketing is shifting attention away from \u201cbig creative ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we redefine what a big idea is in the industry, and develop an awards system that recognizes it, instead of feeling it\u2019s threatened and everything is under fire?\u201dFor Ms. Wahl, an Effie award, which measures marketing effectiveness, is more valuable than a Cannes Gold Lion.\u201cIt\u2019s affirming if you do great work and win an award, but the goal has to be building the category [and] the sales revenue,\u201d she said.Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 13:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/advertising-awards-can-boost-more-than-egos-1499361521", "news_title": "Advertising Awards Can Boost More Than Egos", "keywords": "Publicis Groupe,PUB.FR,corporate,industrial news,corporate awards,advertising,marketing,public relations,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "STRAPPED INTO the slim-hipped driver\u2019s seat, my helmet bumping the roof, my heart in my throat, I swung the nose of the pharmaceutical-yellow Ford GT toward the main straight of Le Mans and opened the taps. Destiny.Officially, and for tax purposes, I went to France last month to test this car, the DOT-approved version of Ford\u2019s Le Mans-winning GT, now being built at a rate of one per day by Ford\u2019s assembly partner, Multimatic, in Markham, Ontario. Unofficially, my audience was with la belle circuit: the circus maximus of grandstands, the blind approach to Dunlop Bridge, the Porsche curves, all splitting at speed around me for three whole laps.I\u2019m sorry to say these laps were merely warm, not hot. I had to stay behind a safety car limited to 140 mph, which in the GT felt like following a Bourbon Street funeral procession. Still, this was bucket-list sports tourism. Imagine getting to play pitch-and-putt at Augusta, or plinking grounders from home plate in an empty Yankee Stadium, or excusing yourself from the tour at Churchill Downs to hurl in Eddie Arcaro\u2019s private stall.The car is pretty special, too: a slashing, belt-high fantasy of grilles and glass, a pinup of hips and headlights coming at you at angles you never saw in Euclid. This thing looks like it flew off God\u2019s ax handle.At first you may be blind to all but the spectacular roof buttresses staving off the rear side-pods. The buttresses are one of many design details that turned out to be good for both the race and road car. The arrangement reduces overall form drag (top speed is a whopping 216 mph) by channeling air around the teardrop-shaped fuselage like blood grooves on a sword. The design also aids cooling by positioning the heat exchangers into cleaner airflow.At speed, these buttresses also act like airfoils, generating a bit of downforce while also looking like hell\u2019s kitchen drawer.Deep inside its folded figure is the cause of all the fuss: a production-based 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6, massively boosted to generate 647 hp and 550 lb-ft of torque, blasting creation through high-mounted dual exhaust ports that are always nicely blackened, like the tips of retrorockets. Crackle, Pop? Your ride is here.Let\u2019s just run the checklist: seven-speed dual-clutch rear transaxle; inboard spring-and-damper suspension with hydraulic ride-height adjustment (which, put a pin in it, is the secret to the whole operation); active aerodynamics in the front and rear, including the articulating rear wing/air brake; carbon-ceramic brakes that would stop time.It is rather fast. The following day I was able to take a GT into the French countryside, with Ford executive vice president       Raj Nair       joining me in the narrow cockpit\u2014or conjoined, like Siamese twins. Here and there on two-lane roads, I was able to drift back from the cars I was going to overtake, downshift into 2nd and lean into the GT\u2019s throttle. A blur, a sawtooth roar, a flash of the digital tachometer, and then a thudding upshift like a meat mallet on a thick steak. The GT\u2019s quickness from a standing start\u2014under 3 seconds to 60 mph\u2014is the first act of a much bigger performance drama.And now, dear readers, as we come to the price, please refrain from eating or drinking anything spit-able: $450,000. Ford will limit production to 1,000 cars over four years. That\u2019s right: as in Henry Ford.While it looks like a machine, the Ford GT is actually 100% narrative. From its initial conception, in 2013, as the \u201cPhoenix Project,\u201d the GT was blueprinted to win its class at Le Mans. Management targeted the 2016 race for the big push to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ford\u2019s epic 1-2-3 sweep, with       Carroll Shelby       and the original GT40s.After a pretty horrible 24 hours, a Ford GT did win the GTE Pro class, by the skin of team owner Chip Ganassi\u2019s teeth. In 2017, they weren\u2019t even as lucky as that, quelle dommage.While many sports cars are turned into professional race cars\u2014Porsche 911, Ferrari 488 GTB, Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Chevrolet Corvette\u2014not many purpose-built race cars go the other way. The design compromises are pretty fundamental. For example, in order to minimize the GT\u2019s frontal area\u2014one of the multipliers of aerodynamic drag\u2014the GT\u2019s greenhouse canopy was kept low and narrow, requiring driver and passenger to sit/slump shoulder to shoulder. The seats are molded into the floor, and the pedal box, steering wheel and seat-back adjust to accommodate.Whereas other production sports car must get a roll cage installed, the GT\u2019s carbon-composite safety cell has one already built in, partly explaining the low ceiling.The GT\u2019s very proportions, especially its grandiose nose, are dictated by the slew of radiators required to run Le Mans, around which cars are at wide-open throttle 80% of the time.Talk about an afterthought: The entire cargo capacity amounts to a hatched compartment, built into the rear deck of the car, that\u2019s about the size of a four-slice toaster. Your grand touring better involve a lot of nudity.\u2018If you think the price is high, remember the GT is like getting two cars in one.\u2019Between the 12.8-inch rear tires and the thrumming turbo V6 in the small of your back, the GT\u2019s cabin noise and vibration levels are also pretty vivid. Fortunately, my declining hearing compensated.The key enabler is the car\u2019s two-stage hydraulic ride-height adjustment, and if you think the price is high, just remember it\u2019s like getting two cars in one. At normal ride height, the GT sits on a sophisticated inboard suspension with spring-and-damper sets, an arrangement typical of race cars. In part thanks to its extra long lower suspension arms, the GT\u2019s real-world ride comfort is surprisingly tolerable. But when the driver switches over from Sport to Track, everything changes. The car\u2019s chassis abruptly drops 2 full inches, as hydraulic pistons compress the springs completely. This leaves the torsion bars as the only source of elasticity. The damping gets hard, the road feel gets thrashy, the body roll goes from nil to none.Switching to Normal mode causes the car to jump back up like a Pop-Tart.There was a time when the beau ideal was to drive your sports car to the track, paint numbers on it, go racing and then drive home. It\u2019s been decades since any road car could be really convincing on track against purpose-built race cars\u2014the McLaren F1 and Maserati MC12 come to mind. But in its thoroughly dual nature, its ability to leave public roads and hunker down to speed work with a press of a button, the GT can do this gallant old trick as well as any car I\u2019ve ever driven.For all its blade-running futurism, it\u2019s actually a bit of a throwback.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as '2017 Ford GT: When Performance Tops All.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 13:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/2017-ford-gt-a-450-000-road-rocket-thats-two-cars-in-one-1499360980", "news_title": "2017 Ford GT: A $450,000 Road Rocket That\u2019s Two Cars in One", "keywords": "ford gt,luxury cars,rumble seat,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,reviews,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014      Emmanuel Macron       is one of the best things to happen to the European Union in years. Charismatic, popular and resolutely pro-European, the new French president is leading a backlash against nationalist political forces seeking to undermine the bloc\u2019s institutions.So there is irony in how the EU and its budget rules are shaping up to be a big problem for his agenda. Last week, France\u2019s Court of Auditors said the government deficit would likely be far larger than targets negotiated with officials at the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm and enforcer of the bloc\u2019s budget rules.That gap sets up Mr. Macron\u2019s government for the\u00a0Brussels\u00a0equivalent of a root canal: months of uncomfortable talks with commission officials on France\u2019s budget through 2020.The budget woes are already complicating Mr. Macron\u2019s ambitious plans to remake the French economy, an effort politicians across the bloc are watching closely. Delays to his legislative plans combined with the impact of EU-mandated austerity threaten to sap the political capital Mr. Macron needs to push through difficult overhauls.Brussels\u00a0is wary of undermining Mr. Macron, officials say, knowing the EU has much to lose if the French president\u2019s agenda falters. He has been a forceful advocate of policies that EU officials have long sought to fortify the bloc, such as a budget to backstop the eurozone.\u201cThe new administration is extremely positively viewed in\u00a0Brussels,\u201d said       Zsolt Darvas,        an economist at the Bruegel think tank. \u201cI believe the commission will give Macron a chance.\u201dThe task facing Mr. Macron by the end of this year is to bring the French deficit under 3% of gross domestic product, the threshold for a deficit deemed \u201cexcessive\u201d under the EU treaty. France\u2019s deficit has run above 3% since 2008, when it ballooned in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The commission has shown leniency to Paris several times, most recently in 2015, when it gave the government until this year to bring the deficit below 3%.\u201cNo question of another extension,\u201d EU budget commissioner       Pierre Moscovici       said this week.The audit court estimates this year\u2019s deficit at 3.2%, so the cuts required aren\u2019t huge. Things get much tougher in the following years: The budget plan his predecessor,       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        submitted to the commission targets a deficit of 2.3% in 2018, 1.6% in 2019 and 1.3% in 2020.The pressure from\u00a0Brussels\u00a0is already pushing Mr. Macron to delay a series of planned tax cuts, a centerpiece of his campaign promise to raise French purchasing power and ease the tax burden on businesses.A proposed change to France\u2019s wealth tax, which would cost the government several billion euros a year, is being delayed by a year to 2019, Prime Minister       Edouard Philippe       said this week.Mr. Philippe gave little clarity on another of Mr. Macron\u2019s big tax proposals: eliminating France\u2019s local \u201clodging tax\u201d for 80% of French households. The prime minister said only that he would start talks with local governments on cutting the tax at some point in the next five years; Mr. Macron had promised to do that starting next year.Given the budget mandates from\u00a0Brussels, Mr. Macron\u2019s tax-cut plans will put his government under heavy pressure to make politically sensitive spending cuts, says       Shahin Vall\u00e9e,        an economist who was an aide to Mr. Macron when he was labor minister and advised him during the campaign.\u201cIf you don\u2019t do the tax cuts, it\u2019s OK: It\u2019s tough but it\u2019s doable,\u201d Mr. Vall\u00e9e said. \u201cIf you add tax cuts, you have to finance a bigger amount of expenditure cuts.\u201dEven if it brings its deficit under 3%, France wouldn\u2019t be free of EU budget restrictions. The Fiscal Compact, a treaty sought by Berlin and signed by most EU nations in 2012 during the height of the eurozone crisis, requires governments to bring their \u201cstructural deficit\u201d\u2014a measure of a country\u2019s longer-term fiscal strength\u2014to under 0.5% of GDP.For 2018, commission officials have signaled they are ready to cut Mr. Macron some slack, giving him oxygen to pass his agenda. While the rules call for a high-debt country like France to pass annual cuts worth 0.6% of GDP, a policy announced by the commission in 2015 says the bloc\u2019s budget enforcers could look the other way if the cuts amounted to more than 0.1%\u201cThe interpretation won\u2019t be overly orthodox,\u201d an EU budget official said.Still, Mr. Macron will likely face sustained pressure from Brussels to cut the deficit throughout his five-year term. The commission in May estimated that France\u2019s structural deficit would likely hit 2.3% of GDP and rise to 2.8% of GDP next year without more cuts. That means France is looking at years of austerity to hit the 0.5% target and satisfy the Fiscal Compact.Write to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 13:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-eu-could-hobble-emmanuel-macron-1499360608", "news_title": "How the EU Could Hobble Emmanuel Macron ", "keywords": " eu budget rules,european union, france budget, france deficit, france economy,European Union,Emmanuel Macron,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014It was a gusher few expected. What began as a trickle of U.S. crude being sold to China is turning into a flood, the result of a surprise American glut that has made the country\u2019s oil cheaper than Mideast rivals just two years after Congress lifted a 40-year export ban.China, one of the world\u2019s largest oil importers, bought nearly 100,000 barrels of oil a day from the U.S. in the first five months of 2017\u201410 times the average in 2016. Imports in April and May surged to more than 180,000 barrels a day on average, China customs data show.The shift has been greeted with enthusiasm by American producers, who have been trying to pull the sector out of a three-year price slump that has sapped profits and jobs. Industry executives and local officials are now scrambling to retool ports in the Gulf of Mexico to accommodate the large vessels needed to ship vast quantities of crude around the globe.While still far below the figure China pays its top suppliers\u2014Russia, Saudi Arabia and Angola\u2014the bill for U.S. oil could come in well above $1 billion this year, up from $150 million last year, according to customs data.A confluence of factors has helped open the taps.Falling production from China\u2019s own aging fields has forced the country to step up its hunt for new sources of crude. Imports are up 13% this year through May, compared with a year earlier, according to customs data.The search came as America was opening oil exports in 2015 for the first time in four decades amid a boom in U.S. oil drilling, upending petroleum flows. Political uncertainty in the Middle East, including the decision last month by Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations to cut ties with Qatar, also has played a role.\u201cIf there\u2019s opportunity to buy [oil] from somewhere else, we should,\u201d said       Lin Boqiang,        an energy expert at Xiamen University who has advised Beijing on oil policy. \u201cThe precondition is that it must be economical.\u201dThe economics have tilted in favor of the U.S. partly because of production limits put in place by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which have pushed up the price of benchmark Brent and Dubai oil. At the same time, rising shale production in the U.S. has pushed down the cost of American crude.The new flow offers a bright spot in a U.S.-China relationship racked with challenges, from North Korea to hackers to the South China Sea. At industry conferences in Beijing and Singapore in March, executives from state-owned Chinese trader Unipec hailed a new golden age for energy trade between the two countries. Attendees said the overtly positive message appeared directed at Washington.While much of the focus has been on expanding U.S. natural-gas exports to China, oil may prove another pillar in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China\u2014a key objective of the Trump administration.Unipec\u2019s parent, Sinopec Group, declined to comment on its U.S. imports.The sudden rush of American oil to China could sputter out just as quickly as it began. U.S. crude will need to remain cheaper than rivals\u2019 offerings to make up for the higher cost and longer time frame of transporting oil from the Gulf Coast. It takes an estimated six weeks for oil to reach China from the Gulf, versus three weeks from the Middle East.Because of the long haul to China, larger tankers are needed to boost economies of scale and bring down costs. That requires an upgrade of U.S. ports to allow the biggest tankers, which can ferry 2 million barrels of oil at a time, to load oil directly from the dock instead of transferring it from smaller vessels in the middle of the Gulf.In May,             Occidental Petroleum Corp.docked one such supertanker at its oil terminal along Corpus Christi Bay in Texas for the first time\u2014a prelude to what it hopes will become a routine event. \u201cThis will be a game changer\u201d for U.S. exports, said       Cynthia Walker,        the company\u2019s senior vice president for midstream and marketing operations and development.The Houston-based company says its Gulf Coast terminal accounts for 25% of the U.S. export market. Driven by the growing demand from Asia, total U.S. exports could hit 3 million barrels a day in the next few years, up from around 500,000 barrels a day last year, according to Occidental.But American producers still face the challenge of convincing Chinese refiners that U.S. crude is suitable for their plants, many of which were built to process heavier grades of oil than the shale that is most widely available for export from the U.S. Analysts say one option could be persuading refiners to blend U.S. imports with heavier crude\u2014though such a trial-and-error process could take time to iron out.Middle East oil giants aren\u2019t likely to easily surrender lucrative market share in China, either. Producers such as Saudi Aramco have been looking to reverse declines, for example by seeking investors from China in its planned initial public offering, essentially giving China a vested interest in the kingdom\u2019s future success.On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia reduced the official selling price it charges customers in Asia. The prospect of a continued drop in\u00a0Mideast prices poses the biggest threat to U.S. suppliers\u2019 China dream, as it could erode Beijing\u2019s desire to diversify.\u201cYou don\u2019t get sustainable, exponential increases just because the government said so,\u201d said       Michal Meidan,        a China oil analyst at consulting firm Energy Aspects.Write to Brian Spegele at brian.spegele@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'China Sucks Up U.S. Oil Exports.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 13:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-oil-producers-open-taps-for-chinese-market-1499344246", "news_title": "U.S. Oil Producers Find a Surprise New Market: China", "keywords": " aramco, brent,china oil imports,crude oil, dubai,energy prices,opec,shale oil,u.s. oil exports,Occidental Petroleum,OXY,Saudi Aramco,Sinopec Group,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,natural gas,oil,natural gas midstream operations,oil sands,shale"}, {"content": "Opioid painkillers are prescribed far less often in the U.S. than a few years ago, showing that moves to limit their availability are having a positive effect, federal researchers said in an analysis released Thursday.But the amount of opioids prescribed in 2015 was still more than triple the level in 1999, and varied widely by county, according to the analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014illustrating how ubiquitous the drugs still are.\u201cThis is just the beginning of the dip,\u201d       Anne Schuchat,        the CDC\u2019s acting director, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re at 100 degrees and we\u2019ve gone to 95, but we want to go to 60.

Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of the gizmo? It\u2019s the highest-profile brand of the increasingly pervasive countertop \u201cmulticooker\u201d\u2014combination Crock Pot, pressure cooker, rice maker, electric skillet and yogurt maker.This $99 appliance from the tiny Ontario-based company Double Insight has, in the seven years since its debut, progressed from a niche product modestly popular with Paleo dieters to a viral marketing sensation. At least a half-dozen multicooker-focused cookbooks are slated for publication over the next year. The product sits reliably atop Amazon\u2019s Home and Kitchen bestseller list, and during 2016\u2019s Prime Day\u2014the online retailer\u2019s annual one-day flash sale\u2014it was the biggest-selling item in the U.S. market, in any category, with more than 215,000 units moved on that day alone. On Facebook, a community page dedicated to the brand currently counts more than half a million members.This should be where I tell you the Instant Pot revolutionized my cooking and my life along with it. But that\u2019s not exactly the story. It was midwinter when I unpacked my new toy, and the test spins\u2014my mother-in law\u2019s braciole, a rib-sticking stew, a spicy chili\u2014were successes. Still, a gal, especially one with a taste for seasonal cooking, can only stomach so much braised beef and ranch beans. By the time the trees were in bloom, my Instant Pot was back on the shelf.There the Instant Pot sat until a few weeks ago, when, packing for my family\u2019s annual trip to Cape Cod, I was reminded of an essay the novelist Jhumpa Lahiri once wrote. She made the case that you could cook everything you need during a summer getaway in a single cast-iron pan. Recalling the appliance\u2019s promises of ease\u2014not to mention our un-air-conditioned cabin\u2014I eyed my Instant Pot with fresh curiosity. Into a canvas tote it went, along with a few well-thumbed cookbooks by Jane Grigson, Julia Child and Elizabeth David that have become stalwart seaside references. Could the machine adapt to summer\u2019s lighter fare?On arrival, I eased in with a simple challenge: a batch of hard-boiled eggs for beach snacking. Given the 8 minutes it took for the pot to reach pressure, the process proved no quicker than my usual method. Yet there were upsides: namely, shells that slid off with nary a nick and entirely avoiding the swelter of stovetop boiling. Multicookers keep the heat inside and the kitchen cool.A few days later, I threw a quart of sliced strawberries in with a spoonful of sugar and a splash of vanilla extract and closed the lid. After cooking it for two minutes at high pressure, I had a syrupy compote that thickened as it cooled and made a lovely sight at breakfast, spooned over ricotta toast. (Per the internet, I could have made that ricotta in the Instant Pot, too\u2014but let\u2019s be serious, I was on vacation.)Part of becoming a competent cook is learning to play to strengths and minimize shortcomings\u2014in your ingredients, your equipment, yourself. With a few months of occasional use, I\u2019d begun to understand the Instant Pot\u2019s flaws. Tender veggies like spring peas and petite carrots are obliterated in the intense atmosphere of high-pressure cooking. And because of the intense, moist heat the pot generates and the lack of opportunity for evaporation once the lid is sealed, you can forget about crisped edges. But I appreciate the capacity to saut\u00e9 ingredients in the pot, uncovered, before affixing the lid for a steam or a braise, saving the work of washing another pan. And plenty of delicious, summery dishes don\u2019t require browning. I began to wonder if I\u2019d hamstrung the gadget\u2019s potential by relying so heavily on the economy-focused advice and down-home recipes dispensed on message boards and blogs.So, over one humid weekend in Cape Cod, I staged a final throwdown: preparing an elegant summer supper for visiting friends using nothing but the multicooker and my 1961 edition of Julia Child\u2019s \u201cMastering The Art of French Cooking.\u201d Success, I knew, hinged heavily on canny recipe selection, but I didn\u2019t want to play it totally safe, either. In the end, I settled on a quartet of resolutely summery classics: homard \u00e0 l\u2019Am\u00e9ricaine, ratatouille and soubise (a sweet onion risotto)\u2014plus a fudgy (and gluten-free) g\u00e2teau Reine de Saba to finish it off.To get the goods to the table at the proper temperature and degree of doneness would require me to stagger my cooking. I started a day prior with the cake, which calls for a chill before serving, and continued on with the soubise and the ratatouille, both of which cope well with gentle reheating. The lobster would have to be done, as Julia might put it, \u00e0 la minute.\u201cBaking\u201d inside an Instant Pot required a new technique: pot-in-pot cooking (PIP in the parlance of the message boards). Happily, that turned out to be as straightforward as it sounds, involving nothing more than lowering a small springform pan onto the steaming rack and sealing the Instant Pot for a half-hour session. I\u2019d chosen the Reine de Saba because I suspected its dense, almost puddinglike consistency would be well suited to the steamy climate of the cooker. My hunch was right. Crowned with a cloud of freshly whipped cream and a corona of summer berries, it was a sight to behold.\u2018Recalling the promises of ease\u2014not to mention our un-air-conditioned cabin\u2014I eyed my Instant Pot with fresh curiosity.\u2019The ratatouille and soubise were the menu\u2019s ringers: exactly the sort of succulent, moisture-loving dishes that pressure cooking can improve. The ratatouille\u2019s m\u00e9lange of eggplant emerged from the pot silky and slicked with fragrant, herb-infused oil, and I may never make risotto another way again.That left the lobster. Any recipe that begins with plunging a knife directly into a live animal is liable to give you a case of nerves, and indeed, as showtime approached I felt the panic of wading into uncharted waters. I was buoyed by a comment I read from chef Jo\u00ebl Robuchon that described pressure cooking as a lovely method for lobster. But nowhere on Facebook could I find references to Instant Pot flamb\u00e9ing.Also, no disrespect to Mme. Child, but I\u2019m no tomato-peeling cook. Dispensing with that step\u2014and the flamb\u00e9ing, for safety\u2019s and sanity\u2019s sake\u2014I simply split the lobsters and saut\u00e9ed them in batches before returning them to the pot for a fast, final schvitz in a broth of vermouth, tomatoes and herbs.It was remarkable. I\u2019m sure the dinner I laid on the table a few moments later didn\u2019t resemble anything the engineers at Double Insight had in mind when they were designing their \u201cclosed loop control systems.\u201d Nor was this method exactly what Ms. Child had in mind when she addressed the \u201cservantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines and time schedules.\u201d I was having my (Reine de Saba) cake and eating it, too: With the Instant Pot, this really rather grand meal had come together with minimal sweat, figuratively as well as literally.Will my Instant Pot face many more bouts in this weight class? Probably not. But it\u2019s nice to know how far I can push it. And I\u2019ll never again head to the beach without it.Appeared in the July 8, 2017, print edition as 'Does This Look Instant to You?.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 12:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-the-instant-pot-cook-as-well-as-julia-child-1499359731", "news_title": "Can the Instant Pot Cook as Well as Julia Child?", "keywords": "advanced instant pot recipes,instant pot recipes,instant pot vegetables,multicooker menu,multicooker recipes,summer instant pot recipes,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle"}, {"content": "\u201cFewer small businesses tried to hire in June while slightly more reduced employment,\u201d according to the monthly National Federation of Independent Business jobs survey due out later today. After months of optimistic readings, it seems that allowing the U.S. economy to break out of the slow-growth pattern of the Obama era will require the rewriting of Obama-era laws.\u201cAfter last month\u2019s surge in jobs activity, small business owners seem to be in a holding pattern while they wait to see what Congress will do with taxes and healthcare,\u201d says NFIB CEO       Juanita Duggan.The job surge noted in the May NFIB report was among the best since 2008. But June was another story. \u201cTen percent of owners reported increasing employment, which is down five points from the previous month. Meanwhile, the number of firms reducing employment edged up 2 points to 11 percent\u201d in June, according to NFIB.\u201cHiring activity remains strong by historical standards, but the drop in June was unmistakable,\u201d said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. \u201cWhether this is the start of a negative trend or a one-month blip is something we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on.\u201dLawmakers especially should be keeping an eye on such employment data.

As senators consider a rewrite of the signature legislation of the Obama era, they would be wise to consider today\u2019s disappointing NFIB report and seek to amend the disincentives to job creation embedded in the 2010 law.As for plans for future hiring among the business owners who participate in the NFIB survey, Mr. Dunkelberg reports: \u201cA seasonally adjusted net 15 percent plan to create new jobs, down 3 points. Not seasonally adjusted, 20 percent plan to increase employment at their firm (down 6 points), and 4 percent plan reductions (up 1 point).\u201dHe adds that these disappointing data from NFIB members suggest that Friday\u2019s Department of Labor employment report covering the whole U.S. economy is also likely to be disappointing.What would not be disappointing at all is for Congress to complete its ObamaCare rewrite and proceed to tax cuts.

It was built around 1986 by       Prince Abdulrahman bin Faisal,       son of the late King Faisal and brother of former Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, according to J. M. Little, a Houston attorney who represented the prince at the time.Mr. Little said the prince was involved in commercial real estate in Houston in the 1980s and needed a place to stay while in town. The Faisal family couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. The current owners are Nijad and Zeina Fares, who bought the house in 2007.The contemporary-style main house measures almost 24,000 square feet, Mr. Bering said, with 9 bedrooms plus staff quarters. Renovated by the Fareses, the house has an elevator, a wine room and a dining room that can seat more than 40 people. The master suite includes a sitting room, an exercise room, a sauna and steam room.The roughly 3.1-acre gated compound, with water frontage on Buffalo Bayou, also includes a staff cottage with offices and living quarters. By the pool there is a bar and a gazebo with a hibachi grill. The grounds also include an outdoor pizza oven and a playground the Fareses built for their four children.Nijad Fares is the son of Issam Fares, the former deputy prime minister of Lebanon and head of Wedge Group, a Houston-based international investment firm with interests in real estate, manufacturing and oil field services. Ms. Fares said they are selling because, with their children now starting to leave for college, the house is \u201cstarting to feel too big.\u201d And while the house has been \u201ca wonderful home,\u201d she said, maintaining it is \u201ca lot of work.\u201dShe said the couple will stay in the Houston area but may build a house on a smaller scale.Write to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 12:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/houston-home-built-for-a-prince-asks-20-million-1499359082", "news_title": "Houston Home Built for a Prince Asks $20 Million", "keywords": "buffalo bayou, homes for sale,houston,luxury homes, luxury real estate,nijad fares,prince abdul faisal,river oaks,saudi arabia,zeina fares,Prince Abdul Faisal,political,general news,living,lifestyle,estates,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,construction"}, {"content": "Active time: 10 minutes Total time: 2 hours (includes cooling) Makes: one (7-inch) cake1.

Hobby Lobby will surrender the artifacts, pay a $3 million fine and adopt new procedures for buying cultural property.In a statement posted on its website, the privately held company said its lack of familiarity with the \u201ccomplexities of the acquisitions process\u201d led to some \u201cregrettable mistakes,\u201d including relying on dealers and shippers who, \u201cin hindsight, did not understand the correct way to document and ship these items.\u201dThe aim of the company, which is owned by an evangelical Christian family, was to develop \u201ca collection of historically and religiously important books and artifacts about the Bible,\u201d to preserve and share with the public, the statement said.\u201cOur passion for the Bible continues,\u201d President       Steve Green       wrote, \u201cand we will do all that we can to support the efforts to conserve items that will help illuminate and enhance our understanding of this Great Book.\u201dSince the early 1990s, hundreds of thousands of objects have been looted from archaeological sites in Iraq, with many ending up on the black market and sold to collectors. In the wake of\u00a0the U.S. invasion in 2003, there was widespread looting of Iraqi cultural institutions and archaeological sites. Nearly 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen from the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, officials estimated at the time.The company said it didn\u2019t intend to buy items from Iraq. \u201cAt no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country,\u201d the statement said.Still, prosecutors noted that the transaction was consistent with methods used by importers to \u201cavoid detection and targeting by Customs,\u201d including providing false statements about the value and origin of the goods and sending shipments to different addresses.According to the complaint, Hobby Lobby began to assemble a collection of cultural artifacts, manuscripts and antiquities around 2009.\u00a0Mr. Green and a consultant, who wasn\u2019t identified in the court filings, approved the purchases, the complaint stated.In July 2010, the pair traveled to the U.A.E., where they met with two Israeli antiquities dealers and a dealer from the U.A.E. and examined more than 5,500 artifacts, according to prosecutors. The items included 1,500 tablets etched with an ancient writing system known as cuneiform, 500 cuneiform bricks, 3,000 clay balls imprinted with seals known as bullae, 13 extra-large cuneiform tablets and 500 stone cylinder seals, according to the complaint.Soon after, Hobby Lobby\u2019s in-house counsel hired an expert in cultural property law to advise the company on its planned acquisitions, according to the complaint. The expert spoke with the Israeli dealers about the artifacts and told Hobby Lobby\u2019s lawyer that such a purchase carried \u201cconsiderable risk,\u201d because of their likely provenance in Iraq.Between December 2010 and September 2011, the dealers shipped multiple packages to different addresses affiliated with Hobby Lobby, according to the complaint. Five were detained at             FedEx                   headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., and later seized by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.In seeking the return of those artifacts, Hobby Lobby provided U.S. officials with statements from the dealers that raised questions about the items\u2019 true provenance, according to the complaint.The court filings don\u2019t say where, precisely, the items originated. But in a statement, CBP Special Agent in Charge       Angel M.

If approved, the pact would represent a significant opening of the once heavily protected Japanese market. Japan is seeking to pursue new export opportunities following Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which now has 11 countries.Mr. Trump arrived on Thursday in Hamburg, Germany, for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, where differing views on trade are likely to loom large.With \u20ac125 billion ($142 billion) of exports and imports in 2016, an EU-Japan trade deal would be one of the most significant the bloc has reached. Officials have said it could eventually knock an annual \u20ac1 billion off customs duties.Negotiations have taken four years and significant hurdles remain. Still, leaders on both sides hailed the deal, which they hope will take effect in two years, as a blow to protectionism.\u201cSome are saying the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk said at a media conference.Negotiators must still agree how to resolve disputes that arise after the pact is launched and create a mechanism for protecting investments. Months of work are needed to complete detailed legal texts and ratify any deal in Europe and Japan.Meanwhile, domestic opposition is rising against the pact, which addresses tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, such as regulations.However, negotiators recently resolved some of the thorniest issues, revolving around the auto and dairy industries, helped by top-level political encouragement.Not all details of the deal are completed and public yet, but Japanese auto makers stand to gain from the eventual elimination of import tariffs ranging from 10% to 22%, although a safeguard clause is built in to allow tariffs to snap back if Japan restores non-tariff barriers to European exports. Tokyo would harmonize its regulatory standards with the EU.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the deal \u201ca major pillar in our economic growth under Abenomics,\u201d referring to his domestic economic platform. European companies are expected to see a significant boost in agricultural and food product sales, despite longstanding political sensitivities about the sector in Japan. Tokyo has committed to lift most, but not all, tariffs on key EU exports like pig meat, cheese and wines, although in some cases, the transition periods are as long as 15 years.Before Mr. Abe\u2019s election as prime minister in 2012, Tokyo had shown little interest in free-trade talks with major economic powers, reflecting strong domestic resistance to opening up markets such as agriculture.But as Japan\u2019s economy faced headwinds from persistent deflation, a declining birthrate and an aging population, Mr. Abe looked to improve foreign market access for Japanese companies, as well as seeking competition from imports as a way to drive reform of inefficient industries.Emboldened by a strong mandate for economic reform, Mr. Abe drove Japan\u2019s participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, seen as key to increasing exports to the U.S., Japan\u2019s largest overseas market. Once Mr. Trump abandoned the deal, Japan gave the EU agreement priority. Earlier in 2017, Tokyo dispatched officials to reignite negotiation, with an eye on Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Europe for the G-20 meeting as the finish line.Still, a disagreement over dispute arbitration and protection for investors could derail the pact. Japanese officials were also cautious Thursday about committing to an early-2019 deal, which coincides with Britain\u2019s planned exit from the EU. Japanese officials acknowledged Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc could cause further complications, potentially requiring some renegotiation of low-tariff quotas.Political hurdles are also likely. In Japan, politicians want the government to ensure local producers of pork, wood and dairy products are able to compete against European rivals.European concerns range from preventing the sale of illegal logging products to protecting the car sector. Depending on the final details, the agreement could need ratifying by all 28 member states plus the European Parliament, exposing the agreement to the kind of delays the EU\u2019s Canada trade deal experienced because of opposition in Belgium\u2019s regional Wallonia parliament.Separately Thursday, the EU and Japan issued a statement condemning North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear and ballistic missiles tests. They called for the swift enactment of a new United Nations Security Council resolution restricting Pyongyang\u2019s access to products, technologies and funding for its missile program.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com, Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com and Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Japan, EU Say Trade Deal Fights Protectionism.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 11:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-japan-strike-new-trade-deal-1499338631", "news_title": "Japan, European Union Strike New Trade Deal ", "keywords": "donald trump trade deals,eu,g20,japan,trade,European Union,Trans-Pacific Partnership,Donald Trump,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "IT FELT LIKE a furtive liaison from a vintage film noir. After midnight, downtown Manhattan seemed deserted: I barely saw another soul on the streets as I scurried past the wrought-iron fences of Gramercy Park. When I finally located the awning of the Player\u2019s Club, a stately old mansion on the park\u2019s south side, a hulking doorman looked me up and down before shouldering open the portals.But the moment I stepped inside, my night erupted with music and light. Dapper crowds surged up and down the antique stairs, the men dressed in tuxedos with wingtip collars and bow ties, the women in flapper dresses and cascades of feathers. I squeezed my way beneath glittering chandeliers, past oil paintings of long-gone actors, into wood-paneled rooms where musicians were belting out raucous jazz and blues. Bartenders shook up Gin Rickeys, Sazeracs and Mary Pickfords. The main parlor was packed with swing dancers. I was at a \u201cretro nouveau\u201d Prohibition party, open to anyone who could buy a ticket and a pair of spats or a vintage chemise. The only concession to the 21st century was the absence of smoke.Manhattan\u2019s fascination with the Prohibition era\u2014the period from 1920 to 1933 when the U.S. government issued a nationwide ban on alcohol\u2014seems never-ending. In a city where almost any pleasure is available around the clock, New Yorkers are evidently compelled by a time when fun was forbidden. Those years now inspire a host of parties all over the city evoking the period. For travelers, the events provide access to venues that might otherwise be off-limits, like the members-only Player\u2019s Club (a seasonal soiree hosted by Prohibition Productions), or allow a fresh view of classic New York sites. You can find the Jazz Age Lawn Parties on Governors Island, immersive theater pieces about gangland murders in an old bank in Williamsburg, even swing dance parties on the decks of the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier. Meanwhile, a string of historic speakeasies have been reborn as hopping retro bars.I sidled up to the Players Club bar, ordered a classic Southside (gin, mint, club soda and lemon juice) and decided to immerse myself in all things Prohibition. That 13-year period of official austerity is now recalled as a festive golden age.Although the bright young things in many American cities are fond of \u201820s style, New York rightfully harbors a genuine Prohibition obsession. Jazz was born in New Orleans but thrived in Harlem, along with Swing and acrobatic dance styles like the Lindy Hop. Once, tens of thousand of speakeasies, bars and clubs selling illegal alcohol operated in the city and stories of hidden tunnels, rooms and chutes are part of its folk mythology.Even the classiest New York venues cherish their secrets. After the Player\u2019s Club, I set out to explore an even more storied Prohibition relic, the '21' Club in Midtown Manhattan, where mayors, socialites and famous artists once came for illicit libations. There used to be 37 speakeasies on this block,\u201d said manager Avery Fletcher, as she led me downstairs from the busy bar-restaurant into the kitchen. \u201cIt was the wettest block in town.\u201d Guests had to present a yellow invitation card to \u201cJimmy the Doorman\u201d to gain access to 21, where they would be treated to fine wines and champagne smuggled from Europe. \u201cThere was no moonshine here, so nobody was getting sick.\u201dFor a wide range of Prohibition-era events in New York, check thisweekinswingnyc.wordpress.com. On the high end, the '21' Club has its $42 prix fixe lunch, and if the restaurant isn\u2019t busy, ask your waiter about the secret wine cellar (21club.com).

The New York Hot Jazz Fest celebrates benchmarks like the 100th anniversary of the first jazz record (nyhotjazzfest.com). At William Barnacle Tavern, you\u2019ll find a busted safe in the basement and the Museum of the American Gangster upstairs (museumoftheamericangangster.org). The most imaginative addition to the retro bar scene is BlackTail, near Battery Park (blacktailnyc.com). A bit older but also fun is the Raines Law Room in Chelsea (raineslawroom.com).KGB\u2019s Red Room, in the East Village, hosts live jazz and a monthly absinthe party (redroomnyc.com). Former speakeasy Chumley\u2019s reopened in the West Village last year as an upscale eatery (chumleysnewyork.com). Annual events, worth planning a trip to the city around, include the Jazz Age Lawn Party on Governors Island every summer (jazzagelawnparty.com) and the Great Gatsby Party in the former bank Capitale in darkest winter (thegreatgatsbyparty.com).For a wide range of Prohibition-era events in New York, check thisweekinswingnyc.wordpress.com.With a dramatic flourish, Ms. Fletcher paused in front of a gray-brick wall and produced a menacing 18-inch-long metal skewer. She inserted it into a tiny hole, nearly hidden from the naked eye. With a push, the wall swiveled open to reveal a softly lit cellar, where some 2,000 cases of fine booze were once hidden away. After an FBI raid in 1930 cost the bar a fortune in confiscated liquor, a top architect was hired to design this secret cellar, which remained in use for decades afterward as a stash for celebrities\u2019 wine stocks. It\u2019s now been converted into a private dining room, with labeled bottles once owned by Richard Nixon, Sammy Davis Jr. and Elizabeth Taylor tucked into niches along the walls.\u2018Even the classiest New York venues cherish their secrets.\u2019The '21' Club\u2019s downtown counterpart is the William Barnacle Tavern in the East Village. \u201cWhile the mayor was drinking uptown at the '21' Club, the city councilors were drinking down here,\u201d explained the owner, Lorcan Otway. Al Capone was a regular at the once-bustling underground jazz club, which hosted bands, dancing and all-night cavorting. Though quieter now, it\u2019s just as atmospheric. Mr. Otway, who inherited the bar from his father and wears a vintage three-piece suit, gave me a hard hat so we could clamber through a smuggling tunnel to the bunkerlike basement. There, under a bare bulb, the original safe from the \u201920s sits with its door forced open. He remembers as a child seeing the previous owner remove $2 million from it in gold certificates. Mr. Otway has set up the Museum of the American Gangster upstairs from the bar in homage to the period, when competing Jewish, Italian and Irish gangs roamed the Lower East Side. The two rooms are filled with mobsters\u2019 portraits, grisly photos of corpses riddled with bullets and relics like handmade \u201cautomatic shotguns.\u201d Despite Prohibition\u2019s dark side, he said, it ironically also opened up society, allowing women, for example, to frequent bars for the first time. \u201cIn the 1920s, a lot of people felt disempowered by the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then they realized that beating the law was fun. It\u2019s no surprise that the song \u2018Let\u2019s Misbehave\u2019 was such a hit.\u201dOther Prohibition sites have also returned to their boozy roots. A few blocks from William Barnacle, I dropped by the KGB Red Room, a remodeled art-deco enclave at the top of a creaking set of wooden stairs\u2014apparently, Lucky Luciano ran the Palm Court casino in the same building. In the Red Room, a monthly absinthe party called the Green Fairy was in full swing. As bartenders dripped the potent spirits over sugar, I ran into Don Spiro, the co-founder of Zelda magazine, dedicated to the \u201920s revival. He argued that the Jazz Age is far easier to relate to than previous historical periods. \u201cIt was the first truly recorded history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see pictures of what people looked like, see movies of what they did and hear recordings of how they sounded. We will never hear how Mozart played. But we can hear how Louis Armstrong played trumpet and how Cab Calloway sang, just like it was yesterday.\u201dThe clandestine nature of the era also still appeals: The more furtive the venue, the better, it seems. To visit the Monday night swing party in the Back Room in the Lower East Side, I descended an unmarked stairway, followed an underground passageway to the entrance, where I gave a password (gleaned from a             Facebook                   page) through a grille, before being admitted into a softly lit world of velvet lounge chairs and erotic oil paintings. In the \u201920s, this was the speakeasy \u201cbackroom\u201d of Ratner\u2019s Deli and a hangout for Jewish underworld figures such as Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. Cocktails are still served in tea cups and saucers, as they were in the day.Then Michael Katsobashvili, founder of the New York Hot Jazz Festival, took me to Iguana Restaurant and Dance Lounge, a cheesy-looking Mexican eatery on a generic Midtown street. I began to wonder if success in re-creating the freewheeling spirit of the 1920s depended less on antique locations than on a state of mind\u2014a liberated, improvised creativity that has always infiltrated the city.\u201cThis is a postmodern speakeasy,\u201d the Russian-born impresario assured me. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden in plain sight.\u201d The moment we got upstairs, I saw what he meant. The dozen members of the band Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks were dressed to the nines and blasting jazz through vintage megaphones to a crowd that included comedian Mel Brooks. \u201cWho would imagine a scene like this on top of a Mexican restaurant in Midtown?\u201d said Mr. Katsobashvili. Not me, for one. It was an encouraging thought.

And the U.K. would have more to lose than its partners.\u2019Mr. Barnier said that his British counterpart,       David Davis,        confirmed during their first round of talks last month that the U.K. wants to leave both the single market and the customs union. \u201cI have to work with the U.K. government as it is today and based on what it\u2019s telling me,\u201d he said. Divisions within the U.K. government have emerged in recent weeks on this issue, with Mr. Barnier saying that \u201cwe are prepared for all situations,\u201d in case the British stance changes. A next round of talks is scheduled for July 17 in Brussels.Mr. Barnier also made it clear that there will be no special deal for the British financial sector to keep its so-called passporting arrangement under which thousands of U.K.-based banks are operating in other EU countries. \u201cOn financial services, things are clear: The U.K. leaves the EU and the single market and therefore all financial institutions will lose the financial passporting, automatically, mechanically. There is no discussion and no negotiation on this topic,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.Britain\u2019s top financial regulator, Financial Conduct Authority chief       Andrew Bailey,        in a speech in London Thursday called for \u201ca strong coordination of regulatory institutions\u201d in the U.K. and EU after Brexit to preserve free trade in financial services. His stance was echoed by       John McFarlane,        chairman of British lender             Barclays                   PLC, who said that granting the EU some oversight of London-based financial activity relating to the EU and its common currency after the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal was reasonable.During his public debate Thursday, Mr. Barnier warned that the U.K.\u2019s future relationship will have to address concerns about \u201cregulatory competition,\u201d meaning that standards and regulations ranging from environmental protection to consumer and social rights could be watered down in the U.K. to gain a competitive advantage over the EU. Mr. Barnier said national and regional parliaments on the continent will scrutinize the agreement underpinning the bloc\u2019s future relationship with the U.K. and recalled that a regional parliament in Belgium held up the EU\u2019s free trade deal with Canada due to similar concerns.Mr. Barnier also sought to dispel Mrs. May\u2019s idea that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d which has been recently repeated by her ministers.He explained that in the absence of a Brexit deal, trade between the EU and the U.K. would be based on World Trade Organization rules.\u201cThere would be customs duties of almost 10% on vehicle imports, an average of 19% for alcoholic beverages, and an average of 12% on lamb and fish, for which the vast majority of British exports go to the EU,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.\u201cIn practice, \u2018no deal\u2019 would worsen the \u2018lose-lose\u2019 situation which is bound to result from Brexit. And the U.K. would have more to lose than its partners,\u201d he said.\u201cThat is why we want an agreement. To my British partners I say: a fair deal is far better than no deal,\u201d Mr. Barnier said.He also pushed back against the Brexit stance of Britain\u2019s main opposition Labour Party, which has said it wants to exit from the single market but retain all the benefits of membership. Mr. Barnier said that is not possible.Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       is due to meet Mr. Barnier in Brussels next week. In an interview with Bloomberg LP broadcast Thursday, he said securing tariff-free access to the single market should be a priority in Brexit talks. Mr. Barnier said he is open to meetings with various stakeholders, but that the negotiations will be carried out with the U.K. government.Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe,        speaking at a press conference in Brussels, said he hoped the Brexit negotiations would help ensure predictability in the European economy. He said his government is focused on deepening cooperation between Europe and Japan, as evidenced by Thursday\u2019s announcement of a new EU-Japan trade pact, and that close cooperation between the EU and the U.K. is in Japan\u2019s interests.\u201cWe support strong unity in Europe.

The army said it was searching for \u201cterrorists, weapons and explosives\u201d in the camps, located in the Bekaa Valley town of Arsal, near the Syrian border.The military, which receives millions of dollars in annual U.S. aid, said Tuesday that the four men died of chronic health conditions that worsened after their arrests, without giving any further details about their health issues.Syrian refugees and activists in Arsal and the human rights organization The Working Group for Syrian Detainees alleged this explanation was a coverup. The deceased men\u2019s families couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\u201cIt\u2019s clear they died from torture,\u201d Muhammad Raed, a Syrian activist living in Arsal. \u201cEveryone saw the bodies and the torture marks are evident on their corpses.\u201dLebanese Human Rights Minister Ayman Choucair called for \u201ca transparent investigation into everything that was shared recently from photos and news about the latest arrest operation in Arsal and into the reasons that led to the death of a number of detainees.\u201dAn estimated one fifth of Syrian refugees registered with the United Nations live in camps like the ones that were raided over the past week, with ramshackle shelters made of timber, plywood and tarps. They are frequently threatened with evictions and Lebanese laws that don\u2019t allow them to build more permanent homes.Soldiers regularly raid the camps, arresting men who lack legal residency.The Syrian refugees comprise about a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population, straining the country\u2019s already fragile infrastructure and stoking tensions as they compete for jobs. Lebanon imposes tough restrictions on Syrians\u2019 ability to work or gain legal residency and officials here regularly discuss repatriating them even in the midst of the war.\u201cFrom an economic perspective and a social perspective, the situation is deteriorating,\u201d Dana Sleiman, a spokeswoman with the United Nations refugee agency in Lebanon. She added that 70% are living below the poverty line.Living in the tent camps offers little protection from the elements or from disaster. On Sunday, a fire broke out in the Qab Elias camp in the Bekaa Valley, jumping so quickly from tent to tent that residents said they ran out without shoes. In the chaos, they grabbed any child nearby as they fled the growing blaze, unsure of where their own children were.Within an hour, flames destroyed the entire encampment and a 2-year-old girl was dead. Two days later, a second fire broke out at another refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley, killing a 4-year-old girl.The tarps distributed by U.N. refugee agency are treated with a flame retardant chemical but few tents appear to have them. Most are swathed in plastic banners advertising everything from 12-year-old whiskey to scratch-resistant kitchenware to American movies. Next to the banners, garbage piles up and flies swarm.\u201cThings are not getting better,\u201d said Josep Zapater, who heads the UNHCR office in the Bekaa Valley.On Tuesday, residents of Qab Elias watched as workers laid a new foundation of gravel and unloaded timber and tarps for new shelters to replace the more than 170 that burned down. Before the charred detritus was cleared away, residents were given an hour to pick through the rubble. But little could be salvaged.\u201cOur money, our passports, our ID cards and our family books, all of it is gone,\u201d said Hannah Ahmad Ibrahim, 19, who got married four months ago. She tried searching for the jewelry she wore on her wedding\u2014three gold rings, a necklace and earrings\u2014but she said they were lost.\u201cI barely escaped with just myself,\u201d she said.Human Rights Watch called for a transparent and independent investigation into the deaths of the four refugees after the army said \u201cthe health condition of the detainees deteriorated\u201d while in custody.The mayor of Arsal said the municipality helped transfer the bodies back to their families, who took photos before they buried them and posted them online. The images show bruised and bloodied corpses.\u201cThe army acknowledged not one but four deaths in custody without revealing the chain of events that led to these deaths,\u201d said Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cIn case of wrongdoing, those responsible for the deaths should be held accountable.\u201dWrite to Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Syrian Deaths Spotlight Crisis in Lebanon.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 11:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrian-refugee-deaths-reflect-crisis-in-lebanon-1499353881", "news_title": "Syrian Refugee Deaths Point to Crisis in Lebanon", "keywords": " displaced people, isis, lebanon, middle east war, refugee camps,refugees, syria, war,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,armed forces,human rights,civil liberties,migration,politics,international relations,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "KARA MANN has a reputation as something of a sparkplug in the design world, capable of juicing up a tired setting or a well-known brand with a series of unexpected moves, often carried out in high-contrast black and white. Her clients have included the Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan\u2014where her proposed redesign honored the building\u2019s decadent past with ingredients like leather and leopard\u2014and the newly reopened Talbott Hotel, on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast, into whose sparely furnished guest rooms she introduced leggy bedside tables of smoke-colored marble and rust sofas trimmed in bullion fringe.All of this re-energizing can be exhausting, and in 2015 Ms. Mann, who maintains offices in New York and Chicago, went looking for a place to unwind. On the website Circa Old Houses, she found it: a four-bedroom, 1790s farmhouse in Connecticut\u2019s Litchfield County. Well-proportioned and in turnkey condition, it would come together overnight, she assumed\u2014until she started decorating.\u201cI thought I was going super modern on the interior,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut the original details of the house came through and the tension was just too strong. Everything wasn\u2019t blending. I told my office, \u2018I need to hire a designer!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Instead, she unraveled her overly contemporary scheme for the house and wove in a more polyglot range of furnishings that, though updated in terms of palette and materials, evoke 18th-century antiques\u2014upright sofas, blocky trunks and chests, small-scale tables with some height.\u2018\u2018I thought I was going super modern, but the house\u2019s original details came through and the tension was too strong.\u2019\u2019The living room\u2019s center table, for instance, whose proportions mimic a blanket chest, is made of cola-colored cast glass and wood; a white-painted four-poster in the master bedroom is a relatively minimalist take on a mahogany pencil-post.Thanks to such subtle substitutions, the rooms retain the historic charm that made them so appealing in the first place. A full year into the project, said Ms. Mann, \u201cI realized I was creating a new version of my aesthetic, which can be a little rock-\u2019n\u2019-roll, that would feel comfortable in the country.\u201dIn decorating a 1790s farmhouse in Litchfield County, Conn., designer Kara Mann chose furnishings that reference early American antiques in purpose and scale, and don\u2019t contrast too strongly with the home\u2019s 18th-century details. At first the designer installed a curvy black sofa in this sitting room but felt it struck an overly loud note, so she opted instead for furnishings in textured, restorative neutrals, restricting her high-contrast gestures to a single inky chair. \u201cI love the fur stool,\u201d she said of the sheepskin seating from Coup D\u2019Etat in San Francisco. \u201cIt feels like an animal, and it balances the visual weight of the chinoiserie armoire.\u201d The Moroccan Tuareg mat and vintage cast-glass and wood coffee table add texture without introducing too-exuberant colors. On the wall: a Yoshitomo Nara drawing saucily riffs on Ms. Mann\u2019s new persona.\u201cThis room is really about the original granite fireplace,\u201d said Ms. Mann of the combined dining/living room. A 72-inch round table parked next to the fireplace alludes to a time when families gathered around the hearth for warmth and light. The designer refinished petite antique Windsor-style chairs from Liza Laserow in New York with an emphatic black stain to amp up their drama, satisfying her taste for contrast by pairing them with a traditional white linen tablecloth (\u201clike a beautiful dress, pretty and soft\u201d). When the rustic candlesticks on the mantelpiece\u2014reproductions from the website Food52\u2014go onto the table next to the chairs\u2019 spindles, the result is a chorus of delicate vertical lines, traditional and contemporary at once.Architectural alterations in the kitchen yielded a combination of high-performance workspace and unembellished refectory. Ms. Mann kept the black granite counters and hulking range but removed a window seat (\u201ctoo country\u201d) and added windows at one end. She also replaced an overhead beam housing downlights with dimmable globe pendants to simplify the ceiling. Ms. Mann held on to the earthy brick floor but softened it with an antique Khotan carpet, the room\u2019s one busy pattern. A work table that runs the length of the room is by Belgian fashion designer Ann Demeulemeester, who gives the classic American form a twist by covering its surface with gessoed canvas. Equally sober-yet-stylish chairs by Peg Woodworking in New York City flank the table. \u201cThey\u2019re like macram\u00e9 but on a strict steel frame,\u201d said Ms. Mann.Introducing a note of softness and romance, the master bedroom is all about decorative details that play off the austere geometry of the space. A custom-made bed by H2L Design, in Clifton, N.J., offers a reductive take on the traditional pencil-post style; its frilly Shabby Chic spread avoids grannydom in pure white, part of a mostly neutral palette that extends to the white sisal underfoot. The rose-toned antique carpet echoes the flouncy attitude of a Victorian wicker armchair from Pavilion Antiques, in Chicago, that draws the eye out into the hall like a piece of sculpture\u2014and continues the hard-soft conversation already under way inside. Ms. Mann hung a single curtain panel of Rogers & Goffigon\u2019s Edelweiss wool like a gown in the window: \u201cIt kind of dissolves in the light,\u201d she said.Ms. Mann discovered that overtly contemporary furnishings fought with the home\u2019s original elements such as the raised-panel wainscoting and wide-plank floors in this guest bedroom. So she subverted the 18th-century quaintness subtly, in this case with a high-gloss black rattan side table from New York City furniture dealer Michael Bargo. Its hard edges and modern stance contrast unpredictably with the elegant 1940s-vintage swan-motif bed. Bare windows and Benjamin Moore\u2019s China White paint contribute to the room\u2019s monastic simplicity. Said Ms. Mann of the paint color, \u201cIt\u2019s ethereal, with a little gray in it.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 11:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-farmhouse-reborn-with-anti-quaint-decor-1499353819", "news_title": "A Farmhouse Reborn With Anti-Quaint D\u00e9cor", "keywords": "country decor,country house,hotel chelsea,kara mann,political,general news,real estate,property,hotels,restaurants,construction,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "With three children\u2014ages 13 to 27\u2014and three exuberant dogs, it is little wonder that Caroline and Martin Cruddace occasionally feel the need to seek a little sanctuary. So when renovating a rundown Edwardian villa in London, they made creating a calm, private \u201capartment\u201d to escape the domestic maelstrom central to their plans.The Cruddaces bought their 3,065-square-foot house in the north London neighborhood of Highgate in 2011 for \u00a31.875 million, or $2.43 million. When they moved in with Mrs. Cruddace\u2019s two sons, Josh and Harry Hogan, now 27 and 21, and their daughter Amelie, now 13, it had a cramped living room and kitchen in the dark basement. There were nine bedrooms on the floors above. \u201cIt was not an easy house to live in,\u201d said Mrs. Cruddace, an artist and photographer.A friend Mrs. Cruddace had met through the children\u2019s schools, the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, recommended her (then) brother-in-law Alexander Martin, founder of Alexander Martin Architects, to help with the redesign.Key to the design was giving the grown-ups some space of their own. \u201cWe have a lot of the kids\u2019 friends over; we are a family which loves parties and entertaining,\u201d said Mrs. Cruddace.Mr. Martin\u2019s solution was to demolish the double garage, which stood beside the main house and build a three-story wing in its place. Its ground floor would feature a large, modern kitchen with folding-glass doors that lead directly to a back patio. Above would be a split-level master suite with a bathroom, dressing room, yoga room, bedroom and terrace.The original part of the house could then be reconfigured with a living room and dining room, and six bedrooms. The basement, once the main communal area, now contains a utility room and TV room.Work on the yearlong project began in 2014. The family lived in the house while the garage was demolished and the new wing built. Halfway through, however, the chaos became too much for Mrs. Cruddace and she, Amelie and the dogs decamped to the family\u2019s vacation home in Devon. \u201cIt was insanity,\u201d she said.Once the structure of the house was in place, designing the interiors could begin. The older section reflects Caroline\u2019s eclectic, colorful tastes and affection for vintage and industrial style. The new section embodies Mr. Martin\u2019s more austere vision of clean lines and a restricted, natural palette.In the basement TV room, for example, Caroline opted to paint the walls a deep, charcoal blue, giving the room a clubbish, intimate feel with velvety mustard-yellow sofas.Demolition, structural work: $355,700Electrical, plumbing: $78,000Flooring: $32,300Kitchen: $39,000Bathrooms: $97,000Windows: $32,300Woodwork, floating staircase: $55,000Decor: $56,000Landscaping: $78,000Professional fees: $103,000Value-added tax: $185,000TOTAL: $1.1 millionBy contrast the new kitchen is lofty and light, with high ceilings and views of the front and backyards. Ceramic floor tiles are pale, and the cabinetry is painted off white. Almost the only splashes of color are the denim-blue kitchen island and orange seat cushions.The master bedroom suite is where Mr. Martin\u2019s taste coexists with that of his client (Mr. Cruddace admits he left all design decisions to his wife). A luxuriously large bathroom and a yoga studio take up most of the lower level. An elegantly minimal floating staircase leads to the bedroom, furnished with only a bed, side tables, and a chair. The palette is entirely neutral, but a little color finds its way onto the terrace in the form of retro turquoise chairs.All three children have bedrooms in the original house, and Amelie\u2019s passion for horses is reflected in the wallpaper featuring a herd of grays. Fairy lights and a princess dressing table keep things suitably girly. Caroline also had some fun with the spare rooms\u2014one has wallpaper printed with tiny, vividly colored birds\u2014and her own office for which she mixed the shade of vivid turquoise herself.This project added 840 square feet to the house and cost about $1.1 million. The couple is sanguine about the cost, partly because they have no intention of selling and partly because renovated homes in their neighborhood routinely sell for $2.5 million to $3.9 million.Today Mr. Cruddace, who is the chief executive of leisure company Arena Racing Co., says he is glad he has had the experience of renovating a house but wouldn\u2019t want to do it again.His wife, on the other hand, glows at the idea of taking on a new project. \u201cI would love, love to do another house.

The minutes of the ECB\u2019s June meeting, published Thursday, show policy makers increasingly confident in the growth outlook and perplexed why stocks, but not bonds, reflected that in their pricing.The minutes show policy makers also wondering if they should change their guidance on bond purchases, which still suggests the ECB stands ready to buy more bonds if needed. In the end they decided only to change the guidance on interest rates, dropping a reference to the possibility of rates going lower. But further steps, including scaling back the commitment to bond purchases, could clearly be in the cards, although the ECB remains worried that \u201ceven small and incremental changes in the communication could be misperceived.\u201dThat sums up the challenge for the second half of the year.

But Mr. Anikeev was described by the official Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper as the ringleader of Shaltai Boltai, a group that claimed credit for hacking the computers, tablets and smartphones of senior Russian officials.According to Rossiiskaya Gazeta, he reached a plea deal with prosecutors in the case. Khazret Bizhoyev, a lawyer for Mr. Anikeev, said his client was \u201cpleased\u201d with the sentence and had not decided whether to appeal, as he would soon be eligible for parole.Shaltai Boltai, which means Humpty Dumpty in Russian, earned notoriety for breaking into a least one of Russian Prime Minister       Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s       electronic devices and taking control of his             Twitter                   account in 2014.

Facebook hopes that the measured neural activity could tell it what people are thinking.It\u2019s just a short jump from there to being able to directly interface with another person\u2019s brain. Love-smitten young men playing way out of their league wouldn\u2019t need to risk embarrassment by going down on their knees and begging for their girlfriend\u2019s hand in marriage. They would already know that she was going to say, \u201cForget it.\u201d Catchers would no longer have to put down two fingers between their legs to call for a curve or a forkball; brain waves would do all of it.Similarly, Amazon would benefit enormously.

This generation hates talking on the phone, preferring to use online chat or texting. Recruiters are even starting to conduct job interviews via text. Telepathy would take that one step further. By interviewing for a job telepathically, millennials wouldn\u2019t even have to type.Here\u2019s how it would work. A candidate would beam to a recruiter the thought, \u201cI am a passionate, talented person with a Ph.D. in astrophysics who speaks nine languages and is willing to work for next to nothing to get my foot in the door at your out-of-the-way taco stand.\u201dTo which the recruiter might reply: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay any health benefits, have no 401(k) plan and expect you to work 90 hours a week.

Too many simultaneous telepathic messages could fry the brain, inducing the recipient to short the wrong stock or amputate the wrong toe.

The high output reflects Saudi Arabia\u2019s focus last year on building and defending market share, a strategy it has pulled back from.Saudi Arabia is set to publicly list 5% or less of Aramco in 2018 in the hope of raising tens of billions of dollars. The kingdom\u2019s powerful crown prince,       Mohammed bin Salman,        has pledged to invest much of the proceeds in economic diversification, boosting Saudi Arabia\u2019s technological and industrial sectors and reducing its reliance on oil revenues.Aramco has pulled back its output to less than 10 million barrels a day this year as Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut oil production. Their hope is to bring a vast global oversupply of crude back in line with demand and thus raise petroleum prices, which remain below       $50 a barrel      \u2014less than half their level three years ago.Saudi Arabian officials have said the production cut was intended to put a floor under oil prices ahead of the Aramco IPO, the value of which will be determined in part by the direction of the oil market.In its annual report, published Thursday, Aramco offered a look at another key metric for its IPO: the massive crude oil reserves it manages for the kingdom.Aramco\u2019s recoverable crude oil and condensate reserves slipped to 260.8 billion barrels at the end of 2016 from 261.1 billion a year earlier. Considering that it pumped over 3.8 billion barrels of oil in 2016, the small slip in reserves suggests that Aramco made strides in either discovering new oil or making current wells more efficient.Saudi oil reserves have remained at around 260 billion barrels for decades. Saudi officials say independent analysts will confirm Aramco\u2019s reserves ahead of the IPO.Aramco\u2019s gas reserves rose to 298.7 trillion standard cubic feet from 297.6 trillion, while natural gas production increased to 12 billion standard cubic feet a day from 11.6 billion standard cubic feet.The company said it had discovered two new oil fields, Jubah and Sahaban, and one new gas field, Hadidah, all in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province.\u201cThis past year, Saudi Aramco leveraged its capabilities, talent, innovation and fiscal discipline to ensure resilience and realize landmark achievements, including record high rates of crude oil production,\u201d       Khalid al-Falih,        Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister and Aramco\u2019s chairman, said in the report. \u201cAll of this was achieved against the backdrop of persistently low oil prices and a weak global economy.\u201dWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 10:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-crude-production-at-all-time-high-in-2016-1499352070", "news_title": "Aramco Crude Production at All-Time High in 2016 ", "keywords": " aramco ipo, crude oil prices, oil production,saudi aramco, saudi oil, saudi oil production,Saudi Arabian Oil,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Khalid al-Falih,Mohammed bin Salman,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,output,production,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,industrial production,economic news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,energy asset class news,energy,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,natural gas,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Federal Reserve governor       Jerome Powell       on\u00a0Thursday\u00a0said there is an urgent need for Congress to overhaul the housing finance system, echoing calls by some lawmakers to pull the nation\u2019s mortgage-finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, out of government conservatorship.The Fed\u2019s regulatory point person, Mr. Powell called for Congress to look at ways to encourage private capital into Fannie and Freddie, companies that support U.S. mortgage lending, to avoid another taxpayer bailout seen during the financial crisis.

Mr. Powell said his remarks weren\u2019t meant to support any specific proposal but cautioned about a suggestion to create some form of additional government reserve.\u201cIf Congress chooses to go in this direction, any such guarantee should be explicit and transparent, and should apply to securities, not to institutions,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThe reality is that the economy needs Fannie and Freddie...So there is likely still an incentive to preserve the GSE business if one of them goes bust.\u201dHe added that the Federal Reserve is\u00a0near completion of a comprehensive program that would raise standards for most systemically important banks.Write to Rachel Witkowski at rachel.witkowski@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Governor Urges Housing-Finance Fix.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 10:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-says-housing-finance-system-needs-an-overhaul-1499351544", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Powell Says Housing Finance System Needs an Overhaul", "keywords": "American Enterprise Institute,The Fed,Fannie Mae,Freddie Mac,Jerome Powell,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,mortgage planning,trends,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,real estate,property,credit types,services,mortgages,real estate credit,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Donald Trump       thinks of himself as a great judge of character and master deal-maker, and that could be a dangerous combination when the President meets with       Vladimir Putin       for the first time Friday during the G-20 meeting in Germany. The Russian strongman respects only strength, not charm, which is what Mr. Trump will have to show if he wants to help U.S. interests abroad and his own at home.The meeting comes amid the various probes of Russian meddling into the 2016 election, and Mr. Trump\u2019s curious refusal to denounce it. There\u2019s no evidence of Trump-Russia campaign collusion, nor that Russian interference influenced the result. But the Kremlin\u2019s attempt was a deliberate affront to democracy and it has done considerable harm to Mr. Trump\u2019s Presidency. Mr. Trump should be angry at Mr. Putin on America\u2019s behalf, and his apparent insouciance has played into Democratic hands.The irony is that on policy Mr. Trump has been tougher on Mr. Putin than either of his two predecessors. Over Kremlin objections, the U.S. President has endorsed Montenegro\u2019s entry into NATO and new NATO combat deployments in Eastern Europe. He has approved military action against Russian ally       Bashar Assad       in Syria even after Russian threats of retaliation.The White House was also wise to visit Poland a day before he meets Mr. Putin. In Warsaw on Thursday he can reinforce traditional American support for Polish freedom and assert his personal and public support for NATO\u2019s Article 5 that an attack on one alliance member is an attack on all.Perhaps most important, Mr. Trump has unleashed U.S. oil and gas production that has the potential to weaken Mr. Putin at home and in Europe. The Russian strongman needs high oil prices and wields the leverage of natural-gas supplies over Europe, and U.S. production undermines both.Yet Mr. Putin will be looking to see if he can leverage Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for better U.S.-Russia relations to gain unilateral concessions. One Kremlin priority is easing Western sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine and President       Obama\u2019s       December 2016 sanctions for its election interference. The Russian foreign ministry is in particular demanding that the U.S. let Russia reopen compounds in Maryland and New York that Mr. Obama shut down.Mr. Trump will be tempted to oblige because the compounds are ultimately of no great consequence, but the political symbolism of reopening them would still be damaging if the President gets nothing in return. Mr. Putin still denies any Russian election hacking, and to adapt Michael Corleone\u2019s line to Carlo in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d he should stop lying because it insults our intelligence. Mr. Trump should at least follow French President       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       precedent and issue a face-to-face public rebuke unless Mr. Putin apologizes.Mr. Putin, the former KGB man, concluded early that Barack Obama could be pushed around because he bent to the Russian\u2019s demands on nuclear arms and missile defenses in Europe. This week he\u2019ll be looking to take Mr. Trump\u2019s measure.The American can quickly show he\u2019s not Mr. Obama by suggesting he\u2019ll sell lethal military aid to Ukraine if Mr. Putin refuses to implement the Minsk accords that call for defusing the military conflict. Mr. Putin knew he could get away with violating Minsk because he judged, correctly, that Mr. Obama would never risk confrontation.Mr. Trump says he wants good relations with Russia, but the question as always in foreign affairs is on what terms? Mr. Putin wants to push the U.S. out of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and he will be looking to exploit any presidential weakness toward that goal. No single meeting will determine the Trump-Putin relationship over four years, but first impressions matter. Mr. Trump will have a better chance at a better relationship if he shows Mr. Putin that the price of improved ties is better Russian behavior.Appeared in the July 6, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 10:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-putin-test-1499297568", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Putin Test", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,editorials"}, {"content": "A sprawling estate on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, where hillside homes are connected to each other by two glass funiculars on heated tracks, is on the market with an asking price of $75 million.Known as Crystal Pointe, the 5.14-acre waterfront property in Crystal Bay, Nev., has 525 feet of lake frontage. Between the main house, guesthouse, beach house and caretaker\u2019s apartment there are 16,232 square feet of living space, eight bedrooms and 13 fireplaces.The sellers are Stuart and Geri Yount. Mr. Yount, 68, is the chairman and CEO of Fortifiber, a family owned business that his father started in 1939 which manufactures building products.The Younts said they bought the land in 1994 and spent five years building the main house, which was designed to fit into the terrain. Mrs. Yount, 68, said she determined the color palette from sticks and stones on the property; some bright white colored-granite boulders were painted to match more weathered counterparts.The couple said they finished building the beach house, a two-bedroom guesthouse closest to the water, last July. It took 10 years and two months to get the permits, and construction took another 2\u00bd years, they said. There is no road access to the beach house, so all the materials had to be brought in by barge or helicopter; it is accessible via stairs or the funicular.Tucked into the landscaping are a collection of animal statues that come with the home.

The retitling of \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d fooled Nielsen\u2019s automated system, which listed \u201cNitely\u201d as a separate show.Hiding the May 26 program from Nielsen dramatically improved the show\u2019s average viewership that week. Instead of falling further behind first-place rival \u201cABC World News Tonight,\u201d NBC news narrowed the gap.Walt Disney Co.\u2019s       ABC declined to comment. The network, though, groused last month when NBC News intentionally misspelled an entire week of \u201cNightly News\u201d broadcasts. Altogether, NBC, which is ranked second behind ABC in ratings, has played the misspell card 14 times since the start of the 2016-17 television season last fall.NBC News said it broke no rules. \u201cAs is standard industry practice, our broadcast is retitled when there are pre-emptions and inconsistencies or irregularities in the schedule, which can include holiday weekends and special sporting events,\u201d a show spokesman said.The network needn\u2019t feel defensive. ABC took its own ratings mulligan seven times during the 2016-17 season with \u201cWrld New Tonite.\u201d             CBS                   misspelled \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d as the \u201cCBS Evening Nws\u201d 12 times this season.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of gamesmanship,\u201d said Bill Carroll, a veteran TV industry consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a practice that happens with a wink and a nod.\u201dNielsen projects viewer ratings based on a panel of more than 40,000 homes and 100,000 people. Higher ratings help networks sell commercial time at higher rates. The network misspellings fudge that calculation, and some advertisers say the trick is getting overused.\u201cNetworks never used to do this,\u201d said Billie Gold, director of programming at ad giant             Dentsu Inc.       Now, she said, it has become the norm.TV news executives say the higher numbers gathered from show misspellings are used only for publicity purposes, and that accurate ratings for the missing broadcasts are readily available to advertisers.Ms. Gold and other ad executives say they are frustrated with the detective work required to kick the tires on network viewer ratings. She said her clients are surprised by the difference between the number of eyeballs the networks claim and Ms. Gold\u2019s tally, which accounts for the altered titles.\u201cWhen people ask us why our estimates are so much lower than what they see,\u201d she said. \u201cWe explain the situation, and they have their \u2018ah-ha\u2019 moment.\u201dFaced with complaints that title typos have grown from a trickle to a torrent, Nielsen plans to hold a meeting about it next week for TV industry representatives.\u201cIf we find a network working in contrast to this agreed-upon policy, we address the issue in a direct fashion as a way to maintain fairness and balance for all of our clients and the industry as a whole,\u201d Nielsen said.Nielsen has long had a so-called tilting rule that allows TV networks to fiddle with programs for special circumstances. For years, tilting was used sparingly, reserved primarily for Christmas and Thanksgiving or if a show was pre-empted in parts of the U.S. for a live sports event.Misspelling isn\u2019t the only network trick. CBS boasted that its legal drama \u201cBull\u201d was the most-watched new show of the just-finished TV season. Typically, a show\u2019s viewership is calculated using the ratings of both first-run and repeated episodes, which are labeled \u201cR\u201d or \u201crepeat.\u201dWhen CBS submitted its schedule to Nielsen, however, it labeled reruns of \u201cBull\u201d as an \u201cencore.\u201d The ratings service categorized it as a different show and didn\u2019t factor the rerun into the show\u2019s season average.\u201cThat\u2019s bull,\u201d cracked Brad Adgate, a longtime ad executive who studies TV ratings. For advertisers, the network sleight-of-hand is a pain in the neck, he said: \u201cYou have to pay a little more attention if you want do an analysis.\u201dA CBS spokesman declined to comment.Another ratings game involves the calculated placement of national TV commercials. NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d typically loads all of its national commercials in the first hour of the 90-minute show. Since Nielsen counts viewers of a show only through the last network commercial break, the ratings service ignores SNL\u2019s last half-hour, when viewers generally turn away.Sometimes networks sneak in a second airing of a show and add the additional viewers to tally of the original telecast and hope no one notices.NBC in 2015 persuaded almost a dozen of its local TV station affiliates to rerun \u201cNightly News\u201d after 2 a.m. At the time, NBC said, it was focused \u201con ways to reach our audience when and how they want to be reached.\u201dA rival network thought otherwise and alerted NBC advertisers to the practice. After learning of the stunt, many advertisers cried foul. They told NBC whoever was watching the newscast at that hour wasn\u2019t the kind of consumer they wanted to reach. NBC said it quickly discontinued the practice.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 10:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-tv-ratings-game-networks-try-to-dissguys-bad-newz-from-nielsen-1499350955", "news_title": "In TV Ratings Game, Networks Try to Dissguys Bad Newz from Nielsen   ", "keywords": "nbc nitely news,nielsen ratings,tilting,top-rated tv shows,tv advertising,tv news broadcasts,tv ratings,marketing,markets,advertising networks,advertising spending,corporate,industrial news,social media marketing,advertising,political,general news,arts,entertainment,television,radio,page-one stories,broadcasting,television broadcasting,cable broadcasting,public relations,business,consumer services,media"}, {"content": "Ryan O\u2019Donnell is founding partner at O\u2019Donnell Group in Chico, Calif. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.When it comes to long-term financial goals, most clients have the same priorities: funding their retirement and paying for their children\u2019s college education. Most financial plans attempt to save for both of those goals in tandem. It\u2019s the approach we were taught and one that my firm subscribed to for years.Recently, however, my firm\u2019s work with medical professionals has raised a number of questions about the validity of that strategy. Namely, could some of our clients be better off not saving for college at all?Here are the findings.While clients who work in the medical field have their earning potential as a powerful long-term asset, the majority of those clients come out of residency in their early 30s, vastly limiting the time they have to save for retirement. Therefore, they need to save more money each year and invest it more aggressively than someone with a longer timeline. Splitting their available savings between retirement and another goal, like college, makes the task even more challenging.Let\u2019s say that a client has $43,000 available to save each year\u2014an amount equal to a projected annual cost of tuition in the future. The traditional approach might have them put aside $7,500 annually for college and the remaining $35,500 for retirement. After 18 years of saving (with a 5.6% average rate of return) they will have paid for college and they can then begin save the full $43,000 annually for themselves.The issue with that approach is that the client loses out on much of the benefit of nearly two decades of compounding interest. The money that he or she has been socking away in a relatively conservative \u201c529\u201d college-savings plan could have been working harder in a retirement account. Assuming an average 7.4% rate of return (based on returns in a moderate lifestyle portfolio) a client who saved the full $43,000 a year in their retirement account would have amassed an additional $350,000 after those 18 years.When it comes time for college, that client could simply use the $43,000 in annual cash flow to pay for tuition. Even during those years of college when the client isn\u2019t contributing to retirement, the interest earned on the fuller savings is still working. In fact, at age 65\u2014assuming that the client resumes saving once college is complete, and he or she continues to receive that 7.4% rate of return on their accounts\u2014this client will still have $550,000 more retirement savings than the client who saved for school.The risk inherent in this approach is job security\u2014the danger that a client loses his or her income stream during the college years. However, even that worst-case scenario would increase the financial-aid options available to the child and still help make college a reality.While this kind of strategy could work for any client, it isn\u2019t necessarily for everyone. Some clients insist on saving for college and that is their prerogative. However, there\u2019s always value in presenting an alternative possibility.", "news_time": "2017-07-06 10:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-conventional-wisdom-on-saving-for-retirement-and-school-1499350284", "news_title": "Rethinking Conventional Wisdom on Saving for Retirement and School", "keywords": "political,general news,education,personal finance,retirement planning,university,college,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "With social, ethical and environmental issues prominent in the national dialogue, the investment strategy known as sustainable investing continues to grow.It goes by many other names: ethical investing, socially responsible investing, impact investing or high-road investing. Particularly popular among millennials, it refers to investment strategies that take into account factors such as a company\u2019s record on consumer protection, board diversity and managerial practices, among other things.\u201cIn this day and age, so much of a corporation\u2019s value comes from its reputation,\u201d says       Andrei Cherny,        chief executive of the online investment-management firm Aspiration, which focuses on sustainable investments.How much do you know about ethical (or whatever you want to call it) investing? Let\u2019s find out.1. The modern phenomenon of socially responsible investing in the U.S. can be traced back to which period in American history?A. The 1870sB. The 1930sC. The 1960sD. The 1990sANSWER: C. Although socially responsible investing has roots in the financial practices of 18th-century Quakers and Methodists, who opposed the slave trade, its modern iteration springs from the 1960s, when the civil-rights, antiwar and other movements opened up a whole new field of socially conscious investing.2. Fill in the blank: ESG is an abbreviation for ________________________.A. Environmental, sustainable and greenB. Ethical, social and governanceC. Ethical, sustainable and greenD. Environmental, social and governanceANSWER: D. ESG standards\u2014or environmental, social and corporate governance standards\u2014are the criteria by which socially conscious investors weigh a firm\u2019s ethical bona fides.3. Last year, investors put how much money into ESG funds in the U.S.?A. $20 millionB. $100 millionC. $1 billionD. $3 billionANSWER: D. According to fund-research firm             Morningstar Inc.,       investors added nearly $3 billion to ESG funds in the U.S. last year. Over the next two to three decades,             Bank of America                  Merrill Lynch predicts, millennials could drive about $15 trillion to $20 trillion into ESG funds in the U.S.4. At the start of 2016, the sustainable, responsible and impact investing category represented what percentage of all investment under professional management in the U.S.?A. 22%B. 10%C. 5%D. 0.1%ANSWER: A. Sustainable investing had a market size of $8.72 trillion in the U.S. at the beginning of 2016, representing about one-fifth of all investments under management, according to a biennial report published by the advocacy group US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.5. From 2014 to 2016, sustainable investing grew by what percentage in the U.S.?A. 12%B. 20%C. 33%D. 55%ANSWER: C. Sustainable investing grew 33% over a two-year period from 2014 to 2016 in the U.S., from $6.57 trillion at the start of 2014 to $8.72 trillion in 2016, according to the US SIF report.6. On a global level, what is the dollar amount of assets professionally managed under ESG strategies?A. $15.56 trillionB. $22.89 trillionC. $34.45 trillionD. $45.67 trillionANSWER: B. There are $22.89 trillion of assets under professional management in the ESG realm globally, according to a report by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, up 25% since 2014 and representing 26% of all assets under professional management around the world.7. True or false: There is no official governing body that regulates environmental, social and governance criteria.ANSWER: True. While there are a number of groups that track such criteria, like the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a U.S. nonprofit, there is no government-established universal standard for sustainable investing.8. Which of these financial firms have established sustainable-investing products in the past couple of years?A. Fidelity InvestmentsB. Goldman SachsC. BlackRockD. All of the aboveANSWER: D. As ESG investing goes mainstream, a number of financial firms have been moving into the sustainable-investing realm. In 2015, for example,             Goldman Sachs        GS -0.20%       bought Imprint Capital Advisors, an asset-management firm focused on ESG investment, and             BlackRock        BLK -0.10%       launched the BlackRock Impact U.S. Equity mutual fund (BIRAX) for socially conscious investors. Most recently, in May, Fidelity Investments launched two sustainability index funds.9. True or false: Some studies have shown that companies focusing on sustainability and social responsibility have outperformed those that don\u2019t.ANSWER: True. Critics say that many socially conscious strategies haven\u2019t paid off for investors, but in one study, for example, researchers in the Netherlands found that companies with high eco-efficiency scores\u2014a measure of a company\u2019s impact on the environment\u2014had better average returns than those with lower scores over an eight-year period, from 1995 to 2003, \u201csuggesting that the incremental benefits of [sustainable investing] can be substantial,\u201d the study says.\u201cFor a long time, people have made the assumption that if you\u2019re putting environmental and social questions into the mix\u201d then you\u2019re not focused on returns, says Mr. Cherny, of Aspiration. But that perception, he says, is changing.10. True or false: I can invest in sustainable-investment funds through my 401(k).ANSWER: True\u2014as long as your company\u2019s plan offers them. That wasn\u2019t always the case. But in October 2015, the Labor Department\u2014in addressing plan fiduciaries\u2019 duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\u2014ruled that fiduciaries managing retirement and 401(k) plans can invest in sustainable funds as long as it makes financial sense.Mr. Kassel is a writer in New York.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a smaller trade deficit of $46.2 billion for the month.Imports fell 0.1% in May to $238.54 billion, and exports rose 0.4% from April. Total exports were $192.03 billion in May, the strongest month for overseas sales since April 2015.\u201cThe survey evidence suggests that annual export growth will accelerate from here, reflecting the strength of the global economy and the slight depreciation of the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year,\u201d said       Michael Pearce,        U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.Data on international trade can be volatile from month to month, and the figures weren\u2019t adjusted for inflation. The deficit had jumped in April and even after narrowing in May it was larger than at any point last year.Both imports and exports have risen this year, reflecting a stronger world economy driving an upswing in global trade flows. The dollar has strengthened against other currencies since 2014 but weakened since late last year; a strong dollar makes U.S. products more expensive for foreign customers.\u201cExports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen      said last month.In the first five months of 2017, the value of U.S. imports rose 7.3% while U.S. exports increased 6.0% compared with the same period a year earlier. The overall trade deficit was up 13.1% compared with the first five months of 2016.Export demand could strengthen further headed into the second half of the year. The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its index tracking new export orders at U.S. factories rose to 59.5 in June. The U.S. imports more goods than it exports, though it runs a trade surplus for services. The overall trade deficit totaled $504.79 billion in 2016, or roughly 2.7% of economic output as measured by nominal gross domestic product.President       Donald Trump       campaigned for the White House on skepticism about current U.S. trade agreements. \u201cThe fact is that the United States has trade deficits with many, many countries, and we cannot allow that to continue,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week at a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Looking only at trade in goods, U.S. deficits with China and the European Union narrowed in May from the prior month but remained sizable. The U.S. ran trade surpluses during the month with the U.K. and Latin America.The U.S. economy has run overall trade deficits for decades, during both economic expansions and recessions, which economists say reflects the fact that Americans consume more than they produce relative to the rest of the world. To shrink or eliminate the gap, the U.S. would either have to produce more or consume less.International trade was a slight tailwind for overall economic growth in the first quarter, with net exports contributing 0.23 percentage point to the 1.4% annualized growth rate for GDP, according to Commerce Department data.

On a one-year basis, exports jumped 17.8%, or the strongest 12-month showing in nearly six years.Imports rose in May 2.4% to C$49.77 billion, marking one of the strongest month-over-month gains in years.In volume, or price-adjusted terms, exports rose 1.1% and imports climbed 1.8%.The total value of trade in Canada, or exports plus imports, climbed 13.8% in May from the same year-ago month.Meanwhile, U.S. trade figures were also released Thursday, and indicated the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed as exports rose to their highest level in over two years.The trade report emerges less than a week before the Bank of Canada issues its next interest-rate decision, and there is heightened market expectations that Gov.       Stephen Poloz       will raise rates for the first time in nearly seven years. Last week, he said excess slack in the Canadian economy is now being absorbed \u201csteadily\u201d at the current pace of growth, and reiterated that rate cuts delivered in 2015 to offset the negative fallout from lower energy prices have worked.Further, data indicate the Canadian economy grew at a solid 0.2% in April on a month-over-month basis, setting the stage for a second-quarter annualized gain of roughly 2.5%. And the central bank\u2019s survey of firms suggested executives expect sales prospects to improve over the next year, and to maintain or even bolster the pace of hiring to meet demand.The May trade report, along with the GDP and survey results, will give the Bank of Canada further reason to raise its policy rate on July 12, economists say.The trade deficit deteriorated \u201cfor unexpectedly good reasons,\u201d said Derek Holt, economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, who has forecast a rate rise next week. \u201cAn almost perfect combination of ripping exports and enough strength in the domestic economy to pull in more imports reflect what the Bank of Canada has emphasized to be more diversified growth.\u201dTraders had priced in this week a roughly 80% probability of a rate rise on July 12, according to the overnight-index swap market.On the import side, the purchase of goods from the U.S. rose 3.6% in May to a record high C$32.72 billion, led by aircraft and motor vehicles. Canadian exports to the U.S.--by far its biggest trading partner -- fell 0.3% to C$36.25 billion. All told, Canada\u2019s merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to C$3.53 billion.Canadian imports from non-U.S. markets rose 0.2% to C$17.05 billion.The strength in imports \u201cpoint to healthy internal demand, something that comes with an economy well on the mend, and one that\u2019s on track to reach full employment over the coming quarters,\u201d said CIBC World Markets economist Nick Exarhos.Meanwhile, Canadian nonenergy exports climbed 3.6% in May. The Bank of Canada has monitored nonenergy exports for a sign that the economy is starting to firm. Exports of metal and nonmetallic mineral products rose 11.1%, partly due to shipments of unwrought gold to the U.K., and sales abroad from the auto sector climbed 3.6%. Energy exports fell 9% on lower prices.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 09:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-trade-deficit-in-may-widens-on-record-u-s-imports-1499346988", "news_title": "Canada Trade Deficit in May Widens on Record U.S. Imports ", "keywords": " bank of canada,canada,canada gdp, canada trade, canadian economy, exports, imports, interest rates, stephen poloz, trade, trade deficit,trade figures,Bank of Canada,Statistics Canada,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,monetary policy,interest rates,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "On an unassuming side street in Long Island\u2019s Old Brookville, a 1,000-foot long driveway flanked by an all\u00e9e of pear saplings leads to a 120-room, 17th century-style ch\u00e2teau bedecked with elaborate limestone carvings. Atop its slate roof, a copper ridge decorated with rosettes shines in the early summer sun. Above the front door, the initials \u201cRY\u201d are flanked by horn-blowing cherubs.Though it is a brand-new building in suburban Long Island, the roughly 23,000-square-foot structure looks for all the world like it belongs in France at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XIV\u2019s famous creation. That was the goal of its owner Raphael Yakoby, an Israeli-born entrepreneur who created Hpnotiq liqueur, a bright blue liqueur popularized by hip hop artists in the early 2000s.The front door, with its wrought-iron metalwork, is a scaled-down replica of a door found at Versailles. On the grand staircase in the foyer, the cast-iron and gold-leaf banister is a replica of one found at Le Petit Trianon, Marie Antoinette\u2019s retreat on the grounds of Versailles.Mr. Yakoby, who has spent about four years building the house, says he plans to move in next month, but once it is completed he\u2019s also planning to put it on the market for $100 million\u2014a figure he says is close to the cost of building the home.There is something about Versailles that has produced a seemingly constant stream of imitators, ever since the late 1600s, when Louis XIV transformed a hunting lodge into the opulent palace known world-wide. With roughly 2,300 rooms and its chandelier-laden Hall of Mirrors, Versailles started prompting imitations as soon as it was completed, from other European palaces to grand homes. Even the layout of the city of Washington, D.C., borrowed elements from the gardens of Versailles.When it comes to private homes, Versailles continues to have an outsize influence: According to Realtor.com, 23 homes currently on the market or recently sold referenced Versailles in their marketing copy. \u201cIt\u2019s maintained this huge mystique,\u201d says historian Tony Spawforth, author of \u201cVersailles: A Biography of a Palace.\u201dThe allure of Versailles was no accident: Louis XIV created the massive palace as a way to showcase his power and draw attention to the glories of France. \u201cThere was an enormous \u2018wow\u2019 factor that Louis was aiming for,\u201d Mr. Spawforth says.For many of those who choose to build homes inspired by Versailles, the palace represents the pinnacle of success and achievement, and the culmination of a lifelong dream. The costs of this dream are considerable: Not only is building a modern-day Versailles very expensive, it can upset neighbors and be difficult to sell.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit over the top,\u201d concedes Jean \u201cManouch\u201d Pierre, a businessman who bought the \u201cVersailles Penthouse\u201d at the Metropolis condominium in Las Vegas last year for about $2.8 million. \u201cBut this is what working hard is all about.\u201dMr. Pierre says his opulent condo was given its Versailles look around 2005 by a previous owner. It has 30-foot-high ceilings and cabinets trimmed with gold leaf. A chandelier hangs above a curving marble staircase with 18-karat gold detailing. A commercial real-estate investor in his mid-50s who is originally from Iran, Mr. Pierre bought the property at auction after it had failed to sell at its asking price of $4.88 million; he says he was so amazed by photos of the condo that he bought it without ever visiting. The first time he saw the property in person, \u201cI was extremely emotional,\u201d he adds, noting that the purchase felt like an embodiment of his hard work and success after \u201ccoming here with nothing.\u201dTo make the condo even more Versailles-like, Mr. Pierre got permission from the homeowners association to install fireplaces, and plans to complete the d\u00e9cor with period-appropriate antiques or replicas.To Patrice Tarsey, Versailles is \u201cthe most beautiful palace ever built.\u201d So in 1992 when she saw a newly built house in Los Angeles that was inspired by Le Petit Trianon, she jumped at the chance to own it.The roughly 11,000-square-foot home in Holmby Hills has wrought-iron and marble balconies and gold-leaf moldings throughout. In the entry there is a 46-foot-high dome, with twin rose marble circular staircases topped by an 18th century Baccarat crystal chandelier. In the library and living room the cherry wood floors, in a Bordeaux pattern, are a copy of the floors in the Hall of Mirrors.Ms. Tarsey is a real estate heiress whose father Jason Tarsey owned the Dunes Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. A few years ago, she relocated to Florida, and rented the house out. Now she\u2019s planning to list it for $22.5 million with Gregory Bega and Lindsay Galbraith of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.Versailles-style details don\u2019t come cheap. Builder Tom C. Murphy, co-president of Florida-based Coastal Homes, says he\u2019s worked on three homes inspired by Versailles, ranging in size from 15,000 to roughly 80,000 square feet. These homes are pricey not just because of their size, he says, but because materials and artisans are often sourced from overseas. Moreover, 17th and 18th century homes didn\u2019t have to contend with things like electric lighting and HVAC systems, which take extra work to conceal without ruining elaborate design schemes.In the U.S., homes inspired by Versailles don\u2019t always go over well with neighbors. When dentist Leonid Glosman and his wife Natalie set out to build a Versailles-inspired home in Beverly Hills in the late 1980s, it took two years to get permission to build, because the home\u2019s style \u201cis not customary in the neighborhood\u201d and \u201cthe height was much higher than the rest of the homes,\u201d says their daughter Monique Vayntrub.Once they are built, Versailles-style homes can sometimes have trouble on the resale market. \u201cA lot of people today want modern, contemporary, they don\u2019t want traditional and they don\u2019t want European,\u201d warns Beverly Hills-based real-estate agent Myra Nourmand of Nourmand & Associates.According to Realtor.com, homes that mentioned Versailles in their listing copy spent a median of 122 days on the market, far higher than the national median of 62 days and above the 111-day median for the top 5% highest priced homes in the country.Several Versailles replicas have faced difficulty selling. Perhaps the best known example is the 90,000-square-foot mansion in Windermere, Fla. that inspired the 2012 documentary \u201cThe Queen of Versailles.\u201d Owners       David Siegel,        founder of timeshare giant Westgate Resorts, and his wife, Jacqueline, put the partially completed home on the market in 2010 for $100 million fully finished, or $75 million as-is. The home sat on the market for several years and had its price reduced before being taken off the market.Ms. Glosman, who moved with her husband to the U.S. from Russia in the 1970s, says she chose Versailles as her inspiration because \u201cit is one of the most magnificent architectural achievements in the world.\u201dBut when the family put the eight-bedroom house on the market for $18.95 million in 2014, they found that not everyone had the same appreciation for the style. The home had \u201ca limited audience\u201d of potential buyers, says Ms. Nourmand, one of the listing agents.When the house didn\u2019t sell, the Glosmans took it off the market and spent millions on a renovation, replacing many of the colorful interiors with white and swapping antiques for modern furniture. Now they are seeking to rent the house out for $100,000 a month for long-term rentals or $300,000 a month for short-term rentals.When it comes to Versailles-style homes, \u201ceither you love it, or it\u2019s not for you at all,\u201d says       Debbie Sonenshine       of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, who is listing a $4.75 million home in Atlanta with elaborate gardens inspired by Versailles.But if history is any indication, there will be no shortage of future mini-Versailles to come.\u201cIt\u2019s unique\u2014it\u2019s not cookie cutter,\u201d Kevin Harris says of the Versailles-inspired home in Indianapolis he bought in 2014 for $650,000. The roughly 14,000-square-foot home has hand-plastered moldings on the ceilings and doors, murals on the walls and a ballroom. The Scalamandr\u00e9 fabric on the dining room walls is a copy of draperies at Versailles, he said.Mr. Harris, a manufacturing executive, acknowledges that the home\u2019s ornate style may make it difficult to resell if that time ever comes. But he and his wife love the home, he says, and after all, \u201cyou gotta live somewhere.\u201dWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'My Very Own Versailles.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 09:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/my-very-own-versailles-homeowners-who-recreate-the-french-palace-1499349435", "news_title": "My Very Own Versailles: Homeowners Who Re-create the French Palace", "keywords": "david siegel,jacqueline siegel,le petit trianon, luxury homes, luxury real estate,palace of versailles,raphael yakoby,the queen of versailles,versailles penthouse,versailles style homes,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,building construction,residential building construction,construction"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits rose last week for the third consecutive time, though overall numbers remain consistent with steady job gains.Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 in the week ended July 1, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 246,000 new claims.\u201dIn short, claims remain low, consistent with the trend in employment growth remaining more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down,\u201d       Jim O\u2019Sullivan,        chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.Estimates of jobless claims can be volatile from week to week, but generally have hovered near four-decade lows in recent months, suggesting that employers are holding on to workers.The four-week moving average of initial claims, which evens out weekly volatility, increased last week to 243,000.The number of claims drawn by workers for longer than a week\u2014so-called continuing claims\u2014grew 11,000 to 1.956 million in the week ended June 24. Data on continuing claims are released with a one-week lag.Weekly claims have remained below 300,000 for 122 consecutive weeks, the longest such streak since 1970\u2014when the U.S. population and workforce were far smaller than they are now.The persistently low level of layoffs is one sign the labor market is tightening and may be at or near the level that economists consider maximum employment.

Even worse, they faced payroll constraints in the wake of the $206.5 million mega-deal their previous regime awarded pitcher Zack Greinke and possessed a farm system that ranked among the weakest in the majors. Team president and CEO Derrick Hall described the team as being in \u201ca state of disarray and bewilderment.\u201dThese days, such circumstances usually lead to a familiar chain of events\u2014the quick sell-off of all valuable assets, followed by a slow, painful climb back to prominence. You might know this controversial strategy by another name: \u201ctanking,\u201d one of the trendiest and dirtiest words in sports.But Hazen chose a different approach, one that almost seemed bold in the modern baseball landscape. He decided to keep the core of his new team intact and attempt to compete for a championship right away. Rewarding his faith, the Diamondbacks are headed toward the All-Star break with the second-best record in the National League, careening toward their first playoff appearance since 2011.All because Hazen had the audacity to try to win now.\u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily feel like 69 wins was indicative of the talent on the roster,\u201d Hazen said in a recent interview at Chase Field. \u201cWe felt like putting this team together for another run was maybe something we were more ready to focus on.\u201dGiven the recent success stories of organizations that essentially opted to suffer a stretch of extended futility in the name of future prosperity, few would\u2019ve blamed Hazen for blowing the Diamondbacks up and starting over.The Chicago Cubs benefited from that blueprint, winning the World Series a year ago after dismantling their roster to acquire a string of top draft picks. So did the Houston Astros, who averaged 104 losses from 2011 through 2014 before emerging as baseball\u2019s best team thus far in 2017. The San Diego Padres look like the next franchise prepared to follow that path.In light of that, Hall said that when he hired Hazen, he made it clear that the Diamondbacks would allow him the freedom to \u201cgive us the game plan, and we\u2019d follow it.\u201d That included the possibility of a total rebuild.\u201cIf Mike Hazen had said, \u2018Look, I think we\u2019ve got to start all over, let\u2019s shop all of our players,\u2019 we would have been on board,\u201d Hall said.Hazen didn\u2019t recommend that, not right away, at least. Instead, he assembled his front office, tapped Torey Lovullo, the Boston Red Sox\u2019 bench coach, as the Diamondbacks\u2019 manager and discussed the future.As expected, Lovullo focused more on the short-term, while Hazen maintained a more long-term view. But in the end, Lovullo said, everybody agreed that in their first season together, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be a complete teardown. It was going to be, \u2018Let\u2019s evaluate, and let\u2019s see what we have and watch how they perform.\u2019\u201dThey felt comfortable with that because, for all of the Diamondbacks\u2019 problems last year, they boasted two pieces that set them apart from most of their peers: a legitimate superstar in slugging first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and a bona fide ace in Greinke. They also endured several key injuries last season that derailed their chances.That, coupled with a collection of young players on the rise, like shortstop Chris Owings and All-Star third baseman Jake Lamb, convinced Hazen and his staff to give 2017 a shot.\u201cI was happy about that because I know complete teardowns take a little bit of time, and there\u2019s a lot of heartache along the way,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cI was especially happy that it wasn\u2019t going to be a teardown because there are some elite players here.\u201dHazen certainly behaved this winter as if he thought the Diamondbacks could contend immediately. He completed one significant trade, bolstering the pitching rotation by sending shortstop Jean Segura\u2014the NL leader in hits last year\u2014to the Seattle Mariners for 24-year-old right-hander Taijuan Walker.Beyond that, he focused on depth, accumulating useful veteran role players to round out the roster\u2014the type of moves good teams make as subtle, but important, finishing touches. He signed free-agent outfielders Gregor Blanco and Daniel Descalso, who filled in admirably while star A.J. Pollock dealt with an injury. He bolstered the bullpen by adding closer Fernando Rodney and setup man Jorge De La Rosa.Most important, Diamondbacks players say, Hazen turned his attention to behind the plate. He parted ways with Wellington Castillo, a strong hitter, and replaced him with Jeff Mathis and Chris Iannetta, experienced catchers that specialize in defense. With their presence, the Diamondbacks, who had an MLB-worst 5.09 ERA last season, have the second-best ERA in the majors.\u201cThose guys have played a huge part in our success so far,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cThey have a lot of experience, World Series rings, big plays in the playoffs, and so everyone\u2019s just followed their lead and fallen behind them.\u201dWhile most computer projections viewed the Diamondbacks as an underachiever in 2016, they still pegged them as no better than a .500 team in 2017. (Hazen said that due to some of the Diamondbacks\u2019 injuries in 2016, \u201cWe felt like the projections may be a little bit low on us.\u201d)That explains why speculation swirled about whether the Diamondbacks would\u2014or should\u2014press the reset button and think about trading Greinke or even Goldschmidt for a prospect haul. Lovullo heard the talk and admitted that the team might need to start over \u201cif we didn\u2019t go out and perform\u201d quickly in 2017. The Diamondbacks did just that, immediately silencing their critics.Of course, questions remain. The Diamondbacks will eventually need to improve their struggling farm system. Hazen said that in terms of \u201clong-term goals to sustain success, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201dBut for this season, the Diamondbacks look like serious contenders. For that, Hazen deserves credit.\u201cThe fact that he thought there were some tangible pieces here that he wanted to see how they\u2019d perform under a different leadership and a new season, we were willing to go for it,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAt some point, we would have had to figure out when to pull the plug. Fortunately we\u2019ve been winning and winning at a pretty good pace.\u201dWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 09:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-team-that-didnt-tankand-actually-turned-into-a-contender-1499347746", "news_title": "The Team That Didn\u2019t Tank\u2014and Actually Turned Into a Contender", "keywords": "arizona diamondbacks,baseball,diamondbacks,jake lamb,mlb,paul goldschmidt ,zack greinke ,Arizona Diamondbacks,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The bosses of America\u2019s biggest and best-known companies are learning a common lesson this year: The pay is great, but job security has rarely been shakier.In June alone, the chief executives of General Electric Co., Uber Technologies Inc.,             Whirlpool Corp.        WHR 1.09%      ,             Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.,        BWLD 0.53%Perrigo Co.        PRGO -0.34%       and             Pandora Media Inc.        P -1.26%       resigned or announced their departures. Among those, only Whirlpool\u2019s       Jeff Fettig       didn\u2019t have to confront investor pressure in the months before announcing he will step down.Their exits follow an especially busy season of upheaval in corner offices. In the first five months of 2017, 13 companies with market values of more than $40 billion installed new CEOs\u2014including             American International Group Inc.,        AIG 0.50%Ford Motor Co.        F 0.68%      , and             Caterpillar Inc.        CAT 0.73%      \u2014according to an analysis for The Wall Street Journal by executive-recruitment firm Crist/Kolder Associates. That is more than double the CEO changes at mega-corporations in the same period last year.This chief executive churn reflects a broader reality for the country\u2019s business elite: An array of challenges\u2014from increasing impatience on Wall Street and in boardrooms to a corporate landscape rapidly transformed by new technologies and rival upstarts\u2014has made the top job tougher and more precarious than just a few years ago, top executives say. Even the biggest companies are vulnerable to shareholder disapproval and competitive forces that their size and stature once helped them fend off.The typical CEO of a major company a decade ago resembled a ship captain \u201cwho could rally a group of people with a lot of process and procedures,\u201d said Deborah Rubin, a senior partner at RHR International, a leadership-development firm. \u201cToday\u2019s CEO has to be much more like a race car driver,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to do the sharp maneuvers.\u201dFlush with more cash than ever, activist investors are pursuing bigger corporate prey. This year, they have helped push out the leaders of AIG, railroad operator CSX Corp. and aluminum-parts manufacturer Arconic Inc. Indeed, one-third of the 42 S&P 500 and Fortune 500 companies that replaced a CEO through May this year grappled with the demands of activist shareholders during the prior chief\u2019s tenure, Crist/Kolder\u2019s analysis found.Through June 23, activists had launched nine campaigns targeting top management at U.S. companies this year\u2014and the fastest pace since 2014, according to FactSet, a research firm.Even GE CEO       Jeff Immelt\u2019s       disclosure that he would depart this summer came amid brewing tensions with activist investor       Nelson Peltz       over the conglomerate\u2019s languishing stock price.Though the move was part of a long-in-the-works transition, Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management LP had recently stepped up pressure on GE to cut costs more aggressively and boost profits, setting off speculation about when the longtime CEO might leave.Mr. Immelt said he decided in 2013 that he would step aside sometime this year after 16 years at the helm, and GE board officials have said Trian played no role in the leadership change. \u201cMy predecessor did it for 20 years\u2014it\u2019s not a 20-year job today,\u201d the 61-year-old Mr. Immelt said last week at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.Growing shareholder clamor for quick results comes as new technologies are upending entire industries. If you run a retailer, for instance, \u201cyou are watching your whole market go away in just a matter of years,\u201d said       Peter D. Crist,        chairman of Crist/Kolder.J. Crew Group Inc. and             Macy\u2019s Inc.,       two such retailers that have struggled to adapt to consumer shifts created by online shopping and upstarts with more nimble supply chains, have recently appointed new CEOs. Both of their predecessors, Mickey Drexler at J. Crew and       Terry Lundgren       at Macy\u2019s, are remaining chairmen of their companies.Likewise, Ford\u2019s ouster of Mark Fields after less than three years in its highest job was the starkest sign yet of how tech players such as electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       autonomous-car unit, Waymo, threaten the traditional auto sector. Mr. Fields had been groomed for years to take Ford\u2019s helm, but his fellow board members swiftly replaced him after he failed to persuade Wall Street he was reinventing the car maker quickly enough.

Likewise, the commitment to intervene if yields rise puts off anyone considering shorting Japanese bonds: nobody wants to go up against a buyer that can essentially print its own money.In the second quarter of 2017, the BOJ accumulated an average of \u00a513.5 trillion in assets compared with a quarterly average of \u00a522.8 trillion in 2016. That is less than at any time since the program began in the spring of 2013. Japanese government bond yields have gyrated by far less than their European and U.S. peers in the last nine months, and haven\u2019t joined in the recent selloff.That selloff was triggered last week when ECB President       Mario Draghi       noted a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d economic recovery in the eurozone.\u201cDraghi is discovering that narratives contrary to the one you want to get across can take hold in the market,\u201d said       Grant Lewis,        head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.Minutes from the ECB\u2019s June meeting released Thursday showed policy makers weighing up whether to drop their bias toward further stimulus.That followed the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting minutes Wednesday, where officials signaled they may be ready to start slowly shrinking their large portfolio of bonds and other assets in the next few months.Germany\u2019s 10-year bund yields rose by 0.2 of a percentage point in five days, the largest jump since 2015\u2019s \u201cbund tantrum\u201d when investors dumped bonds as they also anticipated less stimulus. Bonds in advanced economies tend to move together, and yields on U.S. and British 10-year bonds rose by a similar amount through the week. But Japan\u2019s 10-year yields rose by just 0.02%. Yields rise as prices fall.The BOJ can keep its markets stable by setting a clear limit on what it will tolerate, analysts say. In early February, when 10-year yields rose as high as 0.15%, the central bank offered to buy an unlimited volume of bonds at a yield of 0.11%, pushing yields back down.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly been easier for (BOJ chief Haruhiko)       Kuroda.       He\u2019s stood up and said yields will be held at these levels. Try and beat me, I\u2019ve got infinite resources,\u201d Mr. Lewis added. \u201cThat\u2019s actually allowed them to start purchasing less.\u201dSome analysts even expect the BOJ to drop the \u00a580 trillion target for annual bond purchases.\u201cAbandoning this target would come at little cost to the policy path,\u201d said       Freya Beamish,        chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThe yield curve target is doing all the work.\u201dMr. Draghi has outlined the difficulty faced by any central bank looking to taper so-called quantitative easing. While the threat of deflation that the ECB\u2019s program was designed to counter has passed, \u201ca very substantial degree of monetary policy is still needed,\u201d in part to ensure that \u201coverall financing conditions continue to support that reflationary process,\u201d he said in late June.To be sure, an ECB target wouldn\u2019t necessarily iron out the volatility. Bond yields in Europe have long been more dramatic than those in Japan, where growth and inflation have been sluggish for decades. The ECB also has a series of national government bond markets to deal with, rather than a single one.\u201cFor a long time Japanese inflation expectations have been extremely low,\u201d said       Peter Chatwell,        head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International. \u201cSo the central bank is more able to adjust its monetary policy without an immediate jump higher in yields.\u201d\u2014Riva Gold contributed to this article.Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 09:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-dials-back-stimulus-without-spooking-investors-1499346641", "news_title": "Japan Shows Europe How to Dial Back Stimulus Without Spooking Investors", "keywords": "bond buying,draghi,ecb,european central bank,fed,federal reserve,interest rates,kuroda,monetary policy,monetary stimulus,qe,quantitative easing,stimulus measures,tapering,yellen,Bank of Japan,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,Freya Beamish,Grant Lewis,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "BRECKENRIDGE, Colo.\u2014Evacuation orders for hundreds of homes were expected to remain in place through midday Thursday as a wildfire rages near Colorado\u2019s Breckenridge Ski Resort.The fire, one of several burning across the West, was reported by a mountain biker late Wednesday morning and is consuming beetle-killed trees in the White River National Forest about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from the resort.It had scorched about 80 acres (32.4 hectares) and forced the evacuation of 463 homes that are about a mile north of the resort.All of the homes on Peak 7 were evacuated, and nearby residents have been warned that they might have to leave, according to the Red, White & Blue Fire Protection District.

Big financial firms are drafting contingency plans for Britain\u2019s future outside the single market.Many have indicated they could move thousands of staff into the EU once Britain leaves, particularly if the U.K. is unable to secure a trading deal which keeps close ties to the bloc.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. initially plans to move between 500 and 1,000 jobs out of London, and bolster its operations in Dublin, Luxembourg and Frankfurt. UBS Group AG and             HSBC                   PLC have indicated they are looking at options for around 1,000 of their London-based staff.Mr. Bailey questioned whether financial companies required single-market access to have the benefits of free trade with the EU.\u201cWhen I hear people say that firms need to relocate to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder,\u201d he said.\u201cDoes Brexit have to mean abandoning the benefits of free trade and open markets in financial services? It should not. Does it require membership of the single market to get the benefits of free trade with the EU? No.\u201dThere is \u201cample evidence that open markets in financial services and free trade can exist safely without common detailed rules and shared regulatory institutions,\u201d he said.Mr. Bailey also discussed the future for the U.K.\u2019s lucrative clearing industry, which has been the subject of scrutiny since the Brexit vote. The EU\u2019s executive body has proposed plans that could compel clearinghouses that do a large amount of their business in euros to move into the bloc.Mr. Bailey said cross-border regulatory cooperation, backed up by joint supervisory oversight is \u201cvery clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location-based policy.\u201dSpeaking at a separate event on Thursday, London Stock Exchange Chief Executive       Xavier Rolet       said that the EU has already struck deals with third countries for clearing and that any effort for the EU to cut off London would be \u201cpunitively expensive.\u201dMr. Bailey explained that the FCA is providing technical advice to support the government in Brexit negotiations, while working with regulated firms to understand their plans for the future.

He admitted to defying a judge\u2019s order to clear one of the protest sites.In the years since the demonstrations, city authorities have aggressively prosecuted activists such as Mr. Wong, sapping their momentum and instilling a sense among many Hong Kongers that resisting Beijing\u2019s will is futile, political analysts say.\u201cThe pro-democracy movement is hitting a low tide, mainly because of intimidation from Beijing,\u201d said Willy Lam, a longtime Hong Kong political analyst.In Hong Kong last week, Chinese President       Xi Jinping       issued a stern warning to the city of seven million people, calling any Hong Kong challenges to central government power \u201cimpermissible\u201d acts that cross a \u201cred line.\u201d Protests planned to mark Mr. Xi\u2019s visit either attracted far fewer participants than expected or were broken up by police.Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement has ebbed for other reasons, as well. Protesters appeared too radical for many conservative Hong Kongers after some actions ended in disturbances. Infighting stole momentum, while attention-getting gambits\u2014such as the decision of newly elected lawmakers to protest during swearing-in ceremonies\u2014backfired by giving authorities excuses to remove them from the Legislative Council.\u201cThe atmosphere is not very good, you have splits in the movement, political persecutions, arrests,\u201d said Leung Kwok-hung, an activist Legislative Council member known as \u201cLong Hair,\u201d who may be disqualified from the body for lacing his oath with anti-Communist Party slogans\u2014an act he said he wouldn\u2019t repeat.However, several pro-democracy activists insist their movement is a long-term effort that could regain momentum sooner than many think. For example, Beijing is pressuring Hong Kong to introduce an antisedition law as well as a school curriculum that promotes the Chinese Communist Party\u2014two initiatives that sparked opposition in the past.\u201cEducation is something that goes right into the home on an issue that people care about most, the future of their children,\u201d said Nathan Law, a protest leader and legislator who also faces disqualification for failing to properly execute his oath.At its peak in 2014, the \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d led by Mr. Wong and others shut down parts of the city. Mr. Wong and several others were charged with contempt of court for interfering with a court order to clear a protest stronghold in Mong Kok, across Victoria Harbour from Hong Kong Island.In an interview, Mr. Wong said he pleaded guilty to take responsibility for his civil disobedience and uphold the rule of law. Mr. Wong will be sentenced in the coming weeks. Any prison term longer than three months would disqualify Mr. Wong, who has founded a political party, from running for the legislature for five years.While Hong Kong\u2019s government brought the prosecutions, it takes its cues from authorities in Beijing, a relationship expected to deepen under the city\u2019s new leadership sworn in July 1.In the cases of the newly elected pro-democracy council members who failed to execute their oaths, two have been disqualified already and four more are awaiting a judge\u2019s decision as to whether they can keep their seats.To make way for the disqualifications, Beijing authorities issued a new interpretation of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution last year, sparking protests. In April, authorities arrested nine of the protesters on charges of unlawful assembly and other crimes. The protesters deny wrongdoing.A month earlier, Hong Kong authorities handed out multiyear prison sentences to three protesters accused of participating in a separate mini-riot in February 2016, during Lunar New Year celebrations, sparked when police tried to clamp down on street vendors in Mong Kok.\u201cWe will continue to fight. We have been in the movement for three decades, there have been ups and downs all the time,\u201d said Albert Ho, a Hong Kong lawyer and veteran democracy activist.Write to John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 08:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kongs-protest-movement-crippled-by-legal-crackdown-1499343358", "news_title": "Hong Kong\u2019s Protest Movement Crippled by Legal Clampdown", "keywords": " activists, beijing,china, chinese, democracy, guilty, hong kong, joshua wong, protests,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union\u2019s antitrust watchdog accused             General Electric Co.        GE 0.19%      , Japan\u2019s             Canon Inc.        CAJ 0.47%       as well as German pharmaceuticals group             Merck        MKGAY -0.28%       KGaA and Sigma-Aldrich Corp. of breaching the bloc\u2019s merger rules.The moves come as the EU is trying to drive home to companies the urgent need to submit accurate and truthful information when registering a deal for antitrust review with Brussels. The EU\u2019s competition chief told The Wall Street Journal in March that her department is reviewing a handful of recent merger clearances on suspicions companies misled investigators in securing approval.The EU said General Electric may have misled regulators when the EU was reviewing its $1.65 billion deal with LM Wind Power, while Merck may have done so with its $17 billion acquisition of\u00a0Sigma-Aldrich, a U.S. supplier of laboratory testing materials.Japan\u2019s Canon Co. may have violated rules by implementing its deal with             Toshiba Corp.\u2019s        TOSYY -2.51%       medical-systems unit valued at \u00a5665.5 billion ($5.9 billion) before registering the acquisition with the EU, the regulator said.\u2018We can only do our job well if we can rely on cooperation from the companies concerned\u2014they\u00a0must obtain our approval before they implement their transactions and the information they supply us\u00a0must be correct and complete.\u2019The EU\u2019s clearances for all three deals remain valid, the EU said. But if in its formal investigations the regulator finds the companies did in fact\u00a0provide incorrect or misleading information, the companies can be fined up to 1% of global revenue. In Canon\u2019s case, if the EU finds the company jumped the gun with implementing the merger, it could\u00a0be fined as high as 10% of global revenue.\u201cWe can only do our job well if we can rely on cooperation from the companies concerned\u2014they\u00a0must obtain our approval before they implement their transactions and the information they supply us\u00a0must be correct and complete,\u201d said EU antitrust chief       Margrethe Vestager.The EU said GE initially failed to provide information regarding research and development activities and that information was necessary to properly assess the future position of GE and the competitive landscape on the wind-turbine market, the watchdog said. GE re-registered its deal in February to reflect the future project, which had not been notified in the initial registration two weeks earlier, the EU said.GE said it believed the company acted in good faith and that there was no intent to mislead. \u201cWhen informed of the EC\u2019s concerns, we acted quickly and openly to resolve the issue,\u201d said GE spokesman       James Healy.In the deal between Merck and Sigma-Aldrich, the companies failed to provide important information about an innovation project relevant to laboratory chemicals at the heart of the EU\u2019s analysis of the deal.\u201cHad this project been correctly disclosed to the commission, it would have had to be included in the remedy package,\u201d the EU said, referring to a business the companies had to divest to win approval for a deal. The viability of the divested business was impaired as a result, the EU said.The buyer of the divested business,             Honeywell International Inc.,       received the relevant technology only a year later after Merck agreed to license it to them, the EU said.In its investigation into Canon\u2019s deal, the EU said it was concerned the company used a two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer, which essentially allowed it to acquire Toshiba\u2019s unit before obtaining the relevant merger approvals.Japanese regulators last year warned Canon that the way it structured the deal potentially violated the law, but also said the deal could go ahead.Canon said it had received the EU\u2019s so-called statement of objections announcing the formal investigation, adding it would respond to the EU in due course.Thursday\u2019s announcement follows the EU\u2019s decision in May to fine             Facebook Inc.       \u20ac110 million ($124 million) for providing incorrect information or misleading authorities over the acquisition of its messaging unit WhatsApp. The EU said Facebook inaccurately claimed during the merger review in 2014 that it couldn\u2019t routinely match Facebook and WhatsApp user accounts\u2014something the company started doing two years later when it began combining user data across the services.\u00a0Facebook said the errors in the filings weren\u2019t intentional.At the time, the EU also opened an investigation into a previously cleared merger between Dutch telecommunications company             Altice                   NV and PT Portugal SGPS SA. The EU accused Altice of implementing its merger announced in 2014 before formally logging the deal for review with EU authorities. Altice said it disagreed with the commission\u2019s preliminary findings.Under the EU\u2019s merger rules, companies have to abide by strict and tight deadlines to submit information requested by the regulator, something lawyers say can be a challenge if companies have to dig up documents or internally cross-check information with different departments.The EU says all the deals currently under renewed scrutiny will keep their clearance. However, in more severe cases, the EU could revoke a merger clearance if more accurate information would have led to a different decision.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'EU Flags Missteps By GE and Others In Filing for Deals.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-canon-germanys-merck-accused-of-eu-antitrust-breaches-1499338465", "news_title": "GE, Canon, Germany\u2019s Merck Accused of EU Antitrust Breaches ", "keywords": " antitrust, competition policy, deals in europe,eu, eu antitrust scurtiny, eu competition policy, firms breach eu antitrust rules, trust busting,Canon,CAJ,JP:7751,European Union,General Electric,GE,LM Wind Power,Merck,MRK.XE,Sigma-Aldrich,Toshiba,6502.TO,JP:6502,Honeywell International,HON,James Healy,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,regulatory breach,glass,glass products,glass fiber,chemicals,pharmaceuticals,electronic office equipment,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,diversified holding companies,health care,life sciences,basic materials,resources,business,consumer services,consumer goods,industrial goods,internet,online,media,entertainment,office equipment,supplies,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "The soaring prices of secondhand stakes in private-equity funds are making it harder for investors to put money to work in the secondaries market, according to a private-equity investment manager at a Swiss private bank.Pictet Alternative Advisors has been priced out of many deal processes, David Mar\u00e9chal told a press briefing in London. The firm has secured three secondaries investments over the last 18 months, after bidding on about 110. Historically its success rate had been in the 5%-10% range, Mr. Mar\u00e9chal said. Pictet Alternatives Advisors, a division of Geneva-based Pictet Group, has more than $20 billion under management across private equity, hedge funds and real estate.\u201dPrices are very, very high in secondary transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cFor quality portfolios with good-quality companies you very often pay premiums\u2014and that is, in our view, a little bit of an anomaly in the market.\u201dAn analysis of secondaries deals struck this year up to June 22 by fund advisory firm Triago showed stakes in buyout funds changed hands for an average of 95% of their most recent net asset value. That compares with 93% for 2016 as a whole. Valuations were steeper at the larger end of the market: stakes in large buyout funds changed hands at 97% of NAV, up from 95% last year.Some 17% of deals were struck at a premium to NAV, according to Triago. The average premium was 3% to NAV, but the most in-demand assets fetched premiums of 15% or more. Just 14% of deals fetched more than their NAV in 2016, and the average premium was 2%.Although prices were climbing, Triago said the market still offered value for investors given the money to be made by selling portfolio assets. Its own analysis of 96 sales of portfolio companies from funds bought in the secondaries market found the average exit fetched a 22% premium to NAV.Mr. Mar\u00e9chal attributed Pictet\u2019s declining success rate to the growing use of debt to fund deals in the secondary market. Pictet never uses leverage in the secondary market, he said.In a recent survey, Dow Jones found that 19% of respondents reported using debt to finance deals in the secondaries market, down from 21% in last year\u2019s survey but up from 9% in 2015. About a third of the respondents who said they don\u2019t use debt were considering doing so.\u201cA lot of the people who are winning deals in the secondaries market can only justify the price they pay to reach their target returns by financing that transaction with leverage,\u201d Mr. Mar\u00e9chal said. \u201cSome secondary players finance a big portion of their secondary transactions with debt, and in our view that\u2019s very risky.\u201dDebt can enhance returns on a secondary buyer\u2019s equity, much as it boosts the potential return on equity in a buyout deal. It can also give secondary buyers extra firepower to increase their bids. But adding leverage on top of underlying portfolios that often are levered themselves can put those deals at a potentially greater risk of default if underlying cash flows the portfolio generates fail to measure up.\u201dIt\u2019s really piling up debt\u2014putting debt on debt\u2014and that is not what we do,\u201d Mr. Mar\u00e9chal said.Asked whether he thought other investors will lose money on investments made at current prices, he said: \u201cTime will tell.\u2026What we can tell you factually is we have lost so many deals on pricing.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-06 07:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pictet-debt-fueling-secondaries-price-surge-1499341930", "news_title": "Pictet: Debt Fueling Secondaries Price Surge", "keywords": "Pictet Group,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,alternative investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Lower fees, weaker returns, higher costs. Running a hedge fund isn\u2019t what it used to be. To avoid going out of business, smaller funds are learning to tighten their belts.Smaller hedge funds have come under severe pressure in recent years due to a toxic mix of poor returns, investor demands for lower fees, and rising costs of regulation and compliance.But a survey by industry body the Alternative Investment Management Association and broker GPP shows many funds can still make a profit with lower levels of assets. Many have been able to cut costs by, for instance, outsourcing some roles, and are managing to live with the expense of meeting greater compliance requirements from regulators and investors.And while investors are demanding lower fees, this pressure isn\u2019t driving most managers to the wall.\u201cYou need to keep the lights on,\u201d said       Tom Kehoe,        global head of research at AIMA. \u201cFrom the allocators we talk to, the last thing they want to do is put these managers out of business.\u201dThe survey showed that, on average, small hedge fund firms could break even running $87 million in assets, while 57% of firms surveyed were able to break even running $100 million or less\u2014a relatively low level of assets for a hedge fund. Funds trading rising and falling stocks, bonds or some computer-driven strategies could on average turn a profit on well below $100 million of assets.The findings paint a brighter picture than many commentators have assumed of the health of small hedge funds.Average hedge fund returns regularly hit double-digits during the 1990s and 2000s. That made starting and expanding a hedge fund an easier and more profitable punt due to strong investor demand for such returns and the fees such businesses could earn. However, funds have lost money on average in two of the past six calendar years, meaning some big investors have lost patience with the sector. While some big-name funds have suffered, many investors remain wary of putting money with managers with a short track-record.The survey also showed that the lucrative model of a 2% management fee and a 20% incentive fee\u2014once seen as the industry\u2019s benchmark\u2014doesn\u2019t apply to most small managers. Half of firms surveyed charged an annual fee of less than 1.5% of assets in their main fund, while funds starting up in the past year could only command a 1.25% fee on average, highlighting the pressure many face.However, the survey also showed firms willing to run slimmed-down operations. Roles such as chief technology officer, chief legal officer and chief compliance officer, for instance, were often outsourced to reduce costs.AIMA and GPP surveyed 135 managers globally managing less than $500 million each.

The turbulent oil-and-gas markets are testing the skills of energy-focused buyout shops, sharpening the contrast between faltering firms and those that remain hot among investors.EnCap held its first close on its latest fund in December 2016 and has already started doing deals out of the pool. The fund, which focuses on exploration and production, backs management teams that buy land, drill wells and develop oil-and-gas fields, among other energy bets.Since oil prices went into free fall in 2014, EnCap has put additional focus on the strategy of buying land and energy assets over leasing out fields to drill for oil and gas, according to an investor presentation.EnCap was one of the several large energy-focused private-equity firms that sold assets in the oil-rich and booming Permian Basin when an energy rebound and soaring land prices triggered a flurry of exits in the region. Late last year, four of its portfolio companies\u2014Firewheel Energy LLC, QStar LLC, Silverback Exploration LLC and American Resource Development LLC, also known as Ameredev\u2014struck separate deals to sell what amounted to north of $3 billion in West Texas energy assets to public oil-and-gas producers.EnCap said in March it committed $400 million to reinvest in the Ameredev management team through another oil-and-gas partnership.Uncertainty in the oil sector has forced some firms to scale back fundraising ambitions. Fewer firms closed on funds in 2016 and the pool of money they raised shrank. A total of 46 funds closed on $45.5 billion in 2016, down from the 63 funds that sealed $54.56 billion the previous year, according to Preqin Ltd.EnCap\u2019s latest fund is the largest energy-focused pool being raised at the moment, according the research firm\u2019s tally of funds.The firm\u2019s previous $6.5 billion flagship pool, launched in 2015, hadn\u2019t yet returned all of its backers\u2019 invested capital by the end of last September, investor documents show. But a prior fund, launched in 2013 and which closed on $5 billion in investor commitments, posted overall gains of 1.2 times invested capital and returned 3.5 times invested capital from realized deals as of September, according to the document.\ufeff", "news_time": "2017-07-06 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/encap-seals-6-2-billion-so-far-as-energy-swings-test-private-equity-1499340602", "news_title": "EnCap Seals $6.2 Billion So Far as Energy Swings Test Private Equity ", "keywords": "Silverback Exploration,American Resource Development,corporate funding,share capital,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,capital movements,invisible trade,economic news,foreign direct investment,machinery,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,industrial goods,investing,securities,renewable energy equipment"}, {"content": "Good morning.

Finally, publishers and marketers on the platform have a way to direct users to their websites without having to pay for an ad that tells users to swipe. Until now, Snapchat has been a fairly closed ecosystem that didn\u2019t play with the rest of the web.

At the same time, for every \u20ac100 sold, Lexington would commit \u20ac50 in new capital to BC European Capital X LP, which is seeking about \u20ac7 billion.The proposed transaction, often referred to as a stapled secondary, would allow investors that sell to lock in a return of about 19% on Fund IX, said these people, while providing BC Partners with a healthy injection of capital into its new fund for future deals. The European private-equity firm raised \u20ac6.5 billion for Fund IX in early 2012.Campbell Lutyens served as an intermediary on the deal, these people said.Although the proposed purchase price represents a healthy premium to the fund\u2019s NAV as of March 31, it doesn\u2019t account for proceeds from BC Partners\u2019 initial public offering of             Altice USA                   in June or from the firm\u2019s recently announced partial sale of Mergermarket Group to Singaporean sovereign-wealth investor GIC Private Ltd., one person said. When those deals are factored into the transaction, the price is closer to par with the portfolio\u2019s NAV.Fund IX\u2019s portfolio has about 17 companies in it, including a stake in Cyxtera Technologies, a data-center operator that the firm formed earlier this year alongside Medina Capital.Stapled secondary deals have become an increasingly popular tool for attracting fresh capital from secondary buyers and other investors to new funds. They are often used in conjunction with spinouts of investment teams from larger institutions. For example, when Lexington backed the spinout of One Equity Partners from its former parent             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. in 2015, the firm agreed to provide fresh capital to seed the team\u2019s next fund in addition to the money it used to purchase a portfolio of existing assets from the bank.However, secondary buyers said such deals also have increasingly been used in conjunction with fundraising efforts by more established firms. Earlier this year, CIVC Partners, for one, negotiated a stapled secondary transaction involving a stake in one of the firm\u2019s funds that was held by the Montana Board of Investments, which sold at a premium to the stake\u2019s underlying NAV, according to pension documents.Write to Ed Ballard at ed.ballard@wsj.com, Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com and William Louch at william.louch@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 07:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lexington-to-back-up-to-1-8-billion-stapled-secondary-deal-with-bc-partners-1499340226", "news_title": "Lexington to Back Up to \u20ac1.8 Billion Stapled Secondary Deal With BC Partners", "keywords": "trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "You & Mr Jones, the \u201cbrand tech\u201d firm founded by former Havas CEO David Jones, is continuing its investment and hiring spree.The New York-based company was launched in June 2015 with a $350 million investment to help it acquire and invest in companies that specialize in areas such as content creation, brand and content strategy, social-media marketing, data and analytics, programmatic media buying, and multichannel networks.In the two years since it was founded, You & Mr Jones hasn\u2019t slowed down on the deal front.Recent, previously unannounced investments have included Tribe Dynamics, an influencer data platform that ties \u201cearned media\u201d\u2014press coverage or other content placements that weren\u2019t paid for by the advertiser\u2014to sales. The firm also has backed Elsy, which uses artificial intelligence for media planning. Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed for either transaction.The average strategic venture investment You & Mr Jones tends to make in a company\u2014which previously has included the likes of digital media news and culture site Mashable and Pok\u00e9mon Go maker Niantic\u2014tends to be around $2 million. But it has invested anywhere from $100,000 to $6 million so far, according to Mr. Jones. On the majority acquisition side, total deal sizes, some of which are based on future performance, have reached from $30 million to just over $100 million.Overall, You & Mr Jones has invested in 13 companies, acquired majority stakes in four firms and launched two of its own startups.As for the future, Mr. Jones anticipates the company will be making more acquisitions in the data and analytics space, mobile video and \u201cpeople-powered\u201d marketing solutions that allow brands to tap into a crowd of talent to create their content. Mr. Jones expects the company also will make more minority investments in companies that work in the areas of augmented reality and virtual reality.Mr. Jones said his company has four criteria it looks for in a potential investment or acquisition: \u201cIs it a great business in a vertical we want to play in? Do we like the people? Will brands get excited about this? Can we do a deal at a valuation that makes sense?\u201dOver the past year, the company has added a number of new partners to its team. Hires include Ron Croen, the founder and former CEO of technology company Nuance Communications; Julie Hardy, the former director at digital agency DAN Paris; and Amy Luca, who came on board in June as president of theAmplify, an influencer marketing platform You & Mr Jones acquired a majority stake in last year.As a private company, Mr. Jones declined to provide financial information. But he did say that the company has more than $150 million of its initial investment left and that revenue grew 724% last year, albeit from a small, unspecified base.You & Mr Jones has counted brands including Coca-Cola, Google, BNP Paribas, Facebook and Unilever among its clients.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter.

Yet the rest of the market isn\u2019t rushing to jump on board.Prominent short sellers, including Carson Block of Muddy Waters LLC and U.S.-based Gotham City Research, have targeted Hong Kong-listed stocks in recent months in an effort to profit from what they expect will be future price declines. These well-publicized campaigns mask the fact that overall short-selling activity throughout Hong Kong has declined as stocks in the region have soared this year.\u201cHong Kong has been a dangerous place to play for short sellers,\u201d says       Simon Colvin,        research analyst at financial-data firm             IHS Markit.       \u201cThere is not a sustained appetite to short these stocks.\u201dOnly 1.5% of shares in Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index were out on loan as of July 5, a proxy for short interest reflective of investors betting against a stock, according to a report this week by IHS Markit. That is the lowest level in nearly two years and down from 2.5% in August 2016.Short sellers borrow shares to sell them with the hope of buying the shares back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference. Falling short interest in Hong Kong contrasts with what is happening in the U.S. Some 4.1% of shares in the Russell 3000 Index\u2014a broad U.S. benchmark\u2014were out on loan in June, the highest level in eight months and up from 3.6% at the beginning of the year, according to IHS Markit.\u2018Hong Kong has been a dangerous place to play for short sellers.\u2019Short selling can be controversial. Proponents argue skepticism in the market is healthy, while skeptics say short sellers can unfairly push prices lower. NYSE Group President       Tom Farley       said last week that short selling \u201cfeels kind of icky and un-American.\u201dDespite the fall in short selling in Hong Kong, the number of activists wagering against stocks there has risen. Short-seller campaigns have targeted at least 20 Hong Kong-listed companies since last year, the most at least since 2012, according to New York-based research firm Activist Insight.\u201cObservers could be forgiven for thinking that Hong Kong has turned into a free-for-all for short sellers,\u201d Mr. Colvin said. \u201cIn fact, the opposite looks to be happening.\u201dPart of the reason why, he says, is that short sellers in the region have covered about one-third of their positions, on average, since the beginning of the year. Short covering refers to traders closing out earlier positions that bet on prices dropping. The act of buying back stocks in this instance can push prices higher. That comes as the Hang Seng Index has risen 17% in the first half of the year, one of the top-performing indexes around the world.Some of the most heavily shorted Hong Kong stocks have ended up soaring this year, squeezing investors out of positions. Short interest in             AAC Technologies Holdings Inc.,       an             Apple Inc.       supplier, nearly doubled in May after Gotham City Research published a report questioning the company\u2019s results. But short interest has dropped ever since, according to IHS Markit, and the stock is still up for the year. A representative from Gotham City wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment. AAC has called the allegations \u201cinaccurate and misleading.\u201dChina-based auto maker Great Wall Motor Co. and property developer             China Evergrande Group                   have faced similar short squeezes this year, too.Worries about the enforcement of tighter regulation and potential repercussions for short sellers are also a concern in Hong Kong. Stocks are only eligible to be sold short if their daily turnover exceeds 60% of the company\u2019s market capitalization, which must also exceed 3 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$384.3 million), according to             Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.       These restrictions often make it difficult to bet against companies.Meanwhile, Hong Kong authorities declared last year that U.S. short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research was \u201creckless\u201d or \u201cnegligent\u201d for spreading false and misleading information about a Chinese property developer. Mr. Left, who is perhaps most well-known for betting against             Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.,       was banned from trading in Hong Kong stocks for five years.Public reports questioning stock valuations and corporate accounting first made a splash in Asia in 2011 with Mr. Block of Muddy Waters\u2019 successful attack on Chinese timber company Sino-Forest Corp. Late last year, he announced he was shorting China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co., which operates the most dairy farms in China, and said the company was worth \u201cclose to zero.\u201d In March, its shares fell 85% in a day and they have been halted since, with the company last month admitting it had lost track of most of its cash.At the Sohn Hong Kong investor conference last month, Mr. Block said he was shorting furniture maker             Man Wah Holdings Ltd.The stock slid by as much as 15.4% that day before being halted. Man Wah has since disputed allegations of undisclosed debt and tax inconsistencies, calling them \u201cgroundless.\u201dMan Wah\u2019s short interest surged to 15% of the company\u2019s free float right after Mr. Block\u2019s presentation, but has since fallen to about 3%, according to IHS Markit.

But plans at the utilities that drive coal demand suggest long-term prospects for the industry are grim. From small power companies to big, multi-state operators, energy providers are transforming the U.S. power grid, the WSJ\u2019s Russell Gold reports, expanding their use of natural gas, wind and solar power while shrinking the role of coal and nuclear power. The transition comes as the Trump administration has signaled it would like to help coal make a comeback, and says it wants to \u201crevive and expand\u201d nuclear energy. Utilities are heading in another direction, permanently shuttering three of every 10 coal generators in the past five years. Oregon utility PacifiCorp plans to spend $13.6 billion on wind and solar generation, and North Carolina-based         Duke Energy Corp.       expects to get 44% of its power from gas and renewables by 2026, up from 7% in 2005, with investments that will set its power plan for years to come.The consumer-sales upheaval that\u2019s roiled the retail world is hitting Southern California garment sellers hard. Jeans maker True Religion Apparel Inc. became the latest in the roughed-up field to enter bankruptcy protection, the WSJ\u2019s       Patrick Fitzgerald       reports, while seeking to reset its business by building up its digital footprint while scaling back physical stores. The company is the eighth apparel seller based in the region to hit bankruptcy court in the past two years, including American Apparel. Southern California garment sellers and manufacturers, which employ more people making and designing jeans and jackets than other pockets of the country, have been hard hit as retailers shutter stores at a record pace. Like the others, True Religion\u2019s sales have been declining for several years as customers moved away from brick-and-mortar and mall shopping toward online retailing. At the same time, premium denim sellers have been losing ground to fast-fashion and low-price apparel retailers.Tensions over globalization in the U.S. and elsewhere may fuel more trade growth between Germany and China. Meeting ahead of the international summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies, German and Chinese leaders are pledging to boost what is becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest trading relationships, the WSJ\u2019s Andrea Thomas reports, with significant new commercial deals already lined up. The pacts include an agreement between car maker         Daimler AG       and         BAIC Motor Corp.       to develop electric cars and a Chinese order for 140 aircraft from         Airbus SE.       Those deals will push more goods through distribution pipelines that are already growing: Combining exports and imports, China was Germany\u2019s leading trading partner for the first time last year, beating the U.S. and France, and China was Germany\u2019s biggest supplier of imports. Closer ties will make Germany a big destination point for China\u2019s growing maritime business, and likely a big backer of the infrastructure behind China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative.\u2018Nike was always \u2018sports, sports, sports,\u2019 but if you\u2019re over 11 years old right now, musicians are where it\u2019s at.\u2019Year-over-year growth in coal carloads carried by U.S. railroads in the first half of 2017, according to the Association of American Railroads.Federal Reserve officials are readying a new phase in monetary policy that would slowly shrink the central bank\u2019s large portfolio of bonds and other assets.

A few are taking a philosophical approach, adding that they will get there when they get there.In April, Amtrak said it would make major track repairs from Monday through Sept. 1, resulting in about 20% fewer trains in and out of New York\u2019s Penn Station. Some trains will be diverted to other stations, while others will be canceled.New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       recently acknowledged that commuters faced a \u201csummer of hell\u201d from the disruption.LIRR rider Worawat Pumisirisawat, 32 years old, said he plans to work in his office a little later each day to avoid the evening rush and walk around the city before heading to Penn Station.\u201cIt\u2019s about enjoying and spending more time, I don\u2019t have to rush walking from the office,\u201d said Mr. Pumisirisawat, who rides an LIRR train to Port Washington on Long Island.Some commuters said they have discussed the delays with their bosses, with some getting extra time to arrive at the office or receiving permission to work from home.For LIRR rider Karen Berger, working remotely isn\u2019t an option. The special-education assistant principal at a New York City public school, said she is working this summer and would spend the her extra time on the train checking her email and assuring her boss that she is on her way.\u201cI\u2019ll be emailing my boss saying \u2018Promise I\u2019ll be there soon\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m really sorry about it,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cNo one thinks like people like us, who have to be where the kids are.\u201dKeith Biondo, 63, waited for an LIRR train during a recent rush hour. He wondered who thought it would be a good idea to concentrate all the repairs in a couple of months, disrupting so many trains. He said the repairs are likely to cost companies money and valuable work time.A spokesman for Amtrak said it is aware there is \u201cnever a good time to do this work,\u201d but the repairs need to get done. \u201cOur plan is designed to try and keep long-term disruptions to a minimum,\u201d he said.When asked how he would wile away anticipated delays, Mr. Biondo said he would \u201ccurse, fulminate, get angry, get stress-tension headaches, hemorrhoids and heart palpitations.\u201dThe Penn Station repairs will affect passengers on both ends of their commutes. On a recent Tuesday morning at the Upper Montclair rail station in New Jersey, Dan DePasquale said he is thankful his children are out of school. If they weren\u2019t, the delays would make his life more hectic. \u201cIt works out for me at this point because my kids are finished with school and I don\u2019t have to really help them out,\u201d he said.Mr. DePasquale, 55, commutes into New York City for his job at a video studio in Chelsea. He said his best weapon to battle the delays will be a good book. The delays, he said, are a great opportunity to catch up with summer reading, which helps him forget about how taxing commuting can be.\u201cYou think you\u2019re so close to the station and then here you are, 20 minutes later and still not arriving,\u201d he lamented.Appeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Riders Make Plans for Rail Misery.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/penn-station-commuters-brace-for-delays-and-frayed-patience-1499335202", "news_title": "N.Y.

International students contributed more than $35 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. There are 85% more international students studying at U.S. institutions than were reported a decade ago.U.S. colleges and universities\u00a0have become increasingly dependent on the revenue from international students. Public schools often charge international students two to three times what domestic students pay, helping offset the decline in state funding for public universities since the credit crisis and the demographic dip in college-aged students.The rate of international students accepted to a U.S. school that plan on enrolling held steady in the West and Northeast and declined by 5 percentage points each in the South and Midwest.Among the four states that enroll the most international students, California saw a two percentage point increase in yield, which refers to the enrollment rate of admitted students. New York and Massachusetts held steady and Texas fell by 9 percentage points.The study did not shed any light on the reason schools in Texas experienced such a steep decline but many factors are in play.International students are asking questions about how hard it will be to get a student visa, they are struggling to discern how much a U.S. degree will help their careers and whether there will be visas available for them to work here.They also have to juggle the strength of the dollar compared to their native currency and broader economic factors in their home countries.Texas may have been disproportionately impacted by the decline in oil prices which may have slowed interest among international students who have historically headed there to study oil industry-related majors.Dr. Goodman of the IIE believes that in addition, at least some of the declines are rooted in a perception of religious and racial intolerance and in some cases, gun policies. \u201cInternational students, more and more ask, \u2018Does everybody in Texas have a gun?\u2019\u201d Dr. Goodman said. \u201cMost students are coming from countries where it\u2019s not easy to get a gun and it\u2019s really easy to get a gun in America and they worry about their safety.\u201d Last year, a Texas law went into effect which allowed concealed handguns on public university campuses.Despite the large drop this year, Texas still has relatively high yield among international students, largely because of its proximity to Mexico.Students from other parts of the world are increasingly leery about the state.\u201cI think there is a PR thing that might be happening,\u201d said Teri Albrecht, director of international student scholar services at the University of Texas at Austin, which saw a small decline in undergraduate admissions this year after years of steady growth.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve had students and scholars that have concerns and might have looked elsewhere to states that don\u2019t have those laws in place.\u201dOne of the students coming to study in the U.S. is India-born Utsav Gupta. When he began looking for colleges to attend this fall, his parents said he could apply wherever he wanted, except for one state: Texas.\u201cI really wanted to apply to Rice but they didn\u2019t let me,\u201d said the 18-year-old New Delhi native,\u00a0referring to the prestigious private university in Houston.Mr. Gupta said his parents were frightened at the prospect of him studying in the state, although Rice has opted out of the law and says it remains a gun-free campus.\u201cIn India, I have never seen a handgun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that I could be sitting next to someone in class\u201d with one was disconcerting, he said. Instead, Mr. Gupta is enrolling this fall at Olin College, an engineering school in the Boston suburb of Needham, Mass.Students and their families in India are \u201cvery aware of red states vs blue states,\u201d said Kavita Mehta, chief executive of Mumbai-based higher education consulting service The Red Pen, which facilitates study abroad for several hundred Indian students like Mr. Gupta every year.Families and students tend to \u201csee the South and the middle of the country as red,\u201d Ms. Mehta said. Many are aware that political attitudes tend to be more conservative in such places. President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and tighter restrictions on H-1B visas for highly skilled workers also have fueled concerns.Two Indian nationals who worked as engineers at technology company             Garmin                   were shot in February at a bar in suburban Kansas by a man who witnesses say used racial slurs before attacking. One of the Indian men died. Both were working on H-1B visas, a Garmin spokeswoman said at the time.A string of incidents on colleges campuses, many targeting Muslims wearing hijabs, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from six countries, concerned U.S. colleges and universities. About 250 have joined a campaign called \u201cYou are welcome here\u201d that is aimed at international students.\u201cWe were hearing from a lot of prospective students more concerns than usual,\u201d said Jessica Sandberg, director of international admissions at Temple University in Philadelphia, and the leader of the campaign. She said those concerned were particularly pronounced in India. \u201cThere seems to be this sense that something has changed, there are alarm bells for them.\u201dLast month, a 26-year-old Chinese student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign disappeared. A 28-year-old former doctoral candidate in physics at the University of Illinois was arrested in connection to her disappearance.Among the Southern schools to feel the pinch is Tennessee Technological University. Associate Provost Mark Stephens said the Cookeville, Tenn., school received roughly 15% fewer international applications this year than last.\u201cIt\u2019s like paddling upstream,\u201d Dr. Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to get our message out that we respect our international students and treat them well.\u201dWrite to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com and Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.comAppeared in the July 7, 2017, print edition as 'Foreign Student Admissions Keep Pace.'", "news_time": "2017-07-06 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-lines-shape-u-s-college-picks-of-some-foreign-students-1499335203", "news_title": "Political Lines Shape U.S. College Picks of Some Foreign Students", "keywords": " colleges, foreign students,international students, universities,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Regulators and government officials across Europe are trying to lure London finance companies ahead of Brexit, sparking a continentwide backroom bidding war.The sweeteners range from the promise of cheap rents to protection of bankers\u2019 bonuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like an auction,\u201d says a lawyer advising several finance companies on their Brexit plans. The jockeying is fostering tension among European regulators and raising concerns that risk is being siphoned unchecked into the trade bloc.Take Lloyd\u2019s of London Ltd. One of the world\u2019s oldest insurance markets, Lloyd\u2019s needed a Continental base so its members could sell to European Union clients after Brexit. It explored Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg as part of its hunt for a European home before settling on Belgium.Part of the attraction: Belgian law allowed for a structure that would minimize disruption post-Brexit. Lloyd\u2019s was given permission to reinsure all the business done on the Continent back to London\u2014a move some other European regulators deemed too risky. That means Lloyd\u2019s likely won\u2019t need to park hundreds of staffers in its new Belgian unit, officials say.\u201cNot everyone was willing to allow this,\u201d says       Inga Beale,        Lloyd\u2019s of London\u2019s chief executive. A Belgian official said the structure adheres to EU-wide rules and is based on existing Belgian laws.In Brussels, the export agency points also firms to consultants who advise on ways to reduce the country\u2019s nearly 70% tax on cash bonuses, officials said. Belgium isn\u2019t alone in making life simpler for incoming financiers. The Dutch central bank recently posted an explainer on its website outlining how bankers can circumvent the country\u2019s 20% cap on bonus payments. In Vienna, officials discussed giving the European Banking Authority a rent-free office if the regulatory agency decamped there from London, according to people familiar with the matter.Still, the efforts are raising eyebrows. Around the time insurer             American International Group Inc.chose to set up a subsidiary in Luxembourg in March, aggrieved Irish officials complained to European authorities that some countries weren\u2019t playing fair, people familiar with the matter say. European officials responded by saying EU laws should be applied consistently across the region and, in some instances, releasing nonbinding guidelines for regulators on handling financial firms moving from the U.K. to stay in the bloc\u2019s single market.The EU\u2019s financial sector is governed by a series of continentwide guidelines. But the patchwork of national authorities still has significant leeway to interpret their own rules.       Dani\u00e8le Nouy,        who chairs the European Central Bank\u2019s supervisory arm, said in a speech last month she was concerned lenders \u201cmay exploit supervisory loopholes by carrying out banklike activities\u201d by operating through foreign branches or broker dealers, \u201cwhich are not supervised at euro-area level, but rather at national level.\u201dA key issue is how much EU and national regulators will allow companies to keep operations in the U.K. while selling products to European clients. Lloyd\u2019s of London, founded in a London coffee shop in the 17th century, doesn\u2019t have a major outpost in Europe, but will likely need one after Brexit so that members using the market can sell policies to European clients.But picking up and moving can be messy and expensive, so Lloyd\u2019s had a key demand for prospective nations: Underwriters should remain based in London\u2014an important ask given the EU accounts for 11%, or \u00a32.93 billion ($3.8 billion), of Lloyd\u2019s gross written insurance premiums. Lloyd\u2019s also wanted to keep as many back-office staffers in its headquarters as possible.This setup could be done by creating an entity that reinsures all of Lloyd\u2019s European business back into the U.K. EU rules give discretion to individual countries on how much reinsurance they allow. But not all regulators are comfortable with having 100% of business shifted though a subsidiary.There is a risk that if Lloyd\u2019s got into trouble, its EU entity would be on the hook to reimburse European policyholders without the funds to pay for it. Irish authorities told Lloyd\u2019s they would only allow 90% of business to be reinsured out of the country, according to people familiar with the matter. U.K. regulators wouldn\u2019t normally allow more than 50% of business to be reinsured to a foreign entity, says       Hilary Evenett,        a London-based partner at law firm Clifford Chance who specializes in insurance.Beyond the reinsure allowance, Brussels had other advantages. One of the Lloyd\u2019s executives leading the search, a Belgian native, knew the city well. The city is a two-hour train ride from London and home to influential European policy makers. Language was also a factor; the Belgian regulator, which juggles news releases in French, Dutch, and English, said it would supervise Lloyd\u2019s in English.The Belgian finance ministry saw Lloyd\u2019s as a juicy prize. If the company set up in Brussels, they guessed several insurance firms would likely follow, according to a person familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking.Belgian officials say by shifting the risk back to London they are minimizing their exposure to future problems. Regulators there also initially agreed to let Lloyd\u2019s keep most back office workers in London during the transition. There will be about 20 staffers in Brussels and others in branches throughout Europe.Brexit & Beyond: Europe in Flux is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s roundup of news and analysis of how Brexit will affect global business, economies and finance. You can sign up here.The Belgian central bank has been in touch with the U.K.\u2019s regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and is planning to arrange joint supervision of Lloyd\u2019s. The Lloyd\u2019s Brussels office, which hasn\u2019t yet been granted its license, is expected to be operational by mid-2018, so it can write insurance contracts starting Jan. 1, 2019.Soon after Lloyd\u2019s announced the deal, Irish officials asked some at the Belgian central bank how they snared the insurance market, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cWe indeed have the feeling that we will have to defend ourselves,\u201d says one Belgian official.But luring Lloyd\u2019s is already paying off for Belgium.

With the exception of state schools, they receive almost no government services: no public transport, no electricity, no sewage treatment, no water.The Israeli government says places like Wadi Na\u2019am are illegal squats on state land, and demolitions are frequent. Israel wants to relocate residents to purpose-built Bedouin towns nearby. The Negev Bedouin, who are Muslim Arabs and hold Israeli citizenship, insist that they have customary rights to their ancestral grounds. Family leaders say they would rather remain in their huts than move to the overcrowded townships.\u201cWe were here first. But the state wants to cram as many of our people as possible into as little land as possible,\u201d said Attia el-Assam, the chairman of the council of unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Negev. \u201cThe majority of the Bedouin want to be part of the state, but it\u2019s the state that keeps pushing them away.\u201dAs disaffection roils Negev\u2019s fast-growing Bedouin community, this conflict\u2014combined with the spread of more conservative Islam amid high unemployment and crime\u2014is creating new tensions in Israel\u2019s southern underbelly. Already, a Bedouin teacher and a policeman were killed when police moved to demolish buildings in the unrecognized village of Umm Hiran in January.\u201cIf this goes on like this, there will be an intifada in the Negev,\u201d said Youssef al Ziyaddin, one of the leaders of Wadi Na\u2019am. Posters of the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca and a portrait of Che Guevara hung on the wall behind him.The Negev Bedouin\u2014once nomadic but now largely settled\u2014account for roughly one-third of the Negev\u2019s current population. They speak an Arabic dialect different from that of Palestinians further north, and are related by tribal links with the Bedouin of nearby Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula.In Sinai, similar grievances over neglect and discrimination by the Egyptian government have spurred an insurgency that has since been hijacked by Islamic State\u2014and that the Egyptian military has been unable to eradicate.A similar scenario could play out in southern Israel, cautioned Talab Abu Arar, the only Negev Bedouin in the Israeli parliament and a former mayor of the Bedouin town of Arara.\u201cThe negligence of the Egyptian governments, their failure to provide full rights to the Bedouin, have pushed the Bedouins there toward violence,\u201d Mr. Abu Arar said. \u201cI have repeatedly warned the government here: the continuation of your policy of unjustly treating the Bedouin will also cause instability, making the Bedouins rise up.\u201dThere are plenty of guns to go around in the area: The school in Rahat, the biggest Negev Bedouin town, is painted over with graffiti urging people not to shoot Kalashnikov assault rifles in the air during weddings because the bullets can maim and kill once they fall down.Violent crime and drug trafficking is rife, in part because of neglect by Israeli police, Mr. Abu Arar added. \u201cAs long as we use the guns to kill each other, they don\u2019t care. They would only care if the guns were to be used against Jews,\u201d he said.Ayoob Kara, an Israeli cabinet minister who is working on the country\u2019s Bedouin policy, said that it is Arab nationalist politicians like Mr. Abu Arar who are primarily responsible for the rising tensions in the region.\u201cTheir interest is not to find a solution,\u201d Mr. Kara said. \u201cThey use democracy to create conflict because if there is conflict between the Bedouin and Israel, they receive support\u201d from voters.As for the unrecognized villages, Mr. Kara said that the Bedouin have no legal claim to the land, and should relocate to housing that the government will provide to their communities elsewhere.\u201cThey know very well they are criminal, they know the truth,\u201d Mr. Kara said. \u201cAll the time they are moving, and for them every five people is a village. It\u2019s a problem. We are now in a different world, we need centers, cities, to give them services.\u201dWhen they were living under nominal Ottoman and British authority before Israel\u2019s establishment in 1948, the Negev\u2019s Bedouin tribes usually didn\u2019t obtain formal land deeds so as not to pay tax.During Israel\u2019s war of independence, nearly 90% of the Bedouin then living in the Negev had to flee, mostly to Jordan. Only about 10,000 were allowed to remain, mostly from clans deemed loyal by Israeli military commanders. They were only permitted to live in an area around Be\u2019er Sheva known as the Siyaj. Most of the Negev was declared a restricted military zone.Until about two decades ago, it was still common for Negev Bedouin families to send their sons as volunteers in the Israeli army\u2014something that rarely happened in the Muslim Arab communities elsewhere in Israel.

AGIC plans to raise $2 billion to $3 billion for the new fund.\u201cI have investors calling me all the time, asking, \u2018Do you have something for us to invest in?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cai said.The new fund is targeting overseas and Chinese investors from the insurance, reinsurance and wealth-management sectors as well as rich individuals, Mr. Cai said. Its goal is to invest around 60% of its capital in European technology firms and the rest in U.S. investments, and to help those firms expand to China.The move comes days after AGIC struck a deal to buy The Ritedose Corporation, a Columbia, S.C.-based pharmaceutical manufacturer.Around 70% of the capital for the new fund is expected to come from investors outside of China, Mr. Cai said. The rest will come from overseas cash holdings of Chinese investors.\u201cThere is a quite strong interest by investors to bring new technologies to China,\u201d said Oliver Rui, a professor for finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. Funds like AGIC\u2019s appeal to Chinese investors, and are unlikely to attract attention from Chinese regulators as they raise the majority of capital outside the country.\u201cFrom a regulatory point of view, that\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Mr. Rui said. Chinese regulators are mostly scrutinizing big transactions by Chinese companies that involve the overseas transfer of capital, Mr. Rui said. The country\u2019s banking regulator at the end of June began a probe of the borrowings of some of the biggest Chinese overseas investors, including Anbang Insurance Group Co. and             Fosun International Ltd.Raising capital in international capital markets isn\u2019t a problem for AGIC, its chairman said. \u201cI have good contacts, especially on Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Cai said. Before co-founding AGIC in 2015, Mr. Cai worked at a number of international banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG and             BNP Paribas SA      .Among the shareholders of his existing fund are sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp., and Chinese insurance firms             Citic Securities Co.       Ltd. and             China Life Insurance Co.       Ltd.Mr. Cai is focused on European technology, especially from Germany\u2019s so called Mittelstand sector comprising medium-size, industrial companies. AGIC was part of a consortium led by China National Chemical Corp. that last year agreed to buy German equipment maker KraussMaffei Group GmbH for $1 billion.\u201cFor bigger deals, we would look at partnering with a Chinese partner,\u201d Mr. Cai said. AGIC would do deals of up to \u20ac300 million ($340 million) alone, he added.The fund aims at taking a controlling stake\u2014with veto rights and a board seat\u2014in companies and sees itself as an adviser that helps these companies bring their technology to China, Mr. Cai said. It plans to invest in companies focusing on industrial automation, robotics, mechatronics and semiconductor components.AGIC became majority shareholder of Gimatic SpA, a producer of pneumatic and mechatronic grippers used in industrial manufacturing, in July 2016. Earlier this year, the fund acquired a majority stake in Fotona Holdings LLC, a maker of high-performance lasers.The firm has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Munich, Germany. AGIC is looking to open a London office soon, he said, but because of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, the fund isn\u2019t actively looking for U.K. investments. \u201cWe will wait and see first,\u201d Mr. Cai said.Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 05:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/henry-cais-agic-capital-plans-to-launch-new-fund-this-year-1499332706", "news_title": "Henry Cai\u2019s AGIC Capital Plans to Launch New Fund This Year", "keywords": "agic,agic capital, china, henry cai, hong kong,pe funds, private equity, private equity fund,Henry Cai,corporate funding,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,private equity,venture funding,interviews with corporate executives,interviews"}, {"content": "A controversial new metric on executive pay is on Congress\u2019s chopping block. Shareholders should want it to survive, even if it only provides a sliver of insight into the companies they own.Beginning next spring, possible repeal notwithstanding, companies will be required to publish a Bigwig vs. Regular Joe pay ratio, or the total earnings of the chief executive compared with those of the median employee.Supporters of the rule, part of the post-financial crisis Dodd-Frank Act, hope disclosure at an individual-company level might focus more attention on inequality and sky-high CEO pay. The ratio has ballooned since the 1970s: The bosses of America\u2019s 350 largest companies made on average 276 times the money of their rank-and-file subordinates in 2015, up from 30 times in 1978, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.Republicans want to repeal the requirement, along with other controversial bits of Dodd-Frank, as a way to trim compliance costs for companies. Some also argue the ratio isn\u2019t instructive:             Wal-Mart                   will have a higher one than             Goldman Sachs,       but that only indicates that Wal-Mart employs more unskilled workers than Goldman Sachs. Comparisons within the same sector are likely to get bogged down in discussions of how one company\u2019s business model or geographic scope is different from another\u2019s.The rollback made it through a House of Representatives bill in June. Whether it can clear the Senate in time for next spring\u2019s proxy-statement season is anyone\u2019s guess.If the ratio survives, however, shareholders might find it a modestly useful addition to their analytical toolbox. The key insights will come from seeing how it evolves for a specific company over time. A widening ratio could be a warning flag that a management team is getting greedy.Executive pay ballooned in the financial sector before the 2008 banking crisis. Those companies that went bankrupt were particularly guilty of deteriorating pay practices, according to an analysis of governance ratings by analysts at             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch. Pay ratios could have made this more obvious at the time\u2014and may help bring subsequent lapses to wider attention.Knowing what the median employee at a company makes would also fill gaps in investors\u2019 understanding, such as how the wage bill compares with other costs. Admittedly, the SEC only requires companies to update the calculation once every three years, so useful insights into how the median wage changes relative to profit, say, would take years to emerge.VIEW InteractiveThat said, investors shouldn\u2019t assume more thriftily paid bosses offer value for money. Simplistic studies can show an association between lower pay and higher returns, but this is partly because larger companies pay better while small-caps usually outperform large-caps.Adjusting for size, using actual realized rather than the estimated target pay disclosed in proxy filings, and factoring in the performance of previously awarded shares, PricewaterhouseCoopers found a strongly positive correlation between executive pay and three-year total returns for big U.K. companies. This is logical, given how much executive pay is triggered by return thresholds these days.Investors should welcome any move toward greater transparency, but wield their new analytical tool with caution.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-06 05:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ceo-worker-pay-ratio-generates-outrageand-some-insight-1499332341", "news_title": "CEO-Worker Pay Ratio Generates Outrage\u2014And Some Insight", "keywords": "banking crisis,ceo pay,executive pay,financial crisis,lehman brothers,pay ratios,regulations,regulation,government policy,management,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Donald Trump       says China could do a lot more to rein in its recalcitrant neighbor. When it comes to trade, he has a point.After North Korea\u2019s successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, Mr. Trump cited Chinese customs data showing that the country\u2019s trade with North Korea was up nearly 40% on the year in the first quarter, despite promises from Chinese President       Xi Jinping       to ratchet up pressure on its neighbor following this spring\u2019s Mar-a-Lago summit.China has put the squeeze on in one important way, \u00a0blocking North Korean coal imports, although some black-market activity is almost certainly carrying on. As recently as February, before the Trump-Xi summit, coal counted for about half of North Korea\u2019s export earnings from China.Yet that tough action hasn\u2019t been matched elsewhere. As coal imports have withered, imports of another commodity, iron ore, have ramped up. The increase may not be deliberate. China\u2019s real-estate market, the main demand driver for iron ore, has recovered sharply over the past year. But the numbers are striking: Iron-ore imports from North Korea quadrupled in value in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier and were twice as high by tonnage. China\u2019s overall iron-ore import tonnage rose only 12% on the year in the first quarter. By banning North Korean iron-ore imports as well, China could instantly deprive it of an additional $10 million or $20 million each month, equivalent to around 10% of China\u2019s trade surplus with the country.Other problems lie with the numbers themselves. Chinese customs abruptly stopped reporting crude-oil export volumes to North Korea in 2014, but Chinese state firms such as China National Petroleum Corp. continue to serve as a lifeline for North Korea\u2019s energy sector, exporting crude and diesel from northeastern Chinese cities.China could do much more to make life hard for North Korea, but it fears pushing too hard lest the regime collapse, resulting in a flood of refugees and, perhaps, American troops on its border. For Mr. Trump and the U.S., however, a North Korea with intercontinental ballistic missiles is clearly unacceptable\u2014particularly when progress appears sparse in other areas of the Sino-U.S. relationship, including trade.U.S.-China trade tensions have taken a back seat to other concerns for investors since the Mar-a-Lago summit.

It is also believed to be the heaviest payload Mr. Musk\u2019s team has ever put into space.Roughly three minutes into the flight, the rocket\u2019s lower stage separated and the upper stage\u2019s engine ignited as planned. Some five minutes later, the upper engine shut down as the satellite continued on its way.Rebounding from launch delays stemming from two Falcon 9 explosions spanning 2015 and 2016, SpaceX is seeking to reassure commercial and U.S. government customers that it is safely ramping up its launch tempo. The company has targeted for later this year the initial flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket, a Falcon 9 derivative featuring 27 main engines and roughly twice the lifting capacity of SpaceX\u2019s current fleet of boosters.Wednesday\u2019s mission was the 10th successful launch of a Falcon 9 this year, already beating SpaceX\u2019s previous record of eight launches in 2016.With some $10 billion in launch business on its books, including contracts from the Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, SpaceX has set the pace for the budding commercial space industry. But in addition to its swift growth and lofty ambitions\u2014including a manned flyby of the moon as early as next year\u2014the company is renowned for a scrappy attitude and nimble engineering culture that is determined to make decisions more quickly than legacy competitors or government agencies.NASA probably would have taken more than a day to analyze the flood of available data surrounding Monday\u2019s countdown, which was stopped roughly 10 seconds before liftoff, according to some industry officials. But barely hours after the launch was scrubbed, Mr. Musk posted a message on Twitter saying that company experts intended to be \u201cdoing a full review of rocket and pad systems\u201d on the July 4 holiday. By Wednesday morning, SpaceX sent an email alerting the media that the launch was reset for that evening, without elaborating on the cause of the earlier problem.Some six minutes before liftoff, the narrator of the launch webcast said engineers had determined that Monday\u2019s scrub was caused by a computer-generated warning about the rocket\u2019s avionics, or flight-control systems. But       John Insprucker,        the narrator, also said that engineers had \u201cconfirmed the rocket was good\u201d and no hardware changes were required. Instead, a software tweak solved the problem.The fast turnaround was reminiscent of instances over the years when SpaceX demonstrated its troubleshooting capabilities. In December 2010, when two cracks were discovered at the end of the second-stage engine nozzle on a Falcon 9, Mr. Musk and his designers were able to implement a makeshift but workable solution to trim off the suspect section of the nozzle in just one day.Less than two years later, when SpaceX made history by becoming the first company to send a capsule to rendezvous with the international space station, SpaceX engineers improvised a tweak to part of the distance-measuring radar system used by the unmanned, bell-shaped Dragon to safely approach the station.Before the end of the decade, company officials hope to routinely launch at least one SpaceX rocket every week.From the start, SpaceX was committed to breaking rocketry conventions by developing a series of enhanced versions of its rockets, while flying older models in the interim. With NASA\u2019s blessing, the company also set out to reduce costs and speed up production, partly by cutting back on traditional quality-control checks and inspections of parts from subcontractors.The failure of a substandard structural part inside the upper stage of a Falcon 9 caused a 2015 explosion during a flight, leading the company to step up inspections. The blast, followed by a second accident during prelaunch ground tests in 2016, prompted concern among senior NASA officials about SpaceX\u2019s management practices and production safeguards.Since then, the company has focused on whittling down its backlog of launches and demonstrating the benefits of reusing as many of the components of its rockets as feasible.Corrections & Amplifications   SpaceX plans a manned flyby of the moon as early as next year.
