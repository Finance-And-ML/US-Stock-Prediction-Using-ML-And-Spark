Under the new rules, for instance, a sister or a husband of an American citizen wouldn\u2019t fall under the ban, but an aunt or a grandparent would.But late Thursday, the administration reversed course and included people engaged to be married on the list of those with close family ties who are exempt from the ban.The new rules came under immediate legal challenge. Challengers in one of the two principal legal cases, from Hawaii, made emergency court filings Thursday asking a federal judge there to \u201cclarify\u201d what the Trump administration can and can\u2019t do with its partial ban. They argued for a broader set of exemptions.It was unclear when the court would rule.The travel ban has been one of the most divisive acts of Donald Trump\u2019s short presidency. Mr. Trump and his backers have argued it is an overdue effort to fight terrorism, while a coalition of Democrats, immigration lawyers, refugee advocates and Muslim activists say it runs contrary to the Constitution and American values of diversity.\u201cAs recent events have shown, we are living in a very dangerous time, and the U.S. government needs every available tool to prevent terrorists from entering the country and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,\u201d said White House spokesman Michael Short.While the executive order on the travel ban has been toned down since its introduction in January, it continues to spark protests. Still, few people on either side of the debate were expecting the sort of chaos that unfolded at airports following the abrupt implementation of the first version of the order.A revision issued in March after courts blocked the initial one exempted travelers holding visas and legal permanent U.S. residents. Administration officials said Thursday that, under the latest rules, refugees booked for travel before July 6 will be admitted.Guidelines being issued to Customs and Border Protection agents who work at ports of entry direct them to honor valid visas and only turn back people who would be rejected under normal operating procedures, administration officials said.But concerned about the sort of bad publicity that accompanied the first order, officials cautioned that foreigners arriving in the U.S. are routinely subjected to rigorous screening and said advocates shouldn\u2019t assume the executive order is to blame if someone from one of the targeted countries is subjected to it.Most of the action is likely to be invisible to the public, unfolding overseas at the desks of consulate officers as they reject visa applications from citizens of the targeted nations\u2014Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u2014that might have otherwise been accepted. People rejected for visas can request waivers, and they will be considered case by case, officials said.For refugees, Mr. Trump set the cap on admissions for this fiscal year at 50,000, and officials said that as of Wednesday evening, 49,009 had already been admitted. Under the Supreme Court ruling, though, refugees who can prove close ties to the U.S. won\u2019t be counted in the total.Both the January and March executive orders were quickly put on hold by federal courts around the country, finding them likely to be unconstitutional. The first order was found to lack due-process protections. Lower court judges ruled the March order likely discriminated against Muslims and said the president didn\u2019t properly justify the action.The Immigration and Nationality Act defines:On Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to begin implementing the order until the justices can hear and rule on a pair of legal challenges this fall. But the high court also ordered the administration to make exceptions for visa and refugee applicants who have a bona fide relationship with people or institutions in the U.S.Interpreting that order, administration officials said visa applicants and refugees with U.S.-based spouses, children, parents and siblings, including in-law and step relationships, would be allowed in. But those with only lesser ties\u2014such as grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles and cousins\u2014would be subject to the ban.A senior administration official said the line designating close family ties was drawn to ensure the exceptions aren\u2019t so broad as to swallow the rules altogether and allow virtually anyone in.Officials said the administration based its decision on exemptions for relatives on the definition of family in the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. The administration added parents-in-law, as they were specified in the court decision, officials said.The change on fianc\u00e9s was made at the suggestion of government attorneys, an administration official said.For refugees, the administration closed off one potential path to admission. The State Department said a connection to a resettlement agency isn\u2019t a bona fide relationship that qualifies for an exception to the ban. Agencies had argued that it was.Hawaii\u2019s challenge asked that the ban not be enforced against people with other types of family relationships. The state also argued that the ban shouldn\u2019t apply to refugees with a close connection to a person or organization in the U.S., even if that connection wasn\u2019t family-based.The definition of close family ties came under immediate fire from advocates.\u201cHow is a sister a \u2018bona fide\u2019 relationship but a grandparent is not? Especially when you\u2019re talking about a culture where family relationships are very fluid,\u201d said Sirine Shebaya, a senior staff attorney for Muslim Advocates. \u201cA grandmother is sometimes as close as your mother.\u201dThose who want to come for business must show a \u201cformal, documented\u201d relationship with a U.S. entity that was formed in the ordinary course of business and not created for the purpose of evading the travel ban, officials said, echoing the language of the Supreme Court decision.Examples of acceptable business ties include students admitted to U.S. educational institutions, people who have accepted a job offer in the U.S. or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the U.S. Those examples were spelled out in the court ruling and repeated Thursday by the administration.Among the six nations, the order\u2019s biggest impact is likely to be on Iran, which sends far more people to the U.S. than any of the others. The number of visitors from all six countries has fallen compared with last year, but Iran still sent 1,284 in April, the Department of Homeland Security said earlier this month.The 90-day period covering the ban on visitors from the six countries began Monday following the high-court action. At the end of it, the administration could decide to extend the existing restrictions, add additional countries to the list or otherwise modify the list.When the Supreme Court hears arguments on the executive order in October, it is possible that the original travel restrictions would have been replaced by new ones, based on the reviews that are now under way. That could give the court an opening to avoid issuing a definitive ruling on the policy now in place.\u2014Ian Lovett, Brent Kendall and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Trump\u2019s Travel Ban Goes Into Effect.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 23:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-begins-stricter-limits-on-entry-to-u-s-1498736379", "news_title": "Trump Administration Tightens Limits on Getting Into the U.S., Targeting Six Nations and Refugee Program", "keywords": "homeland security,muslim travel ban,terrorism,terrorists,trump administration,trump travel ban,State Department,National Immigration Law Center,political,general news,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Eleven states led by Texas are threatening to sue the Trump administration if it doesn\u2019t follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to end a program that protects young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.The threat, conveyed in a letter sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, shows how the president is under pressure from conservatives who say he hasn\u2019t done enough to crack down on illegal immigration, even as he endures a steady stream of criticism from those on the left who think he is far too harsh.As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, calling it an \u201cunconstitutional executive amnesty.\u201d But since the election, he has said he doesn\u2019t want these young people to worry, and his administration has kept the program in place.That decision has long annoyed people who are otherwise allies on a range of immigration issues.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has worked to implement a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries that the president deems security risks, has stepped up arrests of people in the U.S. illegally and backed a crackdown on sanctuary cities. But immigration hard-liners say it is unacceptable for him to allow the DACA program, which started under former President       Barack Obama,        to continue.The program has given a temporary reprieve from deportation and work permits to about 750,000 young people, termed \u201cdreamers.\u201d The administration has approved tens of thousands of new and renewal DACA applications since Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Obama tried to expand the program to cover parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. That was successfully challenged by Texas and other states in court, and the program, sometimes called DAPA, never took effect.Now 11 states are threatening to amend the complaint in the DAPA suit to challenge DACA if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t end it on its own by Sept. 5.\u201cJust like DAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for work authorization, and lawful presence without any statutory authorization from Congress,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a letter also signed by nine other attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho and West Virginia, as well as Idaho Gov.

He did it after more than a decade of only limited success on his sport\u2019s World Cup circuit and at an age when most competitors in his sport are getting worse, not better.If Bailey were Norwegian, the triumph might get his face on billboards throughout Oslo, turn him into a national hero, and make him wealthy. But Bailey is from the U.S., where biathlon\u2014a sport that combines target shooting and cross-country skiing\u2014is the ultimate niche endeavor. He has led a decidedly un-Scandinavian existence since his signature win.There were no parades in his hometown and adoring fans rarely interrupt the few dinners he can afford to eat out. He spent most of April in Montana, planning for a post-retirement job running a nonprofit Nordic sports center that he plans to take up full-time following next year\u2019s Olympics.\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for             Nike                   to call,\u201d Bailey said last week, while driving from his home in upstate New York to Maine for a board meeting of the U.S. Biathlon, for which he is an athlete representative.Indeed, he hasn\u2019t signed a single additional sponsorship deal. He finances his pursuits with about $50,000 in prize money he won during the best year of his career; $25,000 a year from the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. biathlon federation; and limited support from the Lake Placid Olympic Regional Development Authority, and equipment makers Rossignol and One Way. The U.S. team\u2019s apparel sponsor Adidas, gave him a performance bonus of nearly $10,000 and he earned about $15,000 in performance bonuses from the federation.Bailey is already training full-time in pursuit of the first-ever U.S. Olympic medal in biathlon\u2014the only winter Olympic sport in which the U.S. has never won a medal.There is this consolation: In a Steph and Riley Curry-type moment, Bailey did an interview on Norwegian television after winning the world championship holding his then-eight-month old baby, Ophelia, who sucked on his medal. That video endeared him to that Nordic-sports obsessed country. Like an obscure indie rock band, Bailey is unknown in his home country, but \u201chuge in Oslo.\u201dMax Cobb, executive director of U.S. Biathlon, said the federation gets autograph requests for Bailey \u201cfrom all over the world, but unfortunately not too many with American postage on them.\u201dBiathlon presents one the most arduous tests in sports. Competitors have to survive torturous circuits on cross-country ski trails, then come flying into a shooting range and calm their breathing and heart rates enough to shoot five targets from 50 meters as thousands of fans scream from nearby bleachers. Missed targets result in humiliating laps around a penalty loop.Bailey got into the sport when his parents moved from North Carolina to New York. As a teenager he excelled in cross-country skiing and got invited to a biathlon training camp in Lake Placid, site of the 1980 Olympics and one of the few world-class biathlon facilities in the U.S.Two decades later, Bailey was supposed to be finished with biathlon after the 2015-16 season. He and his wife were expecting their first child last June. They purchased 70 head of cattle and planned to start a business on land near Lake Placid where his wife\u2019s family used to operate a bison farm.Then Bailey got a call from a group looking for the right person to help develop the Crosscut\u200bMountain Sports Center in Bozeman, Mont. The group was in the process of acquiring 500 acres for roughly $7 million to build a facility that will accommodate everything from Nordic sports, including an elite biathlon training center, to fat -tire mountain biking.Bailey was the most prominent U.S. biathlete. His wife, Erika, had experience with land preservation and acquisition. If Bailey wanted to continue competing, the group told him he could begin part-time work during the off-seasons and start full-time after the 2018 Olympics. The perfect post-career landing spot had fallen into his lap. Bailey could take a run at his fourth Olympic team.After Ophelia arrived last June 15, the Baileys decided they would stay together through the season, toting Ophelia, through Scandinavia, Russia, Eastern Europe and other World Cup outposts. Bailey felt more relaxed than ever. While he still cared desperately about his success, he didn\u2019t feel like his performances defined him.\u201cIt was so much easier to let go of whatever happened,\u201d he said.On February 16 in Hochfilzen, Austria, Bailey went 20 for 20 on the target range during a 20-kilometer race. He beat Ondrej Moravec of the Czech Republic by three seconds and Martin Fourcade of France, currently the best in the world, by 21.There were plenty of celebratory messages from back home in Lake Placid, and some brief write-ups in national publications but little more attention than that.Bailey returned home in late March. He spent April in Montana working on the sports center, letting his body rest up, and squeezing in some recovery training. For Bailey, that meant mountain trail runs of 90-120 minutes and the occasional kayaking expedition.By May 1, he was back in Lake Placid to begin training for this Olympic season. Morning workouts last as long as three hours and can include roller skiing eight miles up Whiteface Mountain, or a workout that combines intervals of high-intensity roller-skiing and shooting. A two-hour afternoon workout of road cycling, trail running, and a strength workout follows.Bailey remains hopeful that, as the Olympics approach, some blue-chip company will want to attach itself to his recent triumph and the hopes for a first U.S. biathlon medal\u2014or even to the team itself, which has no title sponsor. If none of that happens, he says he will remain thankful for the rewards of 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s the idea that you worked your whole life for something and finally achieved it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the knowledge that all of the work paid off.\u201dWrite to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'How a Winter Champion Spends His Summer.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 23:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-winter-sports-world-champ-spends-his-summer-vacation-1498765360", "news_title": "How a Winter Sports World Champ Spends His Summer Vacation", "keywords": "biathlon,lowell bailey,cross-country skiing,sports,recreation,winter sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.\u2014A former government official accused of selling classified documents to China was ordered free on bond Thursday despite government concerns that he could flee the country.Kevin Mallory,        60 years old, of Leesburg, Va., was arrested last week and charged under the federal Espionage Act.Prosecutor       John Gibbs       said wigs, fake mustaches and other elements of disguise were found at Mr. Mallory\u2019s home. \u201cThe Chinese government would have a great incentive to get him out of the country,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said.U.S. Magistrate       Ivan Davis       dismissed the government\u2019s concerns and adopted the findings of a pretrial services report that concluded Mr. Mallory could safely be released pending trial under conditions that include home detention with electronic monitoring. He also imposed a $10,000 unsecured bond.Mr. Mallory is an Army veteran who speaks fluent Mandarin and worked as a special agent for the Diplomatic Security Service at the State Department, according to an FBI affidavit. He held a top-secret security clearance while he worked at other government agencies and contractors and was familiar with espionage tradecraft, according to the affidavit.Prosecutors allege Mr. Mallory sent three documents containing classified information, one of which was top secret, to a suspected Chinese intelligence agent.Mr. Mallory\u2019s public defender,       Geremy Kamens,        questioned whether the government is misinterpreting his client\u2019s actions. He pointed to parts of the FBI affidavit that show Mr. Mallory reached out voluntarily to old contacts at one government agency and offered details of his contacts with the Chinese. The FBI, though, said Mr. Mallory never volunteered any information until after he was found with undeclared cash earlier this year on a return trip from China.Mr. Kamens said in a court motion that Mallory enlisted in the Army in 1977 and his military service, including time as a reservist, extended through 2011. According to Mr. Kamens, Mr. Mallory was stationed in Iraq in 2005 and was captured and held at a checkpoint for three days, suffering injuries that require multiple surgeries.\u201cMr. Mallory is the straightest of straight arrows,\u201d Mr. Kamens said.Prosecutors have the option to appeal the magistrate\u2019s decision to a district court judge.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-29 22:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-grants-bond-to-man-accused-of-spying-for-china-1498788808", "news_title": "Judge Grants Bond to Man Accused of Spying for China", "keywords": "china,china spy,espionage,mallory,spy for china,Kevin Mallory,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action"}, {"content": "State lawmakers agreed to extend mayoral control over New York City public schools for two years on Thursday, one day before Mayor       Bill de Blasio\u2019s       authority over the nation\u2019s largest district was set to expire.After weeks of nail-biting over the issue at City Hall, the mayor held a news conference. There was an \u201cincredible feeling of relief when we finally got the news,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s very liberating to have it behind us so now we can get back to the core agenda.\u201dThe deal in Albany came after a hectic extraordinary session called by Gov.       Andrew Cuomo.       He forced lawmakers back to the Capitol on Wednesday, a week after their session officially ended with a deadlock on the matter.The governor and legislative leaders had expressed support for mayoral control, saying the system for 1.1 million students needed continuity of governance and clear accountability at the top. But until Thursday they couldn\u2019t agree on the strings attached.In the end, opponents of charter schools claimed victory that the bill\u2019s language didn\u2019t include an increase in the number of charters that can open in New York City, which had been a sticking point.But when asked whether he agreed to measures friendly to the charter-school community as part of the negotiations, Mr. de Blasio said the city had found areas of common interest with the pro-charter groups, and an announcement would come soon. \u201cThose ideas are being crystallized into a final form,\u201d he said.The two-year extension means the governor won\u2019t have to haggle over this law again next year when he runs for re-election.The deal extends a variety of local sales taxes and business incentives for lower Manhattan. It also provides flood relief for communities near Lake Ontario, helps an upstate racetrack casino stay open and names the replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge after the late Gov. Mario Cuomo.The governor said his father would have objected to having his name on the bridge as an \u201cexercise in vanity,\u201d but he recognized the value of honoring public servants.The Democratic-controlled Assembly voted 115 to 15 for the package; the Republican-controlled Senate voted 51 to 2.Mr. de Blasio, who is running for reelection in November, had lobbied hard for mayoral control, and the extension exceeded the two, one-year renewals he had won before.Critics of the law said parents should have more direct say in their children\u2019s education. Some had criticized Mr. de Blasio\u2019s management. But in the end, the concept had support from business leaders, many city politicians and the United Federation of Teachers, which had called for some checks on the mayor\u2019s power as part of the renewal.Mr. Cuomo said mayoral control wasn\u2019t perfect but there was no better alternative in such a big, complex district.Previously, there was a central board of education and 32 local boards, which widely were seen as corrupt and dysfunctional.\u201cIt\u2019s mayoral control versus what?\u201d the governor asked. \u201cVersus the board of education. Forget it. It\u2019s not even close.\u201dMayoral control began in New York City under       Michael Bloomberg,        who got a seven-year stint in 2002 and then six years in 2009. If Thursday\u2019s deal hadn\u2019t gone through, City Hall had scheduled the first meeting of a new board of education on Saturday.In a statement Thursday, Sen. Majority leader John J.

Secretary-General       Antonio Guterres       praised Iran for its \u201cfull and effective\u201d compliance in his third biannual report on the implementation of the nuclear deal, which was signed by Tehran and world powers in July 2015.The report raised concerns about Iran\u2019s testing of ballistic missiles but noted the Security Council couldn\u2019t agree on whether this was a violation of a U.N. resolution known as 2231 because the text \u201ccalled on\u201d Iran rather than \u201cdemanded\u201d it cease ballistic missile activities.The nuclear deal with Iran doesn\u2019t restrict ballistic missile activity nor does it address Tehran\u2019s actions in the Middle East.\u201cThe secretary-general is immensely encouraged by the continued commitment of all parties to the agreement,\u201d       Jeffrey Feltman,        the U.N. Under-Secretary for political affairs, said to the council. He said the deal was an \u201cembodiment of successful multilateral diplomacy.\u201dU.S. Ambassador       Nikki Haley       told the Security Council that Iran cannot be trusted despite its compliance with the nuclear deal. She cited Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, its involvement in Syria\u2019s war, its support of terrorist groups and the travel of its sanctioned military commanders, saying some of these actions violated the U.N. resolution.\u201cFor our part, the United States will not continue to turn a blind eye to Iranian regime\u2019s behavior,\u201d Ms. Haley said. She criticized the Security Council for not taking steps to respond to the violations.Still, the Trump administration is reviewing the Iran deal and \u201cuntil that review is completed, we will comply with our commitments and we expect Iran to do the same,\u201d she said.Russia, China, France, the U.K. and Germany, which signed the deal, pushed back against Ms. Haley\u2019s assertions. The U.K. called the deal \u201ca diplomatic achievement.\u201dThe EU\u2019s ambassador to the U.N.,       Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida,        said the key to the deal\u2019s success was that \u201cit exclusively focuses on one particular issue: Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201dRussia criticized Mr. Guterres\u2019s report for mentioning an allegation by the U.S. that Iran procured ballistic-missile-related material, including carbon fiber in October 2016. The report said the U.N. wasn\u2019t able to verify this allegation.Iran\u2019s procurement of restricted ballistic missile material is conditional on Security Council approval under resolution 2231 and if the U.S. allegations are corroborated, then Iran would be in violation.

We will not relent,\u201d he added.Thursday\u2019s recapture of the ruined Nouri mosque came a week after Islamic State blew it up as Iraqi forces closed in, reducing to rubble the 12th-century building and its 150-foot minaret. The mosque gained notoriety when Islamic State leader       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       spoke there three years ago and declared himself the head of a caliphate, or religious empire.Col. Ryan Dillon, the Baghdad-based spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, said that Iraqi forces on Thursday cut a wedge in the middle of the area held by Islamic State, seizing the Nouri mosque and cornering the few hundred remaining fighters in half of Mosul\u2019s Old City on one side, and an area around a hospital that has been a stronghold for the group on the other side.Col. Dillon predicted that the fighting would be over in a matter of days and that it would then take time to fully clear the areas the Islamic State holdouts.\u201cWhat comes next, where to defeat ISIS, is a decision that will be made in Iraq,\u201d he said.Military officials have warned of tough fighting ahead. In recent days, Iraqi troops have faced counterattacks in the city, with Islamic State penetrating defensive lines and staging deadly attacks even in Iraqi-controlled areas. The warren of narrow streets in the Old City, where Islamic State fighters are holed up, has slowed the offensive.But the progress in beating back Islamic State has been steady, both in Mosul and in the campaign to retake Raqqa, the group\u2019s de facto capital. Col. Dillon said the persistent military pressure in the two countries means Islamic State leadership has no effective capital left.\u201cThere is no hub anymore,\u201d he said.Islamic State leaders have abandoned fighters on the battlefield, morale is plummeting and inexperienced fighters are making rookie mistakes, he added.\u201cISIS cannot stop the progress that Iraqis and Syrians have mounted in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are on the run, and we will not allow them to regroup and catch their breath.\u201dEven after Mosul is retaken, Islamic State won\u2019t be defeated in Iraq. The group remains in control of a number of other smaller Iraqi towns and a significant swath of territory in Syria, including eastern Deir Ezzour province and Raqqa. And while it has lost much of the territory it captured over the past few years, it has proven it is still capable of mounting deadly terrorist attacks in the West as well as in the heavily fortified Iraqi capital of Baghdad, where bombers get through daily.To the northwest of Mosul lies militant-held Tal Afar, likely the next military objective for the Iraqi military. However the battle for that town near the Syrian border is already fraught before it has even begun, with Iran-backed Shiite militias insisting they lead the fight and the U.S. saying it won\u2019t work with those militias.If the Shiite militias do take the lead, it will likely inflame sectarian tensions with Sunnis across the country.The town of Hawija, south of Mosul, has also long been a Sunni extremist stronghold and poses a constant threat to the neighboring city of Kirkuk. In October, militants from Hawija launched a complex attack on downtown Kirkuk that took days to quell and left dozens dead.When Islamic State is defeated, the Iraqi government will face enormous challenges in resettling hundreds of thousands of people displaced from Mosul and reconstructing the enormous ruin of three years of war. The government must also take steps to ameliorate the strife that has only deepened between the country\u2019s three main groups\u2014Shiite Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds.The government\u2019s goal in rebuilding Mosul and restoring its pre-Islamic State population of about 1.5 million is seen as critical to its effort to reunite the country. Islamic State launched a drive in 2014 that ended up with the militants in control of about one-third of Iraq, and with Mosul their de facto capital in the country.Since the start of Iraq\u2019s Mosul campaign in October, more than 875,00 residents have fled the city, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Some return only to retrieve bodies from homes collapsed in the fighting. Those who remained line up for hours for clean water from tanker trucks.Mosul policeman Azad Thiyab Jasim said recently that he has little hope that the city will remain peaceful after Islamic State is driven out.He said the criminal justice system makes it far too easy for suspected sympathizers or even fighters to go free. That means vigilantism rules on the streets, which can feed a cycle of revenge.\u201cKilling members of Daesh is much better than detaining them,\u201d he said.Write to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com and Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'After Seizing Mosque, Iraqis Declare ISIS Close to Defeat.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 20:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-is-near-defeat-in-iraq-prime-minister-says-1498753630", "news_title": "Islamic State Is Near Defeat in Iraq, Prime Minister Says    ", "keywords": "iraq extremism,iraqi government,islamic state in iraq,islamic state of iraq ,syrian war,terrorism,terrorists,Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       recent bid to acquire             Whole Foods Market Inc.inflamed concerns in the U.S. about big tech companies taking over America.In China, that\u2019s already happening.         Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       and         Tencent Holdings Ltd.       are online-offline conglomerates each with hundreds of millions of users. The pair\u2014directly or through companies they invest in\u2014provides services and products across a range of businesses from retail, media and entertainment to health care, payment, banking, logistics and transportation.Their market capitalizations, Alibaba at $358 billion and Tencent at $350 billion, are much higher than those of the state-owned enterprises that dominate the Chinese economy. The country\u2019s biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, is valued at $261 billion; the telecom titan China Mobile is valued at $218 billion. The tech giants, with their wide reach into many facets of daily life, touch ordinary Chinese in ways state companies don\u2019t.As their size and influence grow, Alibaba and Tencent are entering uncharted territory: Never in nearly seven decades of Communist Party rule have private-sector companies held such sway over the economy and society. How well they handle relationships with competitors, old-line companies and, ultimately, an authoritarian government that isn\u2019t used to sharing power will be a top challenge in coming years.\u201cThe most important counterbalancing force against Alibaba and Tencent will probably not come from their direct competitors but the government and the traditional industries they disrupt,\u201d says Yin Sheng, an independent technology consultant who owns shares in both companies. As the two tech companies push further into other sectors, Mr. Yin believes established businesses will lobby the government to enforce tax, antimonopoly and other rules.A Tencent spokeswoman said the company \u201cviews our peers in the internet sector and traditional industries as partners\u201d and \u201cthe healthy growth of the internet industry will benefit users, industry players\u201d and the economy. Alibaba didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Alibaba and Tencent need to tread carefully. Some of China\u2019s wealthiest businessmen ended up in jail, often when they appeared to fall out of favor with the government. Earlier this month, the government said it was investigating the borrowings of some highflying private conglomerates to rein in runaway debt.Bitterness from the old guard is already spilling into view. On a popular business program on national TV late last year, beverage tycoon\u2014and once China\u2019s richest man\u2014      Zong Qinghou       dismissed as \u201cnonsense\u201d Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma\u2019s idea that a new world is being created as data and growing computing power transform industries from retail to manufacturing.\u201cHe\u2019s not in the physical economy. What does he make?\u201d Mr. Zong said. The other two panelists, heads of two biggest electronic appliance makers, concurred. An Alibaba executive was quoted in Chinese media at the time as saying that Mr. Zong\u2019s comments were illogical.Mr. Zong is one of the more outspoken among a cadre of traditional entrepreneurs raising questions about whether the internet businesses should continue to benefit from preferential policies. Online shops operated by individuals and small businesses, for example, pay extremely low to no taxes under a policy that was aimed at nurturing a fledgling e-commerce sector. But that sector is now huge.Members of this business lobby raised the e-commerce taxation issue during spring meetings of the legislature and a top government advisory body. They noted that current tax rules put traditional retailers at a disadvantage and urged the government to heed their complaints because they employ more people than the online firms.Big tech firms have also been called bullies and monopolists because of their treatment of competitors. When Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s China operation was battling Didi Chuxing Technology Co. more than a year ago, for example, Tencent, a Didi investor, blocked some of Uber China\u2019s service accounts on WeChat, its popular messaging app. Some online commentators excoriated Tencent for abusing its power. Uber sold its China operation to Didi last year.Above all, there\u2019s their delicate relationships with the government. As I wrote earlier, once disrupters, China\u2019s internet companies are now part of the system. But still, they\u2019re private enterprises founded by ambitious men.\u201cThe question is whether these companies will demand more say in things as they grow bigger,\u201d says Jingzhou Tao, managing partner of China practice at law firm Dechert LLP.Mr. Tao points out that private ownership is increasingly at odds with the current political environment. The Communist Party is strengthening its command of state-owned businesses and building up its presence in private and multinational companies. \u201cWill it come to a point that the party committee will take charge of private enterprises too?\u201d he says.For now, neither side is testing the line in the sand. The government knows these companies are important and globally known. The companies are being supportive of Beijing\u2019s goals. Alibaba\u2019s Mr. Ma recently traveled to America to talk up the benefits of China-U. S. trade, and Tencent\u2019s Pony Ma organized a forum on improving the competitiveness of Hong Kong, a former British colony, and the surrounding area.Both sides are fumbling for \u201cthe best way to coexist,\u201d says an executive who has worked on government relations for decades.Write to Li Yuan at li.yuan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Alibaba, Tencent Must Tread Cautiously.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 20:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-entrepreneurs-need-to-watch-their-backs-1498728853", "news_title": "To See What It Will Be Like When Amazon Owns Everything, Look at China", "keywords": "alibaba ,amazon whole foods ,big chinese tech companies and the government ,chinacircuit,china circuit,china tech companies ,didi chuxing technology,jack ma ,tencent holdings ,uber china ,whole foods market ,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Alibaba Group,BABA,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,corporate,industrial news,entrepreneurs,machinery,textile machinery manufacturing,wooden furniture,consumer goods,e-commerce,furniture,industrial goods,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Wall Street\u2019s top regulator is moving to grease the way for more initial public offerings by expanding a tool that has allowed many startups to more stealthily plan their stock sales.The Securities and Exchange Commission, whose new chairman,       Jay Clayton,        has said he wants to boost the number of IPOs, announced late Thursday that it would allow all companies to file paperwork confidentially as a first step toward going public. Until now, that privilege has only been available to firms with less than $1 billion in annual revenue.Under the new policy, effective July 10, companies will be able to file information about their finances and business trends with the SEC, but the document could be withheld from investors until 15 days before the so-called roadshow where firms meet with prospective investors. The move will allow a firm and its founders to keep the information under wraps until they have resolved to sell shares publicly.The SEC said in a press release that, because the deal prospectus will be secret, firms will have more flexibility to time their offering. They could, for instance, delay the deal if markets are volatile or a shock has spooked potential investors. The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, allowed startups and smaller businesses to withhold their registration statements from the public until just before shares would be sold.\u201cIt provides companies with flexibility in markets that are uncertain to start the process without the fear they might not complete it and still expose their confidential information to competitors, and incur the stigma associated with announcing a process and being unable to complete it,\u201d said Steven Bochner, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., who specializes in IPOs and other securities deals.Mr. Clayton, a political independent appointed by President       Donald Trump,        has said regulators should find ways to encourage more companies to go public. Mr. Clayton has said retail investors would benefit from having access to shares in promising young companies, instead of that equity being reserved for wealthy private investors. The U.S. had 3,754 public companies at the end of 2015, down from a peak of 7,428 in 1997, according to data from New York University professor Alexander Ljungqvist.The new policy represents Mr. Clayton\u2019s first move to juice the IPO market. The policy is also available to public companies that sell new shares within the first year of their IPO, the SEC said.\u201cBy expanding a popular JOBS Act benefit to all companies, we hope that the next American success story will look to our public markets when they need access to affordable capital,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 20:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-all-companies-can-now-file-secretly-for-ipos-1498783752", "news_title": "SEC Says All Companies Can Now File Secretly for IPOs ", "keywords": "confidentiality,investors,ipo,pe legal,prospectus,sec,vc regulatory,Securities and Exchange Commission,Jay Clayton,corporate changes,regulation,government policy,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "New York\u2018The Traveling Lady,\u201d among the most tenderly poignant of the soft-spoken studies of small-town life in which       Horton Foote       specialized, has had its ups and downs\u2014mostly the latter.

(Harrison is the kind of town whose residents are apt to ask one another questions like \u201cWhat part of the cemetery are they buryin\u2019 you?\u201d)As always, Mr. Pendleton has staged \u201cThe Traveling Lady\u201d with a gentle understatement that draws you in before you know it, and his actors exude a feeling of community so strong as to create the impression that they\u2019ve known one another for years, maybe decades. To single out Ms. Lichty, Mr. Sosko,       Larry Bull       and       Lynn Cohen       for special mention is to disserve the similarly persuasive performances of their six colleagues, who are excellent without exception.       Amy Stoller,        who is credited in the program with \u201cdialect design,\u201d is presumably responsible for ensuring that everyone in \u201cThe Traveling Lady\u201d sounds like a native-born Texan, not a tin-eared caricature. That, too, would surely have pleased Mr. Foote, as would the fact that his play is being performed in a theater whose 179 seats are all close enough to the stage that you can hear the actors breathe.New YorkScott McPherson\u2019s \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room,\u201d which ran off Broadway in 1991 and was filmed five years later, has made it to Broadway at last. I\u2019m surprised it took so long, since it\u2019s the kind of play that typically goes over big there, a kitchen-sink-and-hospital-room cancer comedy in which all of the characters say cleverish things most of the time. The characters in question include Bessie (      Lili Taylor      ), a dutiful daughter who comes down with leukemia after spending 20 years caring for her (unseen) senile father; Lee (      Janeane Garofalo      ), Bessie\u2019s not-so-dutiful sister, who flew the family coop as fast as she could but now finds herself saddled with a teenage son (      Jack DiFalco      ) who set fire to her house and is now in a mental institution, and\u2026but you get the idea, right? Lots of laughs, lots of jerked tears, very little reality.Anne Kauffman,        the director, stages the handful of serious scenes in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d with sensitive simplicity and makes the others seem at least possible, if not truly believable. It happens that Ms. Kauffman also directed the recent Yale Rep premiere of       Amy Herzog\u2019s       \u201cMary Jane,\u201d a play about a single mother and her (unseen) disabled child whose premise has a family resemblance to that of \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room.\u201d The difference is that \u201cMary Jane\u201d is tough, honest and unsparing, the kind of play at which you laugh because it hurts too much not to, whereas \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d is a thickly sugared pill, glib and sentimental to a fault.As for the cast, Ms. Taylor is a happily known quantity, the kind of no-nonsense actor who enhances any show in which she appears. Mr. DiFalco, a Broadway debutant, is convincing in every way as Hank, Lee\u2019s disaffected son, while Ms. Garofalo, who is new to the stage, proves to be fully at ease there, enough so that I hope to see her try her hand at a more challenging role.\u2014Mr. Teachout is the Journal\u2019s drama critic. \u201cBilly and Me,\u201d his second play, opens at Palm Beach Dramaworks on Dec. 8.

The movie must have seemed like the perfect lens through which to view the hot topic of women being treated badly behind the camera in La La Land. Its starring roles featured two female leads\u2014now both activists (      Susan Sarandon       and       Geena Davis      ). Its femme first-time writer won an Oscar. And how all these three worked with a macho director (      Ridley Scott      ) is quite a Hollywood tale. Moreover it was being made at a time when women were just crashing the glass ceiling in Hollywood, first becoming studio heads and producers in significant numbers. It clearly looked like the perfect match.But instead       Becky Aikman       has written a half-terrific book. One half has delicious behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the making of a classic film, as well as sharp insight on all of the rivalrous points of view. The other half\u2014an ideological retake of history\u2014is less of a success and more of a feminist screed.At times Ms. Aikman, a former newspaper journalist, writes about this incipient moment of what I call \u201cchicks in flicks\u201d with acute empathy. For example, this advice list for the female ceiling-breakers of the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, which she lays out in near free verse: \u201cWear combat boots, or a see-through blouse. / Put down your fists, or act like a general. / . . . Hit them with a cleaver, but do it gracefully. / Get a studio deal, but don\u2019t trust the studio.\u201d\u201cNo wonder so few women made it all the way to the closing credits,\u201d she opines, \u201clike the last girl standing in a slasher movie.\u201dBy Becky AikmanPenguin Press, 305 pages, $28To this insightful list I would only add, as one of those who began her producing career at the time, that an ampersand should replace the \u201cor\u201d between the clauses, i.e., \u201cput down your fists & act like a general.\u201d But she is dead wrong to suggest we felt like the last girls standing. For one thing, there were a score of us\u2014a big deal for a boys\u2019 club. For another, we were thrilled to be allowed in the inner sanctums and to learn to do this truly fun if grueling job. Listen to this trenchant quote from still-very-much-standing producer       Lauren Shuler Donner       (\u201cX-Men\u201d): \u201cI used to go in with my fists up. I\u2019d go, \u2018I\u2019m tough, I\u2019m tough, I\u2019m tough.\u2019 Eventually I had to learn that that is the worst thing; that is what men really hate.\u201dBut our story is not the one Becky Aikman means to tell in \u201cOff the Cliff.\u201d She dumps us regular working girls quickly for her real heroine. She tries to tell the story of women in Hollywood through the women of this movie, and mostly that means the world according to the screenwriter of \u201cThelma & Louise,\u201d       Callie Khouri.Callie probably had more creative influence on her movie (even without getting to direct) than most any other first-time screenwriter, so tenaciously did she hold on to it. But how much of her route is repeatable? In one great creative stroke, she pole-vaulted from alienated video production assistant to creator of a heralded original script that she intended to direct. Ms. Aikman tracks that effort\u2014and the pain of ultimately relinquishing the reins to Ridley. Callie could not know of course that after the movie became a hit she too would become a star: The studios gave her two big features to direct with movie stars and big budgets.In reading this book, you will learn how Callie Khouri pulled off this extraordinary feat at a time when female directors were much more rare than they are even now. The formidable confidence she showed throughout the process helped ensure that \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d never compromised its now-famous ending or its theme. There is a profound lesson for \u201cwoke\u201d-yet-mystified women these days, that the missing ingredients\u2014more easily accessed by men\u2014are total conviction and willpower. An undeniable script was a critical assist.In \u201cOff the Cliff,\u201d all the key participants\u2019 vividly remembered high moments and disagreements are well documented; you can feel the pain of every fight and indignity these many years after. (The earliest slights are the most long remembered.) The fun anecdote about a feisty lady agent selling an impossible script to the legendary mogul       Alan Ladd Jr.       reads like a lesson for how to make a surprise hit today. (Old studio rule: Every movie starring two women that makes money is a fluke.) Or you can look at it as Mr. Ladd\u2014who famously picked up \u201cStar Wars\u201d in turnaround from Warner Bros.\u2014did. As a child, he says, \u201cthere were women\u2019s pictures, and they were very important, and they did very well.\u201d So he just figured there was an audience for what he considered a perfect script. Then Ms. Aikman writes what may be my favorite sentence in the book: \u201cLaddie saw the women\u2019s audience as an opportunity he had nearly to himself. He was so old-school, he\u2019d become practically revolutionary.\u201dWhen she was first told that Ridley loved the picture, Callie was nervous. Would he understand this female script? She felt a great risk in giving it away to this cigar-chomping man\u2019s man. From Ridley\u2019s point of view, by the time he\u2019d agreed to direct it, he was in love with it. \u201cI respected the fact that she wrote it. I wanted it from a woman\u2019s point of view and I got it from a woman\u2019s point of view.\u201d A collaboration developed, in which Ridley and Callie went page by page through the script for weeks, making sure he understood the rage and that all the emotion was real. He called them \u201cdaily lectures.\u201d He was dubious about all the hideous male behavior in the script and asked her if these things ever happened to her. \u201cThe point is, it doesn\u2019t matter if it happened to me,\u201d she answered. \u201cThese things happen all the time, and it could have been me and it could be any of the women you have ever come into contact with.\u201d Callie enjoyed his droll sense of humor, however her adamant responses made him find her a bit humorless. But he listened patiently as Callie told him all the things that he couldn\u2019t touch. Most directors will decidedly not let you do this.Once Ridley internalized all the things he didn\u2019t previously understand, he was ready to take the helm, from his point of view if not Callie\u2019s. He argued for humor throughout, as he felt it was critical to the overall \u201cride\u201d of the film. \u201cHe thought the men in the audience should eat some crow, but he wanted them to enjoy the taste.\u201d Yet the suspicion that he would \u201cgo broad\u201d haunted Callie throughout the shoot.The movie became almost as famous for the casting of the hitchhiker\u2014Brad Pitt in his first film role. The story of his now-legendary big-screen breakthrough is alone worth the cover price. Reading it literally made me feel giddy. The casting director had left four guys for Ridley to select from for the part, none of whom he had strong feelings about. So he asked that each read with Geena Davis, with whom the character was to play a sexy one-night stand. When the blond guy, whom no one knew, auditioned with her, she quaked and blushed through the entire thing, almost losing her way. When Ridley asked whom she liked, Geena yelled, \u201cthe blond one!\u201d He knew whom to listen to.To the author, the quite famous girls vs. boys feuds during this production obviously flowed from the feminist theme. It\u2019s easy to see how tempting this interpretation would be: \u201cOff the Cliff\u201d should tell a gender story because the story is about gender. But what I see, 25 years hence\u2014and from more of a bird\u2019s-eye view\u2014seems to be a classic power-ownership dynamic, hidden beneath the guise of \u201cwhat the hell do guys know about women?\u201d Or at least these two issues are mixed in a way that was not understood by the players at the time and has mixed up the author as a result.The set certainly was very boys-against-girls. In Susan Sarandon\u2019s delicious quote: \u201cThe atmosphere was very male. The guys on the crew were all shirtless with their T-shirts around their heads, like a band of cigar-smoking marauders. They adored Ridley and would follow him off a cliff.\u201d Together they chased sunrises and sunsets, making spectacular shots of the two women in the car. \u201cThe joke was the whole movie would be voice-over,\u201d Susan says. \u201cBecause he was getting such fabulous footage, why do scenes?\u201dThis was the point of view of the women, who had no clue as to what Ridley was up to and were afraid he did not care about the emotions as much as the look. \u201cNothing in the script indicated that the intimate story needed such an opulent stage,\u201d Ms. Aikman writes. \u201cHe brought that to it,\u201d Susan tells her. \u201cWe filled in the emotions and the people.\u201d Once she saw the finished film, she understood: \u201cBecause Ridley put us in this heroic setting, the film had the impact it did,\u201d but that wasn\u2019t so apparent at the time. There was so much distrust: It was assumed that if you were interested in the look of the film you couldn\u2019t also care about the scenes. This dichotomy of course is false.How did they even get to that point? The Look vs. The Characters? That is not a boy vs. girl thing. That is a writer vs. director thing. And it\u2019s ironic because what makes the movie so perfect is the blending of the two.Ms. Aikman writes that the person Ridley was most intimidated by was Callie. On the one day she was invited to the set, the disagreement about tone that they\u2019d had since the beginning was set off when Callie openly disapproved of the casting of a funny Rastafarian as a day player and the broad performance of a truck driver. The harder the writer holds on to the literal interpretation of his original vision, the less room there is for the director to make it his (or hers). The more the writer moves into the director\u2019s vision, the more possible it is to serve that vision. This is the key lesson for the newbie screenwriter, and Callie Khouri didn\u2019t learn it in time. She wasn\u2019t invited to test screenings of her first film. She missed her Cannes debut. She did not miss her Oscar, however.\u2014Ms. Obst, the producer of \u201cInterstellar\u201d and many other films, is the author of the memoirs \u201cSleepless in Hollywood\u201d and \u201cHello, He Lied.\u201dAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 19:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-women-took-the-wheel-1498780609", "news_title": "When Women Took the Wheel", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,books,society,community,arts,entertainment,human rights,civil liberties,reviews"}, {"content": "A Senate panel approved a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill without any provision calling for air-traffic control privatization, seemingly ending prospects for congressional passage of the proposal this year.The measure approved Thursday by the Senate Commerce Committee indefinitely postpones consideration of stripping authority from the FAA over controllers and air-traffic modernization efforts, a change supported by House Republicans and the White House.

Regional airlines and their champions on Capitol Hill have been seeking such legislative relief for years, on the grounds that the current requirement of at least 1,500 hours behind the controls has contributed to a shortage of pilots for some carriers.The FAA already has authority to give pilots who graduate from academic institutions offering enhanced training or former military aviators a special credit that effectively reduces the 1,500-hour requirement. The Senate bill seeks to explicitly give FAA officials additional leeway to systematically grant similar credits to would-be airline pilots who go through alternate \u201cstructured, disciplined training\u201d regimens. With the majority of U.S. airports served primarily or solely by regional carriers, reassessing the 1,500-hour rule is \u201can issue that on some level, we have to address,\u201d Mr. Thune said during Thursday morning\u2019s session.Such changes, however, were strongly opposed by virtually every Democrat on the panel, many of whom contend reducing minimum flight hours would erode safety. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has vowed to block approval of any FAA bill that includes reduced flight-hour requirements.Mr. Thune and Sen.       Bill Nelson       (D., Fla.), the senior minority member of the panel, said they would attempt to reach a compromise before the bill gets to the floor of the Senate. But Mr. Nelson said there are strong convictions on both sides and he called the 1,500-hour requirement \u201cone of the issues we are having difficulty with.\u201dDebate over cutting mandatory flight hours has been stoked by recommendations from an FAA-created advisory panel tasked with finding ways to improve commercial air service to hundreds of small airports primarily serving rural communities.The 25-member group, largely representing smaller airports, state transportation officials and regional carriers, concluded in a May report that a nationwide pilot shortage was \u201cthe dominant theme in many of today\u2019s challenges to small community air service.\u201d The report urged Congress to direct the FAA to provide credit for additional types of training, including training provided directly by carriers. The main trade association for regional carriers has been championing such an approach for years.In a dissent to the group\u2019s recommendations,       Paul Ryder,        representing the nation\u2019s largest pilot union, wrote that the panel \u201cmade no effort to evaluate data, use scientific methodology for analysis, or engage in meaningful dialogue during meetings\u201d in an alleged rush to arrive at a \u201cpredetermined\u201d result eroding safety. Mr. Ryder disputed that \u201ca pilot shortage is the top issue facing air service to small communities.\u201dStill other sections of the bill could prompt partisan battles in the Senate or with provisions moving forward in the House. The Senate\u2019s package, for example, includes consumer provisions requiring the airline industry to develop standardized procedures to disclose fees for checked luggage and seat selection. The House measure goes further in requiring the FAA to establish safety standards regarding the size and spacing of passengers\u2019 seats.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 19:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-commerce-committee-punts-on-call-to-restructure-air-traffic-control-system-1498775327", "news_title": "Senate Commerce Committee Punts on Call to Restructure Air-Traffic-Control System", "keywords": "air traffic control,air traffic control privatization,faa appropriations,faa funding,federal aviation administration,privatization,senate commerce committee,Federal Aviation Administration,Senate Commerce Committee,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Senate conservatives wish the health-care bill was more ambitious on deregulation, and so do we, though the benefits of its state waiver feature are underappreciated and worth more explanation. This booster shot of federalism could become the greatest devolution of federal power to the states in the modern era.One of ObamaCare\u2019s most destructive legacies is a vast expansion of federal control over insurance and medicine\u2014industries that did not exactly lack supervision before 2010. This included annexing powers that traditionally belonged to states. The Obama Administration then used regulation to standardize insurers as public utilities and accelerate a wave of provider consolidation that has created hospital and physician oligopolies across the country.Once in command, the federal government rarely eases off or returns control, but the Senate bill does. The Affordable Care Act included a process in which states could apply for permission to be exempted from some rules, but conditions are so onerous that these 1332 waivers have been mostly notional. The Senate Republican draft bill makes this process quicker, more flexible and broader, which could launch a burst of state innovation.The Senate bill is broader than the House\u2019s Meadows-MacArthur waivers that only apply to a few so-called Title I regulations. Creative Governors could use the 1332 exemptions to explore a wider variety of reforms to repair their individual insurance markets, lower premiums and increase access to care.Introducing many competing health-care models across the country would be healthy. California and South Carolina don\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014have to follow one uniform prototype designed in Washington, and even a state as large as California doesn\u2019t have the same needs from region to region.If nothing else the repeal and replace debate has shown that liberals, conservatives and centrists have different health-care priorities, and allowing different approaches and experimentation would be politically therapeutic. The more innovative can become examples to those that stay heavily regulated.Some conservatives in the Senate and the House are despondent because neither bill repeals the federal rules related to pre-existing conditions known as guaranteed issue and community rating. They\u2019re right that these mandates are destructive. Community rating, which limits how much premiums can vary among people with different health status and risks, tends to blow up insurance markets, as ObamaCare is now showing.But at least for now, conservatives have lost this political debate. There\u2019s no Senate majority for catching the pre-existing conditions grenade, Governors aren\u2019t hot on the idea either, and even insurers don\u2019t want to return to the days of medical underwriting.The Senate bet is that the 1332 waivers can help create enough of a recovery in insurance markets to overcome the distortions of these rules and bring down rates. The bill also relaxes ObamaCare\u2019s age bands to a 5 to 1 ratio from a 3 to 1 ratio, meaning insurance for the oldest beneficiaries can be priced five times as high as for the youngest. Since age is a proxy for health risks and expenses, and a 5 to 1 ratio is close to the true actuarial cost of care, the policy result in practice is a wash.The other objection to the waivers is that leaving ObamaCare regulations in law creates the risk that a future Democratic President could revoke the 1332 waivers to restore the ObamaCare status quo. But the bill includes a provision that legally bars the Health and Human Services Secretary from cancelling an approved waiver for eight years, and they can be automatically renewed. A Democratic Congress could change the law, but then a new Congress always can, and in any case successful state projects will be hard to overturn.ObamaCare\u2019s failures have created an appetite for new alternatives. If Senate Republicans can get to 50 votes, they\u2019ll unleash the states to build post-ObamaCare options.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 19:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-obamacare-waiver-breakthrough-1498779447", "news_title": "The ObamaCare Waiver Breakthrough", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The plaintiffs bar is always looking for new crevices of the law to exploit for fun and profit, and so we didn\u2019t want to note the end of the Supreme Court term without celebrating Monday\u2019s 5-4 decision in California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.The case revolved around whether Calpers could proceed with a 2011 complaint over securities the pension fund purchased from offerings in 2007 and 2008. The Securities Act of 1933 says that in \u201cno event\u201d shall an action be brought \u201cmore than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.\u201dOther parties filed a class-action suit in 2008, but Calpers opted out and pursued its own claim, presumably because the plaintiffs thought they could eke out a bigger payout by going alone. Calpers filed in February 2011, past the three-year deadline enumerated in the law, which is why the Second Circuit Court of Appeals tossed the action.

It\u2019s as if markets think central banks are really in danger of returning to more normal policies.The euro jumped 1.4% against the dollar Tuesday after European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       said \u201call the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area.\u201d Never mind that it came in the context of a speech in which Mr. Draghi argued that the ECB should continue doing more of the relatively easy monetary policy he says is working. Markets interpreted the comment as a sign that the ECB may soon start dialing back on its negative interest rate and \u20ac60 billion-a-month ($68.16 billion) bond purchases, or quantitative easing (QE).Bank of England chief       Mark Carney       set off a similar jump in the pound on Wednesday when he suggested Britain\u2019s central bank might at some point sort of think about almost raising interest rates\u2014if the bank no longer feels it needs to make trade-offs between economic growth and its inflation target. To be exact, what he said was: \u201cSome removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing [policy makers] continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional.\u201d Got it?You can\u2019t fault investors for intensive tea-leaf reading of otherwise anodyne comments like these. Given the size of the bond portfolios central bankers have amassed since the crisis, investors are understandably curious about any clues to what central banks will do next.As a result, markets are overlooking how little central bankers are actually saying. Mr. Draghi\u2019s subordinates took to the media Wednesday to point out he hadn\u2019t meant monetary normalization would come immediately. But what if he had? Even in that case, \u201cnormal\u201d would be a very gradual reduction in a quantitative-easing bond portfolio that didn\u2019t exist before March 2015.And the negative interest rate that was once considered a crisis measure but has hung on for three years? A return to zero, let alone the ECB\u2019s pre-2008 rates of between 1% and 3%, remains years off. The same is true in Britain. If the BOE ever does move from its current benchmark rate of 0.25% back to the 3% to 6% range before the panic, it will take years.The U.S. Federal Reserve, which now is leading the way on unwinding crisis policies, is doing so very slowly despite eight years of economic growth. If the Fed does make it to 2% by the end of next year from 1% to 1.25% today, the fed-funds rate would still be well below its level during the late 1990s boom or its pre-2008 maximum.There\u2019s nothing tight about any of this. Markets have simply forgotten what normal monetary policy looks like. This poses a dilemma for central bankers, as Mr. Draghi noted when he warned that, as the economy improves, policies that today offer the right level of stimulus might become too accommodative. It\u2019s hard for central bankers to adjust when any move to make policy slightly less easy is interpreted as a move to make it much tighter.Then again, central bankers have themselves to blame. As policy becomes further divorced from definable metrics such as inflation\u2014which already suggests a need for tightening in Britain and the eurozone\u2014central bankers struggle to explain whether and when they might adjust policy.Markets have learned that central banks can be bullied into keeping the punch bowl on the table a little longer, as with the taper tantrum that delayed the Fed\u2019s slow withdrawal of QE by a few months in 2013.

When spending on homelessness initiatives by other agencies is included, this year\u2019s figure is more than $2 billion, according to an analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group.Ms. Malliotakis said spending on homelessness would remain flat if she became mayor.Mr. de Blasio didn\u2019t directly comment on Ms. Malliotakis\u2019 ideas, but said he and the assemblywoman \u201chave real differences.\u201dA de Blasio campaign spokeswoman said the mayor already is doing some of the things included in Malliotakis\u2019 plan, such as helping domestic-violence survivors find new homes, and increasing outreach to homeless individuals.She reiterated the mayor\u2019s commitment to his own plan to address homelessness, which calls for opening 90 new shelters across the city.Ms. Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, said her plan would free up tens of thousands of units of public housing for homeless families by moving older residents with extra bedrooms into smaller units.Moreover, she would tighten intake requirements for shelter, and ban the use of hotels to house the homeless for more than seven days.About 8,000 people were being housed in hotels by the city as of this week, city officials said.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the assemblywoman\u2019s plan would be executed.

Biggs, Arthur J. Gonzalez, Ana J. Matosantos and David Skeel, four of the seven members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. They were appointed by President Obama based on recommendations by the Democratic and Republican Congressional leadership.In July 2016, Puerto Rico defaulted on its more than $70 billion of debt, putting at risk those liabilities as well as more than $50 billion in public pension obligations. Just before the default, Congress had enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or Promesa, which established the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. Today, under the board\u2019s guidance, Puerto Rico is undertaking the largest municipal restructuring in U.S. history, with the goal of sorting out its longstanding fiscal issues and reigniting economic growth.The board has worked steadily toward these goals over the past year. After rejecting turnaround plans submitted by two successive Puerto Rican governors, last March the board approved an amended plan that includes a nearly 30% cut in government health spending, sizable reductions in government subsidies, school closings, consolidations of government agencies, and the most extensive public-employee pension reforms ever passed in the U.S.This week, after much deliberation, the board rejected the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\u2019s request to move forward with a restructuring support agreement with its creditors. Puerto Rico\u2019s electricity costs are two to three times as high as mainland levels. The board concluded that lowering the price of electricity and spurring economic growth depended on reforming Prepa\u2019s operations, not merely restructuring its credit. Affordable electricity could boost growth by up to half a percentage point annually, raising family incomes on the island, stemming outmigration and increasing funds available to repay creditors.Successful reform will require a true transformation of Puerto Rico\u2019s power sector. As the Center for the New Economy, a Puerto Rican think tank, put it in a 2009 report: \u201cPREPA\u2019s operations are substantially less efficient than the operations of its U.S. counterparts and it underperforms in virtually every area of operations under consideration.\u201d While mainland utilities have reduced costs by shifting to natural gas, Prepa relies on outmoded oil-fired generating plants. The company also loses 12% of sales revenue to faulty billing and theft, three times the U.S. average. Prepa has languished under heavy administrative overhead and politicized management, which contribute to its failure to deliver reliable, cost-effective energy.We believe that only privatization will enable Prepa to attract the investments it needs to lower costs and provide more reliable power throughout the island. By shifting from a government entity to a well-regulated private utility, Prepa can modernize its power supply, depoliticize its management, reform pensions, and renegotiate labor and other contracts to operate more efficiently. A reformed Prepa is key to restoring opportunity for the people of Puerto Rico.Prepa\u2019s credit restructuring proposal would make effective privatization impossible. Under the proposal, bondholders would grant Prepa a five-year reprieve from principal payments and some would accept a 15% reduction in debt. In return, those bondholders would be guaranteed repayment of remaining debt through an electricity surcharge. If demand for electricity continues to decline, the surcharge will have to rise to compensate the creditors. The Prepa proposal and its guarantee to current creditors would increase costs to ratepayers while leaving new investors\u2014the ones Prepa needs to transform its operations\u2014assuming all the risk.Private investors would not involve themselves with Prepa on those terms, meaning the company would lack the capital to modernize. Electricity costs would remain high, and economic growth, families and bondholders would suffer. The board\u2019s economists estimate that without pro-growth energy reforms, funds available to pay Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors would be reduced by $15 billion.The Board\u2019s decision was not easy. Promesa gave preferential treatment to the credit support proposal, not requiring it to satisfy the same criteria as other debt restructuring settlements. Some members of Congress have suggested that Prepa\u2019s credit agreement should have been considered a \u201cdone deal.\u201d But not all the proponents of Promesa understood its provisions in that way. The law clearly expresses that the board must authorize any voluntary debt restructuring, and the agreement proposed by Prepa itself explicitly requires board authorization.The board cannot amend the Prepa agreement, as it did with the fiscal plan submitted by Puerto Rico\u2019s government. But the board will pursue improved terms of agreement for creditors, and more equal sharing of risk between current creditors and new investors.Transformation of Puerto Rico\u2019s energy sector is only one part of a broader reform agenda, which must include fundamental public pension and welfare reforms, as well as the modernization of labor laws. Prepa\u2019s viability must be addressed in the context of these larger solutions to Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal and economic crisis. But unless Prepa can be modernized, Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recovery and its ability to repay its debts will suffer.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/privatize-puerto-ricos-power-1498776904", "news_title": "Privatize Puerto Rico\u2019s Power", "keywords": "management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,government finance,government borrowing,sub-national,local borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "We are coming up on a great American holiday. There will be fireworks and children frolicking in pools; there will be baseball games, cookouts and flags. America will be looking and acting like America. So this is no time for gloom.This moment in fact may be, perversely, promising. The failure so far of Senate Republicans to agree on a health-care bill provides an opening. Whatever happens the next few days, moderates and centrists on both sides can and should rise, name themselves, and start storming through.The difficulties the Republicans have faced were inevitable. They are divided; they don\u2019t have the will or the base. The party is undergoing a populist realignment, with party donors, think-tankers and ideologues seeing things more or less one way, and the Trump base, including many Democrats, seeing them another. The long-stable ground under Republican senators has been shifting, and they\u2019re not sure where or how to stand. The president, philosophically unmoored and operating without a firm grasp of the legislation he promotes, is little help. He has impulses and sentiments but is not, as the French used to say, a serious man. He just wants a deal and a win, and there\u2019s something almost refreshing in this, in the lack of tangled and complicated personal and political motives. It makes so much possible.Many Republican senators see that the American people are not in the mood for tax cuts to the comfortable and coverage limits on the distressed. Democratic senators, on the other hand, are increasingly aware that ObamaCare is not viable, and in some respects is on the verge of collapse.This gives both parties motives to join together and make things better.Republicans believe they must repeal ObamaCare because they\u2019ve long promised to do so. Keeping promises, especially in our untrusting political climate, is a good thing. But polling suggests America isn\u2019t eager that promise be wholly kept. The Senate\u2019s repeal-and-replace bill is deeply underwater in most polls, barely above water even with Republicans. If you campaign promising mayonnaise but once you\u2019re in office voters start saying they prefer mustard, Politics 101 says, at least for now, hold the mayo.Here again is our big wish: that both parties join together and produce a fix. It would no doubt be ungainly and imperfect, but it would be better than the failing thing we have. And Americans, being practical, will settle, for now, for better.The GOP\u2019s donor class would likely hate the eventual bill, as the Democratic Party\u2019s nihilist left, which wants no compromise, would hate it. But their opposition would suggest to everyone else the bill must be pretty good.There is the beginning of a movement in the Senate for a bipartisan approach. Republican       Susan Collins       of Maine has it exactly right: Asked if she thinks it necessary for both parties to work together, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s what we should have done from the beginning.\u201d Republican       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia said on Fox News Wednesday night: \u201cI\u2019m ready to roll up my sleeves and work with the Democrats.\u201d Republican       Ron Johnson       of Wisconsin says it\u2019s a \u2018mistake\u2019 to attempt a partisan fix. Democrat       Joe Manchin,        also of West Virginia, says he\u2019s \u201cready\u201d for a bipartisan effort. The             New York Times                   reports senators from both parties met privately weeks ago to discuss core issues. Mr. Manchin was there along with Democrats       Joe Donnelly       of Indiana and       Heidi Heitkamp       of North Dakota. Among the Republicans were Sens. Capito and Collins,       Bill Cassidy       of Louisiana and       Lindsey Graham       of South Carolina.That\u2019s a good start.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, disappointed in the GOP failure earlier in the week to get to yes, told his own members, in front of the press, that if they can\u2019t get it together, they\u2019ll have to work with the Democrats. It sounded like a threat, not an invitation; he seemed to be saying Republican voters wouldn\u2019t like it. Many wouldn\u2019t, but the polling suggests many would.This column respects history and tradition. I\u2019ve banged away on the fact that any big legislative change that affects how America lives, especially on something so intimate and immediate as health care, has to receive support from both parties or it will never work.Franklin D. Roosevelt,        in creating Social Security in 1935, knew he had to get Republicans behind it and owning it, or America would see it as a Democratic project, not an American institution. In the end he persuaded 81 Republicans to join 284 Democrats in the House. So too with the creation of Medicare in 1965:       Lyndon Johnson       wrestled and cajoled Republicans and got a majority of their votes.Every president until       Barack Obama       knew this. He bullied through ObamaCare with no Republican support, and he did it devilishly, too, in that he created a bill so deal-laden, so intricate, so embedding-of-its-tentacles into the insurance and health systems, that it would be almost impossible to undo. He was maximalist. His party got a maximal black eye, losing the House and eventually the Senate over the bill, which also contributed to its loss of the presidency.Is it fair that both parties must fix a problem created by one party? No. But it would be wise and would work.Here is a thing that would help: a little humility from the Democrats, and a little humanity.It would be powerful if a Democratic senator would go on the Sunday shows this weekend and say something like this: \u201cRepublicans have proved they can\u2019t make progress. They\u2019re failing in their efforts, and I\u2019m not sad about it, because their bill is a bad one. But I\u2019m not going to lie to you, ObamaCare has big flaws\u2014always did. It was an imperfect piece of legislation and it\u2019s done some things my party said wouldn\u2019t happen, such as lost coverage and hiked deductibles. The American people know this because they live with it. The answer is to do what we should have done in the past, and that is joining with Republicans to hammer out changes that will make things better, that we all can live with, at least for now. We\u2019ll make it better only by working together. I\u2019m asking to work with them.\u201dThat person would be a hero in the Beltway, which prizes compromise and constructiveness, and admired outside it. \u201cMy God, it isn\u2019t all just partisan for her.\u201dThe Democratic Party made this mess. It\u2019s on them to help dig out of it. If they show some humility, Republicans would look pretty poor in not responding with their own olive branch.Show some class, help the country. When it\u2019s over, use whatever words you want: \u201cWe forced Democrats to admit the bill was flawed and dying.\u201d \u201cWe forced Republicans to back down.\u201d America won\u2019t mind the propaganda, they\u2019re used to it. Just make a bad thing better.Don\u2019t give what you produce a grandiose name. Call it the Health Reform Act of 2017. There will be more. Wait till we\u2019re debating single payer in 2020.But move now. Do the work, break Capitol Hill out of its shirts-and-skins stasis.

The success of the GOP effort comes down to one simple question: Will the most conservative members of Congress accept that the politics of health care have changed?Or more simply yet: Will they acknowledge that any reform must include continued protections for pre-existing medical conditions?It\u2019s that easy. Yes, the media analysis is correct that there are two camps of defectors from the Senate\u2019s reform bill. One consists of Republican moderates\u2014      Rob Portman,       Dean Heller,       Susan Collins,       Lisa Murkowski      \u2014who claim the bill is too mean to poor and sick people. Cue mind-numbing media stories about Medicaid formulas and per capita spending caps and medical inflation, all of which make a compromise sound nigh impossible.Hardly. Here\u2019s a tip: When a politician claims a bill \u201ccuts too much,\u201d that\u2019s an invitation to be bought off. There\u2019s a reason several senators who had been largely mum on the GOP bill (Jerry Moran of Kansas,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia) came out against it only after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a vote. They saw the other holdouts were about to get payola, and they wanted theirs.And there is cash to be had. With the stakes this high, the Senate leadership will gladly shuffle some money toward opioid treatment, rural health-care providers or Medicaid. So getting the \u201cmoderates\u201d on board is simple and transactional. They name a price, they get pork, they vote yes.The conservatives are the sticking point, precisely because they have principles. Sens.       Ron Johnson,       Mike Lee,       Rand Paul       and       Ted Cruz       have been clear from the start that any bill must lower premiums, which involves getting rid of costly ObamaCare mandates. And there is no question that among the most expensive mandates are those designed to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions\u2014in particular \u201ccommunity rating,\u201d which requires insurers to charge the same prices regardless of health status.The House Freedom Caucus was so intent on getting rid of community rating that it nearly derailed the bill. Only after the conference added an amendment allowing states to apply for waivers from community rating did the most conservative members finally came on board.Even so, it was always clear that provision was never going to fly in the Senate\u2014and for a simple reason. Freedom Caucus members tend to hail from inordinately conservative (and safe) congressional districts, whereas senators represent entire statewide populations. And a sizable majority of the public strongly supports retaining protections for pre-existing conditions.This is the true legacy of the Republican presidential loss in 2008, and the health-care law that resulted. Few Americans ever understood the stunningly complex means by which ObamaCare screwed up the individual insurance market, or the wider economy. To this day, most Americans haven\u2019t intimately interacted with the law, as they receive their health care from an employer or Medicare.But every American remembers two particular provisions of the law\u2014pre-existing conditions and coverage for children up to 26. These policies are simple and sound good. And they have become over the years a new standard in most people\u2019s minds. A February poll from YouGov showed 77% support for protections for consumers with pre-existing conditions.Principles matter, but so does public will. Conservatives will argue their side just needs to do a better job explaining how these mandates drive up costs for everyone, or lower the quality of care. These are valid points, but they\u2019ll count for little in the face of 2018 Democratic campaign ads that flash GOP names next to a graphic of a kid in a wheelchair with cancer who can\u2019t get care. Republicans lost this argument nearly a decade ago, when Mr. Obama won. More than 90% of Senate Republicans understand this.Which is another way of saying that protections for pre-existing conditions are here to stay, and conservatives face a choice. They can work with their colleagues to minimize the costs of the mandates (there are innovative ways to do this) and build in different free-market reforms to lower premiums. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the current Senate bill will reduce premiums by about 30%, and the GOP can and should build on this.Or they can kill the bill, and get no premium reductions at all, no deficit reduction, no Medicaid reform, no tax cuts, and no economic boost. Oh, and the protections for pre-existing conditions would remain. Plus, electoral disaster would loom.It\u2019s a binary choice, rooted in blunt political reality, which ought to make it an easy call. The question is whether conservatives will be savvy enough to forge a face-saving compromise and seek victories elsewhere in the bill. The health-care debate has changed over the past decade, and Republicans can\u2019t reverse it on a dime. But they can pass a bill that starts the walk back to freer health-care markets.Write to kim@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-simplicity-of-a-health-deal-1498776293", "news_title": "The Simplicity of a Health Deal", "keywords": "health care reform,obamacare,preexisting conditions,senate republicans,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Little-noticed provisions in the Senate Republican health bill could have a significant impact on employer-provided health plans, removing four million more people from such coverage in 2018, compared with current law, according to one projection.These provisions could pave the way for higher out-of-pocket costs for many workers.Both the House version of the bill passed last month, and the Senate bill now being negotiated, would scale back requirements imposed on employer plans by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. That means any final version could affect job-based benefits, not just Medicaid and the individual insurance market that have received the bulk of attention.That means far more people could be affected. About 155 million Americans under age 65 are covered by employer-sponsored insurance\u2014nearly half the U.S. population.Under the Senate legislation, some larger companies would drop coverage in part because they no longer would face a penalty for not offering health benefits, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. They also would be freed from a requirement that their plans cover at least 60% of such costs as coinsurance, deductibles and copayments.Employers would be free to offer less-comprehensive plans that limit coverage to a certain number of physician visits, days in the hospital and prescriptions.Not all employers will scale back benefits, said       Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, because many find that offering robust benefits helps recruit and retain workers. Those that do scale back are more likely to be in the services sector, including restaurants and retailers, Mr. Levitt said.The CBO estimates that the Senate bill would result in significantly more people in its first year without employer coverage than the House version, which the CBO estimated would leave two million additional workers without job coverage in 2018 compared with the ACA.Part of the increase under the Senate bill would come from workers opting not to get coverage offered by their job, the CBO report said.In some cases, employees who do keep their coverage may lose protections that limit their out-of-pocket costs annually or over their lifetime. That is because states could obtain waivers from the ACA\u2019s requirements.Some health analysts said it is unclear whether waivers would apply to large employers. But small companies that now must cover specific benefits such as mental health treatment or prescription drugs could stop covering them if their home states obtain the waivers.\u201cEmployers could offer mini-med plans,\u201d said Topher Spiro, vice president of health policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, referring to plans that typically limit benefits to $2,000 a year.Under the Senate bill, some of the biggest changes would affect employers with less than 50 workers, especially small companies that buy insurance through so-called association health plans.Such plans enable companies to join together in group-purchasing arrangements. Republicans including Sen.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky have pushed for changes that would help the associations grow, so that small business could better afford insurance.The associations in the Senate GOP bill would be exempt from a requirement that they cover a specific set of health benefits, said       Matthew Fiedler,        a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. Associations could set the criteria for membership in ways that would have the effect of only allowing businesses whose employees have lower health costs to join. One option likely permitted under the current bill would be to directly condition membership in the association on health status.That could make it easier for companies with younger, healthier workers to get coverage through association plans, but harder for those whose employees are less healthy, older, or have higher medical costs.Republicans say such changes would give more regulatory autonomy to the states and free employers, especially smaller ones, from burdensome requirements that limit their ability to hire.\u201cWhen you have the 50-employee threshold, it actually presents a barrier for employers that have 48 or 49 employees,\u201d said Sen.       Steve Daines       (R., Mont.). \u201cThey stop hiring because of that. It impedes job growth and business expansion. That is one of the reasons.\u201dDemocrats say the changes would remove important worker protections, especially for low-income employees.If states can eliminate essential health benefits \u201cit means that all the plans will be skinnied down because you\u2019re going to have competition, so it will affect coverage for people who have solid employer-based plans,\u201d said Sen.       Ben Cardin       (D., Md.).Overall, the Republican health push faces an uncertain future. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) scuttled a procedural vote this week after a rebellion from some conservative and moderate Republicans. Mr. McConnell now hopes to hammer out a compromise and bring the bill to a vote in July.The United Food and Commercial Workers on Thursday said the union is concerned that the GOP legislation could end the employer mandate and hurt coverage for employees of             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       That measures and Medicaid cuts could cause tens of thousands of Wal-Mart employees to lose coverage, they said in a statement.\u201cWe support high quality, affordable and accessible health care,\u2019 said Blake Jackson, spokesperson for Wal-Mart. \u201cThis is what we strive for when designing benefits for our own associations.

Why not his eldest daughter?July 1 marks the anniversary of More\u2019s 1535 show trial in Westminster Hall, at which       Henry VIII\u2019s       onetime lord chancellor was found guilty of high treason for refusing to swear an oath recognizing the king as head of England\u2019s church. On More\u2019s walk back to his prison cell in the Tower of London, the condemned man\u2019s daughter Margaret broke through the ring of soldiers, threw her arms around her father and wrapped him in her love. Five days later, the executioner\u2019s ax dispatched Sir Thomas More to eternity.More\u2019s story remains well known today, not least because of popular treatments such as the 1966 film version of       Robert Bolt\u2019s       \u201cA Man for All Seasons.\u201d But absent the determination of Margaret, who smuggled her father\u2019s letters out of prison and collected his writings against the day that they might be published, the world would know far less about this extraordinary man. Theirs was an intellectual and spiritual family collaboration, at turns joyful and melancholy, which even death could not kill.Less appreciated is that Margaret More Roper\u2014\u201cdearest Meg,\u201d \u201cdearly beloved Meg\u201d or \u201csweetest Meg\u201d to her father\u2014was herself an individual of singular virtue and accomplishment. In an age when illiteracy was the rule, and girls were thought to be not worth teaching, the classical education Margaret received placed her among the world\u2019s most learned women.In 1524, at only 19, Margaret became the first nonroyal woman to publish a book\u2014an extraordinary feat. The work was a translation from Latin into English of meditations by Erasmus on the Lord\u2019s Prayer.Both Erasmus and More had rejected the idea that learning detracted from a woman\u2019s virtue. Margaret was compelling proof. Though constrained by 16th-century notions that public fame was inimical to feminine modesty\u2014More himself would tell Margaret she would have to content herself with an audience of her father and husband\u2014she enjoyed in humanist circles an international reputation.More knew himself well enough that he feared he would lose heart because of his imprisonment and the prospect of a horrible death. In his biography \u201cA Daughter\u2019s Love,\u201d historian John Guy writes that \u201cwithout Margaret talking and praying with him as often as she could in that cold, bleak cell, it is far from certain that he would have been able to do what he did.\u201d More knew himself well enough to know this too.In the end, More embraced the chopping block as liberation from earthly suffering and entry into a better world. But is there no spiritual merit in the suffering of the loved ones left behind? More\u2019s reliance on his daughter does not in the slightest diminish his virtue, his courage, his faithfulness. Should having a famous martyr for a father diminish Margaret\u2019s?And what of heroic virtue, the defining characteristic of saints?Margaret may not have died for her faith, but she managed to outwit       Thomas Cromwell,        Henry\u2019s chief minister and her father\u2019s chief nemesis, gaining access to More\u2019s prison cell on the pretext that she would try to persuade him to take the oath\u2014even as her visits stiffened her father\u2019s resolve. She defiantly took his severed head down from its pike on London Bridge after his death. Still later she would let the king\u2019s men know that their threats would not deter her from seeing her father\u2019s writings published, so the world might know the man Thomas More really was.Why not canonize her? On the one hand, Margaret took the oath her father refused. Still, this is unlikely to be an immovable obstacle, not least because she added the caveat \u201cas far as will stand with the law of God.\u201d Perhaps the more prosaic reason this gentlewoman is not a saint is that the process is time-consuming and costly, and lay men and women generally do not have the benefit of a religious order pushing their cases.In Rome the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Causes of Saints confirms there is no movement to have this good woman join her father on the calendar of saints. Manifestly, a pronunciamento from the pages of The Wall Street Journal is not the conventional starting point for a journey to canonization. But if that\u2019s what it takes, so be it.Thomas More\u2019s \u201csweet Meg\u201d would live fewer than 10 years after her father\u2019s execution, dying in Chelsea at 39. On this anniversary of their farewell, perhaps it is time for the Catholic Church to acknowledge Margaret More Roper as someone for our season: a woman of strength and character who rose above the limitations of her age to demonstrate herself the equal of any man\u2014in intellect, in courage, in wit.And in saintliness.Mr. McGurn is a Journal columnist and member of the editorial board.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-woman-for-all-seasons-1498776250", "news_title": "A Woman for All Seasons", "keywords": "catholic church,church of england,margaret more roper,martyrdom,sainthood,saint thomas more,Roman Catholic Church,political,general news,society,community,religion,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "It\u2019s become a running joke among my friends: the Coke and Snickers Cure. You scoff, but this combination of cola and candy has relieved many of my worst migraines over the years. Morning doses have rescued workdays that otherwise would have been wasted convalescing. Afternoon treatments have salvaged weekend evenings out.So of course the news that             CVS Healthwishes to conceal these miraculous curatives from their customers is rattling me. Why would a drugstore discourage its customers from consuming some of its most effective drugs?Coke and Snickers are at the core of my personal pharmacopeia. Other wonder drugs include ginger ale, orange juice, ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine (marketed under the brand name Sudafed, although being a cheapskate I always buy the generic). I\u2019m not a doctor, but I\u2019ve learned from experience that there is almost no medical condition, from the common cold right up to bubonic plague, that cannot be treated by some combination of at least two of those things.Migraine? Coke, Snickers and ibuprofen. Flu? Ginger ale, ibuprofen and Sudafed. Tension headache? Ibuprofen and ginger ale. Plague? I\u2019d throw all six of my stock remedies at it. Something would surely work.How they work is a mystery, and I hope some kind doctor will write a letter to the editor explaining it. My best theory is that the combination of the caffeine in the Coke with the salt, sugar and calories in the candy bar fixes some chemical imbalance in the body. If it makes a difference, doctor, only Snickers will do. Other candy bars don\u2019t work. And then that wonderful             Coca-Cola                   fizz, which clears out the sinuses. Ginger ale has long been recognized as a treatment for an upset stomach, making it ideal for rehydration when one\u2019s digestive system might be too frazzled for something as acidic as orange juice, which should nonetheless be consumed when possible for the vitamin C.I gather doctors have a better understanding of how the two formally recognized medicines in my cabinet work, but I will assert that they work a lot better alongside my other \u201cdrugs.\u201d And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so, or at least who has thought so at some point. Coca-Cola famously was marketed as a bona fide medicine, containing cocaine or related plant-based extractions.Which demonstrates how faddish can be the judgments of purported health experts, such as those who now determine the placement of products on CVS\u2019s shelves. It\u2019s a mercy that this story concerns only the marketing judgment of one store chain and not the regulatory heft of the state. Although the state already has come for large doses of Coca-Cola (quantities that might one day be required to treat a smallpox outbreak), and I can only fear my beloved Snickers may not be far behind.CVS Health need not ban me as a customer. I don\u2019t habitually consume these items, now buried beneath piles of organic quinoa chips or whatever rubbish we\u2019re told is good for us. It goes to show that one man\u2019s junk food is another man\u2019s cure, and vice versa. Yes, I\u2019m saying quinoa is junk food and Coca-Cola is a health drink.

With Chilean men and boys extracting lithium from underground brine pools? With Chinese workers in assembly plants that management has ringed with netting to deter suicides? With a wildly successful yet conscience-stricken videogame designer in Hanoi? As reported by Brian Merchant in \u201cThe One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone,\u201d all these people and many more were players in the making of what may be the hottest gadget in human history.It\u2019s a remarkable tale, one that takes us well beyond the predictable panorama of late-night coding sessions and choreographed Apple product launches (though we see those as well). Instead, Mr. Merchant goes deep into the guts of the device that has made Apple the most valuable publicly traded company on the planet.The author, an editor at the online publication Motherboard, is nothing if not obsessive. This is a man who really, really wanted to get inside his iPhone. Apple doesn\u2019t make it easy\u2014like many of the company\u2019s devices, it is sealed shut with tamper-resistant screws\u2014and Mr. Merchant wasn\u2019t satisfied with spreading its innards out on a workbench in any case. He took the thing to a lab and had it pulverized to find out what it\u2019s made of: lots of aluminum, carbon, iron and oxygen (from various oxides); some silicon, copper and cobalt; much smaller amounts of more than 20 other elements; and traces of rare-earth minerals like cerium and yttrium.His next question, naturally, was where all this stuff comes from. The short answer: nowhere nice. Blood diamonds? Try blood cobalt, produced for the most part by child and slave labor for the benefit of Congolese warlords. Mr. Merchant resists the temptation to check out the situation firsthand, or dip his toes in the toxic lake in Inner Mongolia that is a byproduct of China\u2019s drive for rare-earth mineral extraction. But he does head to a leading source of tin: Potos\u00ed, Bolivia, a town high in the Andes that is overshadowed by a mountain that has been mined continuously since the mid-1500s. At that time it supplied silver that helped make Spain the foremost power in Europe; now it supplies tin used to solder circuit boards. For the miners, death is everywhere: Their average life expectancy is 40 years. And for journalists? Mr. Merchant, 33, ventures into a pitch-black mineshaft with a guide, but he and a colleague freak out and start scrambling for daylight before 20 minutes have passed.By Brian Merchant  Little, Brown, 407 pages, $28Mr. Merchant likewise loses his nerve after sneaking past the guards and into the vast factory complex in Shenzhen, China, where iPhones and other devices are assembled. He\u2019s understandably more comfortable interviewing former Apple engineers (current employees were largely off-limits, since Apple declined to cooperate) and other tech prodigies about how, over a period of years, the device came to be devised.To his credit, Mr. Merchant doesn\u2019t buy the myth of       Steve Jobs       as the lone genius. He highlights the men who actually made it happen, often working without Jobs\u2019s involvement or even knowledge. (And it was indeed men: There are only two women of any prominence in the story, one of them a transsexual.) What Jobs did do was to create the environment from which the iPhone emerged. He challenged his engineers relentlessly, and his suppliers as well. He was an absolute perfectionist on matters of aesthetics and design. His fury was legendary, yet somehow he inspired people to take chances rather than keep their heads down. On occasion he even allowed himself to be talked into something. But not until November 2004, when the iPod was being threatened by music-playing MP3 phones in Europe, did he agree to start building what would become the iPhone.There are intriguing parallels with the development of the iPod music player in 2001 and the Macintosh personal computer in the early 1980s. None of Apple\u2019s three signature products (Mac, iPod, iPhone) was exactly original, but each represented a quantum jump over existing products. And each flirted with failure at first, mainly thanks to Jobs\u2019s penchant for closed systems. When Jobs introduced the Mac in 1984, it was incompatible with other computers and ran hardly any software; after his dismissal in 1985, Apple veered in the other direction, licensing it to clone-makers in a move that proved disastrous. The iPod struggled for years before Jobs\u2019s executives persuaded him to make it compatible with Windows computers. The iPhone didn\u2019t take off until he finally agreed to open its app store to outside developers\u2014to people like       Dong Nguyen,        whose Flappy Bird game proved so addictive that he succumbed to guilt pangs and pulled it.

In Warsaw Mr. Trump can reaffirm the U.S. commitment to European security by giving Ukraine the weapons it urgently needs to defend itself against Russia\u2019s continuing aggression.Russia\u2019s violations of the 2015 Minsk II accords grow daily in both number and intensity. Moscow has reconstituted four armies on Ukraine\u2019s borders, rebuilt the Black Sea Fleet, created a powerful antiaccess and area-denial bubble in the Black Sea, militarized Ukrainian energy installations there, and prepared the logistical infrastructure for a major war with Ukraine, including potential amphibious operations in the South. It is building nuclear bunkers in Feodosiia and Sevastopol. The Russian military clearly regards large-scale, protracted conventional war, backed by mounting nuclear threats, to be a real possibility.Vladimir Putin       believes that he is already at war with the West, even if shots are not yet being fired. How else to explain repeated overflights of Europe, close encounters with U.S. and other NATO naval and air forces, election subversion in France, Germany and Holland, massive information-war campaigns throughout Europe that coincide with continued hacking against America\u2019s political system?Though Mr. Putin occasionally praises Mr. Trump, his actions demonstrate that he is contemptuous of the American president\u2014and of U.S. resolve.The Obama administration\u2019s strategic dereliction compounded the Russia problem. Mr. Trump\u2019s trip will be closely watched as a sign of his willingness to advance U.S. and European security. Giving Ukraine weapons that can meet Russia\u2019s threats\u2014counterbattery radars, armored vehicles, antitank weapons, secure communications gear, reconnaissance drones, antilanding weapons like shallow water mines, and training and intelligence support\u2014can help deter Russian aggression while solidifying American leadership of NATO.Arming Ukraine would keep faith with American policies dating back to President       Harry Truman       to support free peoples against aggression. It would enhance U.S. leadership and resolve. Moreover, it would communicate those attributes globally and create, as       Ronald Reagan\u2019s       policies did, a real basis for future dialogue with a Russia deprived of the means of aggression. A public show of helping Ukraine would also turn down the heat domestically. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent critics would be forced to credit him with resisting Russia in support of American interests.Arming Ukraine and shoring up NATO can\u2019t be the end of it. Congress must expand and extend sanctions while passing legislation to counter Russian information warfare. Perhaps the most direct way to impose costs on Russia is to increase American energy exports to Europe.Mr. Putin won\u2019t like any of it. His goal all along has been to sow chaos in the West and diminish NATO\u2019s influence on his doorstep. Paradoxically, he is forcing Mr. Trump to play a bigger role in Eastern Europe than the U.S. president wants to. If Mr. Putin moans about it, Mr. Trump should deliver a strong, simple message: You brought this upon yourself.While in Warsaw, Mr. Trump will have a rare opportunity to do the right thing and demonstrate American greatness in action.

The voters of California\u2019s 34th Congressional District chose Mr. Gomez, a member of the state Assembly, to succeed       Xavier Becerra,        now the state attorney general.Mr. Gomez now says he\u2019ll take office July 11, five weeks after his election and 168 days after the seat became vacant. Until then, his constituents have no representative to help resolve claims and appeals with the Department of Veterans Affairs. They have no representative to secure lost or misappropriated Social Security or Medicare benefits. And they have no representative to debate and vote on the critical issues facing our country.Conversely, the House this week swore in two new Republican members,       Karen Handel       of Georgia and       Ralph Norman       of South Carolina\u2014both less than a week after their elections on June 20, 2017.Where in the world was Mr. Gomez? In Sacramento, the state capital, waiting to vote to expand the state\u2019s failing cap-and-trade program with yet another tax hike that could increase gas prices by 45 cents a gallon.In contrast with Mr. Gomez\u2019s slow road to Washington, lawmakers acted with breathtaking speed to run away from their deeply unpopular agenda\u2014and for good reason. One state senator is being targeted for a recall because he joined the vast majority of state Senate Democrats to raise gasoline taxes by 12 cents a gallon and increase vehicle license fees. A recent survey from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, shows widespread opposition to these hikes.Rather than reassessing their reflex to hike taxes on Californians, state Senate Democrats are doing what they do best\u2014adding new layers of regulation and process to ensure that a recall election happens when they want it, not when the people they represent want it. Four days after that Berkeley study came out, lawmakers introduced a proposal to delay recall elections.This Democrat-run Senate is the same body that had three of its members charged and convicted of different felonies over the past few years. This is the same body that, earlier this year, silenced and physically removed a Republican member, Sen.       Janet Nguyen       of Orange County, because they didn\u2019t like a speech she delivered on human rights in her native Vietnam. Now, with the threat of losing its unilateral authority to raise taxes if one senator is recalled by his constituents, this same body has chosen to change election rules in defiance of voters who oppose the tax increases.These sad and wanton abuses of power shine a light on the problem of one-party power in Sacramento.

Now the ALI is changing its mission in ways that should trouble every business, consumer and taxpayer in America.The ALI\u2019s website explains that it was founded by a group of judges, lawyers and professors troubled by a \u201cgeneral dissatisfaction with the administration of justice\u201d and an \u201cuncertainty\u201d that \u201cstemmed in part from a lack of agreement on fundamental principles of the common law\u201d across states. The institute sought \u201cto promote the clarification and simplification of the law and its better adaptation to social needs, to secure the better administration of justice, and to encourage and carry on scholarly and scientific legal work.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly a worthy mission, and the ALI\u2019s most influential work has come in the form of periodic publications known as Restatements of the Law. These descriptions of existing law were soon relied on and trusted by judges, lawyers, legal scholars and law students for thoughtfully objective analysis. The ALI earned a reputation for being above the partisan fray.That changed in 2009, when the ALI published the first volume of \u201cRestatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm.\u201d For the first time in the institute\u2019s history, its restatement went beyond reviewing the law and recommended fundamental change: an unprecedented expansion of landowners\u2019 duty of care to all visitors, including unwanted trespassers.The following year, Trial Magazine, published by a trade group for plaintiffs lawyers, ran an article calling attention to the new \u201crestatement.\u201d Tellingly, one of the article\u2019s co-authors had also drafted the ALI restatement and thus was expertly able to cite promising cases in Arizona and Iowa, and otherwise provide detailed guidance for plaintiffs lawyers looking to forge a lucrative new line of trespassers\u2019 lawsuits against property and business owners.This new coziness with the trial bar marked a decided turn away from the ALI\u2019s largely objective past and toward a future of special-interest advocacy. Such advocacy was palpable at the ALI\u2019s annual meeting late last month. Up for discussion were two draft restatements, concerning the law of liability insurance and consumer contracts. These, respectively, could reshape fundamental aspects of the law and further clog civil court dockets with litigation at significant expense to businesses, customers and nearly everyone else.Only an 11th-hour letter to ALI leadership from many corporate general counsel, expressing \u201cstrong concern about the recent direction\u201d of the organization, managed to postpone the final adoption of the liability-insurance restatement at the annual meeting. The letter noted the draft text\u2019s potential to undermine the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of contract terms, disproportionately increase penalties for alleged breach of duties, and subject insurers to broad extracontractual damages for alleged \u201cbad faith.\u201dEven more troubling is the pending restatement on consumer-contract law. Leaving aside that there has never even been a recognized body of \u201cconsumer contract\u201d law\u2014there is only contract law\u2014the three law professors charged with drafting this restatement are effectively ignoring the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, much U.S. Supreme Court precedent, and the 92-year-old Federal Arbitration Act. They are trying to convince state courts that virtually all arbitration clauses in consumer contracts are \u201cunconscionable\u201d and therefore unenforceable, clearing the way for still more trial-lawyer-enriching class actions.Meanwhile, the American Tort Reform Association and our state-based allies will do all we can to moot the unaccountable ALI\u2019s radical flights of legal fancy. Since 2011 we\u2019ve driven enactment of bipartisan legislation in 23 states that pre-empts any additional liability for trespassers\u2019 injuries. We\u2019ll launch comparable campaigns to contain future threats.Although ALI has as much right as other interest groups to advocate for changes in the law, it is no longer due special deference from judges. Justice       Antonin Scalia       said as much in a 2015 opinion. The authors of ALI restatements, he observed, have \u201cover time .\u00a0.\u00a0. abandoned the mission of describing the law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for what the law ought to be.\u201dAspirations for American business leaders must include stopping the ALI\u2019s liability-expanding agenda and returning the organization to the laudable scholarship and evenhandedness of its past. Business-friendly members of ALI must become more active and recruit more members like themselves. And unless ALI leaders wish to risk irrelevance should their organization be wholly captured by plaintiffs lawyers and reflexively antibusiness academics, they would be wise to invite and welcome broader participation in their underreported proceedings.Mr. Joyce is president of the American Tort Reform Association.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Tort Lawyers Take Over the American Law Institute.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tort-lawyers-take-over-the-american-law-institute-1498776033", "news_title": "Tort Lawyers Take Over the American Law Institute ", "keywords": "tort reform,American Law Institute,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       declared a new age of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d by the U.S. on Thursday as he outlined plans to roll back       Obama       era restrictions and regulations meant to protect the environment.In a speech at the Energy Department, the president promised to expand the country\u2019s nuclear-energy sector and open up more federal lands and offshore sites to oil and natural-gas drilling.Mr. Trump also celebrated his decision earlier this month to withdraw the U.S. from the 195-country Paris climate accord and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rescindment this week of the Obama administration\u2019s clean-water rules that farmers and business groups found onerous.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to let other countries take away our sovereignty and tell us what to do and how to do it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump also issued a special permit authorizing the construction of a new pipeline between the U.S. and Mexico that would carry fuels across the border in Texas, the State Department said.The president\u2019s intent to resurrect coal and nuclear power comes as many other countries are trying to curb their use. He made only scant mention of renewable energy such as solar and wind power, which now account for 10% of total U.S. electricity generation and a far higher percentage in some European countries.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech caps a week the White House has devoted to energy issues. The proposals Mr. Trump laid out are in keeping with the more robust approach to energy extraction he promised during last year\u2019s campaign and offer another instance of the new administration acting quickly to reverse his predecessor\u2019s policies.\u201cWe applaud President Trump\u2019s support of energy policies that secure and expand U.S. energy supplies and position our country as a world supplier,\u201d       Barry Worthington,        executive director of the U.S. Energy Association, said in a statement. \u201cAn all-of-the-above energy strategy... advances U.S. energy security, but it also protects our allies.\u201dEnvironmental groups criticized the moves as shortsighted and perilous for the environment. \u201cTrump\u2019s dirty energy nightmare is a wake-up call for the country,\u201d said       Rhea Suh,        president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWe get the [environmental] harm, foreign countries get the power, and big oil, gas and coal take the profits.\u201dThe Wilderness Society homed in on the Trump administration\u2019s opening of more Arctic waters to exploration after President Barack Obama had excluded Arctic Ocean lease sales as one of his last moves in office.\u201cOil companies recognize that Arctic Ocean drilling always will be the riskiest and most costly drilling in the world,\u201d said       Lois Epstein,        Arctic Drilling Advisor to The Wilderness Society.Mr. Trump said the Department of Interior will restart its process for approving new areas for offshore oil and gas drilling, including potentially allowing exploration in Alaska\u2019s arctic waters and off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Under Mr. Obama, the department had blocked drilling in some of those areas as part of a five-year strategic plan to evaluate potential leasing areas.\u201cSo much of our land was closed to development,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re opening it up.\u201dThe administration will now begin a process that could last a year or more to re-evaluate potential leasing opportunities, officials said. The effort to open the Arctic and Atlantic coasts is likely to face entrenched opposition from environmental activists and some officials in states including Florida.Despite the Obama administration\u2019s greater emphasis on environmental protection, a historic increase in American energy production has ensued in the past eight years, driven by the shale boom.The resulting supply glut and low crude prices have made high-cost drilling and exploration in frontiers such as the Arctic far less attractive than several years ago.             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC staked $7 billion on drilling offshore Alaska in Arctic waters several years ago only to pull the plug on its project in 2015 after a floating rig ran aground and the company didn\u2019t find much oil.Alaskan oil production has plunged by more than a third over the last decade to under 500,000 barrels a day, amid what energy companies called an onerous tax regime put in place by then Gov.       Sarah Palin       and the advent of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, which made tapping onshore wells from Texas to North Dakota more economic in recent years.Nuclear power is also on the ropes because of low natural gas prices, which are driving more power plants to run on that fuel. Mr. Trump touted a new age of natural gas exports from the U.S., an emerging market, with multiple plants receiving permits during the Obama administration now coming online.Mr. Trump said he wanted a review of U.S. energy policy to find ways to \u201crevitalize\u201d nuclear power. Nuclear-power plant builders want an extension of tax credits for nuclear units. He didn\u2019t mention tax incentives in his speech.The president also stuck to two key energy planks from his campaign\u2014clean coal and the Keystone XL pipeline\u2014both of which face difficulties.             TransCanada Corp.      , which hopes to build the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to Oklahoma, is struggling to sign up customers.And in a filing with regulators Wednesday,             Southern Co.      , which built the large-scale Kemper clean coal power plant in Mississippi, said it was giving up running the facility on coal and would use natural gas instead. The company notified Mississippi officials that as many as 250 workers might be laid off.\u2014Russell Gold  and Bradley Olson contributed to this article.Write to Lynn Cook at lynn.cook@wsj.com and Eli Stokols at eli.stokols@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Targets Obama Energy Curbs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-declares-end-to-obama-era-energy-curbs-1498769568", "news_title": "Trump Declares End to Obama-Era Energy Curbs", "keywords": " environment, federal lands, liquified natural gas, lng,nuclear energy, shale gas,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,energy"}, {"content": "The Republican gamble to stiff-arm       Merrick Garland       and hold open Justice       Antonin Scalia\u2019s       seat appears to have hit the jackpot. In his abbreviated first year on the Supreme Court, Justice       Neil Gorsuch       has lived up to supporters\u2019 greatest hopes and critics\u2019 worst fears.The term that ended this week revealed that Justice Gorsuch is no Scalia doppelganger. The new justice has shown greater sensitivity toward individual liberties than his predecessor, who wrote a controversial 1990 decision permitting states to burden free exercise of religion with general prohibitions, including criminal laws.Justice Gorsuch joined the majority in Trinity Lutheran v. Comer, which struck down Missouri\u2019s exclusion of churches from a state funding program for playgrounds. But he refused to accept the distinction suggested by Chief Justice       John Roberts,        who wrote the court\u2019s opinion, between religious status and activity.\u201cIs it a religious group that built the playground?\u201d Justice Gorsuch asked in a concurrence. \u201cOr did a group build the playground so it might be used to advance a religious mission?\u201d The majority\u2019s distinction, Justice Gorsuch wrote, made no sense under the Free Exercise Clause, which \u201cguarantees the free exercise of religion, not just the right to inward belief (or status).\u201dJustice Gorsuch\u2019s arrival highlights the ascension of Justice       Clarence Thomas,        also frequently\u2014and unfairly\u2014caricatured as a Scalia clone. Astute court watchers have long understood that Justice Thomas was more conservative and intellectually aggressive than Scalia, who once called himself a \u201cfainthearted originalist.\u201d Scalia sometimes abandoned the constitutional text when it conflicted with traditional values or established precedent.Justice Thomas is a more consistent originalist, willing to reject longstanding doctrine and practice when they flout the Constitution\u2019s original meaning. He might have found a fellow traveler in Justice Gorsuch.Reacting to the excesses of the Warren Court, Scalia wanted to limit judicial discretion. But he also sought to restore fidelity to the Constitution\u2019s original meaning. While the latter impulse demanded a narrowing of the court\u2019s Commerce Clause jurisprudence, which has justified the vast expansion of the administrative state, the former sometimes caused Scalia to flinch. In 2005\u2019s Gonzalez v. Raich, Scalia concluded that Congress could regulate the growing of marijuana for personal use. Justice Thomas voted to bar the application of federal drug laws under these circumstances.Similarly, while Scalia wrote the seminal opinion recognizing an individual right to bear arms, he also countenanced state regulation of gun possession, thereby treating the Second Amendment as a second-class right. This week the court declined to hear an appeal in Peruta v. California, upholding the Golden State\u2019s virtual ban on concealed-carry permits. \u201cThe Framers made a clear choice,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote in a dissent Justice Gorsuch joined. \u201cThey reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.\u201dIn the much discussed \u201ctravel ban\u201d decision, Justice Thomas authored a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Gorsuch, arguing that immigration is properly the domain of the political branches, not the courts. Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project mostly resurrected the administration\u2019s 90-day moratorium on entry by nationals of six countries, pending a full high-court review in the fall. The other six justices, however, left the door open to challenges by aliens who have some attachment to the United States.Justice Gorsuch\u2019s arrival has underscored the court\u2019s fault lines. Conservatives have long criticized Justice       Anthony Kennedy\u2019s       penchant for conjuring constitutional rights out of whole cloth, from abortion to gay marriage. Chief Justice Roberts likewise earned the ire of conservatives with his 2012 vote to uphold ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate as a tax. In prizing consensus, Chief Justice Roberts forgets that great justices have sacrificed it for constitutional fidelity. Earl Warren regularly joined 5-4 or 6-3 majorities to apply the Bill of Rights and Reconstruction amendments more vigorously to the states.       Oliver Wendell Holmes,        perhaps the most influential justice of the 20th century, was known as \u201cthe great dissenter\u201d for a reason. Consensus comes at a cost.Justice Gorsuch\u2019s appointment is President Trump\u2019s greatest accomplishment to date. His early decisions have solidified a three-justice conservative bloc. A resurgent conservative wing exposes the high court\u2019s directionless middle, occupied by Justice Kennedy and to a lesser extent Chief Justice Roberts.Justice Gorsuch\u2019s noteworthy debut will prompt an even fiercer fight over the next vacancy, almost certain to occur during President Trump\u2019s term. In replacing Scalia, Justice Gorsuch may not have changed the balance of the Court on the most divisive constitutional issues.

After the bills passed Thursday, Mr. Trump said the \u201cimplementation of these policies will make our communities safer.\u201dThe bill, along with a companion enforcement measure, represents a contrast with the comprehensive immigration legislation long pushed by Democrats and some Republicans. Those proposals typically combine enforcement measures with pro-immigrant provisions such as the legalization of people living in the U.S. illegally. But Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress have showed little interest in a bipartisan approach.Both bills passed largely on party lines, and both are expected to face strong opposition in the Senate, where they would need Democratic support to pass.The first bill, called the \u201cNo Sanctuary for Criminals Act,\u201d primarily aims to persuade local jurisdictions to hold people in jail when asked to do so by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Proponents in the Trump administration and elsewhere say releasing criminals who should be deported makes communities less safe, They add that asking a jail to hold someone for up to 48 hours is a reasonable request.\u201cBy flagrantly disregarding the rule of law, sanctuary cities are putting lives at risk and we cannot tolerate that,\u201d said House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.).Many local communities don\u2019t honor these ICE \u201cdetainer\u201d requests today for a range of reasons. Some say cooperation would undermine trust in law enforcement in immigrant communities, making legal and illegal immigrants less likely to report crimes. Some cite court rulings that found local communities are liable if someone such as a U.S. citizen is wrongly held based on inaccurate information.Under the legislation, jurisdictions would lose federal grants from the Justice and Homeland Security departments if they enact policies restricting assistance with the enforcement of federal immigration law.In addition, it attempts to change the legal incentives for cities and counties. It protects those that honor detainers from being sued, by promising the federal government will take the jurisdiction\u2019s place in potential lawsuits. And the bill enables crime victims to sue jurisdictions that don\u2019t comply if they are harmed by someone who is released.\u201cWhy would the Republicans be for federalizing local law enforcement?\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), saying that it goes against the GOP\u2019s usual goal to restrict the power of the federal government in local jurisdictions. \u201cThey should trust the local law enforcement to administer local laws as they see fit.\u201dA second measure that passed on Thursday would increase penalties for people with felony convictions who are deported from the U.S. and then return. Dubbed \u201cKate\u2019s law,\u201d it\u2019s named for       Kate Steinle,        who in 2015 was killed in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times before and kept coming back.\u201cRepeatedly deported offenders represent disproportionately a great deal of crime,\u201d said Rep.       Darrell Issa,        a California Republican. \u201cAmerica will be safer and people will be in the countries they came from, rather than this country if we enforce our laws.\u201dThe \u201cKate\u2019s law\u201d measure was politically tougher and seen by Democrats as an effort by Republicans to force them into taking an unpopular position. It passed the House with near-unanimous Republican support plus 24 Democratic votes.House Minority Whip       Steny Hoyer       (D., Md.) said many members oppose allowing illegal immigrants who have committed a crime back into the country but fear the bill overstates the problem. Others noted that people could be punished simply for arriving at a U.S. port seeking asylum.\u201cIt\u2019s stupid, it has nothing to do with the criminal act that was done against Kate Steinle, which was a terrible thing,\u201d said Rep.

Executives said they had crafted the smaller deal to address regulatory issues, but antitrust experts said it doesn\u2019t eliminate competition concerns.The aborted deal was a reminder that mergers leading to high levels of industry concentration may face challenges even as more business-friendly Republicans take the reins from Democrats in antitrust enforcement.The late stages of the review held additional intrigue because the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust and consumer-protection laws, is currently short-handed with just two commissioners\u2014one Republican and one Democrat.Other federal agencies also are operating with vacancies since the U.S. presidential election, creating a prolonged period of uncertainty for businesses exploring mergers and seeking other types of regulatory approval from the government.Despite a surging stock market and historically low borrowing rates, the pace of deal making has slowed from the previous two years. Companies have announced U.S. deals in the first half of the year worth $581 billion so far, down 17% from the same period last year and nearly a third below 2015, according to Dealogic. Bankers say uncertainty about corporate tax rates have weighed on sentiment at least as much as regulatory concerns.The slowdown has been particularly acute among megadeals and with tie-ups in the health-care sector where M&A activity is down 30% year-to-date, said Richard Peterson of S&P Global Market Intelligence. Companies may hold off on potentially risky deals until the FTC is restocked, he said.\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be ready to jump on a transaction immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to see who the players are. You can\u2019t play your game if you don\u2019t know your competition.\u201dThe Justice Department, which shares antitrust authority with the FTC and is reviewing         AT&T Inc.\u2019s       proposed $85 billion takeover of         Time Warner Inc.,       is still awaiting Senate confirmation of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       selection of Makan Delrahim to head its antitrust division. The nomination has been awaiting a floor vote for several weeks.President Trump hasn\u2019t nominated a permanent FTC chairman or moved to fill any of its three open seats. But the vacancies haven\u2019t stopped the commission from taking action in some cases, including earlier this month when it sued to block the proposed merger of fantasy sports companies DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc. It also blessed         Sherwin-Williams Co.\u2019s       acquisition of fellow paint maker Valspar Corp., a deal valued at more than $11 billion.Democratic and Republican enforcers sometimes find common ground on what mergers should be challenged, but the antitrust team in place at the end of the Obama administration was considered particularly aggressive. In 2016, for example, the Justice Department challenged two major health-insurance mergers as well as         Halliburton Co.\u2019s       planned acquisition of         Baker Hughes Inc.The FTC\u2019s review of the original Walgreens-        Rite               Aid transaction stretched 18 months, and the commission didn\u2019t back away from concerns that the deal would have harmed competition, according to people familiar with the matter.The commission worried about the merger\u2019s impact in regions where both companies have a strong store presence. It also had been considering whether the resulting drugstore giant\u2014which would have challenged         CVS Health Corp.       in size\u2014would have been able to exert unfair leverage over pharmacy-benefit managers in rate negotiations for corporate and government drug plans. Pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBM\u2019s, oversee drug-benefit plans for employers and health insurers.In an attempt earlier this year to assuage regulators, Walgreens and         Rite               Aid agreed to sell up to 1,200 stores, reducing the deal price to between $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion. Under Thursday\u2019s proposal, Walgreens will buy about 2,200 of         Rite               Aid\u2019s stores. Previously, Walgreens planned to buy about 3,600 and the rest would be sold to regional chain         Fred\u2019s Inc.The decision to abandon their bigger merger plans indicated the companies hadn\u2019t won over the FTC\u2019s acting chairwoman, Republican       Maureen Ohlhausen.       Executives at both companies said they decided to scrap the deal after the FTC indicated to them it would not win approval.On a conference call Thursday, Walgreens Chief Executive       Stefano Pessina       said the smaller transaction addresses \u201call substantive\u201d FTC concerns. The company will be adding stores in regions where it currently lacks a large presence, including the Northeast and MidAtlantic.Asked whether that could be a concern for the FTC, Walgreens General Counsel       Marco Pagni       said, \u201cyou should assume that we have taken account of specific feedback in formulating the plan.\u201dThe transaction would still result in two national drugstore chains that dwarf the next-biggest player. Walgreens has about 8,200 U.S. stores while CVS has about 9,700. The firms, however, also compete with pharmacies at grocery chains and discounters like         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Seth Bloom, an antitrust lawyer in Washington, said the new deal still raises antitrust questions that would require FTC scrutiny, including on the issue of Walgreens\u2019 growing national muscle.\u201cJust because it\u2019s half the number of stores as the previous deal doesn\u2019t necessarily settle it,\u201d Mr. Bloom said. \u201cIt could make the review easier, but it\u2019s not a slam dunk yet.\u201dTad Lipsky, acting head of the FTC\u2019s bureau of competition, said the FTC had \u201cevaluated a number of divestiture proposals put forward by the parties\u201d and would review any new transaction proposed.Walgreens said it expects $400 million in cost savings from the new deal within three to four years of closing. Walgreens will pay Rite Aid a $325 million termination fee for scuttling the larger deal.Shares of Rite Aid tumbled 26% on Thursday while shares of Walgreens added 1.7% to $78.37. Shares of Fred\u2019s fell 23%.Rite Aid\u2019s business has been slumping in recent quarters, falling further behind Walgreens and CVS. On Thursday, the company reported that revenue fell 5% to $7.8 billion in the quarter ended June 3 and it posted a loss of $75 million.Rite Aid CEO       John Standley       said the remaining stores are more profitable, and the smaller size will leave the company less exposed to reductions in drug reimbursement rates. The company plans to use deal proceeds to pay down debt and upgrade existing stores, he said.Asked whether he expects the FTC to approve the new deal, Mr. Standley said: \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that it won\u2019t go, that\u2019s the reality of the process. We believe it makes sense, we just have to wait until it plays out.\u201d\u2014Anne Steele  contributed to this article.Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com and Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Drug Stores Scrap Merger.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-rite-aid-end-9-4-billion-merger-walgreens-to-buy-half-of-rite-aid-stores-1498735324", "news_title": "Walgreens, Rite Aid End $9.4 Billion Merger", "keywords": "antitrust, fred's, fred's earnings,high yield, rite aid earnings,walgreens, walgreens boots alliance, walgreens earnings, walgreens rite aid deal,Fred's,FRED,Rite Aid,RAD,Walgreen,WBA,WAG,Federal Trade Commission,CVS Health,CVS,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,retail,wholesale,pharmacies,drug stores,specialty stores"}, {"content": "The satirist        Finley Peter Dunne       once observed, through his character Mr. Dooley, that the Supreme Court follows the election returns. In a similar way, historical scholarship tends to follow the preoccupations of its own time.       Thomas Jefferson       offers an illuminating example. Though far from uncritical, biographers of Jefferson in the postwar years up to, roughly, the early 1970s\u2014scholars like Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson\u2014treated him with sympathy and celebrated his Enlightenment ideals. In the mid-1970s,       Fawn Brodie       changed Jefferson\u2019s public image by highlighting his relationship with the slave       Sally Hemings.       Race soon became central to Jefferson scholarship and opened up criticism on other fronts. Once lionized as a defender of liberty, Jefferson came to be depicted as a slave-owning elitist whose class interests, as a Virginia planter, trumped his egalitarian rhetoric. Indeed, neo-progressive historians began to argue that, by creating a property-owning democracy of white males, Jefferson had curbed the prospect of liberty for women, slaves and Native Americans and had codified structural inequality. From such a standpoint, Jefferson\u2019s legacy stands in tension with his professed ideals, making him a hypocrite if not worse.In \u201cJefferson: Architect of American Liberty,\u201d       John Boles,        a history professor at Rice University, advances a series of arguments counter to these interpretive trends. He offers a sympathetic (though not hagiographic) view of Jefferson that emphasizes the differences between his world and ours. The constraints under which Jefferson lived\u2014legal, financial, personal and intellectual\u2014shaped his actions, Mr. Boles shows, limiting or guiding his choices and revealing them to be, when viewed in context and without today\u2019s presumption of moral superiority, admirable more often than not, fully justifying the esteem in which Jefferson was once routinely held. It is better, Mr. Boles argues, to understand Jefferson\u2019s world and his place in it than to judge him by the standards of a later day.By John B. BolesBasic, 626 pages, $35Slavery offers a case in point. Although condemned as a slave owner who doubted that free blacks could live at peace among whites\u2014as he famously wrote in \u201cNotes on the State of Virginia\u201d (1785)\u2014Jefferson opposed slavery in his own state and pushed for the legislation that ended the importation of slaves to the U.S. after 1808. Debts kept him from following       George Washington\u2019s       example of freeing his slaves after his wife\u2019s death, an inaction that Mr. Boles describes, rightly, as almost ruining Jefferson\u2019s reputation in the late 20th century. But none of the Founders, including       John Adams       and       Benjamin Franklin,        risked his career by pushing hard for abolition. Jefferson did what circumstances allowed, and it turned out to be more than expected of a man formed by his slave-owning milieu.Jefferson grew up on a plantation more culturally part of the old Tidewater region on the Chesapeake than the Piedmont frontier where it stood. Studying the classics reinforced in him a stoicism common among Virginia gentlemen. Although in his own words a hard-working student at the College of William & Mary, Jefferson managed to enter Williamsburg society by drawing the notice of men like Francis Fauquier, the royal governor of Virginia. Conversation and social polish complemented Jefferson\u2019s reading, which went far beyond preparing him to practice law.From his early support for colonial liberties as a Virginia legislator, Jefferson became a pre-revolutionary spokesman for the American cause\u2014which he saw as a fight for self-rule against new efforts of the British to impose control over the colonies. It is hard for us to grasp today how bold it was to assert the rights of the governed against the encroachments of imperial authority. Almost the youngest delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775, Jefferson determined to fight rather than submit to Parliament\u2019s insistence on imposing internal taxes and legislating for the colonies without their assent.The next year, as Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, he would turn to a range of much earlier English writings as well as to the Virginia Declaration of Rights that George Mason had written not long before. Summarizing \u201cyears of thinking and political philosophizing,\u201d Mr. Boles notes, Jefferson framed his thoughts in the Declaration to make an argument for America\u2019s place among nations. Congress kept 90% of his words in the final document.Instead of taking up arms, Jefferson became a revolutionary lawmaker first in Congress and then back in Virginia. Mr. Boles calls him a born legislator who combined deep legal knowledge with precise language, a pleasant manner and sheer diligence. He started the process of revising Virginia\u2019s laws to promote religious freedom and to make the rules of inheritance more democratic. Far from curtailing liberty, as latter-day interpreters would have it, he worked to expand it. Mr. Boles notes that his efforts against slavery\u2014including an effort to denounce the slave trade in the Declaration\u2014faced too much resistance to make headway.In the later stages of the war against Britain, Jefferson returned to Congress, where he wrote the ratification of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. His report on western lands guided the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a law that planned the sale of the lands to homesteaders, provided funds from the proceeds for public education, and excluded slavery north of the Ohio River: a democratic initiative if ever there was one. It is again important to imagine how differently this territory might have been managed if powerful, self-interested elites, preferring tenants or large estates to independent small-holders, had held sway. Jefferson\u2019s work, by contrast, helped to extend a society of landowning farmers to territory that eventually become states on equal footing with the original 13.Throughout his career, as Mr. Boles emphasizes, Jefferson framed institutions on broad principles of republican government and thus had a lasting effect on America\u2019s political culture. In such a way, he was, in Mr. Boles\u2019s words, the \u201carchitect of American liberty,\u201d a phrase the author uses without the sneers or hedges that have become de rigueur among recent chroniclers of the founding era.Attributes that made Jefferson an effective legislator also served him as a diplomat in France in the 1780s. Mr. Boles describes him as a remarkable conversationalist, and his scientific feats had made him a celebrity before he reached Versailles. There he became \u201can exemplar of the philosopher as statesman.\u201d Touring Europe made him value the United States all the more, especially for the prosperity and liberty it gave ordinary people. He blamed monarchy in France \u201cfor the shocking discrepancy in living standards between the richest and the poorest,\u201d as Mr. Boles writes. Jefferson did not foresee the tremendous social upheaval that the French Revolution would unleash, and he returned home before the Jacobin Reign of Terror. His unwillingness to denounce its excesses gave American opponents ammunition for years to come. Jefferson \u201cconsidered the threat of governmental repression a greater danger than rebellion from below,\u201d Mr. Boles notes, but he neither consistently defended periodic rebellion nor opposed lawful authority.The global conflict that the French Revolution set in motion in the early 1790s heightened America\u2019s vulnerability and made it all the more important to preserve neutrality. Jefferson was alarmed by Federalists who sympathized with Britain and who sought a strong federal government to check the possibility of plebeian unrest; he saw them as hankering after the monarchy he despised. They, in turn, saw him as a crypto-Jacobin who would bring atheism and social revolution to America. Washington sided with Jefferson (then his secretary of state) and maintained good relations with France while distancing the United States from its old ally, but relations within Washington\u2019s cabinet broke down as rival parties emerged.John Adams\u2019s presidency further polarized American politics, though Jefferson and his friends did not realize that, as Mr. Boles says, \u201cAdams was a moderating voice\u201d among the Federalists, checking Hamilton\u2019s larger ambitions. Tensions at home and a quasi-war with France drew Jefferson away from playing a mere passive role as vice president and into actively campaigning to succeed Adams. He consciously sought reconciliation after his victory in the 1800 election by reaching out to former opponents. But he also strove to promote the republican principles of simplicity and frugality, not least by reducing both taxes and the national debt and reversing Hamilton\u2019s efforts at economic centralization.Purchasing Louisiana in 1803 from France \u201cfor a song,\u201d as Gen.       Horatio Gates,        the famed Revolutionary War veteran, put it, marked Jefferson\u2019s greatest achievement as president. French control over New Orleans had meant a stranglehold over exports from the Mississippi Valley, an arrangement that, Jefferson said, would force Americans to \u201cmarry ourselves to the British fleet & nation.\u201d Patient diplomacy and a shift in Napoleon\u2019s strategy brought a sale on favorable terms, although by a step not allowed explicitly by the Constitution (as Jefferson\u2019s critics like to point out).Jefferson fared less well in his second term, mainly because the Napoleonic Wars threatened American trade. Economic warfare squeezed neutral powers like the United States, and clashes with Britain threatened war. Jefferson responded with an embargo on trade that would, he believed, pressure foreign rivals and buy time for diplomacy. Commercial strain had more effect on Britain than critics at the time realized, but economic disruption also hurt the United States and divided the country along regional lines. Jefferson\u2019s departure from Washington in 1809 ended his public career, though he pursued an active retirement\u2014writing, gardening, tinkering with the architecture at Monticello and the University of Virginia\u2014until his death in 1826.While emphasizing Jefferson\u2019s part in framing institutions fundamental to American liberty, Mr. Boles stresses the man\u2019s contradictions. An aristocrat by birth and manner, Jefferson was \u201cthe most thoroughgoing democrat of the Founding Fathers.\u201d Deeply convinced of the power of words, he avoided public oratory and preferred working behind the scenes. A devoted agrarian, he was a connoisseur of cities who took a leading part in the designing of Washington, D.C. More cosmopolitan and widely traveled than other Founders, he preferred the comforts of home and family. The contradictions\u2014almost as much as the differences between past and present\u2014make Jefferson hard to grasp. Mr. Boles\u2019s splendid biography shows that trying to understand him on his own terms is more than worth the effort.\u2014Mr. Hay is the author of a forthcoming biography of Lord Liverpool, Britain\u2019s prime minister during the Napoleonic Wars.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jefferson-in-the-flesh-1498775017", "news_title": "Jefferson in the Flesh", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014New divisions opened among Senate Republicans on Thursday over their proposed health-care legislation even as they edged closer to hammering out some agreements to shore up support for the bill.The bill\u2019s status appeared shaky as lawmakers left Washington for a week-long break, its fate likely vulnerable to home-state pressures they may face and any deals they can make over the vacation.The new fights revolved around a group of Republicans who said they were open to preserving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 3.8% tax on investment income, and a Congressional Budget Office report on the bill that said the government would spend 35% less on Medicaid in 2036 than under the Affordable Care Act, likely forcing states to take steps to curb the program.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Senate Republicans had hoped to rewrite their health-care bill by Friday. That way, the CBO would have time to evaluate the new version while lawmakers are away for the July 4 recess. The continued disputes made that an increasingly unlikely scenario.The tax position cuts to the heart of longstanding Republican orthodoxy in opposition to such taxes, and conservative senators quickly condemned the idea. GOP Sens.       Bob Corker       of Tennessee, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and       Marco Rubio       of Florida said they were open to it.\u201cWe\u2019re repealing Obamacare, so the assumption would be that we would get rid of the taxes, too,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), the third-ranking Senate Republican. \u201cBut if it takes something like that to get our members on board to move this process forward, I think we have to consider that.\u201dConservative Republicans said the move would amount to an abdication of pledges they had made to voters to repeal as much of the 2010 health care law as possible.\u201cI don\u2019t remember anybody going around saying, \u2018Oh, except for these job-killing tax increases,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.). \u201cSo I expect that we\u2019ll be repealing all the taxes.\u201dUnder the current House and Senate bills, the investment tax would be repealed retroactively for income received in 2017. The tax applies to capital gains, dividends, interest and certain passive business income for individuals with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $250,000.Leaving the tax in place would give Republicans two potential benefits as they try to put together a health-care bill that can attract 50 of their 52 members, with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting a potential tie-breaking vote.First, it provides up to $172 billion over a decade that Republicans can use to make health insurance more affordable to low-income households. Second, it could blunt attacks from Democrats that the bill undermines health care for the many in exchange for tax cuts for a few.Democrats said Thursday that preserving that tax wouldn\u2019t offset the bill\u2019s other problematic provisions, including $772 billion in cuts over 10 years to federal funding for Medicaid, the government health-insurance program mainly for the poor.\u201cThe capital gains tax was particularly egregious, but trimming around the edges doesn\u2019t do anything to change the basic structure of this bill, which is it\u2019s a massive cut to Medicaid and does nothing to fix the challenges of the current law,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii).Further roiling the waters was the report from the nonpartisan CBO, which looked at the Senate bill\u2019s impact after 2026 and came amid stepped-up criticism of the CBO from the White House. That built on private grousing among Republicans for weeks that they were fighting a losing battle if they tried to change the bill to win a more favorable coverage assessment from CBO.The agency has found that the 22 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2026 under the Senate bill compared with the number who would be covered then by the Affordable Care Act.Two senior administration officials told reporters that while they didn\u2019t question the office\u2019s professionalism or intentions, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s primary role was estimating budgetary effects of legislation\u2014not behavioral decisions that could drive insurance enrollment.Republicans senators did appear to notch progress on some less-contentious elements of the bill Thursday. Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.) have pressed to boost funding for opioid addiction treatment to $45 billion from the $2 billion currently in the legislation. Lawmakers and aides said the bill was now likely to include significantly more opioid funding.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic on the opioid funding, but I haven\u2019t had anything finalized yet,\u201d said Ms. Capito. Even if it were, she said, it wouldn't be enough to win her support for the bill. \u201cI\u2019m not there yet,\u201d said Ms. Capito, who has also worried about Medicaid cuts.In a closed-door lunch on Thursday, Senate Republicans discussed a change sought by conservatives to allow people to use money stashed in tax-advantaged health-savings accounts, or HSAs, to help pay their insurance premiums.GOP leaders are also working to see if there is a way to incorporate a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), backed by other conservatives, that would allow insurers who offer at least one plan that meets ACA requirements to also offer a cheaper plan covering fewer benefits.Senate leaders said they wanted to make sure such a provision wouldn't result in costs spiking for older and sicker people.\u201cIn the interest of giving people more options and more freedom to get the policy they want, there\u2019s some value in what he\u2019s trying to put forward,\u201d Mr. Thune said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to be workable.\u201dLawmakers also said they had also discussed the idea of boosting the amount of money in the bill\u2019s stability fund, designed to prop up the shaky individual market, where people can buy health insurance if they don\u2019t get it through work or a federal safety-net program.Senate GOP aides said they would continue negotiations over the recess in hopes of unveiling a revised draft shortly after lawmakers return the week of July 10. Giving the time to review any new draft, the Senate might not vote on the bill until mid-July.Stephanie Armour and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com, Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Fresh Conflicts Emerge Over Health Bill.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-clash-again-over-senate-health-care-bill-1498774952", "news_title": "Republicans Clash Again Over Senate Health-Care Bill", "keywords": "affordable care act,government sponsored health insurance,health exchanges,medicaid,senate republicans,Brian Schatz,Mike Rounds,Pat Toomey,Bob Corker,Marco Rubio,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "In 1979, when       Carl Yastrzemski       of the Boston Red Sox was closing in on his 3,000th hit, the sportswriter       Red Smith       reflected on a not particularly pleasing trend in baseball. \u201cToday,\u201d Smith wrote, \u201cit sometimes seems that statistics are bigger than the game or the players, in the eyes of the \u2018media,\u2019 at least.\u201dI don\u2019t know that stats have actually become bigger than the game or the players, but numbers have certainly taken on a greater role in how we perceive and even how we play the game. Sporting strategy is now so heavily data-driven that it seems almost quaint that coaches and players are not permitted to carry computing devices on the field. Perhaps it\u2019s only a matter of time.Numbers were not always such a central part of American sport. As Smith pointed out in the same 1979 column, when       Ty Cobb       notched his 3,000th hit, the news of his milestone was reported in the \u201c12th or 14th paragraph\u201d of the story covering that day\u2019s ballgame. And when       Sam Rice       retired in 1934 with 2,987 hits, he didn\u2019t consider it worthwhile to hang around for another 13.Similarly, no one paid much attention in the late 1800s when Brooklyn\u2019s       George Pinkney       played consecutively in 578 games, the longest streak at that time, as       John Eisenberg       writes in his smart new book, \u201cThe Streak:       Lou Gehrig,       Cal Ripken Jr.      , and Baseball\u2019s Most Historic Record.\u201dOne might quibble with Mr. Eisenberg\u2019s subtitle. It\u2019s not clear to me why the record for most consecutive games\u2014which Mr. Ripken set in 1995, breaking Gehrig\u2019s mark of 2,130\u2014should be deemed the sport\u2019s most historic. As Mr. Eisenberg himself notes, it\u2019s a record that some consider the most humdrum in all of baseball. But that would make for a lousy subtitle.By John EisenbergHoughton Mifflin Harcourt, 299 pages, $26To play without an injury or a day of rest does not necessarily require special talent. There need not be thrilling performances. There need not be triumphs. An athlete might perform solidly on a losing team year after year, and if he\u2019s good enough to satisfy his coach and lucky enough to avoid injury, the record can be his.The mundane nature of the accomplishment presents a challenge for an author attempting a book called \u201cThe Streak.\u201d The protagonists in Mr. Eisenberg\u2019s story present another challenge: Lou Gehrig of the Yankees and       Cal Ripken       of the Orioles were two of the game\u2019s plainest men. Gehrig, of course, became baseball\u2019s tragic hero when his streak was interrupted by fatal illness. But until that time, he was a quiet, modest, hardworking fella who refused to take a sick day. Mr. Ripken was the same sort of character. Yawn.Mr. Eisenberg, to his credit, approaches his task like a batter facing a particularly crafty pitcher. He keeps cool and doesn\u2019t try to knock it out of the park. There are no attempts at grandiosity. Instead, he builds his story with shrewd analysis and good reporting. The result is a line-drive hit of a book, one that would make Gehrig and Mr. Ripken proud.In alternating chapters, Mr. Eisenberg tells the stories of Gehrig and Mr. Ripken, as well as of many of the other players who put together impressive streaks. But the book belongs mostly to Mr. Ripken, in no small part because the ballplayer agreed to be interviewed and also because Mr. Eisenberg, a former columnist for the Baltimore Sun, witnessed firsthand much of the player\u2019s streak.Mr. Ripken carries this book much the same way he carried the Orioles; he\u2019s a reliable but less than thrilling figure. We don\u2019t see much evidence of a sense of humor. Nor do we gain any sense of how he juggled work and family. Even his flaws are mild ones. His biggest critics during his playing career, it seems, were the umpires who felt at times that Mr. Ripken tried to usurp their authority. One of those umps,       Al Clark,        said that Mr. Ripken \u201calways thought he was right, could be pretty arrogant about it.\u201d Another umpire who tossed Mr. Ripken from a game said that it was \u201clike throwing God out of Sunday school.\u201dMr. Eisenberg\u2019s book is best when engaging in the sort of debates that baseball fans adore. Whose streak was more impressive? Did train travel, day games and small gloves make Gehrig\u2019s record more arduous? Was Mr. Ripken disadvantaged by a schedule that alternated day games and night games and therefore made it hard to establish a daily routine? How did the media and artificial turf affect him? Did advances in medicine help him top Gehrig?Gehrig and Mr. Ripken faced criticism during their careers for pursuing their streaks for selfish reasons. Would these players have been more productive if they\u2019d rested from time to time? Would they have been more valuable to their teams? Mr. Eisenberg has no clear answer, but he seems to give the benefit of the doubt to the players, arguing that even when their performance flagged, their leadership made them valuable to have on the field.The author argues that Mr. Ripken\u2019s streak of 2,632 consecutive games, played over 20 years, will never be broken. Soaring salaries, guaranteed contracts and smarter sports medicine all mean that players are more likely to rest. But Gehrig\u2019s streak was also thought to have been unbreakable, and no one came close to breaking it in 40 years before Mr. Ripken.The interesting question isn\u2019t really whether the record will be broken; it\u2019s why we should care about such a pedestrian record.We care, it seems, for the best of reasons: because character still counts for something in this age of high-priced, deeply quantified athletic competition. Gehrig and Mr. Ripken were not the greatest or most elegant athletes. They relied on hustle, intelligence, hard work and determination to compete with more physically gifted men. Character made them great. Character kept them in the lineup every day.It might not be the most exciting of all baseball records, but it\u2019s one worth celebrating.\u2014Mr. Eig is the author of \u201cLuckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig.\u201d His life of       Muhammad Ali       will be published this fall.Appeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-praise-of-clock-punching-1498774815", "news_title": "In Praise of Clock-Punching", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,Cal Ripken Jr,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Marking a new phase in the Trump administration\u2019s pressure on North Korea, the White House said it plans to cut off China\u2019s Bank of Dandong from the U.S. financial system, accusing it of facilitating financing for companies involved in Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program.The move is an escalation in Washington\u2019s efforts to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, using a sanctions tool that proved effective under the       George W. Bush       administration in forcing the regime back to negotiations by cutting off Pyongyang\u2019s financial ties to the world.Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        announcing the new sanctions at the White House on Thursday, said the administration would \u201ccontinue to roll out sanctions\u201d against companies involved with Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programs. President       Donald Trump       will raise the issue with leaders from the Group of 20 largest economies at a summit next week as Washington seeks to coordinate international action against Pyongyang.\u201cWe are committed to cutting off all illegal funds going to North Korea,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s provocative, destabilizing and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d\u201cWe are committed to targeting North Korea\u2019s external enablers and maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\u201d he said.Mr. Mnuchin said Thursday\u2019s action, which will take at least two months to go into force, isn\u2019t intended as a message to China.Still, the move represents a second phase of the Trump administration\u2019s strategy to ratchet up pressure on North Korea and could escalate diplomatic tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies, said Victor Cha, a former director for Asian affairs in the Bush administration\u2019s National Security Council.\u201cThe first phase was to treat China as part of the solution, and if that didn\u2019t work, then treat them as part of the problem,\u201d Mr. Cha, now a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.The Trump administration had urged China to increase its leverage to roll back North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs. But Mr. Trump said in a Twitter message last week ahead of high-level U.S.-China talks that Beijing\u2019s effort \u201chas not worked out.\u201d\u201cWhile we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies, and financial institutions who enable this regime,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the action.China has opposed unilateral U.S. sanctions, particularly against Chinese entities.Under the proposed sanctions, the bank won\u2019t be able to access the U.S. financial system either directly or indirectly. Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor the Bank of Dandong immediately responded to a request for comment.The move comes as North Korea steps up its ballistic missile tests and after the death of      Otto Warmbier,        an American who had been held in a North Korean prison for more than a year before being released to U.S. officials when he was in a coma.Treasury also added to its North Korea sanctions list two Chinese citizens accused of working in front companies designed to evade existing North Korea sanctions. A firm that primarily transports steel and coal between China and North Korea also was added, allegedly for violating a luxury-goods ban.South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Mr. Trump are scheduled to hold talks in Washington on Friday and meet for dinner Thursday night.Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is using a tool the Bush administration applied in 2007 against a Macao-based bank, called Banco Delta Asia, that allows the administration to declare a bank a money-laundering institution. Even though that bank was tiny, the sanction clamped down on North Korea\u2019s financial ties to the world because other banks feared losing access to U.S. markets.Similarly, Bank of Dandong is relatively small\u2014in the bottom quintiles of China\u2019s official banking system\u2014but the action could have a chilling effect on other banks providing financial services for North Korea or firms linked to the regime.\u201cIt\u2019s a shot across the bow for other Chinese banks; they don\u2019t want to get listed also,\u201d Mr. Cha said.Treasury said the bank, based in a port city that borders North Korea, serves as a conduit for the regime to access the U.S. and international financial systems, evading existing U.S. and international sanctions. The institution facilitated millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, the administration said, using a \u201cnetwork of front companies and embassy personnel that support illicit activities through banking, bulk cash, and trade.\u201dThe Treasury secretary didn\u2019t elaborate on what other sanctions might be forthcoming. But according to administration documents accompanying the sanctions, North Korea also has been using bank accounts under false names and conducting financial transactions through banks located in China, Hong Kong and various southeast Asian countries.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Plans to Cut Off Chinese Bank Over North Korea.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-sanction-chinese-bank-over-north-korea-financing-1498763996", "news_title": "U.S. to Sanction Chinese Bank Over North Korea Financing", "keywords": "bank of dandong,chinese bank,donald trump,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,sanctions,Bank of Dandong,Steven Mnuchin,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,weapons programs,banking,aerospace,defense,credit,financial services,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Ed Murrow hired Sevareid as a CBS correspondent solely because he admired his writing talent. A wise choice, for Sevareid was one of the war\u2019s finest writers. But with the German invasion of France, Sevareid discovered a fear of death that he found shaming and that caused him later to return home, literally sick with fear. He would nonetheless find courage after bailing out of a crippled plane over a part of Burma inhabited by headhunters. Sevareid\u2019s tribute to the proud spirit of Londoners during the Blitz can, even at this remove, bring a tear to the eye. \u201cNot So Wild a Dream\u201d is all the richer for its eloquent portrait of pre-war America. A college student in the \u201930s, he had been, like many, hostile to the military and to the idea of American involvement in any European war. He would not long after become a passionate enlistee in the anti-Nazi cause. In an acclaimed broadcast, he cautioned American parents to expect to find their sons transformed. \u201cWe can see, and tell you, that this war is brutalizing some among your sons and yet ennobling others. . . . War happens inside a man. . . . It can never be communicated. . . . That is also why, in a certain sense, you and your sons from the war will be forever strangers.\u201dBy       Alan Moorehead       (1945)2. Moorehead\u2019s vivid account of the war in Europe has been rightly described as a masterpiece, a work of wisdom and compassion and some of the most moving writing to have come out of the war. His graphic account of the destruction of a German army in the Falaise Gap is unsurpassed by any work of reporting of the entire war. He could feel and express sympathy for the grim fate that befell the enemy, even as he welcomed their defeat. \u201cHere in the apple orchards and the village streets one turns sick to see what has happened to them,\u201d he wrote of the German troops. \u201cThe beaten Wehrmacht is a pitiable thing.\u201d Still, for all the horrors he had witnessed, he had come to an understanding of the ways in which war, this war, could be ennobling. One Resistance leader, he wrote, \u201cwas suddenly projected . . . into an atmosphere where there really were possibilities of touching the heights, and here and there a man found greatness in himself.\u201d It was this that \u201crefreshed and lighted the whole heroic and sordid story.\u201dBy       Osmar White       (1996)3. White\u2019s book almost never saw print. His British and American publishers, originally enthusiastic, rejected it without explanation. Clearly his accounts of military black marketeers, his criticism of Gen.       Patton       and of military racism, and his revulsion at the Nuremberg trials did not jibe with the postwar mood. But almost 40 years later, White resurrected his manuscript, which focuses on some of the darker aspects of the war and also provides one of the better accounts of the Allied drive into Germany in the late winter and spring of 1945. White arrived in Buchenwald shortly after the liberation, walking between tiers of bunks where emaciated and dying prisoners began weakly applauding and speaking in whispery voices. \u201cTheir voices were like the sound of wind in a dark, deep place. . . . The image of their eyes and their teeth as they smiled will, until the day I die, remain life\u2019s most terrible recollection.\u201dBy       Ernie Pyle       (1944)4. Pyle\u2019s eye was ever on the ordinary GI, especially the infantry, \u201cthe God-damned infantry\u201d that he loved. Writing with undisguised devotion about the men and their heroism, he became the most famous, most read, American print correspondent of the war. In a nation that feared for its survival, for sons and husbands in the fight, Pyle\u2019s column was a treasured morale booster. His own morale was another matter: Sickened by slaughter and haunted by a certainty that he would be killed, Pyle turned to drink. He wrote of the hardships of reporting. \u201cWe\u2019d drained our emotions until they cringed from being called out from hiding. . . . I am not writing this to make heroes of the correspondents . . . merely to let you know that correspondents, too, can get sick of war\u2014and deadly tired.\u201d His moving account of the death of a beloved Texas officer in Italy was the most celebrated American dispatch of the war. Four months before Japan\u2019s surrender, Pyle\u2019s intimation of his fate proved justified. He was killed by a Japanese bullet and America mourned.By George Weller (2009)5. No other correspondent ranged over as many battlefronts: Greece, Africa, the Middle East, Papua New Guinea, Italy, Burma, China and Japan. The first correspondent into Nagasaki after the second atomic bomb had been dropped, Weller squandered his magnificent scoop\u2014which he could have smuggled out\u2014by engaging in a foredoomed battle with Gen.       MacArthur\u2019s       censors. That lapse aside, Weller made an impact everywhere he went. One of his reports inspired a       Gary Cooper       movie. Another, on medically untrained submariners performing an undersea appendectomy, won a Pulitzer Prize. His description of the horrors of New Guinea is scarcely bearable: \u201cEverything you own including your body is partly broken, rusty, moss-covered, insect-infested, diarrhetic, fevered, dirty, diseased, wet and muddy, or smells of putrefying Japs.\u201d \u201cWeller\u2019s War,\u201d which contains his principal dispatches, was compiled after his death by his son, Anthony.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 18:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ray-moseley-1498773670", "news_title": "Ray Moseley", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Why is an electric toothbrush like a hotel keycard? And what relates an E-ZPass system to a toaster? Apparently disparate everyday technologies often share underlying principles, as James Kakalios, a professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, delights in explaining in \u201cThe Physics of Everyday Things,\u201d a vivid compendium of digestible science lessons. The toothbrush (when it\u2019s being charged) and the keycard both use one coil to induce a current in another coil. Meanwhile, electromagnetic waves are generated by both the E-ZPass and the toaster, which accounts for the red glow of the toaster\u2019s wire.Mr. Kakalios organizes his book around the story of a somewhat busier-than-regular day: You wake up and have breakfast (explaining alarm clock and toaster); you drive into the city (automobile engines and GPS); you see the doctor (X-rays and MRI scans); you take a flight (airplanes); you give a presentation (laser pointers and LCD projectors); and finally you go to a hotel (motion sensors, keycards).Many modern technologies rely on surprisingly old principles: The way the clock in a smartphone works is very close to the familiar physics of a spring. Some theoretical updates are crucial, though: A GPS system locates you using old-fashioned trigonometry but also corrects for Einsteinian relativity.The pages constantly generate a pleasurable \u201cAha!\u201d at the connections the author reveals. Systems that enable cars to park themselves, for example, rely on methodology first developed for the proximity fuses in antiaircraft shells, which used radar to know when they were close enough to detonate. And the light-emitting diode or LED is \u201cnothing more than a solar cell run in reverse.\u201d Wait, really? Yes: \u201cFor a solar cell, light goes in and current comes out, while for an LED, current goes in and light comes out. Same device, just run forward or backward.\u201d Mr. Kakalios has an eye for the astonishing engineering detail, too: An OLED pixel in a high-end TV or smartphone screen is \u201cthinner than the diameter of a single red blood cell.\u201dBy James KakaliosCrown, 245 pages, $26Sometimes the author evinces an expert\u2019s genial frustration at the vagaries of public mood. Radiation is neither good nor bad in itself, he points out, only in its effects. Irradiating food to kill bacteria, he writes, is perfectly safe, because the food is not thereby made radioactive. But mention of radiation is \u201cso emotionally charged that many will avoid any process that involves nuclear decay, even at the cost of preventable sickness and death.\u201d Elsewhere he notes that MRI was originally called NMRI, for \u201cnuclear magnetic resonance imaging\u201d\u2014but they dropped the \u201cN\u201d because it scared patients.Occasionally, too, he displays a scientist\u2019s inattention to non-scientific considerations. \u201cThere are only two reasons why, well into the twenty-first century, we still don\u2019t have flying cars,\u201d he writes: \u201cphysics and chemistry.\u201d Sure, physics and chemistry are issues (you need a lot of force to keep a heavy object aloft, and you need fuel with a lot of energy density), but economic and social reasons are equally important. Indeed, the author admits that standing right underneath a flying car\u2019s jet engines might be a little unpleasant for pedestrians\u2014and that\u2019s not physics or chemistry, it\u2019s politics.What of the future? The commercial embarrassment suffered by Samsung because of the Galaxy Note 7\u2019s exploding batteries might soon be a thing of the past if \u201csupercapacitors\u201d can match the capacity of lithium cells (they can already deliver energy much more rapidly). In theory, meanwhile, traffic flow along an expressway should be smooth, like water flowing through a pipe; it is only the aggregated decisions of individual human drivers that cause traffic jams. \u201cPhysics says that traffic would be forever smooth and easy,\u201d Mr. Kakalios writes wistfully, \u201cif only we could get rid of the drivers.\u201d The good news is that getting rid of the drivers is exactly what Google and other companies are set on doing.

And yet there is something especially painful about the failure of revolution in this most populous and wealthy of the insurgent Arab states, because one feels it all could have ended more happily.For a brief period Egypt looked as if it was going to emulate Tunisia and haul itself into a new era of (relative) liberalism and democratic stability. But since the deposition of President Hosni Mubarak, the revolution has gone full circle: The current regime, under the former army general       Abdel Fattah Al Sisi,        is arguably more repressive than its recent predecessors.Omar Robert Hamilton\u2019s       explosive debut novel, \u201cThe City Always Wins,\u201d explains how Egypt got this way, and it does so with a combination of intensity and empathy rare in political fiction. There is no room for distanced irony here, nor is the novel an earnest polemic. Instead the view is admirably clear-sighted, evenhanded, at times kaleidoscopic. This is less a howl of rage than a sober accounting. Which is not to say it isn\u2019t angry. Or that it lacks pace.By Omar Robert HamiltonMCD, 312 pages, $26The novel opens in October 2011, eight months after Mr. Mubarak has been ejected, and shunts us through the next three years of political turmoil, via the triumph and then ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood, on the journey back to the status quo. The focus is on two young revolutionaries: Mariam, an intense young Egyptian woman whose parents are doctors, and Khalil, an American of Palestinian heritage who has come to Cairo in search of a cause. They are secular, leftwing, technologically astute. Mariam lives and breathes revolution; it permeates every aspect of her life. Khalil is equally intoxicated by the prospect of change, though he later becomes disillusioned.They meet during the wave of post-Mubarak protests as Egypt prepares to transition to democracy, \u201cthe two of them running . . . into the dark doorway of a building hanging heavy with foliage.\u201d They become lovers and set up a radio station. But what might at first seem to be a passionate love story forged in the heat of revolution turns out to be something else entirely: Politics in this novel subsumes everything. Even when their relationship begins to crumble, it seems a paltry thing. Which of course it is.But there are pros and cons to the authorial strategy of forgoing the personal for the bigger picture. \u201cThe City Always Wins\u201d is not an easy book to warm to. It can leave the reader skittering across the surface of events. There is, however, an authenticity to its wide-angle approach, a kind of revolutionary verisimilitude; and what the novel lacks in intimacy it more than atones for in its urgency.Mr. Hamilton employs a range of modes to tell his frantic story. We see things in the close third person from both Mariam and Khalil\u2019s point of view, and later in Khalil\u2019s own narration; we dip into the minds of minor characters\u2014protesters, doctors, parents of those martyred in the violence. At times the text disintegrates into a cacophony of different voices, at others it is formed of text messages, tweets, newspaper headlines, cinema schedules, passages from       Eric Hobsbawm,        dialogue from telephone calls made in the midst of clashes with police (\u201cHello. Hello? We need help. They\u2019re beating her. They\u2019re beating her!\u201d). The effect is impressive rather than distracting. On occasion the writing really sings.The book is in part a paean to Cairo, \u201cthis city of infinite interminglings and unending metaphor. Cairo is jazz: all contrapuntal influences jostling for attention.\u201d The prose dips into neo-modernist freestyle as it warms to this theme, contemplating \u201cthe jazz that is beauty in the destruction of the past.\u201d But the city has a dismal energy of its own: It \u201cdoesn\u2019t show mercy or respect. It races on around us and our silent island of dread.\u201d Toward the end, with Egypt back under military rule, Khalil launches into a memorable tirade against \u201chistory\u2019s one long looping nightmare\u201d and the failure of his generation to usher in a new world order: \u201cThe army wants your land and the British want your oil and the Italians want your gas and the Americans want your airspace and your canal and your complicity . . . and when we\u2019re bored of war we will bring you peace and post-conflict resolution . . . and dialogue camps and off-Broadway plays . . . [until] you are finally and forever stripped of even the possibility of thought.\u201dThe book is split into three linear sections. The first (\u201cTomorrow\u201d) takes us\u2014by way of hospital morgues and countless demonstrations, tear gas, bullet wounds, excitement, optimism and fear\u2014to the surprise victory of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt\u2019s first free elections. The result is a disaster for the young modernizers, who squabble among themselves about who to blame. The elections were a trap; democracy is on sale. Is it better to fight for power or to embrace disruption? \u201cYou need discipline to win a war. You need chaos to win an insurgency.\u201dThe second section (\u201cToday\u201d) follows\u2014via more demonstrations, arrests and custodial sadism\u2014the Brotherhood\u2019s tightening grip on power, its hardline new constitution and ultimate deposition by the army in a semi-popular coup. In the final section (\u201cYesterday\u201d), Mr. Sisi is Egypt\u2019s new strongman and protector, his image everywhere. The liberal revolution is in tatters and \u201cthe airwaves have been cleansed.\u201d Supporters of the Brotherhood are crushed; so are the modernizers. One, a young film student, is horrifically tortured in prison. He later dies.\u201cThe City Always Wins\u201d powerfully transmits the hope and despair of Egypt\u2019s Tahrir Square generation, and the bravery and willingness of its members to keep fighting in the face of insurmountable obstacles. Mr. Hamilton plunges us into an important moment in recent history and makes us think about it anew. While the novel\u2019s political message is clear, its tone is never hectoring, and its journalistic attention to detail never didactic. It is not always pleasurable to read but is always worth the trouble. It may even grow to be an important book\u2014one of the defining novels of the Arab Spring.\u2014Mr. Lichtig is the fiction and politics editor at the Times Literary Supplement.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 17:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yesterday-in-tahrir-square-1498773393", "news_title": "Yesterday in Tahrir Square", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,recommended books,books,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,reviews"}, {"content": "Google\u2019s workforce continues to look pretty much the same as previous years, according to its annual diversity report published Thursday, a sign of the task awaiting its newly named head of diversity.Google said Thursday that women made up 31% of its employees last year, the same percentage as the previous year\u2019s report. It barely moved the needle on other fronts: the percentage of black employees was unchanged at 2%, and the number of Hispanic workers increased by 1 percentage point, to 4%. The majority of Google workers remain white and Asian men.Google declined to disclose the size of its workforce. Its parent company,             Alphabet Inc.,        GOOGL 0.59%       employed 72,000 workers in December 2016.The slow progress in hiring and retaining more underrepresented groups and women underscores the challenges ahead for       Danielle Brown,        who was introduced as Google\u2019s new head of diversity on Thursday. Ms. Brown, who joins from             Intel Corp.      , replaces       Nancy Lee,        who left the company in February.Google acknowledges the lack of progress in diversifying the makeup of its workforce. \u201cMore than other industries, the technology sector is extremely open about its challenges in creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. We all welcome the conversation and the scrutiny; it helps us raise the bar in terms of this important work and our commitment to it,\u201d       Eileen Naughton,        vice president of people operations, said in a blog post.The struggles at Google represent the difficulty facing the tech industry overall, which has struggled to balance out its workforce with people of different backgrounds. Equality advocates contend that diverse perspectives are essential to creating products destined for a global population.The reasons for the problem vary from a tendency to recruit from a handful of name-brand schools such as Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a propensity to hire from one\u2019s social circles, an interview process that doesn\u2019t favor minority candidates and gaps in the promotion process, according to industry experts.Google has attempted to improve on some of these fronts. This summer, it welcomed a couple dozen students from Howard University to study computer science at Google\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters and learn from Google engineers as part of an effort to forge relationships with historically black colleges.Retaining employees is also crucial. The company said that it is working to make the workplace more welcoming through communication channels such as town halls and employee-resource groups.There are a few bright spots in the report. Women now account for 20% of tech positions and a quarter of the leadership positions at Google are filled by women, a 1 percentage point increase for both from last year.Technical roles, however, continue to be the hardest for underrepresented groups to break into. Just 1% of the company\u2019s technical roles are filled by blacks and 3% are filled by Hispanics\u2014both figures the same compared with the previous year.Write to Yoree Koh at yoree.koh@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 17:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-new-diversity-chief-to-tackle-slow-pace-of-change-1498773329", "news_title": "Google\u2019s New Diversity Chief to Tackle Slow Pace of Change   ", "keywords": "google diversity,google hiring,google hiring practices,google minority hiring,silicon valley,silicon valley diversity,silicon valley hiring,silicon valley hiring practices,silicon valley minority hiring,Alphabet Inc.

He\u2019s most often found writing speeding tickets, responding to citizens who telephone to complain or keeping an eye out for \u201cblack market auto parts, small-time marijuana farming, maybe a [meth] lab or two.\u201dBut in this second novel featuring the recently widowed Farrell (who made his debut in 2014\u2019s award-winning \u201cDry Bones in the Valley\u201d), heroin has come to Wild Thyme, bringing with it an increase in burglaries, arrests for possession and even, sometimes, fatal overdoses. The once-lovely Penelope had become a user before her disappearance, says her boyfriend Kevin, a hard-drinking carpenter whose account of her violent abduction is so full of holes that he comes under suspicion for her murder, despite the absence of a corpse. Once the body of a drug dealer is found floating in a nearby river, Kevin seems an even more likely homicide suspect. Is the mysticism-spouting carpenter as demented with grief as he acts? Or is he \u201cmore than what he seems, but less than what he wants us to believe?\u201d\u201cFateful Mornings\u201d unfolds in a less hectic and more novelistic manner than many police-procedurals, leaving space for meditations on natural history (\u201cI love a cedar waxwing.

So fine is this novel, and so purely told, that it establishes Mr. Ryan as the heir apparent to the late, great Irish stylists       John McGahern       and       William Trevor.\u201cThe Spinning Heart\u201d was about the downfall of a principled construction foreman during the ravages of the post-2008 recession. \u201cAll We Shall Know\u201d is a more domestic affair, telling the story of Melody Shee, who has exacted a Pyrrhic revenge on her philandering husband, Pat, by seducing a 17-year-old boy she was teaching to read. The novel, told in Melody\u2019s diary entries, begins when she is 12 weeks pregnant from the fling. The boy, who belongs to a family of Travellers, an itinerant caste of tradespeople who live on the outskirts of society and abide by their own laws and customs, has moved away. Pat has left as well, leaving her alone to contemplate her past and an increasingly frightening future.Her thoughts circle back to self-recriminations about her treatment, years before, of an unpopular childhood friend whom she abandoned when she met her husband and who subsequently committed suicide. Until now Melody\u2019s hidden guilt has been the toxic glue holding their marriage together. \u201cWhat does a thing look like that\u2019s never looked at?\u201d she wonders. \u201cA thing has form only when light is reflected from it into someone\u2019s eye, and its image only exists as it\u2019s told to exist in a dispatch from the mind, and even then it\u2019s a compromise, an agreement between two eyes and two hemispheres of a brain, an impression. A thing can exist and never be observed, and never be bathed in light, and be forever formless, resting in the dark. I had to stay with Pat, I had to make him stay with me; I had to make him marry me; I had to, because Breedie Flynn died so that it might be so.\u201dThere are countless passages like this that are so sculpted and beautiful that one\u2019s lips begin to shape their words unbidden, the way a song can move a crowd to its rhythm. The writing takes on a further dimension when Melody, while looking for her child\u2019s father, befriends another Traveller, a young woman named Mary Crothery. Mary is also alone\u2014she left her husband when she learned that she was infertile, thereby initiating a blood feud between her clan and his. Pariahs both, the women unburden each other of their secrets and offer steady, if colorfully expressed, consolations: \u201cYou are, miss, you\u2019re kind, I know you are,\u201d Mary assures Melody. \u201cYou\u2019re a bould bitch the way you done the dirt on your husband but that don\u2019t mean you\u2019re not kind.\u201d\u201cAll We Shall Know\u201d interweaves the approach of Melody\u2019s delivery with the violence visited upon Mary and her family to arrive at an ending of soul-cleansing catharsis. This is a good time for Irish fiction. Adventurous newcomers like       Eimear McBride,       Sara Baume       and       Paul Murray       have joined such past masters as Anne Enright and Bernard MacLaverty in producing a literature of exciting variety and reliably superior prose. With this book Mr. Ryan moves to the head of a brilliant young class.Rosecrans Baldwin\u2019s       \u201cThe Last Kid Left\u201d (MCD, 391 pages, $27) begins with the shocking double murder of a New Hampshire doctor and his wife. After 19-year-old Nick Toussaint Jr. is caught driving the bodies through New Jersey he immediately submits a written confession and is extradited to his hometown of Claymore to await trial. But the seemingly open-and-shut case begins to attract interested parties. One is Martin Krug, a newly retired New Jersey policeman who sees holes in Nick\u2019s confession and goes to Claymore to do pro bono investigative work for the public defender. Another is Leela Mann, a local freelance writer who hopes that reporting the case will help land her a position at the New Yorker.As both intuit, there\u2019s much more here than meets the eye. Nick\u2019s girlfriend, Emily, happens to be the daughter of Claymore\u2019s sheriff, and the rumor going around is that he\u2019s subjected her to years of sexual abuse. Then some nude photographs that Emily snapped to smuggle to Nick in jail are leaked to the media, and suddenly the crime comes to national attention. In Mr. Baldwin\u2019s formulation, \u201ca modern-day Romeo and Juliet story plus ye olde Yankee township, plus double homicide, plus porno selfies, plus accusations of pedophilia, equals so much lurid delirium.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot to like about this book, which integrates letters, email and text messages as it briskly alternates among its wide cast of characters. The opening chapter dramatizing Nick\u2019s arrest is a barnburner, and the affably crusty retired cop, however hackneyed a figure he may be, enlivens every scene he\u2019s in. But like so many novels that hope to juice up their stories by borrowing from crime fiction, \u201cThe Last Kid Left\u201d suffers from an identity crisis. It\u2019s too long and tentacled to satisfy as a detective novel and its sensational elements weaken the serious exploration into sexual trauma. Mr. Baldwin\u2019s creditable attempt to create that rare hybrid beast, the thriller with hidden depths, never quite materializes.With the appearance of \u201cKingdom Cons\u201d (And Other Stories, 103 pages, $13.95), all three of Yuri Herrera\u2019s novellas, which meld evocations of contemporary Mexican life with different forms of mythologizing, are at last available in English. \u201cSigns Preceding the End of the World,\u201d the best of the trio, linked border crossing with Homer\u2019s Odyssey; \u201cThe Transmigration of Bodies\u201d plunged Mexico City narco-gangs into an apocalyptic fantasy; \u201cKingdom Cons\u201d\u2014the first of the books but the most recently translated\u2014imagines the fall of a drug cartel as a medieval fable.The main character here is the Artist, a street musician tapped to serve as the bard for a mighty drug kingpin. The Artist happily eulogizes the King and his court in song, but when a palace coup overturns the ruling hierarchy he is forced to choose, as a fellow courtier puts it, between making music out of \u201cpassion\u201d or \u201cobligation.\u201d This cunning little drama about the line separating art from agitprop is, like the other books, translated with colloquial verve by       Lisa Dillman.       The Artist\u2019s mission statement could speak for the whole of Mr. Herrera\u2019s daring and memorable project: \u201cLet them be scared, let the decent take offense. Put them to shame.

Earlier this year, the attorney general backed withdrawing federal guidance saying transgender students should be able to use public school bathrooms matching their gender identity. Mr. Sessions said the guidance wasn\u2019t supported by law; civil-liberties groups called the decision a major setback.But at Thursday\u2019s hate-crimes summit, Mr. Sessions set aside his usual focus on law and order to talk about protecting individual rights. He cited approvingly a case against a Mississippi man who last month was sentenced to 49 years in prison for murdering a transgender woman. Begun under the Obama administration, it was the first case prosecuted under the 2009 law involving gender identity.Mr. Sessions also said he had personally met with staffers to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of other transgender murders.\u201cWe have, and will continue to, enforce hate-crime law aggressively and appropriately where transgender individuals are victims,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cNo person should have to fear being \u00a0attacked because of who they are, what they believe, or how they worship\u201d he also said.The summit is part of the Trump administration\u2019s complicated balancing act on civil liberties and public safety issues as it juggles demands from various ideological camps within and outside the White House. Shortly after addressing the civil-rights gathering, Mr. Sessions met with families of victims killed by illegal immigrants\u2014the latest in a series of controversial moves by the administration to link illegal immigration with violent crime.The summit also occurred on the first day of the administration\u2019s travel restrictions on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries after the Supreme Court let a modified version of President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban take effect.Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil-rights group invited to participate in the summit, called Mr. Sessions record \u201cdeplorable\u201d shortly before the gathering began.\u201cWe urge the attorney general and the Trump administration to stop enacting discriminatory policies, to stop engaging in anti-Muslim rhetoric that gives license to extremists to commit violent acts, and to speak up and condemn hate when it rears its ugly head,\u201d she said.In 2009, Mr. Sessions said he opposed the hate-crimes legislation because it \u201ccreates a new system of justice for individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, providing them with a special protection, while excluding vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or police officers or soldiers, from such special protections.\u201dBut since his nomination to be the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions has spoken more positively about regulating bias-motivated crime.When pressed about the 2009 vote during his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Sessions said he disagreed with the law because state prosecutors were effectively handling hate crime. But he added, \u201cThe law has been passed, the Congress has spoken\u2014you can be sure I will enforce it.\u201dThe Justice Department hosted a reception on Wednesday that marked June as gay pride month. Before that event, Mr. Sessions was asked about it by an intern during a staff meeting, and the intern posted the attorney general\u2019s response online: \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly appropriate, and we will protect and defend and celebrate that\u2014and protect the rights of all transgender persons.\u201dThe reception honored Gavin Grimm, the transgender high-school student whose lawsuit over using the boys\u2019 bathroom was rebuffed by the Supreme Court after the administration rescinded its guidance on the issue.Mr. Sessions \u201chas personally demonstrated respect for the rule of law and offered an olive branch to the LGBT community,\u201d said Tyler Deaton, senior adviser to the American Unity Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for gay rights. \u201cI\u2019m still very disappointed with how he rolled back the guidance regarding transgender students.\u201dMr. Sessions also has faced criticism from civil-rights leaders for a budget plan that cuts 17% of the jobs in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights division, which prosecutes hate crime. Most of the 121 civil-rights jobs that would be eliminated have been vacant for a few years, according to the department.\u201cFighting hate crimes demands more than words,\u201d said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D., Wis.), the first openly gay senator when she was elected in 2012. \u201cWe need real action.\u201dThe hate-crimes summit coincided with the release of a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey in which U.S. residents described an average of 250,000 hate crimes a year from 2004 to 2015.However, less than half of these incidents were reported to police. The survey describes an increasingly narrow funnel from the public\u2019s experience of hate crime to the federal government\u2019s record-keeping, with 6% of the incidents in the survey confirmed as hate crimes by police and 3% reported to the FBI.The latest FBI statistics in 2015 showed hate crime was up 7% from the previous year, a rise driven partly by a 67% surge in anti-Muslim incidents.Also Thursday, the White House nominated Eric Dreiband to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights division, which is in charge of prosecuting federal hate crimes and violations of other civil liberties and election laws.Mr. Dreiband has filed discrimination lawsuits as the top lawyer at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and has also defended big businesses from such lawsuits as an attorney at the Jones Day law firm.hate-crimesThe reaction from civil-rights groups to his nomination varied from outright opposition to calls for tough Senate scrutiny of his record and views on policing and voting rights.Corrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave the last name of Tyler Deaton, senior adviser to the American Unity Fund, as Branch.

Recent economic data, especially inflation, have been middling, expectations for policy changes like tax cuts and fiscal stimulus have been tempered and second-quarter earnings season has yet to begin in earnest.Central banks around the world have also suggested that they will push for a normalization in monetary policy\u2014sending yields on government bonds higher.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complacency out there,\u201d said Tom Stringfellow, president of Frost Investment Advisors. With stocks already trading near where many analysts expect them to finish the year, further pullbacks wouldn\u2019t be surprising, he added.At the same time, selloffs have been relatively short-lived, suggesting investors don\u2019t want to miss out on a market that has been rising. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to rise for seven straight quarters.The blue-chip index fell 167.58 points, or 0.8%, to 21287.03 on Thursday and the S&P 500 lost 20.99 points, or 0.9%, to 2419.70\u2014their largest one-day declines in more than a month.

The VIX, which measures investors\u2019 expectations for swings in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, typically moves inversely to stocks.Tech shares led declines in the S&P 500, falling 1.8%. Google parent Alphabet fell $23.19, or 2.4%, to $937.82 and chip maker             Nvidia                   shed 5.07, or 3.3%, to 146.68. The S&P 500 tech sector is up 17% this year, but has fallen 2.6% in June as some investors have questioned whether the group\u2019s run-up has been overdone.Financial shares climbed, benefiting from a recent rise in Treasury yields, as well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to allow big U.S. banks to ramp up dividend payouts and share buybacks.The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of U.S. commercial lenders added 1.3%.Elsewhere, expectations of higher interest rates in Europe and the U.K. bolstered the euro and the pound, which were both up roughly 0.6% against the U.S. dollar.The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.3%, with broad losses across sectors offsetting gains in bank shares.A raft of statements Wednesday by policy makers at the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada has convinced many investors that the gradual end of monetary stimulus is coming.The key test is whether economic data and corporate profits come in strong enough to justify borrowing costs going up, analysts said. While optimism from central bankers can give stocks a boost, higher rates can also make them look less attractive.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is that equities continue to take it so well,\u201d said       Philippe Gijsels,        chief strategy officer at             BNP Paribas                   Fortis. \u201cMarkets have benefited enormously from the very loose monetary policy.

First, it provides up to $172 billion Republicans can use to make health insurance more affordable to low-income households. Second, it could blunt attacks from Democrats that their bill undermines health care for the many in exchange for tax cuts for a few.But keeping the investment tax could also make an expected tax overhaul this fall more complicated, and it could erode support from conservatives who see the health care bill as a chance to undo taxes created by the Affordable Care Act.\u201cPolitically, I think voters of both parties aren\u2019t going to be too sympathetic to wealthy investors,\u201d said       Brian Riedl,        a senior fellow at the free-market-oriented Manhattan Institute. But, he adds, it would be a mistake to leave the tax in place because taxes on investment are the most economically destructive levies.Several GOP senators said Thursday that retaining the tax was under discussion, but that no decision had been reached.Republican Sens.       Bob Corker       of Tennessee and       Marco Rubio       of Florida said they were open to keeping the tax. Others, including Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ted Cruz of Texas, said they wanted it eliminated.\u201cWe\u2019re repealing Obamacare, so the assumption would be that we would get rid of the taxes, too,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       (R., S.D.), the third-ranking Senate Republican. \u201cBut if it takes something like that to get our members on board to move this process forward, I think we have to consider that.\u201dUnder the latest House and Senate bills, the investment tax would be repealed retroactively for income received in 2017. The tax applies to capital gains, dividends, interest and certain passive business income for individuals with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $250,000. Those thresholds aren\u2019t indexed to inflation so the tax will affect more people over time.Repealing the tax would reduce federal revenue by $172 billion over a decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.The 2010 law paid for expansions in health-insurance coverage with taxes on health industries and high-income households. The House bill and the pending Senate legislation would repeal taxes and lower projected spending in ways that would cause more than 20 million fewer people to have health insurance after a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The ACA\u2019s health-industry taxes\u2014including a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices\u2014tend to attract bipartisan opposition. But the parties are divided when it comes to the investment-income tax, and a separate 0.9% payroll tax on high-income households. The payroll tax repeal would be delayed until 2023 under both the House and Senate bills. Now senators may delay or scrap the repeal of the investment-income tax.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about $20 trillion in debt, so I think we should seriously consider maintaining some of the tax revenue that funds those subsidies,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.).Other Republicans are resisting the change, saying the taxes were imposed as part of the ACA and should be repealed as part of the GOP\u2019s pledge to do away with the law.\u201cI don\u2019t remember anybody going around saying, \u2018Oh, except for these job-killing tax increases,\u2019 \u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.). \u201cSo I expect that we\u2019ll be repealing all the taxes.\u201dCapital-gains income is concentrated at the top of the income distribution, and more than 90% of the benefits of the cut would go to the top 1% of households, according to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Democrats have contrasted the proposed tax cut with the GOP bills\u2019 proposed cuts to Medicaid, the government program that provides health insurance for those with low incomes, painting the GOP proposals as a giveaway to the rich at the expense of the poor.\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) said of the GOP movement away from the tax cut. \u201cProgress, but they\u2019ve got a lot more work to do.\u201dIt isn\u2019t clear what keeping the tax would do in the House, which passed a different version of the health overhaul. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), said he wants to repeal all the law\u2019s taxes, but he also said he wanted to see the full Senate bill and that he was particularly concerned about non-tax provisions affecting insurance premiums.To some Republicans, doing away with the investment-income tax is important because, they say, the higher taxes created under the ACA are slowing investment and economic growth. Also, some investors may be waiting to sell assets now because they are waiting for the tax cut to be certain.Keeping the 3.8% tax also would add another issue for Republicans to address in the coming debate over revising the tax code, making that effort more complicated. If the investment taxes remain in the tax code after a health law is complete, conservatives and small-business groups will press again to repeal the taxes.But including the investment tax cut in the broader effort would tilt the plan toward the top earners, putting pressure on Republicans to rethink some of their other plans.Mr. Rubio said Thursday he was open to keeping the investment tax, but \u201conly if it\u2019s part of a plan that works, not simply just growing government.\u201dMr. Corker said it appeared the repeal of the 3.8% tax wouldn\u2019t be included in the next version of the Senate health bill, which is being written by GOP leaders. The idea, he said, is that the money would be used instead to make insurance more affordable for low-income households.Pairing the investment tax repeal with a cutback in subsidies to lower-income Americans isn\u2019t \u201csustainable,\u201d Mr. Corker said.\u201cIt is an inappropriate proposition to lower the tax on the wealthy and increase the burden on the poor,\u201d he said. \u201cMy goal is to not necessarily focus on the wealthy. My goal is to make sure we\u2019re dealing with the poor.\u201dSome Republicans, under pressure to rack up political achievements now that they control the legislative and executive branches, say they may have to yield on some of their priorities to get to a majority on difficult issues.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.), \u201cwe need to get this in the best position to pass.\u201d\u2014Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Missouri Sen.

In an unusual move Wednesday that reflected weak investor demand for the IPO, Blue Apron lowered the expected price range for its shares to $10 to $11 apiece, from the $15 to $17 range it sought earlier in a regulatory filing.If Blue Apron\u2019s employees, friends and family were disappointed, they didn\u2019t show it Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange, where they cheered as Chief Executive Matt Salzberg and other executives rang the opening bell. Most of the roughly 500 guests were local, as Blue Apron\u2019s headquarters is in Manhattan, but the company also flew in some staff for the event, Mr. Salzberg said.Mr. Salzberg added that his focus wasn\u2019t on the opening trading, but on growing the company.The average first-day share-price increase for companies that have gone public in the U.S. this year is 6.9%, according to data provider Dealogic.Blue Apron constructed a wall of lettuce in front of the NYSE on Thursday. After the stock started trading, the company served some of its most popular recipes\u2014including Thai chicken sliders and Veracruz-style rock fish tacos\u2014and held a cooking competition.Blue Apron offers a subscription service delivering premeasured ingredients and recipes for customers to cook. The company has evolved into a service with one million customers as of March 31 and more than $790 million in revenue in 2016. But even as sales have grown, the company has recorded steepening losses since its inception and the cost to attract new customers has increased.Although some investors were skeptical of Blue Apron, major food companies have made investments in food-delivery startups recently.

But that appears to have been a ruse: The virus\u2019s underlying software was different from Petya and made it technically impossible for files to be recovered, even by the attackers, researchers say.\u201cThe attackers have no actual means of decrypting the files,\u201d said Juan Andr\u00e9s Guerrero-Saade, a security researcher with antivirus vendor Kaspersky Lab ZAO. \u201cIt\u2019s masquerading as a ransomware.\u201dThe disguise slowed down the international response to the outbreak by leading cyber-responders down investigative dead-ends, said Lesley Carhart, a computer-security researcher who studied the latest attack.The Petya clone attack began Tuesday after hackers broke into the servers belonging to Intellekt Servis, a little-known Ukranian company that makes the country\u2019s most popular tax software, security researchers say. The hackers then modified the M.E. Docs software to include the malicious virus, which rapidly spread to other corporate networks when companies installed a software update.Intellekt Servis, said there was no evidence supporting the idea that its clients downloaded a corrupted update of its accounting program. Still, the company said it was cooperating with police and IT experts to determine how the virus spread.The virus employed remarkably effective password-stealing software along with attack code, allegedly stolen from the National Security Agency, to worm through corporate networks. The alleged NSA code \u201cmay have been used to compromise a few systems,\u201d but the password-stealing tools led to the bulk of the computer infections, said Charles Carmakal, a vice president at             FireEye Inc.An NSA spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.M.E. Docs is the most popular software used to electronically file tax forms with the Ukranian government, and it is widely used by international companies doing business in Ukraine, said Hennadiy Voytsitskyi, a partner with the law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP.After an M.E. Docs software update, a computer at Baker McKenzie\u2019s Kiev office was seized with the ransomware Tuesday, demanding the $300 payment in the digital currency bitcoin, Mr. Voytsitskyi said. But the law firm didn\u2019t pay, he said. The infected computer was isolated from the rest of the company and the virus didn\u2019t spread, he said.Other companies weren\u2019t so lucky. The world\u2019s largest containership operator,             A.P. Moeller-Maersk                   A/S, was forced to shut down ports in the U.S., Europe and India after experiencing widespread computer outages at its APM Terminals unit. Delivery giant FedEx Corp. said a courier division in Europe was crippled by the virus. Other victims included French construction giant             Saint Gobain                   and in the U.S., pharmaceutical giant             Merck                   & Co. and law firm DLA Piper.Kaspersky, the Russian antivirus company, said that half of the companies targeted by the infection were industrial companies in industries such as oil and gas, transportation and electricity production.Within some of these companies, the virus spread like wildfire.On Tuesday, the fake ransomware infected 5,000 computers within a matter of minutes at a large U.S. manufacturing company, said David Kennedy, chief executive at security consultancy TrustedSec LLC.\u00a0 When the company, which Mr. Kennedy declined to identify, contacted TrustedSec for help on Tuesday, investigators initially believed the company had been hit by ransomware spread via email.By the next day, they concluded that M.E. Docs was the source of the attack, he said.\u201cWhen this company called, their entire infrastructure was shut down. Gone,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. Two days later the company was \u201cat about 50% capacity,\u201d he said.Companies were already on edge after the WannaCry attack, which began on May 12 and ultimately infected more than 200,000 computers around the world by exploiting a bug in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Security researchers have linked that attack to North Korea.Mr. Kennedy believes the newest attack, with its sophistication, subterfuge, and its targeting of Ukranian systems, shows \u201csigns of nation-state hands in it.\u201dThe attack has netted its authors just under four bitcoins in ransom payments to date, or roughly $10,000. Security experts say this is a small amount for such a technically advanced attack.The lawyer, Mr. Voytsitskyi, said he continues to feel the effects of the outbreak even though his firm evaded a massive disruption. Because some financial systems in Ukraine remained offline Thursday, he was unable to pay for his lunch because the restaurant\u2019s credit-card machine remained offline. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a nuisance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d\u2014David Gauthier-Villars contributed to this article.Write to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Faux Ransomware Does Damage.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattack-launched-for-pain-not-profit-experts-say-1498771601", "news_title": "Cyberattack Launched for Pain, Not Profit, Experts Say ", "keywords": "companies,cyberattack,global hack,petya,ransomware,FedEx,FDX,Charles Carmakal,Juan Andr\u00e9s Guerrero-Saade,Hennadiy Voytsitskyi,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,malware,extortion,blackmail,financial crime,cybercrime,hacking,marine transport,couriers,messengers,freight transport,logistics,water transport,shipping,transportation"}, {"content": "New York City Council members and advocates for immigrants railed against federal immigration agents in courthouses, saying their presence undermined public safety and made noncitizens afraid to appear in court.Those testifying at a City Council committee hearing\u00a0Thursday\u00a0said that in the past few months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents increasingly have entered city courthouses, making some immigrants hesitant to make appearances, whether as defendants, victims or witnesses.ICE agents have appeared 34 times and made 21 arrests in state courthouses in New York City since February, according to a spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration.\u201cWe\u2019re hearing fears, we are seeing people not show, we are watching our clients be shackled and taken away from their families,\u201d       Tina Luongo,        an attorney at public-defender organization the Legal Aid Society, said during the hearing. Those arrested included people with and without criminal histories, she noted.A spokeswoman for ICE didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In March, U.S. Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       and Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly       wrote a letter to the chief justice of California in which they said so-called sanctuary cities\u2019 lack of cooperation with its agents, particularly in barring them from jails and prisons, makes courthouse enforcement necessary. \u201cAs a result, ICE officers and agents are required to locate and arrest these aliens in public places, rather than in secure jail facilities,\u201d they wrote.Earlier this month, ICE agents went to the Human Trafficking Intervention Court in Queens and sought to arrest a woman who was about to have prostitution charges dismissed, said City Council Member       Rory Lancman,        a Queens Democrat who chairs the council\u2019s Committee on Courts and Legal Services. ICE wanted to arrest the woman for overstaying a tourist visa, he said.\u201cThis is the choice too many immigrant New Yorkers are now being forced to confront: Show up in court or get deported,\u201d Mr. Lancman said. The woman\u2019s lawyers asked bail be set and that she be jailed. The agents left the courthouse and she ultimately was released, he added.Many arrests occur in the vestibule outside courtrooms, public defenders said. A court officer typically tells the lawyer to wait while a client enters the vestibule; the client is then approached by ICE agents, said Stan Germ\u00e1n, executive director of New York County Defender Services, a public-defender group.City council members and those who testified Thursday suggested the court system do more to keep ICE agents out of its buildings. They brainstormed various actions, including a lawsuit, that the council or others could take.The City Council has no official oversight of the state courts. The Office of Court Administration, which oversees the state courts, said in a statement that it was committed to the safety of all New Yorkers.\u201cWe maintain a continuing dialogue and have met with federal officials on a local and national level to convey our concerns and request that they treat courthouses as sensitive locations, similar to schools, hospitals and places of worship,\u201d the spokesman said.Under ICE policies, agents typically don\u2019t enter places such as schools or churches, but they don\u2019t view courthouses as sensitive locations.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 17:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/immigrant-advocates-want-agents-barred-from-nyc-courthouses-1498771530", "news_title": "Immigrant Advocates Want Agents Barred From NYC Courthouses ", "keywords": "ice,immigrants,immigrants in nyc courts,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,political,general news,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "Major events of American history from the 1920s to the 1960s can be seen now in color thanks to this five-part series\u2014an assortment of scenes, most of them digitally colorized, that cover Prohibition, the Depression, Pearl Harbor, the postwar years, Kennedy, Nixon and more.America in ColorBegins Sunday, 8 p.m., Smithsonian ChannelIt\u2019s a question whether color makes a significant difference in the potency of these clips, known so well to the world in their original, grainy black-and-white.

She\u2019s a strong voice in conferences with her fellow therapists as they discuss patients; a loving mother to her endearing 9-year-old daughter, Dolly (      Maren Heary      ); a devoted partner to her affable husband, Michael (Billy Crudup), a lawyer who takes everything about his life in stride.Toward the end of the season, when Michael discovers that his wife has been leading a dangerous double life\u2014harmful to others, her patients included, as well as herself\u2014and when the world as the two of them know it is clearly crashing down around them, all the script gives him to say is a thunderous \u201cYou never could commit!\u201d None of this, of course, is Mr. Crudup\u2019s fault.But far earlier, in the conversations that take place in the Holloways\u2019 elegant suburban home\u2014the exchanges of affectionate banter between Jean and her husband that bear small resemblance to anything resembling recognizably human talk between intimates\u2014this is the canary in the coal mine here. The indicator that, whatever else this series may offer, it won\u2019t be the dialogue of credible human characters.The one exception is the couple\u2019s child, a cheerfully boyish girl displaying signs that she may one day arrive at transgender status\u2014a fact already causing gossip among parents at her school and, yes, talk of a special bathroom. Drenched though it is in hot-topic-of-the-day symbolism, Ms. Heary carries her role off superbly.The same can\u2019t be said for her character\u2019s mother, Jean, whose roles are more confused, and none more than the one she takes on as a schemer pursuing her sexual obsessions with Sidney (      Sophie Cookson      ), a barista and the longtime love object of Jean\u2019s patient Sam (      Karl Glusman      ). Sam is in despair: Sidney has dropped him\u2014Sidney who exerts a special hold on him, who makes him feel alive, who makes life seem vivid. All this, it appears, is enough to spark a certain hunger in Jean, even as she persuades Sam that he\u2019s imagining this hold Sidney has on him, and that he\u2019s far better off without her. The therapist in due course goes looking for Sidney\u2014for herself, as it turns out.There\u2019s another self to Jean, as it turns out, another identity. She has a city apartment rented in another name, the name of a self she describes as a journalist in tapes she\u2019s left. It\u2019s the place to which she brings Sidney at the height of their passionate connection.Her pursuit of the barista, abetted by information she dragged from her poor patient, comes close, occasionally, to a kind of suspensefulness that might justify the show\u2019s description as a thriller. As do Jean\u2019s manipulative efforts to keep Sam from reuniting with Sidney when she seems to want him back\u2014inconvenient for Jean, who wants her for herself. Why, Sam wonders\u2014when the happiness of a lost love returned to him is being offered\u2014should his therapist be telling him the woman is no good for him?It\u2019s effective intrigue, yes, but a kind quickly deadened by dialogue stupefying in its torpidity\u2014as is the case throughout\u2014and by the flatness of these characters. Here\u2019s Sidney, the barista empowered, as her rejected boyfriend testifies, with magical charm and effervescence, by a capacity to make a person feel whole and alive.

The yields on 10-year government bonds in Germany, the U.K. and Canada all closed at the highest level since March. Yields rise as bond prices fall.This week\u2019s selloff upended months of calm in bond markets, underscoring investors\u2019 vulnerabilities to a potential shift in major central banks\u2019 policy stance. The moves left investors and analysts debating whether the current selling marks a significant change in direction or just a bout of volatility.Despite this week\u2019s rise in global government bond yields, they remain at very low levels. And government bonds in the developed world have been jolted by a number of selloffs in past years but they have failed to last long.The \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d that hit the U.S. bond market in 2013 and the rout of the German bond market in 2015 were both driven by investors\u2019 anxiety over the outlook for monetary policy.\u201cThe central banks have provided the markets with advanced notice of their intentions in hopes of minimizing disruptions, but as investors adjust to the new regime, periodic bouts of volatility could occur,\u2019\u2019 said       Edward Fitzpatrick,        portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Erik Weisman,        global bond portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, said he doesn\u2019t expect a sustained rise in bond yields without sustainably higher growth and inflation.Higher bond yields, said Mr. Weisman, could be self-correcting\u2014pushing up long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and undercutting growth.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.27% on Thursday, compared with 2.223% Wednesday and above this year\u2019s closing low of 2.135% on Monday.The yield on the 10-year German bund closed at 0.442%, according to Tradeweb, up from 0.249% on Monday.Thursday\u2019s selling came after a report showed the European Commission\u2019s Economic Sentiment Indicator, which aggregates business and consumer confidence, jumped to 111.1 from 109.2 in May. The release raised fresh concerns that the European Central Bank may reduce its bond-buying monetary stimulus sooner than many investors anticipated.The extended selling began earlier this week after ECB President Mario Draghi hinted Tuesday that the ECB might start winding down its large monetary stimulus as the eurozone economy picks up speed. Similar signals from top officials at the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada Wednesday added to investors\u2019 angst over tighter monetary policy.The ECB\u2019s bond purchasing, along with that of the Bank of Japan, has been a main factor sending global bond yields to historically low levels. A large number of government bonds in Japan and in the eurozone are trading with negative yields, which has propelled a global search for income and pushed many asset prices to what some analysts describe as elevated levels.Analysts have warned that bond prices could fall when central banks remove monetary stimulus, and paltry yields would leave investors who have piled into long-term government debt vulnerable to potentially steep capital losses if there\u2019s an extended selloff.Higher bond yields, if they persist, could also cause broad ripples in global markets, some investors said.The 10-year Treasury yield in particular is a bedrock of global finance, used by global investors to measure the relative value of assets including stocks.\u201cWhile I\u2019m certain the world\u2019s central banks are hoping to move gradually, the withdrawal of [stimulus] will have a significant impact on future risk-taking,\u2019\u2019 said       Jack Ablin,        chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% Thursday, and the tech-heavy         Nasdaq Co      mposite lost 1.4%, though the indexes remained near record highs.Some stocks benefited from higher bond yields. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index added 1.3% on Thursday, boosted partly by a rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield premium over the two-year note. The premium had sunk earlier this year toward the lowest since 2007.\u2018The members of the central banks are not all singing from the same hymn sheet.\u2019A higher premium, known as a steepening yield curve, is a boon for banks, which typically borrow short-term and lend long-term.Corrections & Amplifications   The euro was up 0.3% at $1.1415.

Smith,        implied he was working with retired Lt. Gen.       Mike Flynn,        at the time a senior adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump.\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m talking to       Michael Flynn       about this\u2014if you find anything, can you let me know?\u2019\u201d said       Eric York,        a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith\u2019s behalf for people who might have access to the emails.Emails written by Mr. Smith and one of his associates show that his small group considered Mr. Flynn and his consulting company, Flynn Intel Group, to be allies in their quest.What role, if any, Mr. Flynn may have played in Mr. Smith\u2019s project is unclear. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith said he knew Mr. Flynn, but he never stated that Mr. Flynn was involved.Mr. Flynn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.A Trump campaign official said that Mr. Smith didn\u2019t work for the campaign, and that if Mr. Flynn coordinated with him in any way, it would have been in his capacity as a private individual. The White House declined to comment.Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian attempts to sway the U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign. President Trump has denied any collusion and called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The Russian government has denied it interfered in the election.Mr. Smith died at age 81 on May 14, which was about 10 days after the Journal interviewed him. His account of the email search is believed to be his only public comment on it.The operation Mr. Smith described is consistent with information that has been examined by U.S. investigators probing Russian interference in the elections.Those investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence.It isn\u2019t clear who that intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith\u2019s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers. The reports were compiled during the same period when Mr. Smith\u2019s group was operating, according to the officials.Mr. Smith said he worked independently and wasn\u2019t part of the Trump campaign.His project began over Labor Day weekend 2016 when Mr. Smith, a private-equity executive from Chicago active in Republican politics, said he assembled a group of technology experts, lawyers and a Russian-speaking investigator based in Europe to acquire emails the group theorized might have been stolen from the private server Mrs. Clinton used as secretary of state.Mr. Smith\u2019s focus was some 33,000 emails Mrs. Clinton said were deleted because they were deemed personal. Mr. Smith said he believed that the emails might have been obtained by hackers and that they actually concerned official matters Mrs. Clinton wanted to conceal\u2014two notions for which he offered no evidence. Mrs. Clinton gave the State Department tens of thousands of emails related to official business.Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director       James Comey       said in July 2016 there was no evidence the private server had been hacked but held out the possibility it could have been.In the interview with the Journal, Mr. Smith said he and his colleagues found five groups of hackers who claimed to possess Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, including two groups he determined were Russians.\u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Mr. Smith said.U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Russians of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman,       John Podesta,        and providing them to WikiLeaks last summer as part of a multifaceted operation to interfere with the election and help Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump on July 27 publicly encouraged Russia to go further and find the Clinton \u201cemails that are missing.\u201d Asked about that on Monday, White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       said Mr. Trump was joking.Mr. Smith said after vetting batches of emails offered to him by hacker groups last fall, he couldn\u2019t be sure enough of their authenticity to leak them himself. \u201cWe told all the groups to give them to WikiLeaks,\u201d he said. WikiLeaks has never published those emails or claimed to have them.Mr. Smith and one of his associates said they had a line of communication with Mr. Flynn and his consulting company.In one Smith email reviewed by the Journal, intended to entice outside experts to join his work, he offered to make introductions to Mr. Flynn\u2019s son, Michael G. Flynn, who worked as chief of staff in his father\u2019s company. Mr. Smith\u2019s email mentioned the son among a small number of other people he said were helping.Michael G. Flynn didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.In another recruiting email seen by the Journal,       Jonathan Safron,        a law student Mr. Smith described as a close colleague, included links to the websites and LinkedIn profiles of people purportedly working with the Smith team. At the top of the list was the name and website of Flynn Intel, which Mr. Flynn set up after his 2014 firing as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.Mr. Safron declined to comment on his email or Mr. Smith\u2019s project.In phone conversations, Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son, according to this expert. The person said an anti-Clinton research document prepared by Mr. Smith\u2019s group identified the younger Mr. Flynn as someone associated with the effort. The expert said that based on his conversations with Mr. Smith, he understood the elder Mr. Flynn to be coordinating with Mr. Smith\u2019s group in his capacity as a Trump campaign adviser.The senior Mr. Flynn was fired as national-security adviser in February after misleading administration officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador concerning sanctions. Those conversations put Mr. Flynn under scrutiny by the FBI and then the special counsel, according to U.S. officials.Mr. Smith said in the interview he supported Mr. Flynn\u2019s efforts during the presidential transition to establish relations with Russian officials.Mr. Smith said he never intended to pay for any emails found by hackers.He said he understood the risk in publishing the emails himself. If, under public scrutiny, they proved not to be genuine, \u201cpeople would say we made them up,\u201d he said, and the whole project would be dismissed as a Republican hit job on the Clinton campaign. In the early 1990s, Mr. Smith helped publicize Arkansas state troopers\u2019 claims that then-Gov.       Bill Clinton       had enlisted them to arrange trysts with women, an unproven allegation denied by the Clinton White House.Mr. Smith\u2019s views on Russian hacking were complex. While he said he believed Russians were likely among those who tried to steal Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, he dismissed intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that the Russia\u2019s government meddled in the election to discredit Mrs. Clinton and to help Mr. Trump.Mr. Smith was himself once a hacking victim. Emails he wrote about the 2015 contest to fill former House Speaker       John Boehner\u2019s       seat were stolen from the Illinois Republican Party and then made public, in a campaign U.S. intelligence officials attributed to Russian actors. Mr. Smith didn\u2019t dispute that Russia might have been to blame. He said he was unconcerned about his messages being exposed.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Write to Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Operative Claiming Flynn Tie Sought Clinton Emails.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 17:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-operative-sought-clinton-emails-from-hackers-implied-a-connection-to-flynn-1498770851", "news_title": "GOP Operative Sought Clinton Emails From Hackers, Implied a Connection to Flynn", "keywords": "clinton emails,flynn,hillary emails,mueller investigation,russian hacking,trump and russia,Flynn Intel Group,WikiLeaks,Mike Flynn,Peter W.

So, after consulting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and cybersecurity experts, officials made the decision to replace the system.Now, doctors, nurses and other hospital staff are adjusting to what will be days of working off paper forms to record vital signs, order medications and scribble notes.\u201cThere is a lot more paper visible up on our units than there used to be,\u201d Ms. Morgan said. \u201cIt was a bit of organized chaos at first. Now we\u2019ve hit our stride.\u201dNurses reverted to two-foot-long paper templates for patient records known as flow sheets, she said.Employees from human resources and finance, who can\u2019t work without computers, have stepped in to ferry doctor\u2019s orders from one hospital department to another, deliver prescriptions or shuttle billing records. The pneumatic tubes that typically whisk materials throughout the hospital fell silent in the attack. The tube system is connected to the hospital\u2019s computer network.The Petya attack disrupted operations at major corporations including             Merck                   & Co. and             A.P. Moeller-Maersk        AMKBY 0.55%       A/S and at least two other U.S. hospitals owned by the Heritage Valley Health System in Pennsylvania.Surgeons at the Heritage Valley Hospital in Beaver, Pa., canceled elective surgeries Tuesday\u00a0and\u00a0Wednesday, but the Heritage Valley hospitals and emergency rooms remained open.Heritage Valley continued to make progress restoring its clinical and ancillary care systems\u00a0Thursday, a spokeswoman said. Regarding whether the system was able to pay a ransom, she said,\u00a0\u201cEven if we wanted to pay, it is our understanding the [internet service providers] have blocked communication with the attackers.\u201dAt Princeton Community Hospital, new hardware will replace existing infected computers and servers. Backup records will be used to restore patient files after technology staff screen\u00a0the backup files\u00a0to be sure they aren\u2019t infected by the malware, Ms. Morgan said.\u00a0Officials hope to have the network rebuilt by the end of next week.It isn\u2019t yet known how much it will cost and how much the hospitals\u2019 cyber insurance and business-continuity insurance will cover. The nonprofit hospital, which ends the fiscal year on\u00a0June 30, finished last year with a slim 3.5% operating margin on revenue of $139.1 million.The cyberattack almost left Princeton Community Hospital without even paper templates, which were stored on\u00a0a computer file, to be printed.\u00a0No one could access the file, Ms. Morgan said. Fortunately, her administrative assistant,       Linda Cunningham,       \u00a0had an archive of paper templates that she had printed and saved in a binder,\u00a0Ms. Morgan said.Doctors and nurses continued to care for more than 100 patients who were being treated in the hospital\u00a0Thursday, according to Ms. Morgan. Surgeries continued as scheduled. Four uninfected computers can access the hospital\u2019s electronic medical record data using an uncompromised guest network, but the records can only be viewed, she said.The emergency room continued to accept patients with life-threatening conditions, but diverted other ambulances between\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0morning and\u00a0Thursday\u00a0morning.The emergency room reopened to all patients\u00a0Thursday\u00a0morning, Ms. Morgan said.Write to Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 16:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattack-forces-west-virginia-hospital-to-scrap-its-computer-systems-1498769889", "news_title": "Cyberattack Forces West Virginia Hospital to Scrap Computers", "keywords": "computers,computer system,cyberattack,cybersecurity,heritage valley hospital,hospital,petya,princeton community hospital,surgery,west virginia,Heritage Valley Health System,Federal Bureau of Investigation,A.P.

The union that represents the paper\u2019s news staff estimated the number of demonstrators at 450.In late May, New York Times Co. said it was initiating a round of buyouts of its editing staff as it looks to shift the balance between reporters and editors, part of a broader newsroom restructuring. The company said that if enough people didn\u2019t accept buyouts, it would be forced to lay off some staffers.No specific target has been set for job reductions, but the Times expects to use the savings\u2014along with proceeds from a jump in digital subscriptions\u2014to hire as many as an additional 100 reporters.In a federal filing dated May 31, the Times forecast approximately $17 million to $23 million of charges in connection with the job cuts.\u201cWe take employee concerns seriously and support their right to speak their minds,\u201d the Times said in a statement. \u201cBut we also believe increasing the number of reporters is vital to the future of The New York Times. Even with these changes, we will have more editors than any similar news outlet and our editing standards and processes will remain the most robust and rigorous of any news organization.\u201dThe walkout capped a tense week. On Wednesday, copy editors at the paper sent a letter to Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Managing Editor       Joseph Kahn       decrying the impending job reductions and requesting that the company \u201csharply increase\u201d the number of positions being made available for its editing staff.In a written response, the two editors replied that \u201cwe are not, as we have said repeatedly, eliminating copy editing. A majority of people currently employed by the copy desk will find new editing jobs.\u201dA second letter from the reporting staff sent to the two senior editors on Thursday said, \u201cWe believe that the plan to eliminate dozens of editing jobs and do away with the copy desks is ill-conceived and unwise, and will damage the quality of our product.\u201dTimes science writer       Donald McNeil Jr.       said he joined the walkout to \u201csupport the copy editors but also to support all of us. They don\u2019t need to do this. It\u2019s demoralizing. And it creates an us-versus-them mentality in a place that has always had one sense of mission.\u201dThe protesters belong to the NewsGuild of New York, which represents an estimated 3,000 workers, most of them news professionals.       Josh Austin,        a spokesman for the union, said its membership counts an estimated 1,100 staffers at the Times. These include 110 copy editors, many of whom he said could lose their posts if the paper moves forward with its job cuts.\u201cThe walkout is a way for our members to express to management that what they are doing is devastating,\u201d said Mr. Austin. \u201cIn an age of fake news, we need copy editors more than ever.\u201dWrite to Jeffrey A.

Paul LePage has threatened to shutdown the state for the first time since 1991 over disagreements on taxes. In Connecticut, Gov.       Dannel Malloy       is preparing deep spending cuts as an agreement before Friday night appears elusive.All but four states start their next fiscal year on Saturday, and legislatures in 11 of those states had yet to finalize a budget as of Wednesday, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\u201cIt\u2019s not untypical to wait to the end. What\u2019s untypical is the degree of crisis that we\u2019re seeing in terms of not being able to make the budget balance,\u201d said Elizabeth McNichol, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. She noted this kind of stress in budget negotiations is more common during a downturn.The lengthy budget processes may be another sign that states are on an unusually rocky fiscal road despite being eight years into an economic recovery. A recent Nasbo analysis of governors\u2019 spending proposals for the coming fiscal year showed they were aiming for just a 1% increase in general-fund spending, the smallest rise since fiscal 2010.Nowhere are the budget pressures greater than in Illinois, which faces a possible debt downgrade to junk status and hasn\u2019t had a budget for two years. The two-year budget stalemate has resulted in a nearly $15 billion backlog in unpaid bills. Gov.       Bruce Rauner       has told lawmakers he will keep them in session beyond Friday\u2019s deadline if they fail to agree on a balanced budget.Some states are finding a way forward. Washington state lawmakers Wednesday reached the outline of a deal that would avert a partial government shutdown. The sides had been at odds over education funding.Elsewhere, states like Pennsylvania and Connecticut are struggling to fill large deficits.\u201cThere\u2019s still a core number [of states] that are dealing with the fact that revenue is just not growing at the same pace as expenditures,\u201d said Marcy Block, lead Fitch Ratings analyst for Connecticut, New Jersey and Delaware.Budget work in those three states has come down to the wire, most notably in Connecticut, where lawmakers are struggling to deal with a $5.1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget period.Gov. Malloy has said if lawmakers can\u2019t reach an agreement he will issue an executive order to keep the government running that would close the deficit through spending cuts alone, which would amount to a $2.1 billion reduction for the entire fiscal year beginning Saturday. That plan would sharply reduce education funding, eliminate summer youth employment programs and cut rental-assistance programs.In New Jersey, lawmakers face a possible government shutdown over the holiday weekend if they can\u2019t reach a deal. But all sides remained at odds Thursday with competing priorities between education spending and Republican Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s push to give the state more power over its largest insurer.The consequences for failing to pass a budget on time vary by state. In Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers are hashing out disagreements over how to raise transportation funding, the state operates at prior-year funding levels until a new budget is enacted.There are also 22 states where the government shuts down over a blown budget deadline, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Maine is hovering close to its first government shutdown in more than two decades while lawmakers try to fashion a budget that increases education spending while undoing a voter-backed additional tax on the state\u2019s high-income earners that was passed in November. Republicans have sought to do away with that tax altogether while Democrats have agreed to lessen it.A plan from Senate Republicans on Wednesday appeared to bridge the gap on education spending, but Republican Gov. LePage blasted the proposal on a radio show Thursday. The plan included a lodging-tax increase he had supported, but without an offsetting income-tax cut he sought, a spokesman said.To pass the two-year budget, the state legislature will need a two-thirds majority, enough to also override a potential veto. But the governor can hold the bill for 10 days before issuing that veto, and Mr. LePage said Thursday he is ready to do that.In a news release, the governor said state police and state parks are among the entities that will continue running during a shutdown.The disruption could prove harmful to the state\u2019s tourism and hospitality industry, said Mark Brewer, a political-science professor at the University of Maine. The timing is bad, with travelers about to hit the road for the long Independence Day weekend.\u201cIf I had hair and I worked in those industries, I would be pulling it out right now,\u201d Mr. Brewer said.\u2014Joseph De Avila and Kate King contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'State Budget Battles Heat Up as Deadline Draws Closer.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 16:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-budget-battles-show-few-signs-of-letting-up-1498769391", "news_title": "State Budget Battles Show Few Signs of Letting Up ", "keywords": " education funding, fiscal year,state budgets, state governors, state legislatures,state shutdowns, tax fights,National Association of State Budget Officers,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,education"}, {"content": "Gold prices slipped Thursday as investors favored riskier assets amid signs of economic confidence from central bankers around the world.Gold for August delivery fell 0.3% to $1,245.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing at a one-week low.Stronger stock markets and a more positive view of growth prospects for global economies have pressed on gold, viewed typically as a haven asset preferred in times of instability, said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.Copper, meanwhile, benefited from the positive economic sentiment, as futures for September delivery gained 0.7% to $2.6955 a pound, the highest close since March 3.A raft of statements Wednesday by policy makers at the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada convinced many that the end of monetary stimulus is coming nearer.That global growth optimism is helping copper prices rise, said       Kash Kamal,        senior research analyst at Sucden Financial.\u201cIn the bigger macro picture, global growth is running at a solid clip, which we expect to slow only modestly in the base case.

The exhibition of 400 black-and-white photos, shot between 1961-1967, took place in 1970 at the Fort Worth Art Center in Texas. It was an achievement that remained meaningful to him since, despite his prolific acting career, Hopper increasingly wished to be remembered as a photographer by the end of his life.After he died in 2010, his daughter Marin Hopper, who designs the luxury fashion brands Hayward and Hopper (named after her maternal grandfather and father, respectively), discovered all of the photographs from the show tucked away in his garage, in boxes among Christmas ornaments. \u201cIt was incredible to find the layout of the original show and the notes behind each piece,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was hundreds of photographs. No one could believe they weren\u2019t in art storage.\u201dThe collection of over 400 photos, now titled The Lost Album, opens at Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles on July 8. The small-scale images mounted simply on cardboard make for an intimate viewing experience. The Lost Album has previously been shown at the Martin Gropius Museum in Berlin, in London at the Royal Academy of Arts and at Gagosian Gallery in New York. This summer\u2019s show is a homecoming of sorts not simply because Hopper had settled in a Frank Gehry-designed home in Venice by the mid-\u201880s, but also because his photographs will be accompanied by the works of artists who were his friends and influences, including Andy Warhol, Wallace Berman and Bruce Conner.Hopper was an avid collector of both assemblage and pop art onwards from age 26, when he bought one of Andy Warhol\u2019s soup can paintings for $75. A shot of Hopper\u2019s living room includes works by Warhol, Ed Kienholz and Jasper Johns. Naturally, the people who surrounded him informed part of his unique perspective. Though Hopper didn\u2019t want to be known as just an actor who took pictures of his interesting circle, his portraits of his actor and artist friends remain among his most captivating. He captured the era\u2019s less high-profile characters too: hippies and protesters and motorcyclists. And his interests weren\u2019t limited to the New York City and Los Angeles scenes. A decade after meeting Martin Luther King Jr. at the Chateau Marmont in 1955, Hopper joined and photographed one of the activist\u2019s famous marches from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965.Hopper\u2019s daughter Marin didn\u2019t see his photos until she was 18 or 19, and she remembers feeling awed by her father\u2019s natural ability to frame everything he photographed in his mind. Just as movie directors can\u2019t crop their shots after filming, Hopper never cropped his compositions once they were developed. It makes sense then that despite his passion for art, his photography was more about his aspiration to make movies. \u201cI think these photos saved his life because it gave him an outlet, even when felt like he wasn\u2019t going to become a director,\u201d she says. \u201cTaking them helped him bridge the gap between being an actor and becoming a director.\u201d Hopper stopped taking photographs as he prepared to direct and star in Easy Rider, the 1969 film that made his career.Marin sees The Lost Album as a precursor to this success. \u201cIt shows you so much about , as he would refer to it, his keen eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re almost on the road with him, through his travels, through his life.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The entire \u2018Lost Album,\u2019 a collection of over 400 photos, will be exhibited at the Kohn Gallery.

Instead, these firms are relying on outside data such as credit activity, property deeds, college-attendee records, liens, evictions and other public information to give them a sense of an applicant\u2019s well-being, The Wall Street Journal reported in January.\u00a0These data sources are used in conjunction with health-related answers provided by consumers and longstanding industry tools such as prescription-drug databases.On Thursday, New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent       Maria T. Vullo       sent a letter to about 160 life insurers, asking for details about their use of new data sources, aiming to ensure practices are in line with state laws and regulations.\u00a0The Journal has reviewed the letter.In a statement, Ms. Vullo said her department \u201csupports innovations that reduce the overall time and expense of obtaining life insurance coverage.\u201d Her concern is whether practices are based on sound actuarial principles, or will result in higher rates for certain consumers.The department is acting as venture-capital funding has poured into insurance technology. Last year, investment firms spent $1.7 billion across 179 \u201cinsure tech\u201d deals, according to CB Insights, a firm with a venture-capital database. The industry is seen as ripe for innovation because of its heavy reliance on traditional ways of doing business even as consumers increasingly favor online financial transactions.The state\u2019s action shows the power that regulators hold over how\u2014and if\u2014data scientists, software engineers and other quantitative professionals get their way.Specifically, the New York letter asks if insurers use algorithmic underwriting, and, if so, what data sources they rely on. It also asks how the information is weighted within an algorithm. The letter asks about disclosures to applicants about the data\u2019s use, and what happens with the data after underwriting is completed.Insurers are trying to reverse decades of declining sales of individual life-insurance policies. They say that details about lifestyle\u2014such as years of residence at a single address and steady credit activity\u2014can be markers of a stable lifestyle indicating a good risk for a life insurer.Insurers said the information is used to speed up the application process, and that they divert online applicants back to the conventional application process if issues surface with the nontraditional data. They say they obtain permission from consumers to obtain personal information. Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, databases used in underwriting must provide consumers opportunity to correct errors.Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 16:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-regulator-seeks-details-from-life-insurers-using-algorithms-to-issue-policies-1498768476", "news_title": "New York Regulator Seeks Details From Life Insurers Using Algorithms to Issue Policies ", "keywords": "big data,finreg,life insurers,Maria T.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week had expected a more modest rise to 109.5.The surprisingly strong improvement should aid the eurozone\u2019s recovery, since businesses and households are likely to spend more freely if they feel more confident. That increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank will soon step back from the economic stimulus measures it has provided since mid-2014.\u201cPolitical winds are becoming tailwinds,\u201d ECB President       Mario Draghi       said in a speech Tuesday. \u201cThere is newfound confidence in the reform process, and newfound support for European cohesion, which could help unleash pent-up demand and investment.\u201dJune\u2019s rise in sentiment was aided by France, where the country-specific reading climbed to 109.8 from 107.6 in May. This was in response to       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       victory in May\u2019s presidential elections and the strong showing of his party in subsequent legislative polls. The pro-EU centrist has pledged to remake the country\u2019s aged labor regulations and give the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy the vigor it has long lacked.Speaking in London after an ECB gathering of policy makers in Portugal, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President       James Bullard       said he had detected a new sense of optimism following Mr. Macron\u2019s victory, which may open the way for changes to the way the currency area\u2019s economy is managed.\u201cYou have a sort of springtime here in which there will be renewed efforts on the European project, to move it forward,\u201d he said.Other large eurozone countries also saw big jumps, including Germany and Spain.Manufacturers across the 19-country currency bloc were particularly upbeat\u2014a mood echoed by Germany\u2019s VMDA engineering federation, which Thursday raised its sector output forecast, citing better-than-expected demand from the eurozone and Asia.\u201cEverything is in place for a new upswing,\u201d VDMA Chief Economist       Ralph Wiechers       said.The pickup in confidence has coincided with renewed optimism about the future of the EU. Pessimism about the bloc\u2019s prospects grew in the wake of the financial crisis and revived in 2016 after Britons voted to leave the EU. But the first half of 2017 saw a change in outlook, with the commission\u2019s biannual Eurobarometer survey recording that 56% of the 28,007 people questioned between May 20 and May 30 felt optimistic\u2014the highest proportion since early 2015.That revival is something of a surprise. Coming into 2017, nationalist political parties that were hostile to both the bloc and the euro appeared to have momentum, while the U.K.\u2019s Brexit vote was a major blow.However, those anti-euro forces failed to make a great deal of headway with the public, and there was a firming in the eurozone\u2019s recovery and a continuing fall in unemployment. In the Eurobarometer survey, 46% of respondents described the EU\u2019s economic situation as \u201cgood,\u201d the highest proportion since before the global financial crisis.The ECB has referenced the return of optimism as one reason for its improved view of the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects. Indeed, the pickup in confidence is consistent with other signs that economic growth sped up in the three months through June, having already accelerated in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Mr. Draghi hinted that the central bank might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth.But the ECB views strengthening growth as a means to its end of raising inflation to just below 2% and it doesn\u2019t expect to meet that goal within the next three years.\u201cJune\u2019s EC business and consumer surveys point to a sharp acceleration of eurozone growth, which will increase speculation about ECB asset purchase tapering to come and add to upward pressure on the euro,\u201d said       Jessica Hinds,        an analyst at Capital Economics. \u201cBut with inflation expectations still subdued, we doubt that the ECB will raise interest rates until 2019.\u201dOther statistics released Thursday showed declines in the annual rate of inflation in Spain and Belgium. But the inflation rate picked up in Germany, to 1.5% in June from 1.4% in May.Despite their optimism, neither eurozone businesses nor consumers expected a significant pickup in the pace of price rises over the coming year, according to the commission\u2019s survey.\u2014       Nina Adam       contributed to this article.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 16:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-confidence-hits-post-crisis-high-1498727238", "news_title": "Eurozone\u2019s Confidence Hits Post-Crisis High", "keywords": " ecb,eurozone,eurozone consumer confidence,European Union,European Commission,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,inflation,prices,consumer sentiment,euro zone,currency,economic news,dj economic sentiment indicator,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The GOP\u2019s narrow victory in Georgia should be a wake-up call to the Democrats (\u201cGOP Prevails in Georgia,\u201d page one, June 21).

Still, the analysts added, \u201cit does feel as if a wave of selling has ebbed for now.\u201dThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that daily average U.S. output last week fell 100,000 barrels to 9.25 million, coinciding with a tropical storm which resulted in some production shutdowns.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear how much of that was due to the tropical storm in the Gulf last week,\u201d said       Tom Pugh,        analyst at consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cIf it continues to be a bit of a trend\u2014either a fall in production or stable production\u2014then we could see a more sustained rally.\u201d\u2018The low prices [have] finally spilled over to the production side and we believe production should fall further throughout the year.\u2019Earlier this month U.S. oil output rose to its highest level since August 2015. The resiliency and the increasing efficiency demonstrated by U.S. producers has largely foiled the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 effort to lower global inventories. Since January, when OPEC members and Russia began cutting output, oil prices have fallen 16% and the glut has remained.Analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said Thursday that oil supplies have been slower to shrink than anticipated. They cut their forecast for U.S. crude prices by $7.50 a barrel to $47.50 in the third quarter and $50 the fourth quarter.But some oil investors are hoping that recent low prices will U.S. producers down and bring the market to back to a balance.\u201cWe believe that prices have reached a level near $45/bbl. at which US producers should start to adjust their drilling activity,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note Wednesday.\u201cThe low prices has finally spilled over to the production side and we believe production should fall further throughout the year,\u201d said OCBC economist       Barnabas Gan.But Wednesday\u2019s weekly report from the EIA also had many bearish factors, including a rise in crude stocks.

Last year, 55% of its students were white, 33% Hispanic and 3% black, according to state data. About 12% were poor.When the state education commissioner endorsed the school\u2019s expansion, it had a slightly rising share of white students. The three-member panel\u2019s ruling noted that the charter\u2019s growth couldn\u2019t be linked directly to district enrollment changes because the city as a whole had become increasingly white, and an array of private schools affected parents\u2019 choices as well.The school board is disappointed the appellate division \u201cfailed to place stronger limits on the Department of Education\u2019s broad discretion in such a politically charged area of law,\u201d said board attorney       Eric Harrison.The state\u2019s charter-approval system, he said, is unfair. \u201cOur quarrel was never with HoLa,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cIt was about the need to improve a flawed process where statistics can be distorted to support a predetermined outcome.\u201dThe ruling noted that the school\u2019s staff and parents canvassed subsidized-housing developments to recruit families and gave preference to low-income children in its admission\u2019s lottery.The school outperforms the state average on New Jersey\u2019s annual tests: Last year 81% of HoLa\u2019s test-takers met expectations in English-language arts and 74% did so in math.\u201cHoLa provides quality education to a cross section of Hoboken\u2019s children,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cAs a dual-language school, HoLa allows students to become bilingual in a curriculum with a multi-cultural content, and thus advances public-policy goals.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/n-j-court-affirms-hoboken-charter-school-expansion-1498766189", "news_title": "N.J.

In addition, the police allegedly engaged in arms dealing and kidnapping of suspected drug traffickers in exchange for ransom payments.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult day, but it\u2019s necessary,\u201d said       Roberto S\u00e1,        the state security secretary.Begun in February 2016 after a jailed drug dealer began cooperating with authorities, the operation highlighted the troubled state of Rio\u2019s police forces at a time of rebounding crime in the recent Olympic host.Long known for their violent tactics, Rio state police killed 383 people in first four months of 2017, 60% more than a year earlier, according to official statistics. Homicides rose 11% to 1,905.At that rate, 2017 is on track to be the deadliest year since 2009 for Rio. Sociologists say the violence is likely being fueled by a brutal recession and fiscal crisis exacerbated by the financial woes of government-run oil company             Petr\u00f3leos Brasileiros SA,       or Petrobras, which is based here and forms the backbone of the local economy.The crisis has driven up unemployment, delayed salary payments to civil servants and left police so short on funds that, at times, they have been unable to refuel their patrol cars.Write to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-authorities-arrest-rio-police-on-bribery-allegations-1498766144", "news_title": "Brazil Authorities Arrest Rio Police on Bribery Allegations ", "keywords": "brazil,corruption,police,rio,sting,bribery,political,general news,crime,legal action,drug trafficking,dealing,financial crime,gangs,criminal enterprises,trafficking,smuggling"}, {"content": "ChicagoThe shadows of French colonialism, of 19th-century cultural appropriations, and of the artist\u2019s unbridled carnal appetites found in his work have made the French Post-Impressionist painter       Paul Gauguin       (1848-1903) a lodestone for scholars and commentators of every conceivable stripe. Gauguin\u2019s infamous self-image as an exotic, unrepentant savage has been debunked, but what has not received its due is the breadth of the artist\u2019s creative process\u2014the radical experiments and breathtaking range of media Gauguin employed to define a willfully crude, self-conscious primitivism that defied the hierarchies of the fine arts.Gauguin: Artist as AlchemistArt Institute of Chicago  Through Sept. 10The exhaustive and exhilarating \u201cGauguin: Artist as Alchemist,\u201d an exhibition of almost 250 works curated by       Gloria Grooms       of the Art Institute of Chicago and Claire Bernardi and Oph\u00e9lie Ferlier-Bouat of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay (where the show travels next), changes that. Though he supported himself as a painter (some 70 of his paintings are on view), the primal place of sculpture and the applied arts in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre\u2014as seen here in wood, carved stone, embellished furniture and richly expressive ceramics\u2014reveals the depth of his fascination with decoration and the lowly craft arts that would shape his outlier aesthetic, and even his identity. Working in France, the Caribbean and finally French Polynesia, Gauguin produced an oeuvre of astonishing complexity and refinement that itself challenges his mythic persona as an ultra-sauvage.The show, organized chronologically, opens with early works that highlight the artist\u2019s deep attachment to the humble objects he carved or collected and their significance for his art. A chalk drawing by       Camille Pissarro       of Gauguin whittling a small wooden statuette\u2014a skill likely acquired in the artist\u2019s youthful years as mariner\u2014is flanked by the tiny figure pictured within it, painstakingly carved by Gauguin in a tropical hardwood he would see again in Tahiti. Likewise, an 18th-century pinewood tankard looms large in Gauguin\u2019s \u201cClovis Sleeping\u201d (1884), an exquisite portrait of his young son that anticipates the dreamlike world of the artist\u2019s later Symbolist works. The object\u2019s physical presence here grounds that vision in reality. A later wooden walking stick, on which the artist sculpted a snake and female nude and topped with a carved Breton sabot (or wooden clog), encapsulates his stay in Brittany in the late 1880s even as it offers a rustic riposte to the elegant accouterments of Parisian fl\u00e2neurs.Gauguin discovered ceramic art making in 1886 in the studio of       Ernest Chapelet,        and produced over a hundred such objects during his years in France. Though prized by the artist and often depicted in his still lifes (a number are included here), Gauguin\u2019s clay and stoneware creations remain his least known works; the inclusion of almost half of those that have survived is an epiphany. The artist delighted in the strangeness of such works as his \u201cVase With the Portrait Mask of a Woman\u201d (1887-88), a glazed vessel on which the accidental effects of the firing process are celebrated with gilded highlights. Gauguin remembered his mother\u2019s collection of anthropomorphic ceramics from her native Peru, and the placement of this work alongside the ancient Andean \u201cPortrait Vessel of a Ruler\u201d is one of the show\u2019s many inspired pairings. Likewise, his stoneware \u201cSelf-Portrait in the Form of a Grotesque Head\u201d (1889) one of the \u201cmonstrosities\u201d he boasted of to his friends, is beautifully juxtaposed with an ancient terra-cotta portrait from Mexico of a kind he would have known from Parisian ethnographic museums. It suggests the countless visual prompts from non-European cultures that would shape his defiant aesthetic.The artist also mined his own works for eloquent motifs. The tentative female nude who inches into a pool atop his elegant glazed \u201cCup Decorated With the Figure of a Bathing Girl\u201d (1887-88), for example, evolved from the charcoal and pastel \u201cBreton Bather\u201d (1886-87), a design for a fan and for stoneware, and is reprised in reverse in a zincograph that belonged to the brilliant, chrome yellow prints of his Volpini Suite (1889).Neither clay nor kilns were to be found in Tahiti when Gauguin arrived in 1891, so he turned to the materials at hand, working in tapa (bark cloth), stone and especially tropical hardwoods in works that burnished the authenticity of his exoticism. He became obsessed with the local ti\u2019ii, the mysterious Maori deities banned by Christian missionaries and hidden away by natives; they figure in his Polynesian paintings and were joined by the artist\u2019s own small idols carved in wood and adorned with precious objects.Woodblock prints, too, took on a huge new place in his output, as seen here in the pages and printing plates of his \u201cNoa Noa Suite,\u201d an ambitious graphic project he undertook on his sole trip back to Paris (1893-95) that offered a synthesis of his ambiguous Tahitian imagery and primitive style. Its shallow carved blocks of flattened motifs may well have inspired the artist\u2019s later ensembles of painted and sculpted reliefs, including the decorative panels of his \u201cMaison du Jouir\u201d (or House of Pleasure) that he built in his last days on the remote Marquesas Islands. The final expression of his mythic artistic identity, its remnants here bring the exhibition to a powerful and poignant close.\u2014Ms. Lewis teaches art history at Trinity College, Hartford, Conn.Appeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'The Unknown Gauguin.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gauguin-artist-as-alchemist-review-the-unknown-gauguin-1498765806", "news_title": "\u2018Gauguin: Artist as Alchemist\u2019 Review: The Unknown Gauguin", "keywords": " art institute of chicago, artist as alchemist,arts in review,gauguin,Paul Gauguin,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,modern art,reviews"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May       won a critical parliamentary vote on Thursday to approve her policy program, overcoming the first of what is likely to be many challenges to her authority in the months ahead.U.K. lawmakers backed Mrs. May\u2019s legislative agenda by 323 votes to 309, a slender margin that underscores the prime minister\u2019s limited room for maneuver in Parliament after she called elections that resulted in her Conservative Party losing its majority.Thursday\u2019s win was possible only after a pact signed this week between the Conservatives and Northern Ireland\u2019s small Democratic Unionist Party delivered Mrs. May an extra 10 votes that enabled her to face down opposition to her government from an emboldened Labour Party and other, smaller groups.The prospect of a minority Conservative government propped up by the DUP following Mrs. May\u2019s election misfire has cast doubt on her future as prime minister, concerns magnified by her perceived hesitancy in responding to a fire in London\u2019s Grenfell Tower apartment block that killed about 80 people.The prime minister\u2019s slim majority leaves her vulnerable to rebellion among lawmakers in her party, which is deeply split over how Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union should look.It has also raised questions about the government\u2019s ability to successfully negotiate Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and deliver on other policies.Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said Mrs. May \u201cgot over the first hurdle\u201d but her weakened position means she now faces the risk of opposition from both pro- and anti-EU Conservative factions. \u201cThere could be trouble from both sides,\u201d he said.The government survived Thursday\u2019s vote \u201cby the skin of its teeth,\u201d Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       said in a statement following the vote.Signs that the government\u2019s unity on Brexit policy may be fraying have already appeared. This week Brexit secretary David Davis accused Treasury chief       Philip Hammond       of inconsistency over his support for a multiyear transition deal to ease departure from the bloc for companies. The two senior ministers also seemed to clash over whether the U.K. should remain attached to the bloc\u2019s customs union, which sets common tariffs on imports from outside its borders, during that transition.Splits over Brexit also came into the open Thursday within Labour. An amendment to the government\u2019s legislative program presented by Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna called on Britain to stay in the EU\u2019s customs union and in its single market, which sets common rules for goods and services. The amendment was voted down but dozens of Labour lawmakers supported it in defiance of Mr. Corbyn. Three rebels in his top team were subsequently sacked, while another resigned.The domestic unease comes as Brexit talks began last week with disagreement over how to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain after the U.K.\u2019s departure and the rights of British \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe. That spat likely foreshadows bigger fights to come on thornier issues such as how much the U.K. will have to pay to settle past commitments to the EU budget and how to forge a new economic relationship.Minority governments are rare in the U.K. and have tended to be short-lived. The Conservatives\u2019 alliance with the DUP extends only to critical votes, so Mrs. May will need the backing of other parties to pass legislation in areas such as counterterrorism. She showed a slimmed down policy program to Parliament that skipped many of the Conservatives\u2019 key election pledges.Among those left out was a flagship proposal from the party\u2019s election manifesto to reform elderly care in Britain that had bombed with voters. The Conservatives also ditched plans to tweak benefit payments for retirees that were opposed by the DUP.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'May Scores Victory on Legislative Agenda.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-parliament-votes-in-favor-of-conservative-policy-program-1498756422", "news_title": "U.K. Parliament Votes in Favor of Conservative Policy Program ", "keywords": "brexit,conservatives,dup,exiting the eu,labour party,minority government,tories,tory,European Union,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A House of Representatives committee voted Thursday to repeal the post-Sept. 11 law that undergirds the U.S. war on terror, in a sign that members of Congress are preparing to reassess the scale and scope of America\u2019s military commitments for the first time in more than a decade.An amendment offered by Rep.       Barbara Lee       (D., Calif.) and passed by the House Appropriations Committee would repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, also known as an AUMF.The unexpected vote reopens a long-simmering debate on Capitol Hill about whether to revisit the legal authorizations that underpin most military operations since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The amendment, part of a bill that sets spending levels for the military, still must be approved by the full House and Senate to become law. But it marks the most significant move in years to reconsider the legal status of the war on terror. Some members have complained that the 2001 law, passed just three days after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, is too broad and has been stretched beyond its original intent.Ms. Lee was the only member of Congress to vote against the 2001 AUMF and has long been a critic of the law. She has routinely offered an amendment repealing the AUMF in committee over the years, with little success.\u201cOn Sept. 14, 2001, I did not vote for this authorization because I knew then that it would provide a blank check to wage war anywhere, any time, for any length, by any president,\u201d Ms. Lee said in a Thursday committee hearing introducing her amendment. \u201cIn the last 16 years, it has become increasingly clear that this AUMF has essentially provided the president\u2014any president since then, all of our presidents\u2014the authority to wage war in perpetuity.\u201dThis year, Ms. Lee was joined by many Republicans colleagues who said it was time for Congress to take more responsibility and oversight of America\u2019s military activities abroad.Tom Cole,        a Republican from Oklahoma who voted for the amendment, said that renewing or updating military authority is something Congress \u201chas collectively avoided taking responsibility for years.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re going to send people to war, \u201c he said, \u201cwe owe them support of the Congress of the United States.\u201dThe 2001 AUMF gave the president the authority to target terrorists and their affiliates responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. A second resolution in 2002 authorized strikes on Iraq. Together, the laws have provided the legal basis for nearly every sustained military action the U.S. has taken in recent years.Those include the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as military operations in the Philippines, Georgia, Yemen, Djibouti, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.The 2001 AUMF has also been used to justify strikes on Islamic State, a group that didn\u2019t exist when the law was passed.The Constitution gives Congress ultimate approval over military actions, but in recent years, members of Congress have sidestepped tough votes on military campaigns.Former President       Barack Obama       asked Congress twice to pass new military force authorization measures to address the changing nature of U.S. military action. He also called for the repeal of both current authorizations, even as he relied on them for military action approved by his administration.In 2013, Mr. Obama asked Congress to authorize strikes against Syria\u2019s President       Bashar al-Assad       in response to the use of chemical weapons, even though he maintained he already had the authority he needed under the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs. Mr. Obama ultimately decided not to launch the strikes.Several bipartisan proposals exist in the House and Senate to re-evaluate the scope of America\u2019s military commitments and authorize the war on Islamic State.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-looks-set-to-reassess-u-s-military-commitments-1498765667", "news_title": "Congress Looks Set to Reassess U.S. Military Commitments ", "keywords": "2001 authorization for use of military force,authorization for use of military force,barbara lee ,congress,counterterrorism,democratic lawmakers,house appropriations committee,house of representatives,law,republican lawmakers,tom cole,u.s. military operations,war on terror,House Appropriations Committee,Congress of the United States,Barbara Lee,Tom Cole,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,terrorism,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced Thursday it would send additional forces to Afghanistan, as the visiting U.S. defense secretary discussed broad outlines of Washington\u2019s approach to curb the rising tide of violence in the Central Asian nation.NATO Secretary-General       Jens Stoltenberg       said the alliance would focus its strategy on providing more training support to Afghanistan\u2019s special operation forces and its air force.Without providing specific numbers NATO said it would increase the number of special operation forces trainers in Afghanistan, focusing the alliance mission in the country on strengthening Kabul\u2019s commando forces. Acting Afghanistan defense minister Tariq Shah said his country intends to double the size of its special operation forces.Mr. Stoltenberg said the alliance\u2019s military authorities have requested a few thousand more troops. Mr. Stoltenberg said allies would increase its presence, although he put no definite numbers on the allied contributions.U.S. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       said that allies have filled about 70% of the existing requirements for forces, and he was confident that more forces would be forthcoming. Mr. Stoltenberg refused to put a timetable on the 16-year-long Afghanistan war.\u201cI don\u2019t put timelines on war, it is that simple, war is a fundamentally unpredictable phenomenon. Every effort to create a pat answer to that is probably going to fail,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say I got tired of it so I am going to come home and wonder why you get hit again.\u201dWhile he offered few clues about his new strategy or what force levels he would recommend for Afghanistan, Mr. Mattis did say that the U.S. likely reduced its presence too quickly in recent years.\u201cLooking back, it is pretty much a consensus we might have pulled our troops out too rapidly,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.Mr. Stoltenberg said ending the combat mission in 2014 was the right move, and said the current mission\u2014training and advising the Afghan forces\u2014wouldn\u2019t change.\u201cIf any thing we should have done it before, gone from a combat mission to a train, advise mission,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cWhat we are aiming at now is not to go back to a combat mission.\u201dThe number of additional troops so far committed by NATO members is well below what officials said is likely to be requested by Washington. The U.S.-led international military coalition is seeking to bolster the government of President       Ashraf Ghani       against an array of insurgencies led by the Taliban and the local affiliate of Islamic State.European officials had expected the       Trump       administration to decide on a new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan before NATO defense ministers convened in Brussels on Thursday. But the White House has yet to announce its plans, though it has given the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan at its discretion.There are about 6,600 NATO and allied troops and fewer than 9,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan. After President       Barack Obama       approved a military surge in Afghanistan in 2009, when the government\u2019s military campaign against the Taliban appeared in danger of failing, the number of U.S. troops in the country reached some 100,000.After the NATO meeting, Gen.

The two countries share a 670-kilometer (416-mile) land border with several sections of land in dispute.The tribunal was established in 2009 in an EU-brokered agreement that ended Slovenia\u2019s veto over Croatia\u2019s accession negotiations with the EU. Those talks were completed soon after and Croatia joined the bloc in 2013, becoming its 28th member.Croatia was bound to respect the tribunal\u2019s decision under the terms of its accession treaty, but Zagreb said in 2015 it wouldn\u2019t abide by the ruling after a Slovenian official had authorized contacts with the Slovenian judge on the tribunal. The incident resulted in the judge\u2019s resignation and the ouster of the official while Slovenia was fined.Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201cdoes not in any way bind Croatia and Croatia shall not implement it,\u201d Croatian Prime Minister       Andrej Plenkovic       said in a statement Thursday afternoon.Mr. Plenkovic called for bilateral talks with Slovenia to resolve the dispute. \u201cCroatia expects that Slovenia will not take any unilateral acts that would in any way change the current state of affairs along the common state border.\u201dSpeaking Thursday evening, Slovenian Prime Minister       Miro Cerar       said he hoped to work with Croatia to implement the decision within the six-month deadline set down and that his government considered the decision final and binding.Slovenian officials said later that Messrs. Cerar and Plenkovic had spoken Thursday evening and would meet on July 12th to discuss the issue.Previously, Slovenian officials had urged the EU to make a strong statement calling on all sides to abide by international law.For now at least, Brussels was staying aloof. A commission spokeswoman said officials will analyze the ruling and that it will be discussed on July 4 when EU commissioners next hold their weekly meeting.In the past, the EU has successfully leveraged its accession process to ease tensions on a continent dotted with territorial disputes, from Kosovo\u2019s independence to Turkey\u2019s occupation of northern Cyprus.\u00a0However, Brussels\u2019 authority has been increasingly challenged in recent years among its newer central and Eastern European countries.The ruling comes amid renewed worries in the bloc about nationalist tensions in the Balkans, including between Croatia and Serbia.

It is in all their interests to maximize future U.K. payments to the bloc\u2014Britain\u2019s so-called divorce bill\u2014as one of its biggest budget contributors departs.But even before the size of the bill is settled, a separate battle among the 27 is ahead, pitting governments that are net recipients from the EU budget against net payers, some of which are promising voters they won\u2019t pay a penny more.With EU officials talking about a \u20ac20-billion ($22.7-billion) budget gap in coming years because of Brexit and extra responsibilities the bloc has pledged to take on, the budget fight has the potential to reopen deep divisions within the EU at a critical moment in talks about Britain\u2019s exit.Adding an extra dose of tension to the coming budget debate are proposals by Germany and some other western European governments to use the budget to prod the bloc\u2019s poorer countries into line on issues like migration, democratic principles and the rule of law.There is simmering frustration among major net payers like Germany, Sweden and Belgium that they took in large numbers of refugees during the 2015 migration crisis, while some of the bloc\u2019s biggest recipients of EU funds\u2014like Hungary, Poland and Slovakia\u2014refused to settle asylum seekers.\u201cWe really want to make clear that solidarity is a two-way street,\u201d said one European diplomat.Were it not for Brexit, the EU budget fight would already be in full swing. The EU works on a seven-year budget cycle in which overall spending levels are fixed in advance to allow long-term planning for programs and priorities. The current multiyear budget period, which started in 2014, ends in December 2020. The EU is supposed to have a new budget deal in place by the end of 2019 at the latest.Instead of presenting its budget plans, as intended, before the end of this year the EU\u2019s Budget Commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger will do so in 2018. Negotiations are due to start next summer, with Mr. Oettinger arguing there is no point bargaining over the next budget until the financial hit created by Brexit is clearer.That impact will depend in large part on the degree to which Britain stands by its past spending pledges, including contributions to the 2019 and 2020 EU budgets. The U.K. is due to leave the bloc in March 2019.\u2018We have got a large country, a net payer which will be departing so we need to look at shifting expenditures and making cuts.\u2019The EU has fixed negotiations on Britain\u2019s divorce bill as a priority issue it wants settled in principle by October. Brussels officials say the U.K. should hold to upward of \u20ac60 billion of past spending pledges to the EU. British officials are questioning the EU\u2019s right to fix any divorce bill and suggesting an agreement on the country\u2019s financial commitments will only come when Brexit talks end, expected in October 2018.Speaking in Brussels\u00a0on Wednesday, Mr. Oettinger estimated the bloc would be \u201cdown \u20ac10 to 11 billion\u201d annually once the U.K. departs. The total gap, he said, could be twice that given additional EU pledges on future defense, economic programs and migration spending.\u201cWe have got a large country, a net payer which will be departing so we need to look at shifting expenditures and making cuts,\u201d he said.Some routes to savings are relatively clear. The percentage of the budget spent on agriculture and fisheries, currently just below 40% of the roughly \u20ac1-trillion 2014-20 budget, will likely remain on a downward path.It is also likely that so-called cohesion spending, which earmarked \u20ac63 billion to 15 poorer EU member states in the current seven-year budget, will fall after 2020, with the EU offering fewer grants to the likes of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, officials say.In\u00a0a paper issued on Wednesday about future EU budget options, the European Commission proposed other ways of filling the gap, including reviving a push for Brussels to receive more of its revenue directly from EU taxes. European officials say the ideas will be discussed but member states have long preferred the current system, where 90% of the funds come from member-state coffers. That means governments hold the bloc\u2019s purse strings and can better steer its priorities.Some EU officials suggest that starting budget discussions while Brexit negotiations are wrapping up could actually reinforce the cohesion of the EU\u2019s remaining 27 members. They argue it would keep the group focused on ensuring a large British divorce bill and keep governments focused on protecting and defending the EU. On the other hand, it could end in a terribly timed and bitter EU fight.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-faces-post-brexit-budget-battle-1498764774", "news_title": "EU Faces Post-Brexit Budget Battle ", "keywords": "brexit, british divorce bill, eu budget, european commission,European Union,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,domestic politics,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "Fund managers who own Mozambique bonds are calling for the country to repudiate government guarantees on loans made to the country by             Credit Suisse Group AG       and Russia\u2019s             VTB Bank.A recently released audit of the loans by investigations firm Kroll and a similar investigation by the Mozambican parliament show that there is no legal basis for Mozambique to honor guarantees on the loans made by the administration of former President Armando Guebuza, a group of bondholders said in a statement Thursday.Mozambique defaulted on $762 million of bonds and about $1.2 billion of loans last year, sparking outrage among bondholders, who say they should be repaid ahead of owners of the controversial loans.The bondholders\u2019 announcement marks an escalation in their previously private struggle with Mozambique and the banks that arranged the loans over how to restructure the country\u2019s debts.Two companies owned by Mozambique\u2019s military borrowed the loans backed by government guarantees in 2013 and 2014 without public disclosure or parliamentary approval. A third state-owned company issued $850 million of bonds using similar guarantees in 2013, but bondholders in March 2016 agreed to delay repayment for three years in exchange for the conversion of their debt into sovereign government bonds.Kroll found that the process for providing the guarantees was inadequate, violated Mozambican budget laws and may have involved conflicts of interest.The country\u2019s parliament said in a report last year that the guarantees breached the constitution and budget laws but voted in April to legalize the guarantees. The vote \u201cwas an administrative act that has no relevance on the government\u2019s decision whether to honor the guarantees,\u201d said Thomas Laryea, the lawyer for the bondholder group.Bondholders have \u201cmisconstrued the findings of the Parliamentary Commission and the Kroll report,\u201d a VTB spokeswoman said. \u201cThe issued guarantees remain legal and binding obligations of the state.\u201dA spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment. Mozambique\u2019s Ministry of Finance didn\u2019t return a request for comment.Mozambique hired restructuring firm             Lazard                   amid a financial crisis last fall to start restructuring talks, asking that its debts be reduced and that the bonds and loans be treated equally. Bondholders, including mutual-fund firm Franklin Templeton Investments and hedge funds Greylock Capital Management, NWI Management and Pharo Management, rejected the idea.The bondholders Thursday proposed Mozambique resume payments to them with government revenues as the economy recovers. They also called for the loans to be repaid only with proceeds from a liquidation of the three state-owned firms that issued the original debt. More than $1 billion of the money raised by the companies remains unaccounted for, according to the Kroll report.Such a restructuring would likely mean losses for holders of the loans\u2014a mix of the banks and private investors. Mr. Laryea says it would allow Mozambique to return to bond markets while addressing concerns of international donors, which have frozen loans to the country, and would \u201cdeal appropriately with the channels of illicit financing.\u201dThe group is also approaching donor countries and multilateral lenders including the International Monetary Fund for support. Representatives of the group presented their proposal to Paris Club member countries last week in Paris at the annual meeting of the informal organization of donor countries.Disclosure of the loans last year by The Wall Street Journal prompted some donors to freeze aid to Mozambique pending a thorough investigation. The IMF called the Kroll report an important step but said that \u201cinformation gaps remain, in particular on the use of the loan proceeds,\u201d in a statement last week.Mozambican watchdog group the Center for Public Integrity, or CIP, in a statement Thursday called for criminal proceedings against parties involved in the debt deals. \u201cThe Mozambican state should not pay the debts contracted by the three companies,\u201d CIP said.\u2014Matina Stevis contributed to this article.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mozambique-bondholders-push-for-loan-repudiation-1498750866", "news_title": "Mozambique Bondholders Push for Loan Repudiation", "keywords": "kroll,loan default,mozambique finances,mozambique loans,russian bank,state-owned companies,Credit Suisse,CSGN.EB,CS,VTB Bank,VTBR.MZ,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014A jury in Moscow found five men guilty in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in a trial criticized by his allies as failing to identify who ordered and organized the killing.Mr. Nemtsov, 55 years old, a former deputy prime minister and one of Russian President       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       most vocal critics, was shot dead not far from the Kremlin in 2015 in a slaying that shook Russia\u2019s opposition and political elite.The jury\u00a0on Thursday found the five men guilty of involvement in the murder, including Zaur Dadayev, a former servicemember from Chechnya who prosecutors say fired the fatal shots.Allies of Mr. Nemtsov have linked the killing to the inner circle of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, and said that they suspect a coverup.Mr. Kadyrov has denied involvement in the murder, and the Kremlin has played down its significance, suggesting it was organized to discredit Russian authorities.\u201cThe case remains unsolved,\u201d Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, wrote on her             Facebook                   page.Ilya Yashin, another prominent opposition leader, also criticized Russian authorities\u2019 handling of the case.\u201cThe matter cannot be considered closed as long as those who organized and ordered it remain free,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnly those who carried it out are behind bars.\u201dRussia\u2019s Investigative Committee, which investigates high-profile crimes, said the investigation into who ordered and organized the killing was continuing.Lawyers for the defendants criticized what they called violations and inconsistencies during the trial, with a lawyer for Mr. Dadayev saying the verdict was delivered incorrectly, Russian news agencies reported.Mr. Putin enjoys high approval ratings, and Russia\u2019s opposition remains weak and divided.

Without the financing deal in place, the creditor group acknowledged that the utility is likely to default on its obligations and enter court-supervised bankruptcy.Creditors were scrambling to keep Prepa out of default after the federal board overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s finances vetoed a proposed settlement to restructure $9 billion in utility debt. The board voted 4-3 earlier this week to kill the deal, which they said would choke off private investment capital needed to upgrade Prepa\u2019s dilapidated power generators.Bondholders had agreed to accept a 15% haircut on their claims in exchange for new debt with stronger legal protections, paid for by a special charge on ratepayers.A bankruptcy would mark a setback for Prepa\u2019s bondholders and for bond guarantors             Assured Guaranty Ltd.       and             MBIA Inc.\u2019s       National Public Finance Guarantee Corp., which insures a combined $2.2 billion in utility bonds.

A massive blackout last year, later blamed on a fire, left Prepa customers without power for three days.A federal rescue law passed by Congress last year empowers the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in bonds either through negotiated deals or with the help of the courts.The four board members who voted against the deal said that without extensive privatization, high power rates will drag down economic growth and reduce payouts on Puerto Rico\u2019s other bonds by $15 billion They want to shift Prepa from a government monopoly to a \u201cwell-regulated private utility.\u201dIt remains unclear how their decision will affect Gov.

Harrold\u2019s gripping novel set in England, the girl, who goes by Frank, cannot seem to turn around without being persecuted by an older boy and his malignant cronies. In the opening scene, the bullies catch Frank at the playground putting up posters for her lost cat. It\u2019s a hard few pages to read, not because the boys\u2019 cruelty is exceptional but because it\u2019s all too familiar.

For children ages 8-12, it\u2019s a haunting, sorrowful story tinged with magic and hope.Outdoorswoman and Canadian marine conservation officer       Terry Lynn Johnson       creates a much more straightforward atmosphere of action and hazard in \u201cOverboard! (Survivor Diaries)\u201d (HMH, 99 pages, $9.99), the first in a series of short books of catastrophe and endurance that promise to put children through an avalanche, a dust storm and a jungle misadventure.This first book plunges a boy and girl into the icy waters off Washington state when a rogue wave hits their whale-watching boat. \u201cWaves slammed my face,\u201d 11-year-old Travis narrates. \u201cWind screamed. The ocean spun around me. Cold water everywhere. Something shrieking. What was that noise?\u201d He sees 12-year-old Marina, daughter of the boat\u2019s captain, thrashing nearby. She is injured, and the two of them are alone. \u201cWe have about an hour,\u201d she warns once she has steadied herself. \u201cThen we\u2019ll probably lose consciousness.\u201dChildren ages 7-11 who love mettle-testing stories will love this one: They\u2019ll study the lurid front cover, with its towering, terrifying green wave, and pore over the \u201cU.S. Coast Guard-Approved Cold-Water Survival Tips\u201d at the end.As with all created art, the illustrations in children\u2019s books tend to bear the marks of their era. Sometimes there is a blatant time stamp: think of the moustaches, poofy hair and wide lapels of 1970s picture-book dads.Often, though, the effect is subtle and fugitive. It seems obvious that William Papas\u2019s picture book \u201cTasso\u201d (Pikku Vintage, 32 pages, $16.99) has returned from the 1960s. But how? Is it the loose lines of black ink splashed with bright secondary colors? The enormous eyes of the two children, Tasso and Athena, who live with their father, a poor fisherman, in a seaside Greek village? Whatever it is, the pictures all but shout \u201cthe 1960s!\u201d And indeed, Papas (1927-2000) first published this tale of modernity\u2019s intrusions in 1966.To the joy of locals and tourists, Tasso loves to play his guitar-like bouzouki in the Trocadero caf\u00e9 while his sister waits tables. No musician can go without a rest, though, and when customers demand nonstop entertainment, the proprietor brings in a flashing, blaring machine, the Rock-a-Rola. Welcome at first, the relentless music eventually ruins everything: \u201cNobody went to the Trocadero, nobody sang or danced, the donkeys became impossible and the goats just sat.\u201d A bold decision by the village restores Hellenic harmony at last in this tale for children ages 3-8.The delicate artwork in       Jacqueline Ayer\u2019s       picture book \u201cThe Paper-Flower Tree\u201d (Enchanted Lion, 32 pages, $16.95) shares nothing with \u201cTasso\u201d except an indefinable sense of its having originated in the same era. It so happens that this story of a young Thai villager named Miss Moon, who trusts that a tree with paper blooms will grow from a little bead, first appeared in 1962.True to its time, the story is wordier than picture books tend now to be, which is all to the good: The descriptions of Miss Moon\u2019s pastoral life, of the planting and harvesting of rice, of her refusal to believe the scoffers, give us time to savor the pictures (see above). Blocks of color, and fine lines alternating with crosshatching and patches of rough pencil, give a mystical feeling to this lovely tale from Southeast Asia.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-childrens-books-1498763206", "news_title": "The Best Children\u2019s Books", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014France\u2019s budget auditor Thursday said the government deficit this year will significantly exceed targets negotiated with the European Union, presenting President       Emmanuel Macron       with a major economic test just weeks into his term in office.The French Court of Auditors said the budget deficit is on track to hit 3.2% of gross domestic product in 2017, compared with a target of 2.8% of GDP set by the government of Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessor,       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.       The 2.8% target was part of an agreement reached between France and the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, to bring France\u2019s long-swollen deficit in line with EU rules, which call for government budget gaps under 3% of GDP.Now, Mr. Macron is likely to face pressure from commission officials in Brussels and budget hawks in the German government to pass a new package of spending cuts and tax hikes. Those austerity measures threaten to slow the French economy just as growth is starting to pick up.The court\u2019s report was sharply critical of last year\u2019s budget and the government\u2019s bookkeeping. Budget provisions for the next three years \u201ccontain numerous drafting biases that affect its accuracy and appear unlikely to be respected,\u201d the court said.Responding to the court, Mr. Macron\u2019s government denounced Mr. Hollande\u2019s budget.\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Prime Minister\u00a0      Edouard Philippe.       \u201cIt\u2019s as if the government had made a budget and forgotten to include the justice ministry.\u201dDrafting changes to meet the EU targets could test Mr. Macron\u2019s ability to forge consensus within his ideologically diverse government. Mr. Philippe and the finance minister,       Bruno Le Maire,        come from France\u2019s conservative Les Republicains party, who have favored spending cuts to address France\u2019s budget woes.Mr. Macron himself, however, is a former economy minister under the Socialist Mr. Hollande who has at times criticized austerity mandates pushed by officials in Brussels.France\u2019s budget deficit has exceeded 3% since it ballooned in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. That has prompted periodic clashes with the commission, which is charged with enforcing the EU\u2019s budget rules and has long urged the French government to cut spending.France has received several extensions on deadlines to bring its deficit under 3%. In 2015, the commission agreed to allow Paris until 2017 to hit the 3% threshold, which is enshrined in the EU treaty.Last year, France and Spain were the only members of the 28-nation EU whose deficits exceeded 3%.Beyond this year, Paris will face mounting pressure to meet its deficit targets. France\u2019s budget plan submitted to the commission proposes to cut the government\u2019s deficit to 2.3% of GDP in 2018, 1.6% in 2019 and 1.3% in 2020.Hitting those targets will require deficit cuts \u201cwithout precedent\u201d for France, the court said.Write to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-deficit-forecasts-pose-challenge-for-emmanuel-macron-1498763161", "news_title": "French Deficit Forecasts Pose Challenge for Emmanuel Macron", "keywords": "austerity,eu,france,france budget,france deficit,france economy,french budget,gdp,French Court of Auditors,European Union,German government,Emmanuel Macron,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The story of how Charlotte       Bront\u00eb,        the shy and (in her own words) \u201cplain and small\u201d clergyman\u2019s daughter from Haworth in Yorkshire, came to write a proto-feminist romance that became one of the 19th century\u2019s best sellers, is as gripping as any in her novels. When \u201cJane Eyre\u201d appeared in 1847, nothing quite like it had been published in English before. Its tale of a young orphan who survives every kind of deprivation to achieve independence and a passionate marriage to the man of her choice so impressed its first reader\u2014the literary adviser at publisher Smith, Elder & Co.\u2014that he stayed up till dawn finishing it. The novel had it all: moral seriousness, sex, an irresistible gothic intensity. But who was the author? The title page called it \u201cAn Autobiography, edited by Currer Bell.\u201d Was the androgynous-sounding Bell male or female? And in what sense was it autobiography?The mystery of Bell\u2019s identity caused a literary stir before Bront\u00eb reluctantly unmasked herself nine months later. What the public did not know, until       Elizabeth Gaskell       brought out the first, posthumous biography of Charlotte in 1857, was that there were strong affinities between the life of the retiring author and her work. In his astute study \u201cThe Secret History of Jane Eyre,\u201d       John Pfordresher       argues the uncanny emotional authority of the novel comes in part from its refashioning of experiences that Bront\u00eb had found traumatic, and that her fiction processes as art.By John PfordresherNorton, 254 pages, $26.95In her lifetime Bront\u00eb was careful to distance herself from her succ\u00e8s de scandale, insisting her heroine was not a self-portrait (she was so angry with       Thackeray       for introducing her as \u201cJane Eyre\u201d at a London lecture that she stormed his house the next day to give him a piece of her mind). Yet Charlotte, like Jane, was a governess, and like her, she was physically little or \u201cstunted\u201d\u2014the legacy, she claimed, of a spell between the ages of 8 and 9 at a boarding school that systematically starved its pupils. The school appears in \u201cJane Eyre\u201d as Lowood: The founder,       William Carus Wilson,        is recast as the sadistic \u201cblack pillar,\u201d Mr. Brocklehurst; Charlotte\u2019s adored elder sister Maria, who died as a result of this maltreatment, as Jane\u2019s martyred friend Helen Burns. By writing \u201cJane Eyre\u201d the novelist got the last word.Then there is the problematic figure of Mr. Rochester, the Byronic married man with whom Jane falls in love, not knowing he has a mad wife in the attic. Mr. Pfordresher is excellent both on Rochester\u2019s entitlement\u2014he tries to trick Jane into bigamy, after all\u2014and those aspects of his character drawn from the three men Charlotte admired most: her irascible father, Patrick, her hedonistic brother, Branwell (who was fired after having an affair with his employer\u2019s wife while working as tutor to a Yorkshire family) and the imperious \u201cMaster\u201d who taught her French at the Belgian pensionnat she attended in 1842 and 1843, Constantin Heger.Mr. Pfordresher argues that in her father, Charlotte \u201chad observed Rochester\u2019s physical vigor, determined will, passionate temper, and defiant courage.\u201d Controlling and subject to bursts of what Gaskell termed \u201cvolcanic wrath\u201d (like Rochester, who is quick to anger), the Rev. Bront\u00eb was in the habit of carrying a loaded pistol, which he fired from his bedroom window every morning. When he grew older and began to suffer from cataracts, Charlotte nursed him, as Jane does Rochester: It was while tending Patrick after an operation, which required her to sit in a darkened room for hours, that Bront\u00eb began to write \u201cJane Eyre.\u201d He was her first model of a dominant man, whose concerns always took center stage.Just as complex was Charlotte\u2019s relationship with Branwell, who started out, as Mr. Pfordresher puts it, as \u201cher mental equal\u201d and constant companion but became, through the abuse of alcohol and opium, the \u201cself-destroying family humiliation.\u201d Mr. Pfordresher is surely right in thinking that Jane Eyre\u2019s teasing exchanges with Rochester\u2014who shares Branwell\u2019s sensual weakness\u2014are based on Charlotte\u2019s \u201cearly adolescent love for\u201d and habit of sparring with her childhood rival.But the most obvious real-life source for Rochester is Heger. For in 1913, half a century after Gaskell\u2019s biography was published, letters from Bront\u00eb to her former professor, written once she\u2019d returned to Haworth, emerged. They showed that Charlotte had been unrequitedly in love with this \u201cferocious\u201d man (again, the adjective is her own), who corrected her mistakes mercilessly, encouraged her writing as no one ever had, and above all, she felt, understood her, just as the saturnine Rochester sees straight into the heart of Jane. Alas, Reader, she didn\u2019t marry him: Heger (like Rochester) already had a wife.Mr. Pfordresher suggests Rochester is all of these male figures rolled into one, but rehabilitated and\u2014after the death of Bertha Rochester during a fire\u2014rendered miraculously available: In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d Bront\u00eb\u2019s erotic frustrations are redeemed. In life, things weren\u2019t quite so neat: Alarmed by the volcano he\u2019d stirred up, Heger stopped replying to his former pupil\u2019s desperate pleas, Branwell killed himself with drink and drugs, and Charlotte settled for her father\u2019s worthy but unglamorous assistant.Anyone new to \u201cJane Eyre\u201d will find this a wildly readable introduction to novel and author, even though none of the revelations in it are new. Biographers from       Winifred G\u00e9rin       in the 1960s to now have dealt with what she called Gaskell\u2019s efforts at \u201cwhitewashing Charlotte.\u201d       Lyndall Gordon       and       Rebecca Fraser       stressed Bront\u00eb\u2019s struggle to live authentically despite the limitations imposed on her sex;       Juliet Barker       went further and gave us a self-willed Charlotte who doggedly pursued her ambitions to write and did not scruple to use her ailing father as an excuse.Mr. Pfordresher\u2019s originality lies in the way he uses links between       Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s       life and her major work to probe the wider question of literary authenticity. Gaskell recalls that Bront\u00eb was acutely conscious, while writing \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d that she was drawing on actual emotion to animate fictional scenes. It is undoubtedly this lived dimension that lends the novel its peculiarly \u201creal\u201d quality\u2014or what Bront\u00eb called the effect of \u201cNature and Truth.\u201d If Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d is autobiographical, it is so in the sense that it gives, as Mr. Pfordresher writes, equal weight to \u201cthe truth of her experience and the emotionally dominant claims of her imagination.\u201d Charlotte Bront\u00eb \u201cis\u201d Jane Eyre in the same way that       Sylvia Plath       \u201cis\u201d Esther Greenwood in \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d or       James Joyce       \u201cis\u201d Stephen Dedalus in \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\u201d They are; and of course they aren\u2019t.\u2014Ms. Lowry is the author of \u201cThe Bellini Madonna.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loving-mr-rochester-1498763122", "news_title": "Loving Mr. Rochester", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,recommended books,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Winston Churchill is reputed to have said that the Queen Mary and the       Queen Elizabeth,        the world\u2019s largest ocean liners in the 1930s and 1940s, had shortened World War II by a year because of the vast number of servicemen they carried across the Atlantic\u2014and at such speed that German U-boats were unable to fire on them with any success. Many historians have highlighted the contribution of merchant shipping generally in that war. Less attention has focused on the similar role it played in World War I.In \u201cThe Great Rescue,\u201d       Peter Hernon,        the author of several works of history and a former newspaper reporter, helps to redress this imbalance with his enthralling account of the USS Leviathan, an ocean liner that carried more than 10,000 doughboys at a time to fight in France in 1917-18. Although the Leviathan had been one of the fastest liners crossing the Atlantic before the war, its impressive speed did not give it invulnerability. Some of the most exciting passages of \u201cThe Great Rescue\u201d recount the vigilance and countermeasures of the Leviathan\u2019s crew when faced with submarines out to sink it and drown its human cargo.Ironically, the Leviathan\u2019s prewar crossings had been as the SS Vaterland, a German-flagged liner. As Mr. Hernon writes, \u201cthe world had never seen a luxury ship built on the scale of the Vaterland.\u201d It was magnificently decorated and appointed in first class, with gilt latticework and a bronze statue of       Marie Antoinette.       It offered an \u00e0 la carte Ritz-Carlton restaurant for passengers who disdained the lavish menus in the dining saloon. Even the steerage passengers, whose $29.50 tickets were \u201ca major money maker for the owners,\u201d had \u201cattentive waiters in uniform,\u201d Mr. Hernon says. For immigrant passengers seeking a new life in the New World, \u201csteerage must have seemed heaven sent.\u201dBy Peter HernonHarper, 350 pages, $27.99The Vaterland had only completed the first half of its fourth round-trip voyage when it arrived in New York Harbor on July 30, 1914. The planned turnaround was overtaken by events: \u201cA cable from Germany ordered the ship to remain in New York,\u201d Mr. Hernon writes, \u201cwarning that French and British warships were poised offshore to seize her if she tried to sail.\u201dAs it happens, many other German passenger ships were moored in U.S. ports at the time, including other German ocean liners. The imposed hiatus meant that the liners remained safely out of danger for the nearly three years of American neutrality\u2014and out of the way of official concern.All that changed when the United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Indeed, an American destroyer, Mr. Hernon reports, was sent \u201cto make sure the captains of the interned superliner and eight other German passenger ships tied up at the Hoboken piers wouldn\u2019t be tempted to make a run for open water.\u201dThe day before the declaration of war, the U.S. had already seized the Vaterland, and so began its transformation into the Leviathan. The ship, Mr. Hernon reports, was stripped of its fine woodwork; its expensive wines were carted away; its chairs thrown overboard. Everything was retrofitted for wartime use. It was a long process, complicated by a lack of blueprints and the need for vigilance against German saboteurs.Mr. Hernon describes what passage was like for the thousands of servicemen packed into the no longer luxurious ship, who found themselves in \u201cfootball-field-size spaces . . . crammed with \u2018standees,\u2019 iron-frame bunks with canvas bottoms, stacked four high.\u201d The ship\u2019s celebrated wartime passenger names ranged from Gen.       John J. Pershing,        soon to lead the American Expeditionary Force, to a \u201cnewly minted sailor named       Humphrey DeForest Bogart,       \u201d nearly four decades later to be, in \u201cThe African Queen,\u201d the Hollywood skipper of a very different kind of World War I vessel.In September 1918, the Leviathan ferried Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt back from a visit to the European theater, where he had contracted flu in the epidemic then sweeping the world. \u201cIt would be weeks before he recovered his strength,\u201d writes Mr. Hernon, \u201cand by then his marriage would be in shambles.\u201d His wife, Eleanor, had discovered in her husband\u2019s baggage a stack of love letters written to him by       Lucy Mercer,        her social secretary. \u201cIt was a life-altering moment,\u201d Mr. Hernon writes, \u201cas she realized her husband had been having an affair.\u201dMr. Hernon offers brief accounts of the postwar lives of some of the notable figures who traveled on the Leviathan\u2014a young war correspondent named       Damon Runyon       went on, of course, to write the stories collected as \u201cGuys and Dolls.\u201d We also get a moving account of the Leviathan\u2019s postwar life. Its \u201cthird and final act\u201d began in 1923, Mr. Hernon says, when it set sail for France \u201cas America\u2019s largest and fastest luxury liner.\u201dIt was again an opulent vessel, launching \u201cjust in time to catch a wave\u201d: the amusements of the Roaring Twenties. But the Leviathan could not offer liquor during Prohibition, unlike its British and French competitors, and \u201cfew crossings made money,\u201d Mr. Hernon notes, despite carrying yet more high-profile passengers, like the (teetotal)       Queen Marie       of Romania.The Leviathan was sold for a pittance in 1938 and broken up for scrap\u2014just a couple of years before it would undoubtedly have been ready, once again, to render service as a troop ship transporting soldiers across the Atlantic for yet another war.\u2014Mr. Rubin is a writer in Pasadena, Calif.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/over-there-by-ocean-liner-1498762945", "news_title": "\u2018Over There\u2019 by Ocean Liner", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The three great symbols of American inventiveness in the decades after the Civil War\u2014the light bulb, the elevator and the Brooklyn Bridge\u2014were dependent on wire.       Thomas Edison\u2019s       incandescent bulb is the most ubiquitous example, the wire being tungsten filament. But modern American cities would have been impossible without       Elisha Otis\u2019s       elevator and the wire cables that raised and lowered it, while anyone with a nodding acquaintance of the New York skyline will be familiar with the looping wire suspensions of the majestic Brooklyn Bridge.In the late 19th century, the wire for elevators and suspension bridges was usually the handiwork of       John Roebling       & Sons in Trenton, N.J. In the case of the Brooklyn Bridge, the firm did more than supply the wire: It designed the bridge itself. And yet the Roeblings\u2014John and his son Washington\u2014are now as invisible to Americans as Edison and Otis are conspicuous. With \u201cChief Engineer,\u201d       Erica Wagner       seeks to rescue the Roeblings from oblivion.A former literary editor for the Times of London and a biographer of the poets       Sylvia Plath       and       Ted Hughes,        Ms. Wagner is not perhaps the most obvious candidate for this task, but she is Manhattan-born, and in her teens, she tells us, she had one of those epiphanies that the Brooklyn Bridge inspires. She wrapped her fingers \u201caround one of the vertical suspender cables\u201d and felt the vibration convey a sense of the bridge as \u201ca living thing.\u201d Curiosity took her to       David McCullough\u2019s       \u201cThe Great Bridge,\u201d his marvelous 1972 account of its construction, and from there, eventually, into libraries and archives until the bridge became for her \u201csymbolic of the desire for connection.\u201dAlthough Ms. Wagner\u2019s subject is officially the younger Roebling, the book is really two biographies in one, if only because Washington Roebling could never disentangle himself from his father, either psychologically or in the public mind.John Augustus Roebling was born in 1806 in central Germany; at age 19, he went to study at the Berlin Building Academy and soon began work for the Prussian government. While traveling, he fell in love, as only an engineer can, with the suspension bridge over the Regnitz River in Bavaria. It displayed a design that, thanks to advances in technology, was then emerging: loops of iron chain, suspended from towers, bearing the weight of the roadway beneath. Roebling soon began work on his own designs for suspension bridges but had little prospect of persuading the Prussian bureaucracy to adopt them, and in 1831 he emigrated to the United States.It was in the U.S. that Roebling encountered a new variation on the suspension bridge, one that substituted iron-wire cable for chain links. The use of iron wire reminded him of the cables he had seen used in the Harz Mountains to run coal cars. The cables had been produced by twisting lengths of wrought-iron wire around one another to make strands, as Ms. Wagner explains, with the strands in turn \u201ctwisted together to make a rope.\u201dRoebling did not have the chance to put the idea to work until 1845, when he was hired to rebuild the Monongahela Bridge at Pittsburgh, an eight-span bridge that was eventually hung from wire rope twisted on-site. It was a triumph, free from the swaying and the vibrations that had afflicted earlier suspension constructions, and the wire rope made John Roebling famous. In 1849, he opened a factory in Trenton, which did $40,000 in business in its first year (more than $1 million in today\u2019s dollars).Such success did not, however, earn him respite from his demons. Roebling was a household tyrant who cowed and beat his long-suffering wife, Johanna, and his five sons and daughter, whose \u201cingenuities were bent to one purpose, to keep out of his sight,\u201d Ms. Wagner writes. The wonder is that any of them grew into anything like psychological maturity. But they did, especially the oldest son, Washington.It never seems to have entered Washington Roebling\u2019s head that he should be anything but an engineer. The education he got at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., was exactly the rigorous training that his father prized, and his graduation thesis was written, predictably, on the construction of a suspension aqueduct.The outbreak of the Civil War interrupted Washington Roebling\u2019s plans for bridges and aqueducts. After the firing on Fort Sumter, his father had demanded: \u201cYou clear out this minute!\u201d His family\u2019s reputation allowed him, in time, to secure a staff position in the Army of the Potomac. On one memorable occasion, he carried orders in the midst of the Battle of Chancellorsville. As an aide to       Gouverneur K. Warren,        the Army of the Potomac\u2019s chief engineer, Roebling helped keep Little Round Top out of the hands of the Confederates at Gettysburg. He left the Army in January 1865 and went back to work for his father, completing the great Covington-Cincinnati suspension bridge over the Ohio River.Even as he did so, New York was beckoning to the Roeblings. As early as 1857, John Roebling had sketched out a plan for a vast suspension bridge to link Manhattan and Brooklyn; a decade later, the New York Bridge Co. hired him to design and build it. Washington Roebling was by then his father\u2019s right hand, and in 1869, when the elder Roebling died suddenly after a freak accident at a Brooklyn ferry slip, the mantle of chief engineer fell onto Washington\u2019s shoulders.Although the preliminary designs for the two great towers of the Brooklyn Bridge were drawn by John Roebling, it was Washington Roebling who created the water-tight, compressed-air caissons that formed their river-bed foundations. It was Washington Roebling who drafted the 44-page memorandum describing the manufacture of the suspension cables\u2014four enormous cables able to bear 10,730 tons. It was he who kept politicians from diverting or corrupting the project. In May 1883, when the bridge was ready for its opening, the first vehicle to cross it was a carriage driven by Washington Roebling\u2019s wife, Emily.Washington Roebling never set foot on the bridge while it was being built. While supervising the early underwater digging, he was injured by uncontrolled shifts in air compression. So between 1873 and the opening of the bridge he supervised the construction from his home in Brooklyn. He would gradually recover\u2014in fact, he would live to the ripe old age of 89\u2014but he would never build another bridge. Or need to, since the assets of John Roebling & Sons reached over $10 million by 1899. The firm supplied the wire rope for the Panama Canal, the Wright Brothers\u2019 Flyer and       Lindbergh\u2019s       Spirit of St. Louis, and the copper wire that carried electricity to Edison\u2019s bulbs.Ms. Wagner\u2019s writing is graceful, even evocative, conveying a mellow admiration of Washington Roebling that suits the man. And as much as she esteems       Emily Roebling       as a proto-feminist, Ms. Wagner rebuffs the notion that Emily somehow became the \u201creal\u201d engineer of the bridge during her husband\u2019s prostration.Ms. Wagner\u2019s research is limited almost entirely to the personal papers and memoirs of the Roeblings. It might have been useful to learn more about how Washington Roebling\u2019s wartime service connected to his postwar influence as a bridge builder. And learning how the Brooklyn Bridge compared with other bridge-building projects of the era would have situated it in the larger picture of American technological entrepreneurship. But such missing elements detract little from what is a welcome tribute to the persistence, precision and humanity of Washington Roebling and a love-song for the mighty New York bridge he built with the help of his pioneering, if irascible, father.\u2014Mr. Guelzo is the author of \u201cGettysburg: The Last Invasion.\u201dAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'East River Love Song.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 15:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-brooklyn-bridge-1498762883", "news_title": "Behind the Brooklyn Bridge", "keywords": "bookcar0701,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "President Trump has made some nasty comments about two people who make a living insulting him. On Thursday morning Mr. Trump decided for some reason to tweet about MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. The President called them \u201clow I.Q. Crazy Mika\u201d and \u201cPsycho Joe\u201d and wrote that they came to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida \u201c3 nights in a row around New Year\u2019s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s words are beneath the dignity of his office, whether or not the targets of his ire accept that he is the legitimate holder of that office. The President\u2019s latest social-media salvos raise again the question of how the President should respond to the media outlets that vehemently oppose him.Presidents don\u2019t give up their First Amendment rights when they take the oath of office. One might long for the self-restraint and respectful manner of a       Ronald Reagan,        but most of the time we have to settle for less.       Barack Obama       frequently criticized Fox News and on at least one occasion called it \u201cdestructive\u201d to America\u2019s economic future. Readers can ponder whether they would rather the President call them crazy victims of botched surgeries or threats to the country. Ideally presidents would have enough respect for the office and for themselves to set a higher standard.As far as this column can recall, Mr. Obama never launched the kind of ad hominem attack that Mr. Trump directed at the MSNBC couple, and as with so many Trump tweets, it\u2019s not clear why our commander-in-chief felt moved to publicly denigrate fellow celebrities. But it could have something to do with the content of their program.On Wednesday morning\u2019s show, for example, Mr. Scarborough called the President \u201cthe greatest liar that\u2019s ever sat in the White House.\u201d Judging from a cursory search of online stories about the daily MSNBC program, calling the President a liar appears to be a staple of its morning commentary. And of course, like all MSNBC shows, there is the usual evidence-free questioning of whether Mr. Trump betrayed his country to get elected and aims to rule as an authoritarian.Ms. Brzezinski has referred to the Trump Administration as a \u201cfake presidency\u201d and has suggested that the President is \u201cnot well\u201d and perhaps even \u201cmentally ill,\u201d according to a report earlier this month in The Hill.Ms. Brzezinski and Mr. Scarborough do not limit their ad hominem attacks to Mr. Trump. The Poynter Institute describes a February edition of the program in which Mr. Scarborough called Trump aide Kellyanne Conway a liar. Ms. Brzezinski for her part claimed that media interviews are Ms. Conway\u2019s \u201c\u2019chance to one-up and suck-up\u2019 (to Trump).\u201dYour humble correspondent would advise the President to get even by enacting legislation that offends the values of MSNBC, rather than getting mad and responding as he did this morning. American parents don\u2019t need MSNBC hosts to be model citizens. But having to explain to children why the President isn\u2019t treating his opponents with respect presents a challenge.The President might also look for more opportunities to tweak his media adversaries, but with a smile. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the official White House transcript of Mr. Trump speaking at a Tuesday meeting with Republican senators, where he seems to have maintained his sense of humor:As for this morning\u2019s tweets, the American people deserve better from our President. It\u2019s a little tougher to argue that MSNBC in particular deserves better, but wouldn\u2019t it be a nice example to have our President treating even his most unfair critics with kindness?Bottom Stories of the DayIf We Allow CNN to Be Criticized, Then the Terrorists Win  \u201cCNN Anchor: Trump Putting Journalists In Danger; \u2018Declaration Of War On Media\u2019 Has \u2018Emboldened\u2019 War Zones,\u201d RealClearPolitics, June 28The New Low-Carb Diet  \u201cWhy It\u2019s Hilariously Hypocritical For Food And Wine To Lecture About The BLT\u2019s Carbon Footprint,\u201d The Federalist, June 28But Americans Should Be Embarrassed by Trump  \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s 10-year association with group which denies the Holocaust,\u201d The Telegraph, May 20News of the Tautological: Independence Day Edition  \u201cFireworks sold in Wisconsin stores recalled due to burn hazard,\u201d WTMJ, June 28If Only There Were Some Mechanism by Which Labor Supply and Demand Could Meet  \u201cWhat\u2019s the right minimum wage?

Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       has implored lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling, with no conditions attached, before they leave for a five-week summer recess July 28.Mr. Mnuchin said earlier this month Treasury could continue to pay the government\u2019s bills through the beginning of September, but declined to give a more specific date for when Treasury expects to exhaust its so-called extraordinary measures.\u201cI urge, given the importance of this, that we send a message to the rest of the world and the markets that we take our credit very seriously,\u201d he said.Analysts have said the government could run out of room to meet its obligations\u2014including payments on its debt, Social Security and veterans benefits, for example\u2014sometime in the fall, though estimates have ranged from early September to November.CBO estimated in March that Treasury would run out of cash sometime in the fall, but said the range of dates has narrowed as the budget outlook for this year has become clearer.But it cautioned that \u201cthe timing and magnitude of revenues and outlays over the next few months could vary noticeably from CBO\u2019s projections,\u201d and Treasury could run out of cash earlier. Failing to increase the debt limit \u201cwould ultimately lead to delays of payments for government programs and activities, a default on the government\u2019s debt obligations, or both.\u201dThe extraordinary measures Treasury has taken so far include suspending the issuance of new state and local government securities and savings bonds, and limiting investments in certain federal employee pension plans. It still has several other measures available, CBO said.In a separate report issued Thursday, CBO said weaker tax collections this year have led it to increase the projected budget shortfall for 2017.CBO now expects the deficit to rise to $693 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, or 3.6% of gross domestic product, from $587 billion, or 3.2%, in 2016. That was higher than estimates released in January, when CBO projected the deficit would decline in 2017 to $559 billion, or 2.9% of GDP.CBO said \u201csurprisingly weak tax collections\u201d led it to lower its revenue projections for this year by $89 billion since January. At the same time, outlays are expected to rise by $45 billion, driven almost entirely by higher costs of government student-loan programs.Overall, the budget deficit is expected to fall next year before rising steadily over the next decade, primarily due to higher interest costs, the result of faster rate increases from the Federal Reserve. CBO estimates the budget shortfall would hit 5.2% of GDP by 2027, while total debt held by the public is projected to total 91% of GDP.CBO\u2019s projection of the cumulative deficit over the next decade increased about 7% from its January forecast, primarily because it assumes that increases in funding for war-related activities in Afghanistan\u2014included in a short-term spending bill Congress passed in April\u2014will continue in the future.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 14:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-analysis-shows-government-could-run-out-of-cash-in-early-to-mid-october-1498759456", "news_title": "New Analysis Shows Government Could Run Out of Cash in Early to Mid-October", "keywords": " budget deficit, congress, debt ceiling,debt limit, federal budget,Congressional Budget Office,U.S. Treasury Department,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       will meet with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       at next week\u2019s G-20 summit, senior administration officials confirmed Thursday.Mr. Trump also plans to meet with a number of NATO allies and is set to hold one-on-one discussions with German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        British Prime Minister       Theresa May,        Chinese President       Xi Jinping,        Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       and Mexican President Enrique Pena-Nieto among others, according to national security adviser H.R.

The \u201cminded to\u201d language is used by the government to signal its intentions, but isn\u2019t binding.Speaking in Parliament, Ms. Bradley said she would make a final decision on whether to refer the deal after hearing representations from the parties involved over the next 10 days. Fox and Sky have until July 14 to respond.The government\u2019s move followed the release Thursday of two reports by Ofcom, Britain\u2019s media regulator, on the proposed deal. Ofcom said it has concluded that allowing Fox to take full control of Sky risked giving too much control of the U.K. media landscape to the Murdoch family.In one report, Ofcom said \u201cthe transaction raises public interest concerns as a result of the risk of increased influence by members of the Murdoch Family Trust over the U.K. news agenda and the political process, with its unique presence on radio, television, in print and online.\u201dOfcom said proposals by Fox to safeguard the editorial independence of Sky\u2019s news channel helped mitigate its concerns, but Ms. Bradley said she didn\u2019t think those undertakings went far enough.Fox said in a statement that it was disappointed that Ms. Bradley reached that decision, and that it would continue to work constructively with the U.K. authorities. It said it expects the transaction to be completed by June 2018. Sky said it would continue to engage with the process.Mr. Murdoch and his family are a major shareholder in both Fox and             News Corp,       which owns a number of British newspapers, including the Sun tabloid and the Times of London. News Corp also owns The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Murdoch, who helped create Sky in 1990, has long sought full control of the broadcaster. He abandoned a previous attempt to buy out Sky in 2011 after a phone-hacking scandal at one of his U.K. papers\u2014now closed\u2014triggered widespread political and public outrage.Full ownership of Sky would further diversify Fox\u2019s revenue, making it less reliant on its North American business and giving it a cash stream from Sky subscribers.A second test that Ofcom posed was whether Fox would be a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of Sky. The media watchdog has wide latitude to define what \u201cfit and proper\u201d means, and it examined this year\u2019s sexual-harassment scandal at Fox News, interviewing complainants against the channel. A group of British politicians wrote to the media watchdog to urge regulators to block the deal, citing among their concerns the harassment allegations.Ofcom said Thursday that it considered allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News \u201cextremely serious and disturbing,\u201d but said there was no clear evidence that senior executives at Fox were aware of misconduct before the issue was escalated to them in July 2016, after which action was taken. Fox has said it is cooperating with U.S. government probes about the sexual-harassment claims.\u201cWe have concluded that the overall evidence available to date does not provide a reasonable basis for Ofcom to conclude that, if Sky were 100% owned and controlled by Fox, it would not be a fit and proper holder of broadcast licenses,\u201d the regulator said.A fresh antitrust probe could add months to the merger process. The proposed deal had already gone through a regulatory gantlet, including passing muster with European Union regulators, before the U.K. government called in Ofcom.If British competition authorities eventually approve the proposal, Fox must still win over the 75% of minority shareholders, excluding Fox\u2019s stake, to cement the deal. Some investors argued that the Fox bid\u2019s 36% premium wasn\u2019t enough. Shares of Sky have been trading under Fox\u2019s offer price, suggesting still-significant investor skepticism about a deal.Sky shares rose more than 3% after the decision Thursday, to close in London at \u00a39.88, still below the \u00a310.75 offer from Fox. One analyst who specializes in analyzing takeovers said the move reflects relief among investors that the deal at least cleared the fit-and-proper test that some believed would be more onerous to overcome than antitrust issues.With the further review delaying the closing of the deal beyond the end of the year, Sky shareholders will be entitled to a special dividend of 10 pence a share. The cost to Fox will be about $136 million because of its 39% stake in Sky.When Mr. Murdoch helped create Sky, with his British satellite-TV business merging with a U.K. rival, it started beaming news, sports and entertainment programming to homes via satellite before branching out to offer cable-TV and mobile-phone services, too. It expanded in Europe, creating a European pay-TV giant with 22 million customers in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.Sky owns both nationwide telecommunications services\u2014selling cable, internet and mobile packages\u2014and the rights to its news, sports and entertainment programs. As such, there is no U.S. equivalent to Sky, though             AT&T Inc.       could become one if regulators approve its proposal to buy media giantTime Warner Inc.Mr. Murdoch first tried to buy Sky in 2010 via News Corp, which was then a media conglomerate that included both Fox and its newspaper businesses. In 2011, allegations surfaced that one of those publications, the News of the World, had hacked into the phones of politicians, celebrities and, most notably, murdered teenager       Milly Dowler.Mr. Murdoch apologized and closed the News of the World. In July 2011, News Corp dropped its Sky bid. In 2013, News Corp split into two companies: Fox, the entertainment arm, and News Corp, which included the newspaper and publishing businesses.\u2014Ben Dummett and Joe Flint contributed to this article.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 14:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxs-bid-for-sky-set-for-more-u-k-scrutiny-1498735307", "news_title": "Fox\u2019s Bid for Sky Set for More U.K. Scrutiny", "keywords": " 21st century fox, fox, ofcom, rupert murdoch,sky, sky fox, sky ofcom,Sky,UK:SKY,21st Century Fox Cl A,FOXA,SKY.LN,21st Century Fox,FOX,Ofcom,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,printing,publishing,newspaper publishing,television,film production,cinema film production,broadcasting,television broadcasting,satellite broadcasting,media,entertainment,newspaper,magazine printing,satellite television"}, {"content": "When pianist Geri Allen died on Tuesday, at age 60, of complications from cancer, the jazz world lost a soft-spoken yet commanding master\u2014one whose career was still in ascent, whose sustained brilliance and conjoined commitments to scholarship and free-thinking innovation helped shape a new aesthetic.When the story of jazz since the 1980s is written, Ms. Allen will show up prominently in nearly every chapter. She contributed memorably to the catalogs of several towering greats, including alto saxophonist       Ornette Coleman       and singer       Betty Carter.       She worked on equal footing with nearly every standard-bearing bassist-drummer pair (her 1994 album, \u201cTwenty One,\u201d is among the last sessions pairing drummer       Tony Williams       with bassist       Ron Carter      ).Through nearly two-dozen recordings under her own name and more than 100 as a co-leader or band member, the profile Ms. Allen established isn\u2019t well conveyed by catchphrases for styles or trends. Her music was, by turns and often within a single tune, at once classic and subversive. Rather than adhere to any jazz convention or school, she absorbed them all, sounding complete.Drummer       Andrew Cyrille,        who played on \u201cThe Printmakers,\u201d Ms. Allen\u2019s 1984 debut as a leader, and whose Trio 3 collective recorded with her 25 years later, once told me in an interview: \u201cYou could call Geri a thinker and a creator, and that\u2019s true. But she\u2019s also this powerhouse synthesizer of ideas. We feed off that.\u201dGeri Antoinette Allen was born on June 12, 1957, in Pontiac, Mich., and raised in Detroit during a time of great musical ferment. She took up the piano at age 7. Her earliest jazz instruction came from trumpeter       Marcus Belgrave,        at Cass Technical High School, a magnet school with a breeding-ground reputation.\u201cGeri was very timid,\u201d Mr. Belgrave once recalled to me. \u201cShe and the only other girl in the class were being intimidated by some of the fellows in the class. But I knew her potential. So I told her to write something and bring it in. It was so interesting and so complicated that the boys couldn\u2019t play it unless they worked really hard. So that shut them up.\u201dAt Howard University, Ms. Allen was among the first students to earn a jazz studies degree. She received a master\u2019s degree in ethnomusicology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1982. (She would return to the University of Pittsburgh and, in 2013, succeed another mentor,       Nathan Davis,        as director of jazz studies there.)Ms. Allen arrived in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in 1982 to find a resurgence of attention to jazz and a Balkanized musical community. Yet she straddled divisions, defusing seeming tensions\u2014mainstream/avant-garde, and so on\u2014with a galvanizing sense of purpose and the knowledge to back it up. In Brooklyn, she quickly fell in with like-minded contemporaries, including alto saxophonist       Steve Coleman,        who spearheaded an influential collective known as M-BASE. (She played forcefully on Mr. Coleman\u2019s debut album, \u201cMotherland Pulse.\u201d) She briefly sustained herself touring with singer       Mary Wilson,        formerly of the Supremes\u2014gaining \u201cmakeup and wardrobe tips,\u201d she told me, and deepening a passion that extends to one of her last releases, \u201cGrand River Crossings: Motown & Motor City Inspirations.\u201dIn 1996, around the same time she worked in Betty Carter\u2019s band, Ms. Allen played on Ornette Coleman\u2019s dual \u201cSound Museum\u201d albums. This association was notable not only because Coleman seldom worked with pianists after the late-1950s, but also for the compassion and invention with which Ms. Allen handled the assignment.Long before she was cast as pianist       Mary Lou Williams       in       Robert Altman\u2019s       1996 film \u201cKansas City,\u201d Ms. Allen had researched Williams\u2019s legacy while a graduate student, living in the Pittsburgh neighborhood Williams once called home. Long after, in 2014, she worked in collaboration with scholar       Farah Jasmine Griffin,        singer       Carmen Lundy       and director S. Epatha Merkerson on a theatrical production, \u201cA Conversation With Mary Lou,\u201d at Harlem Stage. That same year, she helped found the All-Female Jazz Residency, a summer program at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center for young musicians.During the past several years, Ms. Allen worked in two fascinating trios\u2014one with tenor saxophonist       David Murray       and the other with bassist       Esperanza Spalding,        and both including drummer       Terri Lyne Carrington.       Ms. Carrington, who first worked with Ms. Allen more than 30 years ago, said: \u201cShe thinks like a drummer. And she made me dig deeper and take chances.\u201dMs. Allen always focused on rhythm, took chances. Twice she recorded with an ensemble that included a tap dancer. She was a master collaborator, yet some of her most stunning recordings are solo works, especially 2010\u2019s \u201cFlying Toward the Sound.\u201d Subtitled \u201cA Solo Piano Excursion Inspired by       Cecil Taylor,       McCoy Tyner       and       Herbie Hancock,       \u201d that album exemplifies both Ms. Allen\u2019s firm grounding in the jazz-piano lineage and her daring and original leaps.Ms. Allen, whose manner was generally reserved, would grow animated discussing how Mary Lou Williams held court in her Harlem home in the 1940s for the likes of       Bud Powell       and       Thelonious Monk,        demonstrating how one can \u201ctouch the piano\u201d with authority and distinction.Ms. Allen knew how to touch the piano: The resonance of that act won\u2019t soon fade.\u2014Mr. Blumenfeld writes about jazz for the Journal.

The 76-year-old cardinal, the highest-level Vatican official to face charges in the sexual-abuse scandals that have hit the church, denied the allegations and said he would take a leave of absence with       Pope Francis      \u2019 permission to go back to his native Australia to clear his name.When Cardinal Pell came to Rome three years ago to head the newly established Secretariat for the Economy, he was already the target of claims that he had mishandled cases of sex abuse by other priests. But Thursday\u2019s charges nonetheless mark a dramatic turnaround\u00a0from his arrival, when the high-ranking prelate was seen as the media-savvy, straight-talking solution to the Vatican\u2019s chaotic finances.As his plans conflicted with those of other powerful officials, he was increasingly\u00a0marginalized\u00a0in his efforts to take on the Vatican bureaucracy. The criminal charges now take him entirely off the scene for an indefinite time, leaving an already diminished office\u00a0with even less clout to challenge\u00a0longtime ways of doing business at the Vatican. They also sideline a vocal defender of traditional Catholic moral teaching.\u201cPell\u2019s absence will seriously weaken the office\u201d he runs, said       Sandro Magister,        a longtime Vatican watcher for Italy\u2019s L\u2019Espresso magazine. \u201cThe economic reforms, which have been very modest after more than four years, will now become even more difficult to carry out.\u201dThe cardinal\u2019s departure comes a few days after the resignation of the Vatican\u2019s auditor general,       Libero Milone,        only two years after Pope Francis appointed him as the first person to hold that job. The Vatican announced the departure of Mr. Milone, an ally of Cardinal Pell, in a terse statement that gave no reason for his resignation.When Pope Francis was elected pope in March 2013, he accepted a mandate to make the Vatican bureaucracy more transparent and accountable, particularly in the financial area.The preceding pontificate, of       Pope Benedict XVI,        had been shaken by controversy over leaks documenting corruption and incompetence in the Vatican, including a Christmas manger scene that cost \u20ac550,000 and little oversight of funds collected by advocates for the canonization of potential saints.Accounting at the Vatican didn\u2019t follow unified policies, with data inconsistent across departments or not directly comparable.\u00a0Budgets didn\u2019t exist, and expenditures weren\u2019t itemized.Pope Francis brought Cardinal Pell to Rome in 2014 and originally gave him sweeping powers, with a document that said the cardinal\u2019s reach extended \u201cto all that in whatsoever manner\u201d concerned economic activity, including procurement and hiring.The cardinal oversaw a review of assets which he said turned up \u20ac1.4 billion \u201ctucked away\u201d off the books.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not saying it was being mismanaged or anything. It just was there for a rainy day,\u201d he said in an interview last year.\u00a0His office also issued new budgeting and accounting policies and produced the Vatican\u2019s first consolidated budget.Meanwhile, Cardinal Pell\u2019s proposals for what he considered a more effective approach to asset management\u2014demanding better returns on rental properties\u00a0and outsourcing financial investments to money managers\u2014raised hackles at the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, known as APSA.The pope briefly gave Cardinal Pell control over most of the Vatican\u2019s real estate portfolio\u00a0in July 2014\u00a0before handing it back to APSA\u00a0the following February. He trimmed back the cardinal\u2019s power in other ways, turning down his proposals for managing financial investments, reaffirming the power of the Secretary of State over hiring and transfer of personnel, scrapping an external financial audit supported by Cardinal Pell and transferring his responsibility for payment and procurement services to APSA.Cardinal Pell said in the interview last year that some of his setbacks were because of \u201cpeople wanting to retain their turf, their traditional role\u201d particularly at APSA and the Secretariat of State, and he vowed not to back down.According to Mr. Magister, the cardinal\u2019s leave of absence, following the resignation of the auditor general last week, shows that APSA and the Secretariat of State have regained control over Vatican finances.A Vatican statement said that the Secretariat for the Economy would continue to carry out its tasks, which include budget-making and oversight.Cardinal Pell\u2019s leave\u00a0of absence also\u00a0removes from the Vatican a major opponent of the pope\u2019s drive to liberalize church practice on\u00a0divorce.\u00a0As archbishop of Sydney, his post when the pope brought him to Rome, and in his earlier role as archbishop of Melbourne, Cardinal Pell had been an outspoken defender of orthodox teaching on sexual and medical ethics, opposing abortion drugs as well as embryonic stem-cell research.During two international synods of bishops at the Vatican in 2014 and 2015, Cardinal Pell spoke forcefully inside and outside the meeting hall against proposals to allow divorced Catholics who remarry without an annulment to receive Communion.According to church teaching, such Catholics may receive Communion only if they abstain from sexual relations with their new spouses, living together as \u201cbrother and sister.\u201d Otherwise the church considers their relationships adulterous. Conservatives have warned that changing this teaching would in effect legitimize sexual relations outside of marriage.Owing to the efforts of Cardinal Pell and his allies, the two synods failed to endorse a change in the traditional practice, drawing an angry rebuke from Pope Francis at the closing session in October 2015.In a document the following year, the pope didn\u2019t change church teaching but encouraged greater leniency in the matter by priests. Cardinal Pell and other conservatives have concluded that the pope\u2019s words didn\u2019t change the traditional prohibition on Communion for remarried divorced people.Write to Francis X.

There are roughly 850 troops in the Middle East as part of Canadian mission.Canada\u2019s mission is designed to focus on training and assisting Iraqi security forces, and helping regional military authorities to expand their capacity.The nearly two-year extension comes on the heels of a seminal shift this month in Canadian defense and foreign policy, partly in response to the Trump administration\u2019s growing isolationism in global affairs. The renewed commitment was also made at a time when the Iraqi military says it is making significant gains against ISIS in the city of Mosul.Canada pledged to ramp up defense spending over the next decade by more than 70%, and vowed to take on a greater role in battling global terrorism by deploying troops to the most dangerous parts of the world.\u201cOur new defence policy has made it very clear that Canada is ready and willing to do its part for the global community. This includes confronting security issues that threaten our shores and those of our allies and partners,\u201d Mr. Sajjan, a former lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian forces, said in a statement.Canada first deployed forces to Iraq in mid-2014 to work alongside allies in the anti-ISIS mission and now has troops in Iraq and Syria. The Liberal government came to power in the fall of 2015 on a promise to end Canada\u2019s direct combat role in the fight against Islamic State, and last year withdrew six Canadian fighter jets used in bombings.Mr. Trudeau has come under fire from some political opponents, who charge he has allowed Canadian troops to engage in a combat role in Iraq despite Liberal promises of a noncombat deployment. Criticism escalated after it was revealed last week that a sniper from the Canadian special forces unit shot and killed an ISIS fighter in Iraq.Mr. Trudeau said this week Canada is expected at times to defend its partners in the anti-ISIS mission, adding the sharpshooter should be \u201ccelebrated\u201d because it reflects a level of excellence in Canadian forces\u2019 training and expertise.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 13:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-pledges-to-remain-in-isis-fight-until-2019-1498758906", "news_title": "Canada Pledges to Remain in ISIS Fight Until 2019 ", "keywords": "canada,iraq,isil,isis,islamic state,mosul,syria,troops,troop withdrawl,Harjit Sajjan,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "The Treasury Department will auction $112 billion in securities next week.

As one murmuring head after another observes, absolute silence can\u2019t be achieved in these earthly precincts, and doesn\u2019t warrant chasing after in any case. What\u2019s de-stressing for the body and nourishing for the soul is quiet that contains benign sounds\u2014a fugitive breeze, a rustle of leaves, choral insects, a bird sending signals from the far reaches of a serene acoustic surround.The film begins with a tribute to \u201c4\u201933,\u201d the seminal composition by       John Cage       in which music is not played\u2014by a pianist, or a full orchestra\u2014for the four minutes and 33 seconds of the title.

The decision came two days after Mr. Janot filed charged Mr. Temer himself with corruption in an unprecedented move against a sitting president.Ms. Dodge was runner-up in an election among top prosecutors that generated a list of three attorney-general candidates from which Mr. Temer would choose. Since 2003, Brazilian presidents have chosen the candidate with the most votes from prosecutors, a tradition Mr. Temer\u2019s predecessor,       Dilma Rousseff,        honored in 2015 even as the investigations badly damaged her government and ultimately led to her impeachment last year.The selection of a new attorney general came as the so-called Car Wash probe has increasingly drawn criticism from the president and many of his allies in Congress. Mr. Temer, who denies wrongdoing, lashed out at the attorney general on Tuesday for what he called a politically motivated attack that threatened to undermine Brazil\u2019s political and economic stability.Such comments have been accompanied by budget cuts to the Federal Police, Brazil\u2019s version of the FBI, and various legislative proposals critics say are intended to weaken the investigation and allow crooked politicians to avoid prosecution.The process of selecting a successor to Mr. Janot had been closely watched for signs of political interference.According to Brazilian news reports in recent weeks, Ms. Dodge was the preferred candidate of several power brokers in Mr. Temer\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or PMDB, who had been maneuvering behind the scenes to bolster her chances in the election. One PMDB senator told The Wall Street Journal earlier this week that party members had sought to influence the vote.In a video interview posted to the internet Sunday by Brazil\u2019s UOL Not\u00edcias, Ms. Dodge dismissed the reports as speculation, adding that she only knew the politicians cited from formal events they had attended. Asked how she would handle the confirmation process with Mr. Temer and subsequently Brazil\u2019s Senate, Ms. Dodge said, \u201cThe expectation is [to] present my plan for the job and present myself. Never in the sense of asking or making a request for anything in return.\u201dMs. Dodge, who holds a master\u2019s degree in law from Harvard University and has been a federal prosecutor for 30 years, came a close second in votes behind Mr. Janot\u2019s main ally in the election, prosecutor Nicol\u00e3o Dino. During their campaigns, both candidates promised to continue the Car Wash investigation.Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima,        a federal prosecutor on the original Car Wash task force, said he sees any name on the three-person list as acceptable, adding that Ms. Dodge has had a distinguished career.\u201cThe thing to do now is wait and see\u2026how she runs the attorney general\u2019s office amid such a complex situation,\u201d Mr. Lima said. \u201cWe think the important thing is really to maintain the fight against corruption and organized crime, that there\u2019s no going back.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-29 13:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-president-michel-temer-picks-attorney-generals-successor-1498757349", "news_title": "Brazil President Michel Temer Picks Attorney General\u2019s Successor ", "keywords": " brazil attorney general ,brazil car wash, brazil corruption, brazil politics,Michel Temer,Raquel Dodge,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Are central bankers twisted geniuses manipulating the markets in order to meet their inflation goals? Or are they bumbling ex-academics whose ramblings are overinterpreted by investors besotted with their brilliance?The question has become increasingly important as investors try to navigate the end of global easy money, and wild swings in currencies this week show how markets are prone to misconstrue statements of the obvious by leading policy makers.A historic palace in Sintra, Portugal, was the prime location for the misunderstanding. European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       set out the nuances of monetary policy in a speech, only for most of it to be ignored by traders who seized on one sentence to conclude he had turned hawkish. The euro soared 1.4% against the dollar, then dropped almost a cent the next day when ECB officials denied the interpretation, before making it all back. German bond yields swung similarly.Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       then sent the sterling up 1% against the dollar when he said that he would be in favor of raising rates if investment and wages rose, a statement that is not only obvious but in agreement with his previous views.Serious money rests on the question of whether these were delicate signals to the market. Believing they were requires two assumptions about central bankers: that they wanted to tighten policy and that they were capable of saying so subtly.Both the Bank of England and the ECB were already clear that they no longer lean toward easing. There are several reasons they might want to lean more toward tightening: The Fed is already leading the way, and they don\u2019t want to be left behind; they would like to prepare the ground for rate increases so markets aren\u2019t shocked when it happens; or they would like to damp market exuberance, which several prominent bankers have worried about recently in public.Believing they are capable is harder. The hawkish interpretation of both Mr. Draghi and Mr. Carney rested on a few words amid speeches setting out existing policy as clearly as possible. Central bankers would have to be more attuned to the sensitivities of traders than full-time central-bank watchers, who initially took the apparently bland words as restatements of previous positions.The true twisted genius would be on display if the Sintra speeches weren\u2019t misinterpreted at all, but were trial balloons designed to test market sensitivities. On this reading, Messrs. Draghi and Carney want to know how worried investors are about tighter policy so they tried out ambiguous language before soothing nerves by letting it be known they were misinterpreted.Investors have little choice but to pay attention to central banks: They set the price of money, on which the price of everything else is, to some extent, dependent. It is natural that a lot of time is spent both trying to work out what will happen to the economy and how central banks will react, even if most of the effort is wasted.Markets are particularly sensitive in Europe because of the approaching end of ECB bond purchases and an unexpectedly close vote on interest rates at the Bank of England. Poor communication\u2014or perhaps market misunderstanding\u2014when the Fed neared the end of its bond buying in 2013 led to the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when 10-year Treasury yields leapt more than a percentage point in two months. The ECB and investors are on alert for any similar bond selloff.Yet, the Kremlinology is going too far.Peter Fisher,        a senior fellow at the center for business, government and society at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, and a former Fed official, says much misinterpretation of policy makers comes from their tendency to argue with each other in public in recent years. \u201cGiven the influence they have it\u2019s hard to ignore them, but think hard about whether they\u2019re talking to us [investors] or to each other.\u201dNeville Hill,        head of European economics at             Credit Suisse                   Group AG, shares the common view that Mr. Draghi is a silver-tongued communications virtuoso, but thinks Mr. Carney was just misinterpreted. \u201cHe [Mr. Draghi]\u2019s trying to get us to taper without having a tantrum,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is why they [the ECB] pushed back the next day, because the price action looked like there might be a tantrum.\u201dInvestors should try to think long term about central bankers\u2019 motivations. A few things are clear: They are still wedded to the \u201cPhillips curve\u201d link between lower unemployment and higher inflation, even though it hasn\u2019t held up in recent years. So if joblessness keeps falling, expect tighter money than inflation would otherwise suggest.They are still reluctant to risk market disruption through surprise decisions, so expect big policy shifts to be well-telegraphed.Finally, there were some signs of concern this week about high stock prices and low corporate bond yields from both the Fed and the Bank of England. But so far that isn\u2019t enough to cast doubt on the \u201cYellen put\u201d, the idea that the Fed will save investors from themselves by easing policy if markets fall.So forget the linguistic analysis and take central bankers\u2019 speeches at face value. As       Neal Soss,        vice chairman in research at Credit Suisse and a former assistant to Fed Chairman       Paul Volcker,        puts it: \u201cIn the end, watch what they do.\u201dWrite to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Divining the Secrets Of Draghi\u2019s Temple.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 13:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twisted-geniuses-or-bumbling-ex-academics-1498756654", "news_title": "Are Central Bankers Twisted Geniuses, or Just Twisted?", "keywords": "cb commentary,Credit Suisse Group,CSGN.EB,CS,Neal Soss,Neville Hill,Mark Carney,Peter Fisher,Mario Draghi,Paul Volcker,monetary policy,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "SOME FOLKS achieve a Zen state by meditating; others run.

If you\u2019re more visually inclined, YouTube offers enough video tutorials to keep you enthralled for years.Larry Kosilla, a former commodity trader, is the king of car detailing on YouTube, where his Ammo NYC how-to channel has nearly 400,000 subscribers. That\u2019s how Jennifer Vogt got hooked.

She\u2019d had pros detail the vehicle (at upward of $400 a pop) but realized she could do a better job herself, she explained. \u201cWhen you have an eye for it, it becomes a kind of art.\u201dThat art starts with a standard carwash (see below). After that, things get a little more nuanced.Obsessive detailers, for example, don\u2019t just want a vehicle to look slick; they want it to feel slick, too. When you run your hand over a car\u2019s finish, it\u2019s likely to feel rougher than you expect. Those imperfections are contaminants like tree pollen and brake dust that have bonded to the clear coat over time.\u2018Larry Kosilla is the king of car-detailing on YouTube, where his channel has nearly 400,000 subscribers.\u2019But devotees such as Warren Naugler, a campaign manager from Carlsbad, Calif., get their cars glassy smooth by laboriously rubbing a \u201cclay bar\u201d over every inch of its finish to expel the pollutants. Made from synthetic resin, these pliable hunks pull tiny debris out of the clear coat. Mr. Naugler spends hours doing this about every two months. (He also admits to waking up in the middle of the night to remove bird droppings from the hood of his 2008 Lexus IS-F. \u201cIt\u2019s therapy. I\u2019ll stay out there just to think,\u201d he said.)But clay bars can\u2019t do it all. For deeper stuff\u2014clearing up a hazy finish, say, or eradicating etching damage from baked-on bird poop, you\u2019ll need a dual-action polisher. Once a tool of the pros, this has become essential to the DIY set. Unlike rotary polishers, which spin on a single axis, dual-action models have heads that oscillate randomly, so you won\u2019t leave swirl marks and damage your finish.Budget-minded DIY-ers can pick up a basic dual-action polisher from Harbor Freight for $70 and up, but those with the means go for tools from Rupes, an Italian manufacturer that recently arrived in U.S. retailers. Its Big Foot series of polishers (from about $300) has become the de facto standard among serious DIY-ers and pros alike. \u201cI love it to death. It\u2019s a game changer,\u201d said Mr. Nichols. Rupes\u2019s latest innovation is the Nano ($590), which can use pads just 1 inch in diameter. Ms. Vogt extols its agility. \u201cYou can do pillars, and mirrors, nooks and crannies. It\u2019s so much fun,\u201d she said.For a dual-action polisher to do any good, you\u2019ll need a polishing compound. In recent years these have become safer to use\u2014less likely to leave swirls or haze. \u201cCompounds have gotten more workable. Before, you really had to know what you were doing, because they\u2019d dry out,\u201d said Mr. Nichols.One of the most basic steps in detailing a car\u2014waxing\u2014has evolved, too. No longer do you need to rub a layer of wax onto your hood and then wait a half-hour for it to dry, the way your father likely did: Polymer-based waxes and sealants are longer lasting, more effective and go on in one pass. \u201cYou\u2019re not grabbing for that can of carnauba and having to repeat it every two weeks,\u201d said Ms. Vogt.Meanwhile, advanced ceramic coating is threatening to obviate waxing all together. Unlike waxes and sealants that sit on top of a car\u2019s finish and soon break down, this silica dioxide\u2014like liquid glass\u2014fuses to the clear coat and can last for months or years with maintenance.What many DIYers love about it is that the coating\u2019s low surface tension has a hydrophobic effect\u2014allowing a spray of water to dispel dirt. Companies like Ceramic Pro have a network of installers that charge from around $300 for six months of coverage to $1,700 for the life of the car. Or, assuming your car has been perfectly paint-corrected, you can do it yourself with a product like CQuartz (from about $58, carpro-us.com).Yet not all detailers are convinced. To holdouts like Mr. Naugler, high-tech coatings that promise to take the elbow work out of maintaining a perfect finish are hogwash. \u201cAll that high tech ceramic, Teflon, do-it-once-in-a-lifetime stuff is B.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wax your car.\u201dWhether you prefer to polish manually or rely on nanotech, Mr. Naugler does have some words of warning about the addictiveness of detailing: \u201cOnce I realized what a clean car looked like, it threw me over the edge. I can never go back.\u201dDitch the Dish Soap | It may be gentle on your hands, but it\u2019s more abrasive than car soap\u2014and will strip away protective wax and dry out plastic trim. Products like Meguiar\u2019s Mirror Bright Automobile Shampoo ($13, meguiars.com) are pH neutral to protect paint and provide a light waxing, too.Use Two Buckets | One for soapy water, one for rinsing grime out of your mitt. Place a Grit Guard ($7; chemicalguys.com) in your bucket to provide a washboard-like surface for the task.Go Woolly | Many DIY detailers swear by wool wash mitts like the CarPro Merino Wool Wash Mitt ($20; carpro-us.com), which hold suds but release dirt easily when dipped in a rinse bucket. To avoid damage from brake dust, some detailers use a dedicated wash mitt and bucket just for the wheels.Spin a Good Yarn | Good quality microfiber towels, like a 25-by-35 inch Griot\u2019s Garage Microfiber Drying Towel ($27, griotsgarage.com), leave a streak-free finish without scratches.Don\u2019t Be a Hoser | For environmental reasons as well as convenience, more enthusiasts are using rinseless wash products like Optimum No Rinse & Shine ($16, optimumcarcare.com) in lieu of hosing down their vehicles. Its polymers help usher dirt off a car\u2019s surface.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 13:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-lovers-buff-their-way-to-blissand-you-can-too-1498756273", "news_title": "Car-Lovers Buff Their Way to Bliss\u2014and You Can, Too", "keywords": "car care,car detailing,carwash,how to,how to detail,luxury car,tutorial,vintage cars,reviews"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014A major meeting of world leaders in Germany next week emerged as a flashpoint of tension between allies on Thursday as Chancellor       Angela Merkel       sought to block the Turkish president from giving a speech in Germany and European leaders ratcheted up their criticism of President Donald Trump.In the space of a few hours Thursday, Ms. Merkel and her government delivered broadsides against both Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan,        who had wanted to give a speech on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg next week, and against Mr. Trump\u2019s positions on climate and trade policy.Speaking to the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, Ms. Merkel criticized the U.S. for abandoning the Paris climate accord and warned of difficult talks.\u201cWe want to and must master this existential challenge, and we cannot and will not wait until every last person in the world has been successfully convinced of the scientific findings about climate change,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThose who believe they can solve the problems of this world with isolationism and protectionism are making a huge error.\u201dMr. Erdogan and Mr. Trump will join Ms. Merkel and other leaders of 20 large economies at the two-day annual summit that starts on July 7. While much of the anticipation in the U.S. has focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s likely first meeting with Russian President       Vladimir Putin,        European leaders hope to use the summit to present Mr. Trump with a united front backing the Paris climate accord and opposing new trade barriers.\u201cThe G-20 summit takes place in especially challenging conditions this year,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThe world is in turbulence. It has become less united.\u201dMs. Merkel is not only girding for tough talks with Mr. Trump, but also preparing for potentially violent protests. Mr. Erdogan, in particular, is a divisive figure in Germany\u2019s large Turkish diaspora.Ms. Merkel\u2019s foreign minister,       Sigmar Gabriel,        said Thursday that the Turkish president had notified Germany of plans to deliver a speech to supporters on the sidelines of the summit. Such an appearance, Mr. Gabriel warned, was \u201cnot possible\u201d and risked inciting conflict in Germany\u2019s large community of people of Turkish descent.Ms. Merkel backed Mr. Gabriel\u2019s position, her spokesman said.\u201cThe Turkish people who live in Germany are part of our society,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said Thursday while on a visit to Russia. \u201cWe do not want these people stirred up through conflicts in their home country.\u201dRelations between Germany and Turkey, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, have deteriorated rapidly since last summer\u2019s aborted coup in Turkey.Tensions escalated this year after Turkey detained a prominent German-Turkish journalist, Turkish officials were barred from holding political rallies in Germany, Berlin granted asylum to Turkish military officers wanted in connection with the failed coup, and Turkey barred German lawmakers from visiting German troops stationed in Turkey.In Berlin, eight other European leaders joined Ms. Merkel on Thursday at her Chancellery office to prepare a united front for the Hamburg summit. They echoed her defense of free trade and the importance of fighting climate change.The leaders\u2019 comments after the meeting showed that the summit is shaping up as a clash between proponents of a liberal world order, embodied by host Ms. Merkel and recently elected French President       Emmanuel Macron       on the one hand, and advocates of the antiestablishment nationalism that Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have come to represent in Europe.\u201cI believe Europe is currently the only place that defends the vision of fair free trade and multilateralism against protectionism and, of course, against all dumping practices and the breach of international rules,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Without referring to the U.S. directly, Mr. Macron said he hoped some countries would \u201ccome to their senses again\u201d on climate change. Mr. Trump caused consternation in Europe when he said earlier this month the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris agreement to curb global warming.Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 30, 2017, print edition as 'Tensions Rise as Leaders Prepare to Meet.'", "news_time": "2017-06-29 13:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-criticizes-trump-erdogan-ahead-of-g-20-meeting-1498734796", "news_title": "Germany Criticizes Trump, Erdogan Ahead of G-20 Meeting ", "keywords": "g-20,germany-turkey relations,germany-us relations,group of 20 meeting,us-turkey relations,Group of 20,Angela Merkel,Emmanuel Macron,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,climate change,international relations,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "In the summertime, I typically run at 5 in the morning, when the temperature\u2019s great, like 85 degrees. This January, I finally got a GPS watch, Garmin                   Forerunner 25. I use it to track my runs and hikes, and it\u2019s been neat to precisely track how far I\u2019ve gone and where I\u2019ve gone.Before I go hiking, I freeze six quarts of water in Powerade bottles, then I let three thaw. As I hike, I pour water from the thawed bottles into the ones with ice in them, so I\u2019ll have cold water most of the day.There\u2019s only one gas station here and it generally charges around $2 a gallon more than the ones in town. So never buy gas in Death Valley. When I\u2019m going to town, I use an app called \u201cGasBuddy\u201d that tells you where the cheapest gas is.I have a super-old, 2011 ACER Aspire One netbook that I use to track all of my hikes in an Excel spreadsheet. I\u2019ve been tracking my hikes obsessively, more or less on the same spreadsheet, since 1995\u2014about 20,000 miles worth of hikes. It\u2019s interesting to look back and compare the averages across months and parks. Death Valley miles, for example, are really difficult versus Yellowstone miles. I can also see the people I\u2019ve hiked with\u2014almost 600 different people in that time frame.Two park rangers and I recently went up Dry Mountain. It\u2019s one of the more extreme hikes any of us has ever taken in the park. Leading up to it, I did research on panamintcity.com and summitpost.org, where people post their routes and compare experiences. I used the sites to make notes on my paper map about ways to get around challenging spots.To effectively live in a remote place like Death Valley, you pretty much need two vehicles. Just to go to the grocery store, you\u2019re doing 300 miles round trip, all paved, so I have a 2012 Ford Focus for the gas mileage. On the other hand, you need a good four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around this park, where 95 percent is backcountry or only accessible by hard-core roads. My four-wheel-drive vehicle is a 2015 Toyota Tacoma, which is my desert vehicle of choice for its short turning radius, high clearance and its durability.I usually carry a small run of duct tape with me. [Survive Essentials 2-by-50-inch rolls shown.] You can use it to fix hiking boots, clothes, cars\u2014just about anything in the field.

You could spend a small fortune on 800-thread-count sheets\u2014or about 10 minutes prepping a batch of silky, tender, caraway-scented gravlax. With a few days\u2019 stay in the fridge, the latter is guaranteed to inspire serious breakfast-table swooning. Come Saturday morning, slice the salmon thinly enough to read the horoscopes through and array it on a tray alongside a dozen plump bagels. Add a snowy peak of scallion cream cheese, some sliced onions and summer tomatoes, a scattering of capers and a few other niceties. No one will want to get out of their pajamas. You win the weekend.With its seashell-pink hue and delicate texture, gravlax looks a lot like cold-smoked salmon and tastes like that brunch stalwart\u2019s milder cousin: sweeter, cleaner, and of course, smoke-free. For home cooks\u2014even timid ones\u2014this is a DIY project with little risk and enormous rewards.There are endless ways to tweak the formula based on regional tastes and personal recipes, but the basic method\u2014which harks back to the days when Scandinavian sailors preserved their catch by salting and burying it along the shore\u2014remains remarkably simple. Grab a slab of the freshest salmon you can find. Ask your fishmonger to remove the skin. (And if wild Alaskan salmon is in season, splurge. It\u2019s worth it for the buttery texture and Crayola color alone.) Slather on a rub of salt and sugar and whatever herbs strike your fancy\u2014dill and caraway are a nice nod to the Nordics, and a hefty pinch of black pepper never hurts\u2014then wrap the whole thing tightly in plastic wrap and pop it into the refrigerator, weighted with a few hardcovers from your summer reading stash. (A couple of cans from the pantry will also work.) The longer you let it cure, the firmer the fish\u2019s flesh will be and the bolder the flavor\u2014but generally speaking, two to three days gets the job done.It really is as easy as that. Hearty slices of pumpernickel or bagels and cream cheese are, of course, classic pairings. But you can bring as much bling to your appetizing platter as the occasion warrants, adding bowls of cucumber salad for cool crunch, a sunny egg salad flecked with herbs or even a few spoonfuls of briny caviar.Leftover gravlax is a rarity, but any that isn\u2019t gobbled up will keep at least five days in the refrigerator. My favorite vehicle for scraps is a hash made with hunks of rye bread.

I\u2019ve always had a thing for Mr. Meier\u2019s minimalist glass and white-steel residences. Now we were going to spend five vacation days in one.I opened the door and gasped. It\u2019s one thing to see Mr. Meier\u2019s work in photos or YouTube clips. But walking into this room was like stepping into a painting. Sunlight sailed through the floor-to-ceiling windows and filled every space. It ricocheted off the bleached and crenulated walls, leapt up to white, shallowly coffered ceilings and poured across the travertine floor. Kicking off my flip-flops, I fell back on the king-size bed.That\u2019s when I saw it between my bare feet: a sublime chalky-cream credenza. Roughly 8.5 feet long, the piece deftly combined the sleek silhouette of a 1950s stereo console with a 1930s Euro Deco aesthetic. Facets on the four doors created a spine-like geometric pattern of light and shadow. And burnished brass lined the gap between the case and doors. The cabinet was sculptural, understated, cool.Back in New York, I called the designer of the piece and all of the hotel\u2019s guest-room d\u00e9cor, Paris-based architect       Joseph Dirand.       He told me the doors were coated with a special lacquer that crackled faintly while drying to give the wood relief its ceramic appearance. \u201cThe credenza\u2019s doors pay tribute to Miami\u2019s geometric architectural facades,\u201d he said, referencing the concrete patterns that grace many of the city\u2019s midcentury buildings.While Mr. Dirand\u2019s cabinet isn\u2019t yet available to the public, any of the alternatives shown here could fit into most contemporary spaces. Still, adding one to an eclectic interior requires some finesse. \u201cYou don\u2019t want too many large horizontal pieces competing for the eye,\u201d warned       Rachel Newton       of Red, a Brooklyn, N.Y., interior design studio, adding that the silhouette of such a credenza is best appreciated in uncrowded rooms. \u201cGive it room to breathe,\u201d she said.

Rite Aid will also receive a $325 million breakup fee. The new agreement was spurred by the growing likelihood that the government would reject the original deal.But while Rite Aid will be losing several billion dollars a year in revenue, the beleaguered company could use the proceeds from the sale to pay down as much as 70% of its more than $7 billion in debt. Assuming pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $500 million, or half of Rite Aid\u2019s trailing 12-month figure, that would lower its net debt to around 3.8 times. That compares with 6.3 times trailing Ebitda today.If Rite Aid used the proceeds of the deal to pay down debt, Moody\u2019s would consider raising its current credit rating, which is in the middle of the junk range, said analyst Mickey Chadha.\u00a0 Rite Aid said the per-store sales and adjusted Ebitda of the remaining stores would be higher than its current companywide average, a signal that Walgreens may be taking some of Rite Aid\u2019s lower performing stores off its hands.For Rite Aid, which reported a net loss of $75 million and interest expense of $109 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a lower debt load could help it free up cash to invest in its struggling stores. Same-store sales fell 3.9% in the quarter as the company felt the impact of lower reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical sales. That should be offset somewhat by Thursday\u2019s deal, which gives Rite Aid the option to purchase generic drugs from a Walgreens affiliate at roughly the same cost as Walgreens for 10 years.Being smaller and having less debt could also help Rite Aid attract another buyer.             CVS Health,       the No. 2 drugstore chain, could be interested. Rite Aid could also merge with             Fred\u2019s,       a regional pharmacy chain that was hit almost as hard as Rite Aid by the unwinding of the Walgreens deal. Fred\u2019s, whose stores are primarily concentrated in the Southeast, had agreed to purchase more than 800 Rite Aid stores in a sweetheart deal done to appease regulators.Granted, Rite Aid still isn\u2019t particularly cheap. The company trades at about 10 times the assumed pro forma Ebitda, after adjusting for net debt, about the same as the much healthier Walgreens.Still, Rite Aid is better shape after the deal than it was Wednesday, it remains a national chain and its shares are down by two-thirds this year.

BDCs, as they\u2019re known, sell stock to raise money to invest, typically in the debt of small- to midsize companies. In recent years, large investors like Oaktree,\u00a0            Apollo Global Management                   LLC and             Ares Management                   LP\u00a0have boosted the pile of assets they manage by forming or buying these specialty lenders.\u00a0By and large, the big investors manage funds that return capital after a number of years.

The flag-waving fervor reached numbing levels in 1976, when banners paraded, bunting draped and star-spangled tchotchkes proliferated: mugs, key chains, T-shirts, bikinis.An unlikely trigger, the revival of 1969\u2019s \u201cEasy Rider,\u201d made the teen me see the red, white and blue with more appreciative eyes. I loved the look of Peter Fonda on his custom chopper, Old Glory painted on the gas tank, his helmet and leather jacket mirroring the motif, too.The actor\u2019s Stars and Stripes display\u2014cool and attitudinal, symbolic of individuality more than of patriotism\u2014hooked me. I see now that my new allegiance to the flag had much in common with the Founding Fathers\u2019 motives. What were they but rebels\u2014their cause, independence?\u201cConsider that if the revolution had failed, all the guys who signed the Declaration of Independence would have been hung,\u201d said       Steve Winters,        whose Historical Americana Company, in Atlanta, deals in antique flags.I hadn\u2019t thought of displaying one in my home until I visited the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, my adopted hometown. I saw framed and encased specimens\u2014and in particular a battle-worn, faded version from D-Day, so beautiful and full of character as to qualify as art.Studying the market, I found that early-American flags have become sought-after Americana. In May, a 13-star campaign flag from James Buchanan\u2019s 1856 candidacy (center of grid) set an auction record when it sold for $275,000 to       Jeff Bridgman       American Antiques, in York County, Pa.Modest finds remain, however. A 48-star version, from 1959, before Hawaii and Alaska gained statehood, can be had unframed for $10 to $150, Mr. Winters said.Sail and tent makers likely fabricated early flags, which flew from ships and forts, said Jeff Bridgman. \u201cPrivate use really didn\u2019t begin until the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cThen homemade examples first appeared in a significant number.\u201d Not until 1912 did the federal government standardize the design, which explains varieties like two flags shown here (top left and top right) that distinctively arrange 31 stars, reflecting California\u2019s 1850 admission as the country\u2019s 31st state.Materials and configurations reflect events of their day. Although many flags are made of wool, silk or cotton, the 30 Xs that stand in for stars on a WWI-era example (middle left) appear to be made of medical tape. It was fashioned, said Mr. Bridgman, by Belgians welcoming U.S. soldiers into the previously Germany-occupied city of Virton.Customers prefer specimens that show age and usage, said       C. Garrett Bonsell,        owner of Bonsell Americana, in Hillsdale, Ill. This makes flags an anomaly; with most other collectibles, \u201cmint condition\u201d increases value. \u201cPeople want it clear, even upon first glance, that the flag is old and unusual,\u201d he said. Mr. Winters noted that when early hand-printed examples age, the red turns shades of orange, the blue fades and the white mellows to tan or cream. \u201cThey take on a surreal look and have wonderful, glowing chromatic colors,\u201d he said.Kate Schelter,        a New York stylist and author of \u201cClassic Style,\u201d scours estate sales for vintage American banners. One hangs in the staircase of her cedar-shingled Cape Cod home. \u201cIt makes a wonderful focal point,\u201d she said. Flags sit well, too, in interior designer Miles Redd\u2019s bold rooms, which often pop with primary hues. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly distinguished and graphic,\u201d he said.Despite a deepened respect for early American flags, I still don\u2019t possess one. Yet this Fourth of July, my fashion-designer wife plans to sell pocket squares she made from a roll of 1950s-era, 48-star mini-banners she found at an estate sale. I will stuff one in my sports jacket\u2019s pocket and cruise to the levee fireworks on my scooter, not motorcycle, come Independence Day.

Today, his fund has lost 89% of its assets from a 2011 peak and he is staking a comeback partly on one of America\u2019s most beaten-down companies:             Sears Holdings Corp.        SHLD -3.66%Mr. Berkowitz\u2019s flagship Fairholme Fund has lost 12.9% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is up about 9%. Over five years, his Fairholme Fund returned 7.6% vs. 15.1% for the S&P. At $2.2 billion in assets, the fund is just a fraction of the $20 billion in assets it held in 2011.Performance has hit assets in the fund, but so have redemptions. Many investors who once relished Mr. Berkowitz\u2019s concentrated bets have taken their cash elsewhere. The fund manager is now the firm\u2019s largest customer after several years of customer withdrawals.Mr. Berkowitz is unapologetic for the poor returns, noting he always has promised his investors ultra-concentrated, often contrarian bets and high volatility was a likely result.\u201cThe people who had the smoothest ride were those in Bernie Madoff. Life is not smooth,\u201d he said.Since the Fairholme Fund was started in 1999, it has delivered an annualized total return of about 10% versus about 5% for the S&P, according to             Morningstar Inc.Mr. Berkowitz is an anomaly in the investing world. He still does what a shrinking number of his peers do, mining regulatory filings himself, gauging his faith in company leaders, conferring with analysts and at times playing the role of activist.That type of examination is behind his growing bet on Sears, the formerly quintessential American retailer that has reported seven years of losses.Last month, Sears raised concerns about its ability to continue operating as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201dMost days, he works from his Coral Gables, Fla., home, calling his staff located at a nearby white-and-glass office building. His day-to-day appearance is more country club than Wall Street\u2014he often wears boat shoes and jeans or khakis. Together with his wife, he runs a charitable foundation and collects art including works by Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol.Mr. Berkowitz says one part of his comeback\u2014big bets on government-backed mortgage financing giants\u2014could pay off in the next six months.Treasury officials have said they want to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could include moving them out of government control. Such a move could put an end to litigation over their future and deliver a windfall to investors. For now, however, the future of the two entities and what that will mean for investors is unclear. Preferred shares in the two represented 38% of the Fairholme Fund at the end of February, according to a regulatory filing, the most recent holdings information available.Mr. Berkowitz started building a position in Sears stock in late 2005 and now owns both debt and equity in a number of Sears\u2019 entities. He also owns shares in its spinoff real-estate investment trust             Seritage Growth Properties.       He has continued to add to some of those holdings in recent years.As of the end of February, more than 10% of the fund was invested in Seritage shares, Sears and appliance seller             Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores Inc.       stock and various Sears entities\u2019 corporate debt, according to the filing. The fund\u2019s holdings also include warrants to purchase Sears common stock.Mr. Berkowitz has been adding to his Sears exposure in recent years as its stock price has declined. This year, Sears shares have fallen 14%.\u201cThe deaths of today\u2019s malls and other enclosed spaces is greatly exaggerated,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said in a recent interview.He believes restaurants are returning to malls, but in the form of outdoor eateries. Mr. Berkowitz said traditional clothing chains may die, but their space will be replaced by movie theaters and auto showrooms. As online retailers reshape shopping, he says the parking lots and properties traditional retailers occupied will be redeveloped and used for new services or homes.When that happens, he says anchor properties will have heightened value given their footprint and location. And, Sears often inhabits the largest corner of malls.Still, many landlords have lost large anchor tenants in recent years, and some analysts and property owners have questioned whether a resurgence of such malls is possible.\u201cNo one thinks about the parking lots. Those already have infrastructure, highways, secondary roads, sewers, water systems,\u201d he said.Together with the Fannie and Freddie stakes, real estate and retail-related holdings account for 70% of the Fairholme Fund. Other real estate holdings include Florida-based developer the             St. Joe Co.      , which represents about 14% of the fund.Some investors have opted to sit out the real estate bets.Steve Bachman, a retired chemical engineer in Orange County, Calif., who owned the fund for 10 years sold his stake in 2015 concerned about the prospects of its positions in Sears and the Florida development firm, where Mr. Berkowitz is chairman.\u201cThey bought Sears because the land was valuable, but it would probably be forever before they\u2019d get a return on it and meanwhile I was watching Sears stock go down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s on he\u2019s really on, when he\u2019s not he\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Bachman said of Mr. Berkowitz.Mr. Berkowitz rose to fame along with investors like       Bill Miller,        Ken Heebner and       Tom Marsico       in the 1990s and early 2000s.A       Warren Buffett       devotee, Mr. Berkowitz, 59, seeks unloved, undervalued companies. He charges investors in his fund 1.03% annually, high for mutual funds, particularly as ultralow cost index-tracking funds that charge a fraction of a percentage point have gained popularity.He made lucrative bets on insurance companies including             American International Group Inc.       and             Bank of America Corp.       in the wake of the financial crisis that paid off in recent years as they recovered. He dodged the technology bubble and bust and before the financial crisis made successful bets on energy and defense that contributed to his fame.In 2010, fund-research firm Morningstar named Mr. Berkowitz U.S. stock fund manager of the decade. The fund had posted a 10-year annualized return of 13.2% through the end of 2009 versus a category average return of 0.01% during the same period, Morningstar said at the time.More recently, he has invested more in debt than stocks, drawn to the income and protection from price swings that bonds offer. He has bought both corporate debt and commercial paper of retail, hotel, metals and mining and food companies.\u201cSpending 30 years analyzing equities is a really great way to understand credit,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz said.Write to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 12:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fund-manager-makes-contrarian-bet-loading-up-on-sears-1498734001", "news_title": "Bruce Berkowitz Seeks Return to Glory by Betting on Sears", "keywords": "Sears Holdings,SHLD,American International Group,AIG,Fannie Mae,Freddie Mac,Seritage Growth Properties,SRG,Morningstar,MORN,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores,SHOS,St. Joe,JOE,Bruce Berkowitz,Bill Miller,Tom Marsico,Warren Buffett,Steve Bachman,financial performance,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,middle management,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,financial investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014            BP        BP 0.57%       PLC said Thursday it will write off $750 million from its second quarter earnings as a result of poor exploration results in Angola, an oil-rich country that the company has touted as a pillar of its business.The British oil-and-gas company said it would give up its 50% stake in a license off the African country\u2019s south coast after deciding it wasn\u2019t worth developing a 2014 gas discovery there. BP said additional exploration write-offs in the country will also contribute to the charge, without giving more details.The shift in exploration strategy comes as BP is working to rebuild the company in the wake of its fatal blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and a three-year plunge in oil prices that has rocked the entire industry.After years of retrenchment, it is now back on the path to growth with plans to add 800,000 barrels a day of new oil and gas production by 2020. By the end of the decade, including its stake in Russian oil giant POA Rosneft, it expects to be pumping 4 million barrels a day\u2014as much as before the 2010 disaster.BP said the $750 million noncash charge won\u2019t be tax deductible, but it also won\u2019t affect the company\u2019s cash flow for the quarter\u2014an increasingly important metric for investors worried about oil firms\u2019 ability to cover spending and dividend payouts with oil prices stuck below $50 a barrel.BP has operated in Angola for decades and counts its operations there as some of its most important. When BP gained access to deepwater and ultra deepwater exploration licenses off the country\u2019s coast in 2011, it described the acquisition as a \u201cmajor win.\u201dSince then, priorities have changed following a precipitous drop in oil prices. Companies are increasingly moving away from expensive exploration in frontier regions, like parts of the Angola that remain relatively unexplored, to focus on areas where they already have operations and knowledge of the geology they are working with.BP said the decision to write off its Angolan assets is part of a broader portfolio review, intended to focus the company more on natural gas and lower-cost oil projects near existing infrastructure. Those types of investments are expected to make the company more resilient in a world where oil prices remain low and more countries shift to lower carbon energy sources like gas and renewables.The company pointed to its decision last year to scrap controversial plans to explore in pristine waters off the coast of Australia.\u201cWe are making disciplined choices throughout our business,\u201d BP\u2019s exploration and production chief       Bernard Looney       said. \u201cWe are choosing not to pursue activities that we don\u2019t think will deliver maximum value for our shareholders.\u201dWrite to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 12:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bp-writes-off-exploration-assets-in-angola-1498753458", "news_title": "BP Writes Off Exploration Assets in Angola ", "keywords": "africa,angola,bp,crude oil,write off,BP,BP.LN,corporate,industrial news,energy,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Aetna Inc.        AET 0.61%       will move its corporate headquarters along with 250 jobs to Manhattan by late 2018, from Hartford, Conn., the latest company to abandon a smaller city for a major urban center.The company said it chose New York as its new location to tap a more robust pool of talent at a time when Aetna is repositioning itself as a consumer-oriented health company.\u201cNew York City is a knowledge economy hub, and a driver of the innovations that will play a significant part in our ongoing transformation,\u201d       Mark Bertolini,        chief executive of the company, said in a statement Thursday.Aetna\u2019s departure from Hartford comes as the Connecticut is struggling with a spiraling fiscal imbalance that has led to a projected $5.1 billion budget deficit over the next two years. It is the latest big-name corporate loss for Connecticut after             General Electric Co.       left the state for Boston last year.Aetna\u2019s new corporate office will be in a 170,000 square-foot Chelsea building being developed by             Vornado Realty Trust                   and Aurora Capital Associates at 61 Ninth Ave. The nine-story office building, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, will feature a terrace for each floor and is located not far from             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google office.             Starbucks                   has signed a lease to take 20,000 square feet at the building for a megastore.The area around Aetna\u2019s new home was initially technology focused but the neighborhoods have begun attracting more mature and diverse corporations looking to recruit and attract high-level workers, said       Paul Amrich,        vice chairman at real estate services firm             CBRE Group Inc.       The High Line park, new residential development, retail and restaurants have added to its allure as a hip neighborhood, he said.Aetna said it would continue to keep thousands of employees at its Hartford campus but said its commitment to Connecticut \u201cwill be based on the state\u2019s economic health.\u201d\u201cThe company remains hopeful that lawmakers will come to an agreement that puts Connecticut on sound financial footing, and that the state will support needed reforms to make Hartford a vibrant city once again,\u201d the company said in a statement.The city of Hartford is in its own financial straits, facing a $49.6 million budget hole. The city has asked the state for help and reached out to attorneys in May in case the city is forced to seek bankruptcy protection.Aetna, along with two other major employers in Hartford, have said they collectively would provide of $10 million annually over the next five years to help the city avoid bankruptcy, as long as comprehensive changes are enacted to stabilize Hartford\u2019s finances.\u201cConnecticut has a long history with Aetna and we appreciate that thousands of their employees will continue to work and live here in the state,\u201d a spokeswoman for Gov.

New York City also wooed the insurance company, promising $9.6 million in tax benefits.Many of the 250 employees that will be working at the new New York office will be new positions, according to an Aetna spokesman.Mr. Malloy previously said his administration offered to match any financial incentives any other state offered.

Regulators said the decision set a precedent for future cases, paving the way for a series of similar actions against other Google products, such as tools to search for flights, hotels, photos and news, analysts said.Such actions would rein in a company that has known few bounds to its growth over two decades.In 13 years tracking Google since its 2004 public offering, \u201cwe\u2019ve never been as concerned as we are following this ruling,\u201d Macquarie Capital analyst       Ben Schachter       wrote in a research note this week.Regulators on Tuesday ordered Google to alter its search results in the EU to give other comparison-shopping sites higher billing, although those companies\u2019 offerings may not be as relevant to queries as Google\u2019s.Google, a unit of             Alphabet Inc.,        GOOGL 0.59%       said Tuesday it would review the EU decision and consider an appeal. It said its data show users and advertisers like its shopping ads, and that regulators aren\u2019t considering the prevalence of shopping sites like             Amazon.com Inc.       The company declined to comment further for this article.\u201cOur search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results,\u201d Google said in a 2015 post in response to EU regulators. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019\u2014that\u2019s giving our customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201dIn penalizing Google, the EU is prioritizing market competition over user experience, analysts said.EU regulators are \u201cstating that if Google improves its services\u2026then these improvements are harming competitors unfairly,\u201d Macquarie\u2019s Mr. Schachter said. That stance \u201ccould dramatically limit Google\u2019s ability to offer what it views as the most relevant information in a potentially long list of categories,\u201d he said.In two other cases, involving Google\u2019s Android smartphone software and its ad network called AdSense, European regulators have said they already determined \u201cthat Google has abused a dominant position.\u201d Google has denied the charges. Rulings are expected on them over the next year.Google launched its search engine in the late 1990s as a list of 10 blue links to webpages relevant to users\u2019 queries. Over two decades, Google has reshaped its search results to also offer tools to find everything from jobs to plumbers to financial information. The search engine also now delivers song lyrics, internet-speed tests, and direct answers to users\u2019 questions, such as \u201cHow big is the sun?\u201dSuch changes often reduced traffic to competing websites, hurting their ability to provide quality offerings. Critics also argue that Google\u2019s services are sometimes not as good as competitors\u2019, such as restaurant reviews on             Yelp Inc.       or             Expedia Inc.\u2019s       flight-search tool. Affected companies for years have cried foul.\u201cWe built search for users, not websites, and no matter what we do, there will always be some websites unhappy with where they rank,\u201d Alphabet Chairman       Eric Schmidt       told the U.S. Senate in 2011, when the Federal Trade Commission was investigating Google for antitrust violations.In 2013, the FTC declined to press charges, going against some FTC staff recommendations.The FTC prioritized the effect on consumers over market competition, said       Paul Gallant,        a tech-policy analyst at Cowen & Co. \u201cThe U.S. is willing to tolerate some competitive damage if consumers win in the end,\u201d he said.But that defense failed with EU antitrust regulators, who care more about a monopoly\u2019s effect on smaller competitors, Mr. Gallant said.The split between U.S. and European regulators is why many of Google\u2019s U.S. competitors\u2014including Yelp,             Oracle Corp.      , and             News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal\u2014have focused lobbying efforts in the EU.News Corp\u2019s complaint to the EU is that Google illegally pulls content off News Corp\u2019s websites to use in search results, and that Google penalizes its sites\u2019 search rankings for requiring users to have subscriptions to read articles. Similarly, Getty Images Inc. has complained that Google illegally pulls its photos from its websites for Google\u2019s image-search tool.News Corp declined to comment. Getty didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Last year, Google prevailed in a U.K. lawsuit filed by a British mapping firm that accused Google of unfairly favoring its maps in search results. The court ruled that Google\u2019s mapping product didn\u2019t harm competition.Such moves by Google are designed to improve the utility of its search engine, which keeps users coming back\u2014and clicking on search ads that account for much of its revenue. Airlines, hotels and retailers also pay Google for traffic from its flight, hotel and shopping search tools.\u201cGoogle absolutely believes that everything it has done in the evolution of its business is improving the consumer experience. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not guilty of competition problems, but it is why this case could be hard to settle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just tactics by Google.

Among other things, the Fed dinged Capital One for plans that \u201cdid not appropriately take into account the potential impact of the risks in one of its most material businesses.\u201dThe Fed didn\u2019t specify which business it was referring to, and Capital One hasn\u2019t clarified. Credit cards and auto lending are the likely culprits though. The stress tests found that under the most severe recession scenario, Capital One could see loss rates of 20% on cards and 8% on other consumer loans, totaling almost $26 billion.Even with these losses Capital One had enough capital leftover to make its originally planned payouts to shareholders, so it is a mystery why it voluntary lowered its request to the Fed. Mysteries are not what investors want to see in a lender that focuses on less-affluent borrowers. Capital One\u2019s U.S. credit card loans were up 8% from a year earlier in the first quarter, and 37% of that was to borrowers with subprime credit scores.Investor confidence in Capital One was already shaken by its first-quarter results, when it raised its forecast for 2017 credit-card losses for the second time in six months.

Without some clear explanation, the shares could fall further.Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 12:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-needs-to-explain-itself-1498752000", "news_title": "Capital One Needs to Explain Itself   ", "keywords": "bank credit cards ,bank liquidity,bank risks,bank stress tests,capital one stress test,fed stress tests,Capital One Financial,COF,Federal Reserve,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,credit types,services,credit cards,banking,credit,financial services,plastic cards"}, {"content": "THE AREA OF south-central Vermont around Stratton Mountain is a rural landscape of white-clapboard farm houses and rolling hills forested with tall pines and silvery birches. Indisputably beautiful countryside, to be sure, but with poor cellphone coverage, stringent restrictions on development and the native Vermonters\u2019 inclination to keep a good thing to themselves, it hasn\u2019t exactly been on the jet-set\u2019s radar.That\u2019s largely what compelled me and my husband to buy a weekend house there in 2014\u2014a spontaneous indulgence in that clich\u00e9d real estate fantasy of \u201cgetting away from it all.\u201d We were eager to flee our Brooklyn home on winter weekends and take advantage of Stratton\u2019s ski slopes, a 4\u00bd-hour drive north of New York. Little did we know that our pokey winter retreat would morph into a stealthily fashionable destination where foodie restaurants are slowly supplanting diners with sticky booths and stylish hotels edging out doily-infested B&Bs. Increasingly, the area has enough going on to make it an attractive summer spot too.In 2011, New England\u2019s first private-club ski resort, the Hermitage Club at Haystack Mountain, opened outside the town of Wilmington; in 2015, it completed a 90,000-foot post-and-beam lodge. Mercedes-Benz buses whisking its guests to the mountain from the nearby small airport have become a common sight on the country roads. Nonmembers are welcome to stay at the club\u2019s six inns\u2014all renovated historic properties scattered around Wilmington and adjacent town Dover\u2014enjoying nearly full access to the ski facilities in winter and swimming and boating amenities on the club\u2019s lake come summer.In late 2015, the Kimpton hotel group opened the Taconic, its first Vermont property, in the historic village of Manchester. With a firepit on the big front porch, the inn puts a local twist on the boutique-hotel model. Bigger changes are afoot too: Aspen Skiing Co. is currently executing a deal to buy the company that owns Stratton and other resorts, which observers say would usher in more high-end development. \u201cAspen\u2019s acquisition of Stratton means there\u2019s going to be a lot more happening here in a short period,\u201d said Meridith Dennes, a former investment banker from Manhattan who moved to the area full time in 2014. Ms. Dennes recently launched an online regional travel-guide, VisitStratton.com, to help newcomers keep up.Until recently, southern Vermont\u2019s summertime appeal revolved around its country pleasures: jumping 35 feet from a marble cliff into the Dorset Quarry; splashing beneath the waterfalls at Pike\u2019s Falls swimming hole; riding at Mountain View Ranch in Danby; or picking blueberries over by Emerald Lake State Park, at Wildwood Berry Farm.But even the outdoor diversions are revving up. Every June, a dogged group of jocks clamber over 20 mud-covered obstacles during the Tough Mudder race on Mount Snow. Cyclists careen down Okemo Mountain, where the lifts can now carry bikes. Alpine slides zip down the face of Bromley Mountain, a small ski resort whose Bromley Fun Zone was a pioneer of mountain summer activities in the 1970s. Bromley\u2019s Aerial Adventure Park strings five courses of zip lines and obstacles through the treetops, at challenge-levels that range from child-friendly to adult-terrifying.Weekenders not up for mud-covered obstacles or zip-lining can opt for small-town culture and style instead. Siblings Tim and Tyne Daly are on stage together for the first time at the Dorset Theatre Festival this season. The rambling Northshire Bookstore in Manchester hides a treehouse reading nook for children and a clothing section of flowing hippie caftans among the new, used and rare books. The Armani Outlet in Manchester offers Armani Black Label and Collection items for as low as 90% off (I have the fur coat to prove it). The only Marimekko outlet in America is down the street.Traditionally, all this fun hasn\u2019t been matched with sophisticated places to stay and eat, but no longer. The region\u2019s first modern fine-dining option, SoLo Farm & Table, in the small town of Londonderry, about 20 minutes north of Stratton, opened in 2011. It was an act of madness or kismet by Chloe and Wesley Genovart, a young married couple who were both working in the restaurant industry in New York City, she as the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at Manhattan\u2019s Per Se, and Wesley as the chef at cult-following tapas bar Degustation. On a trip to visit Ms. Genovart\u2019s parents in Manchester, the couple impulse-bought an 18th-century farmhouse at a foreclosure sale.Now it\u2019s the kind of destination restaurant people plan their weekends around, with a seasonal menu sourced from nearby farms and enhanced by SoLo\u2019s own gardens. Last year, the couple debuted a second restaurant, Honeypie, on Route 30 just past the Stratton Access Road, turning a \u201crundown, nasty gas station\u201d into an industrial-styled family place for burgers and sausage rolls, using high-quality, whole-animal ingredients. \u201cIt\u2019s a burger joint, but a badass burger joint,\u201d Ms. Genovart said.The Downtown Grocery, a bit further north in Ludlow, is also a farm-to-table spot, and on a recent visit had a notably mixed crowd of old men in seersucker and young people with beards and tattoos. The Williamsville Eatery, established in 2014 by a father-son team in Williamsville, a white-clapboard small town, extols its farm-fresh ingredients, too, along with craft beers and small-batch wines in a dining room that was once the town\u2019s general store.Another local culinary trend is the elevation of ye-olde-taverns, whose dank interiors and questionable attempts at modernization are legendary in this part of Vermont. At the White House Tavern, the restaurant at the Hermitage Club\u2019s graceful, century-old White House Inn in downtown Wilmington, diners dip fries into bone-marrow mayo and nibble on pigs ears from nearby Ephraim Farm. The Cask & Kiln Kitchen is also in Wilmington, but the dining room, with its exposed wood and filament lights, looks like it could be in Manhattan, as does the upstairs bar, known for its cocktails. The Taconic Hotel\u2019s Copper Grouse serves updated classics like cheddar-ale soup and cider-brined chicken in a room that quotes tavern style with wood paneling and cozy wallpaper. In the summers, you can dine al fresco on the hotel porch, another Vermont tradition.\u2018Another culinary trend is the elevation of ye-olde-taverns.\u2019The owners of the two-year-old Homestyle Hostel in Ludlow have done a hip update of a different traditional concept, this one the skiier-focused hostel, popular in Europe but uncommon in New England. Like their friends the Genovarts, Eliza Greene and boyfriend Justin Hyjek, were just visiting the area when they came across a deal they couldn\u2019t refuse on an 1832 doctor\u2019s residence with a horse stable on Ludlow\u2019s charming main street. Five months later, they opened the doors on clean and serene bunk-style lodging (some private rooms available) with a good restaurant. The couple recently bought the motel across the street, and plan to renovate and relaunch it in 2018 with a cocktail bar.Even for visitors with no intention of opening businesses in the area, the allure of the country-house fantasy is strong and getting stronger. \u201cOver the past three years I\u2019ve seen a tremendous number of people buy and gut-renovate houses here,\u201d said Ms. Dennes. \u201cYou can still get a good deal but I don\u2019t know how much longer that\u2019s going to last.\u201d Longtime locals laugh at this. I have to laugh myself, since the farmhouse our family bought needed a new foundation and a new roof and certainly didn\u2019t feel like a bargain by the end. Still, these small towns and country lanes are so idyllic, you can\u2019t help but eye the \u201cfor sale\u201d signs in yards as you pass by. These might be famous last words, but there\u2019s no harm in looking.Staying ThereEating There", "news_time": "2017-06-29 11:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-discreetly-fashionable-getaway-in-new-england-1498751252", "news_title": "A Discreetly Fashionable Getaway in New England", "keywords": "best hotels and restaurants in southern vermont,best vermont restaurants,buying a house in vermont,guide to southern vermont,stylish country inns,things to do in vermont,vermont family getaways,vermont farmhouse ,vermont hotels,vermont vacation ,vermont weekend,what to do in southern vermont,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury travel,travel"}, {"content": "Some laws of economics are so obvious that they require hundreds of papers to prove, and a classic example is the minimum wage, which increases the cost of labor and in most cases prices some workers out of jobs. Fresh evidence comes from Seattle\u2019s minimum-wage climb to a $15 an hour.A study from researchers at the University of Washington published in the National Bureau of Economic Research looked at how Seattle\u2019s minimum-wage increase in 2016 to $13 an hour from $11 affected low-wage workers. The results? Hours worked fell 9%\u20143.5 million hours a quarter\u2014and low-wage employees lost $125 a month on average.Let that sink in: A campaign predicated on giving workers a raise lowered paychecks. The increase to $13 from $11 also \u201cyielded more substantial disemployment effects\u201d than an earlier jump to $11 from $9.47, the study found.Note that Seattle\u2019s minimum will continue to rise to $15, with varying deadlines for small and large businesses. Later increases will almost certainly be more damaging, as businesses try to absorb costs by automating more tasks or raising prices for consumers. As for workers, some may even ask for reduced hours: Benefits like Medicaid phase out as income rises, which means a worker\u2019s next dollar of income can be taxed above 100%.The labor unions underwriting the Fight for $15 campaign have activated the phone trees to impugn the study\u2019s credibility. Proponents of the increase point to a report released last week from the University of California-Berkeley that purported to find no adverse effects from Seattle\u2019s move. Yet the Washington study relied on sophisticated and detailed data about hours and earning, while Berkeley deployed the restaurant industry as a proxy.One political subplot: Last week wage and employment expert       Michael Saltsman      wondered why Seattle Mayor Ed Murray\u2019s office was pumping the Berkeley report when the city had commissioned its own studies from the Washington researchers. According to reporting in the Seattle Weekly, the mayor\u2019s office knew the damning report was coming. Berkeley scholars were offered an advance copy to rebut the claims. This looks more like coordinating press releases than honestly addressing the Seattle evidence.Other attempts to avoid reality include complaints that the study did not adequately control for Seattle\u2019s booming labor market, which liberals say is displacing low-wage jobs for better opportunities. The study did include a control, and this is the tension for the left: Wages are growing so fast in Seattle that the government needs to intervene to increase them?Still another progressive impulse is to say that perhaps $15 an hour is too disruptive to the labor market, but with more data the government can pinpoint the precise wage that benefits workers. That would certainly raise the demand for labor consultants and Berkeley professors, if not for waiters. The real and eternal lesson is that political wage-setting hurts the least skilled and lowest-paid workers, as the evidence in Seattle shows.Correction: A previous version of this editorial misspelled the name of Seattle\u2019s mayor.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 11:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/seattle-workers-pay-for-the-minimum-wage-1498692030", "news_title": "Seattle Workers Pay for the Minimum Wage", "keywords": "labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,general labor issues,minimum wage,editorials"}, {"content": "Sycamore Partnersintends to split             Staples Inc.        SPLS 0.10%       into three to help fund its $6.9 billion purchase of the office-supply seller, in another sign of the challenges facing the retail industry.The plan calls for Staples to be divided into three separately financed\u00a0entities, according to people familiar with the matter: U.S. retail; Canadian retail; and corporate-supply businesses. The three groups will remain under the same corporate umbrella.The move is designed to make the leveraged buyout of Staples, announced Wednesday, an easier sell to bond and loan investors whose appetite for retail names has soured as the industry\u2019s prospects have waned. Their appetite will be crucial to financing the deal, the largest LBO announced this year.UBS AG        UBS 0.68%      ,             Bank of America Corp.        BAC 0.67%       and other Wall Street banks plan to arrange bonds and loans backing only the Staples unit that distributes paper, pens and other supplies to large business and government customers, the people said. The delivery operation is the largest and seen as the crown jewel of Staples.Sycamore plans to help fund the Canadian retail business with debt from asset manager             KKR        KKR 1.62%       & Co., the people said.             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co. will finance the U.S. retail segment with a loan backed by the chain\u2019s assets, they said.Sycamore\u2019s approach to breaking up Staples into different businesses and financing them separately is similar to the private-equity firm\u2019s deal to buy another beleaguered retailer, Jones Group Inc., in 2014. After Sycamore bought Jones, it split the company into four independent operating entities: Nine West, Jones New York, Kasper Group and a jeans company. It also took two Jones brands\u2014Stuart Weitzman and Kurt Geiger\u2014and made them into other independent companies. Sycamore later sold Stuart Weitzman to handbag maker             Coach Inc.       and Kurt Geiger to private-equity firm Cinven.\u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this articleWrite to Matt Jarzemsky at matthew.jarzemsky@wsj.com and Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 11:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sycamore-plans-to-split-staples-into-three-1498749012", "news_title": "Sycamore Plans to Split Staples Into Three", "keywords": " lbo,office supplies,pe deals,purchase, staples, sycamore,Staples,SPLS,Sycamore Partners,UBS Group,UBS,Bank of America,BAC,KKR &,KKR,Wells Fargo &,WFC,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,book,office supplies stores,gift stores,specialty stores,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,credit,financial services,integrated banks,investing,securities"}, {"content": "United Parcel Service Inc.        UPS 1.04%       uses jumbo jets, hybrid electric vans and, sometimes, drones to deliver nearly 5 billion packages each year. But a push into a less glamorous transportation method\u2014golf carts\u2014has touched a nerve with drivers in one of its home bases.Starting Thursday, UPS can use golf carts to deliver packages in Kentucky thanks to a new state law allowing delivery drivers to use the vehicles on public roads. The company plans to use retrofitted golf carts to complement its fleet of brown delivery trucks primarily during the winter holidays, when daily volumes can rise two-thirds from normal levels.But union leaders, who had opposed the legislation, argue that having the vehicles share the road with cars and trucks puts workers at risk. They also object because at UPS golf cart drivers earn less than traditional truck drivers.\u201cThey\u2019re just looking to pay the drivers less at the expense of the safety,\u201d said       James DeWeese,        a member of Teamsters Local 89, which represents UPS drivers in Kentucky.UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said the carts undergo a major face-lift from the ones spotted on fairways. The vehicles will have turn signals, seat belts and a emblem designating it a slow-moving vehicle.\u201cThe safety of our [workers] always comes first and we will not operate in conditions that are determined to be unsafe,\u201d Mr. Zaccara said.UPS, which has its main WorldPort package sorting hub in Louisville and is the state\u2019s second-largest employer behind             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       lobbied for the law, which passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate by roughly two-to-one margins.The golf carts, which \u200bare modified with a flatbed or pull a trailer containing the packages, will be driven by part-time workers. The carts generally don\u2019t go faster than 15 miles an hour and will only be allowed to be operate in residential areas and on public roadways with a posted speed limit of 35 miles an hour or less.Mr. Zaccara said using golf carts will give UPS more flexibility during the holidays than having to buy new delivery trucks or vans. The electric golf carts can travel between 25 and 40 miles on a single charge, UPS said.Controlling costs is a major issue at both UPS and             FedEx Corp.      , which have taken steps to optimize driver routes through routing systems, automate more sorting facilities and deliver more packages to drop-off points like stores.Mr. DeWeese said part-time workers driving golf carts made about $15 an hour, versus a starting rate of $18.75 an hour for Kentucky drivers behind the wheel of a truck or van. Most drivers in Kentucky make the maximum hourly rate of a little more than $35 after four years.\u2018They\u2019re just looking to pay the drivers less at the expense of the safety.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s just an eroding of full time employment for people that need it,\u201d Democratic State Rep.       Rick Nelson       said.Mr. Zaccara said UPS\u2019s goal was to find the most efficient way to \u201cprocess the near double average daily package volume we experience during our peak season\u201d in November and December.UPS has a number of unique delivery methods to accommodate local quirks, including horse-drawn carriages on Michigan\u2019s Mackinac Island and gondolas in Venice, Italy.In the U.S., the delivery company\u2019s national labor contract does allow for golf-cart deliveries. One sentence in the 184-page document states: \u201cGolf cart usage will comply with applicable federal, state and local regulations.\u201dThat provision was largely unobjectionable when the contract was ratified in 2013, said Mr. DeWeese, as it was inserted to accommodate deliveries in communities in places like Florida where golf carts are the primary mode of transportation.The issue comes several months ahead of when the national Teamsters union is expected to begin negotiations with UPS over its next contract.

Even the league\u2019s executives relied on his website, CBA FAQ, for Coon\u2019s translation of the labor deal into plain English.But something has changed in recent years. NBA obsessives have become fluent in the language of the CBA. They study each team\u2019s salary-cap situation so carefully that \u201croom mid-level exception\u201d is a term that rolls off the tongue. This area of expertise is no longer only the peculiar interest of a guy working in a university\u2019s IT department.\u201cEvery fan who really follows the league knows this,\u201d Coon said.That knowledge is the result of this odd development: The opening of free agency on July 1, an event that starts at midnight on the Saturday morning of a long holiday weekend and takes place almost entirely on Twitter, has become one of the most anticipated NBA events of the year.The NBA off-season now gets as much attention as the NBA season itself.There were about 652,000 tweets per day related to the NBA during the last regular season, but that number was 800,000 per day between July 1 and July 10, according to Twitter data reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The volume of tweets during free agency, in fact, is roughly equal to the volume of tweets in the playoffs until the Finals. That\u2019s how popular this period between games has become. Only the biggest event of the NBA season is bigger online than the NBA off-season.Source: TwitterThis week has already been a case study in the insanity of free agency even though free agency hasn\u2019t technically begun yet.In the early hours of Wednesday morning, for example, the New York Knicks cut ties with Phil Jackson, a seismic move ending the failed marriage of a marquee franchise and legendary basketball figure. And the news was overshadowed by noon. By then the Houston Rockets were on their way to trading seven players, one first-round draft pick and enough \u201ccash considerations\u201d to buy hundreds of thousands of tacos in exchange for star point guard Chris Paul.\u201cIt\u2019s a weapons race in the NBA,\u201d Houston general manager Daryl Morey said. \u201cYou\u2019re either in the weapons race, or you\u2019re on the sidelines.\u201dIn this one dramatic move were all the elements that have transformed modern NBA free agency into a spectacle.There were gobs of money\u2014as much as $200 million for Paul if he re-signs with Houston next summer. There was the salary-cap parkour required to maneuver the rules and exceptions to the league\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d cap that analysts like Coon have explained. There was even the star player flexing power, taking control of his situation and teaming with another star player.Paul moving to the Rockets was essentially the same as memorable events from recent summers like Kevin Durant signing with the Warriors, LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers and DeAndre Jordan being subjected to emoji warfare. It was an event that didn\u2019t seem plausible until it happened.So what else might happen this summer?There are reasons to believe this year\u2019s market won\u2019t be so frothy. The three most tweeted moments of last year\u2019s free agency, according to Twitter, were Durant joining the Golden State Warriors;       Dwyane Wade       signing with the Chicago Bulls; and the Los Angeles Lakers endowing Timofey Mozgov with $64 million over four years. They also showed why that summer was an extraordinary anomaly.A one-time spike in the salary cap gave NBA teams fat stacks of cash to spend however they wanted. The result was total chaos. The ones that whiffed on star players spent remaining money on role players who had the good fortune of being free agents at the richest time in NBA history.But there are now fewer teams with cap space and fewer players worth the splurge. A blockbuster trade this summer is more likely than a big signing.The marquee free agents most likely to change teams and shape the title race are Gordon Hayward and Blake Griffin. But even if one of them leaves for a team like Boston\u2014and even if the Celtics pair him with a rental of the Pacers\u2019 Paul George, who is pushing to escape Indiana\u2014they still wouldn\u2019t be the overwhelming favorite to win next year\u2019s championship. Hayward and Griffin are really good players who\u2019d make Boston a really good team. They\u2019re not Kevin Durant.But it\u2019s still a good idea to use the next 10 days expecting the unexpected\u2014because all it takes is a single decision to send the entire league scrambling.One unexpected free agent to watch is a player who doesn\u2019t become a free agent until next summer, Russell Westbrook, the recently crowned MVP, who can sign an extremely lucrative extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder as soon as Saturday morning. If he accepts, Oklahoma City could build around Westbrook for the next six years, and             Christian Dior                   could open a boutique in Oklahoma City knowing it\u2019d have a reliable customer.But nobody knows what happens if Westbrook declines. It could trigger a series of trades that reshapes the NBA.What makes free agency especially absorbing this year is the way every roster piece fits into a tricky financial puzzle. The NBA is currently straddling two labor deals that value players at different scales. Among the players who signed deals last year that paid them more this year than Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were Allen Crabbe, Joakim Noah, Luol Deng, Evan Fournier and Bismack Biyombo.That wasn\u2019t because they were better. (They weren\u2019t.) It was simply because the market rate for players mushroomed. Everyone is now expensive. There are fewer bargains to be found, and teams have even more incentive to not be wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s such a big jump in cap from all the TV money,\u201d Coon said, \u201cthat you can divide it into the old-world economy and new-world economy.\u201dWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   There were about 652,000 tweets related to the NBA per day in the 2016-2017 regular season.

But Israel\u2019s highest court in December 2015 reduced his sentence after acquitting him of some of the charges.Mr. Olmert is the first Israeli prime minister to serve time in prison, and his case shook an Israeli public unaccustomed to seeing its leaders jailed. Mr. Olmert denied the charges against him, which stemmed from his time as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 until 2003.Despite the successful prosecution of the ex-premier, allegations of corruption in politics and business remain common in Israel.The current prime minister,       Benjamin Netanyahu,        is currently the subject of two investigations, one over whether he received unlawful gifts while in office and another over whether he tried to negotiate favorable coverage with a top Israeli newspaper. Mr. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing in both cases.Last week, Israel\u2019s securities authority raided the offices of a major telecoms firm as part of an investigation of fraud and alleged improprieties by executives.Israel is ranked 28 out of 176 countries on the Transparency International watch list of corruption, better than European Union members Poland and Portugal but behind the United Arab Emirates.In the case of Mr. Olmert, he and other top-ranking public officials in the Jerusalem municipality were convicted of accepting bribes from real-estate developers to make way for the construction a six-tower property project.In another high-profile criminal case at the time,       Moshe Katsav       was forced in 2007 to step down as president after he was accused of rape and sexual harassment. He began serving a seven-year prison sentence in 2011 and was released last year after serving five years. Israel\u2019s president is a largely ceremonial position, while the prime minister is the top official in government.Mr. Olmert became prime minister in 2006 with the Kadima party after then-leader       Ariel Sharon       suffered a debilitating stroke.

Baird & Co. in Reston, Va. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.While the S&P 500 has done well since November, there has been a lot of dispersion\u2014that is, some sectors of the market doing well while others struggle. What\u2019s more, in a number of cases these trends have changed direction several times. This environment has made a case for value investing, buying companies or sectors that are trading at a discount to their long-term intrinsic value.Consumer-staples stocks, for example, suffered initially for the most part after the U.S. election. Fears over protectionist trade policy and higher interest rates led some of the best companies in the world to trade at 52-week lows. That proved to be a significant buying opportunity as the sector has since recaptured its lofty valuation premium.Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks presented similar opportunities; prevailing rhetoric around policy drove valuations in some cases to the lowest levels in several years, even if fundamentals weren\u2019t necessarily weak. Many names in the sector still offer appeal, and valuations for the most part are close to historical norms, while the broad market trades at its most expensive valuation since 2004.True value investing is about more than simply picking the cheapest stock available; it\u2019s about understanding the fundamentals of a company and why a temporary dislocation in valuation could be overturned through the reversal of any number of headwinds.A good example of that phenomenon is today\u2019s financial sector. During the first few months after the election, financials performed very well, but a year ago, you couldn\u2019t give those stocks away. Regulatory constraints and low interest rates caused a contraction in profit margins and hurt financial companies\u2019 ability to pay dividends. Despite those conditions, many value investors saw that those companies were still performing well below their long-term earning potential and that changes to policy or economic climate would change that. Those investors were rewarded for their patience.So far this year, the sector has traded softly as much higher interest rates haven\u2019t yet materialized, nor has the expectation for a less restrictive regulatory environment. This shift in consensus may once again be providing a buying opportunity for long-term investors.If you look back over the past 50 years, you see alternating periods in which growth and value stocks have outperformed relative to each other. And until 2016, growth led the way for six consecutive years. I think the reason for that outperformance was a confluence of limited economic and earnings growth paired with lots of liquidity and stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Liquidity and low interest rates encouraged speculation on the part of investors and people were willing to pay higher multiples for growth.That trend started to reverse at the beginning of last year when we saw better expectations for earnings growth across sectors\u2014expectations that were realized by the second half of 2016. In an environment of rising rates and increased volatility\u2014which tends to favor more-established companies\u2014I don\u2019t think that value\u2019s recent performance represents a fad, but instead the beginning of a cycle in which those stocks will do better. It\u2019s similar to what we saw from stocks coming out of the tech bubble, when value outperformed growth for just over five years.When it comes to value investing, what\u2019s most important to remember is that there is no such thing as a permanent condition. Value is ultimately where you find it. Any stock or sector can be a value as long as you feel you\u2019re getting it at the right price.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 11:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/value-investing-it-can-pay-to-find-your-price-and-strike-1498749547", "news_title": "Value Investing: It Can Pay to Find Your Price and Strike", "keywords": "Simon Hamilton,analysts' comments,recommendations,corporate,industrial news,banking,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Responding to complaints from outraged consumers, American Airlineshas reversed its decision to reduce the space between some coach seats in new planes to as little as 29 inches from 31 inches. The airline now realizes that such a reduction in size would be cruel, heartless, verging on the sadistic. So, in an act of enormous clemency, the airline says that it will merely slash the space between seats by an eensy-teensy inch, to 30. Satisfied?Anyone who has recently flown in coach knows that flying is one of the least pleasant experiences known to man. If you are taller than 4 feet 10 inches, you will spend the entire trip in excruciating discomfort. This is also true if you weigh more than 135 pounds. Reducing the space between seats by only an inch and then acting like it is some sort of magnanimous gesture just goes to show what fabulous contempt airlines feel for their customers.Inspired by American Airlines\u2019 chutzpah, other industries may soon adopt a similar strategy of announcing plans to make a disliked or overpriced product even more expensive or painful and then relenting\u2014partially.For example: A company sets up its tech-support line to inform customers that due to unusually high call volumes, the average wait will be between 45 minutes and three years. The public goes nuts. The chastened firm then says: \u201cYou\u2019re right. A 45-minute wait to talk to an inept, unsympathetic rep with an attitude after being forced to listen to static-filled, inane smooth jazz is outrageous. From now on, the average wait will be 44 minutes. And as a bonus, we\u2019ll promise that the rep can speak English.\u201dBut why should this ingenious brand of bait-and-switch stop at airlines and electronics? Rock musicians, responding to criticism that a 19-minute guitar solo on \u201cFree Bird\u201d will drive patrons into the street, graciously agree to scale it back to 16.5 minutes. Hotels say that they\u2019re raising the price of a microscopic bag of minibar peanuts to $12, then say: \u201cOur bad. Make it a nice round $11.50.\u201d Scalpers decide that the price of a ticket to Hamilton\u2014which they had been thinking about jacking up to $1,000, plus the ticket buyer\u2019s firstborn child\u2014will now cost the far more generous price of $999.99. And they\u2019re fine with the second-born child.Maybe it\u2019s time to fight back. We can start with planes. From now on, we are no longer waiting until the first-class passengers are seated before we board the plane. We\u2019re boarding the plane now, and we\u2019re sitting wherever we damn well please. We paid for our crummy, uncomfortable seats, and we want to get as much use out of them as we can.And, dear airline, since you have such a deplorable attitude about the seating, we\u2019ll have a deplorable attitude about everything else. Starting today, we are spilling chocolate all over the seats, smearing honey inside the overhead compartments and crumbling the stale dwarf pretzels all over the carpet. Does that mean it\u2019s going to take a few extra hours to get the plane cleaned and ready for the next flight? Boohoo.Finally, if you take away that extra inch of space on your Procrustean aircraft, we\u2019re going to start sticking our feet in the aisles and leaving them there until we land in Sydney.

Macroeconomic Advisers on Thursday projected a 3.3% GDP growth rate for the spring quarter and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model earlier this week predicted 2.9% growth.The U.S. government will release its first official estimate for second-quarter GDP on July 28.\u201cFollowing a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded, resulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       saidin mid-June.The economic expansion that began in July 2009 is already the third-longest growth run in U.S. history. Only the expansions of the 1960s and 1990s were longer, and forecasters surveyed in early June by The Wall Street Journal on average saw just a 16% probability of a new recession beginning within the next year.Despite its longevity, the current expansion has been disappointingly weak, with GDP growth averaging just 2.1% a year. That is weaker than any other recovery since at least 1949. Still, the unemployment rate has continued to decline, hitting 4.3% in May\u2014its lowest level in 16 years.Some prominent economists think the recent slow growth reflects trends that emerged years before the 2007-09 recession: the end of an information technology-fueled productivity boom, and a decline in labor-force participation driven by demographic and other forces.The U.S. experienced \u201ca very deep recession superimposed on a sharply slowing trend,\u201d and it took time for forecasters to fully appreciate how much the underlying trend had slowed, said       John Fernald,        senior research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Looking forward, he said, subdued productivity gains and slow growth in the size of the workforce may continue to weigh on overall growth.\u201cWe can hope for better, but the headwinds are fierce,\u201d Mr. Fernald said.President       Donald Trump       has said he wants to boost growth above 3% a year by overhauling the tax system, rolling back regulations and enacting other policies. But the prospects for legislation remain uncertain, even with a Republican-controlled Congress, and many economists have warned it will be difficult to boost growth so much in a sustained fashion.Grand Rapids, Mich.-based office-furniture company             Steelcase Inc.       last week reported orders in the Americas fell 3% from a year earlier in the three months ended May 26. Chief Executive       James Keane       told analysts that uncertainty about U.S. government policy may be causing some companies to delay projects.\u201cIf you\u2019re in the health-care industry, you might be curious about what\u2019s going to happen as that gets unveiled, and how does that shape your investments,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in growing and you need to hire workers in the U.S., you might be interested in immigration reform.\u2026If you\u2019re interested in spending some of your repatriated cash, you\u2019re interested in tax reform.\u201dThe upward revision to first-quarter GDP growth in Thursday\u2019s report reflected stronger exports and consumer spending on services like health care, offset in part by weaker business investment in structures. Other revisions were largely minor.The economy\u2019s broad contours remained unchanged from prior estimates. Consumer spending slowed from late 2016 while business investment accelerated in the first quarter, and overall growth slowed from the fourth quarter\u2019s 2.1% pace.First-quarter growth figures have repeatedly disappointed in recent years, prompting economists to warn that seasonal-adjustment problems may be causing distortions.

A mound of arugula and fresh basil goes on top, along with some tangy peperonata, the sweet-sour stew of red and yellow bell peppers cooked in olive oil. Boiled new potatoes and pieces of thinly sliced ham ring the plate.Typically, peperonata calls for slow stewing, but here Mr. Satterfield streamlines the process so the peppers get just a quick fry in olive oil before steeping in a vinegar bath.

When Monohaus opens in October, prices will start at about \u00a3500,000, or about $635,000, for a one-bedroom apartment ranging up to around $1.78 million for a three-bedroom penthouse.\u201cI hate the term hipster but I suppose that is who it is aimed at,\u201d said       David Pollock,        a director of Union Developments. \u201cIt is the generation involved in startups or who works in the City,\u201d London\u2019s nearby financial district.Mr. Pollock anticipates his buyers will range in age from their early 20s to mid-40s, and added that the company won\u2019t actively look for either investor landlords or overseas owners.\u201cWe want the place to have life,\u201d he said.In the Notting Hill neighborhood of West London, building permits were issued earlier this month for apartments in a Victorian-era building renamed Sartoria House. The facade will feature a 7-by-14-foot work by the street artist Banksy that was salvaged from the side of the building. The developer, Enstar Capital, plans to protect the piece, \u201cThe Painter,\u201d which it says is worth $2.9 million, with bulletproof glass.Sartoria House, which will also include restaurants around an open-air piazza, is expected to be completed late next year. Rental apartments will start at about $1,300 a week.The move toward homes geared at hipsters comes at a challenging time for luxury London property. Since 2014, the prime market has quieted thanks to a mixture of tax increases, Brexit and domestic political upheaval. New developments continue to go on the market, and developments started in around 2014 are coming to completion. Many early buyers are attempting to \u201cflip\u201d their purchases on to new owners. Discounting has become the norm, with buyers able to knock 5% or 6% of asking prices, said Nick Parr, a director at Knight Frank and specialist in new homes.This glut of luxury homes means developers are now changing tack, targeting the young, fashionable and solvent rather than the super wealthy, and focusing on east London, where prices are lower than in prime neighborhoods.\u201cWhere we used to see massive gyms and sky lounges we are now seeing tech as the driver,\u201d said Mr. Parr. \u201cA main reason is that service charges were getting very, very high and people were getting nervous about paying them.\u201dMr. Parr said many developers are opting for a \u201cwarehouse-style\u201d aesthetic, prioritizing super high-speed broadband and bicycle parking over spas and swimming pools. Another popular\u2014and economical\u2014offering is dedicated apps for residents to communicate with neighbors, posting events and creating a community feel.Developers are also curating the retail units they allow onto their sites.\u201cGround-floor uses drive residential values more than anything else,\u201d said Mr. Parr. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to live in a building with a         Starbucks               underneath. What they want is a cafe serving craft beer and artisanal bread.\u201dIn Deptford, a trendy neighborhood in southeast London, residents at Childers Street, a former propeller factory, converted into 83 rental apartments have a coffee hangout and bar, an on-site movie theater with regular film nights, communal workspaces and a communal roof terrace.The apartments themselves feature high ceilings, huge windows and industrial styling, along with integrated Sonos music systems.\u201cWe did a lot of research, speaking to 20 and 30 year olds, and the feedback was loud and clear,\u201d said       Jamie Lester,        group marketing director.Childers Street opened in mid-June, with rents starting at about $1,700 a month for a one-bedroom apartment to $2,750 a month for a three-bedroom unit\u2014prices that the developer, Vive Living, says are comparable to area rents.\u201cWe are seeing this sort of thing more and more,\u201d said Jason Margetts, head of east London residential development at         Savills.       Developers are looking at \u201cquality amenities like an artisan bread maker, a really good barista, which might not already exist in an up-and-coming area.\u201dThis market showed its muscle at Deptford Market Yard, a development close to Childers Street that opened late last year.

Yet she says she rarely finds ticks on her two pet dogs.A self-described \u201cprofessional chicken enthusiast,\u201d Ms. Steele is convinced that is because her 10 barnyard hens, including Truffle, a Chocolate Orpington that resembles a \u201cbig Hershey kiss,\u201d eat every bug in sight. Their search-and-destroy tactic involves scratching and pecking their way through grass and mulch looking for anything that moves, she says.Two American traditions are colliding this summer. One involves people like Ms. Steele keeping yardbirds for their eggs or meat as part of a move toward local and organic food. The other is a nation convulsing with fear of Lyme disease. The chick people think they have the solution to the tick problem\u2014even if there is little science to support it.The bloodsucking critters have always been a concern, but a mild winter and swelling populations of tick-carrying deer and mice have led to one of the worst tick seasons in years, scientists say. The Northeast, especially, is overrun.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are more than 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. a year, three times the rate two decades ago. Public attention around tick-borne illnesses, including one that leaves victims allergic to red meat, is mounting.\u201cChemical bug spray is not the answer,\u201d Ms. Steele said. \u201cYou want the natural predators.\u201dThe CDC advises people to take lots of precautions to avoid getting bitten by ticks, from staying away from tall grass to creating a barrier of wood chips between lawns and wooded areas. The CDC declined comment on the use of chickens, saying that was out of its \u201carea of expertise.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need a study if we know experientially it works,\u201d said Steven Bibula, a Maine farmer whose chickens are flying off the shelves as New Englanders \u201cterrified\u201d of ticks come knocking. Mr. Bibula said the breeds he sells for tick control are the \u201celite forces of the chicken world,\u201d light-bodied and naturally wary of predators.Fayetteville, N.Y., last September approved a proposal that lets residents keep up to a dozen backyard chickens. The town of about 4,400, which borders an upstate New York park, has been battling the tick menace for years. There have been instances of children getting Lyme disease just from playing in their backyards, officials say.Fayetteville has experimented with hiring sharpshooters to take down deer. Chickens were added to the list of tick-fighting options after a resident bugged them about it. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want all of our eggs in one basket,\u201d said Lorie Corsette, the village clerk.While residents are happy about the option, Ms. Corsette said the town had received just one application for a chicken permit as of this week.Gluttonous appetites and undiscerning palates make chickens especially good at foraging for all kinds of bugs, grubs, fleas and ticks.Chickens \u201ccan be very aggressive when it comes to their food,\u201d said Erin Hull, a farmer who recently gave a presentation on chicken-keeping to Fayetteville residents. \u201cIf anything moves, a chicken will attack it.\u201dPatricia Foreman, who wrote the book \u201cCity Chicks: Employing Chickens as Garden Helpers, Compost Creators, Bio-recyclers and Local Food Suppliers,\u201d says chickens are \u201ceasier to maintain than cats,\u201d requiring little more than a clean coop, fresh water and regular routine.She loves chickens so much that she sometimes ends phone calls by saying, \u201cMay the flock be with you.\u201dNorth Hempstead, N.Y., has hatched a different plan. It will release about 25 Northern Bobwhite quails, native to the area, into the woods surrounding the community. Quails also eat ticks and officials hope that will help reduce the scourge.Quails, however, are known to fly their coops, so they don\u2019t make for good backyard foragers.The idea that barnyard birds could be stand-ins for other, more proven methods of tick control is ruffling some feathers.\u201cTo say I have a chicken and therefore won\u2019t get Lyme, that is dangerous,\u201d said Lee Ann Sporn, a biologist who teaches at Paul Smith\u2019s College in the Adirondacks.Ms. Sporn said at least one study had found that wild birds can host Lyme-disease-causing bacteria and didn\u2019t see why ticks would spare chickens, which are also known to carry certain parasites. \u201cInappropriate human-domestic fowl interactions\u201d could lead to other human health problems, she added.Timothy Driscoll, an assistant professor at West Virginia University who studies tick-borne microbes, said there are few studies of scientific rigor on the subject, and they all focus on guinea fowl\u2014a noisier alternative to chickens.Although those studies provide some evidence guineas could potentially eat enough adult Lyme-infected ticks to reduce their population, these birds appear to have little effect on nymph ticks, each the size of a poppy seed, which are a bigger threat to humans, he added.\u201cOpossums, on the other hand, are the real deal,\u201d Mr. Driscoll said about the marsupial\u2019s appetite for ticks. \u201cUnfortunately, they tend to wander into roadways and get killed.\u201dAlex Devoy, a college sophomore who helps out on a Lakewood, N.J., farm, says guineas can eat hundreds of ticks a day. \u201cThe number of tick bites on farmworkers is much less than that of last year, when we didn\u2019t have the guineas free-ranging.\u201dDairy farmer Keith England keeps 15 guineas on his 5-acre property in Williamsburg, Pa., specifically for tick control. When his flock dwindled, the eight-legged critters came back quickly, he says, so he began rebuilding his bird patrol.However, guineas startle easily and squawk loudly. Guineas \u201cdon\u2019t get along with the UPS man or guests or the dog,\u201d said Mr. Bibula, the Maine farmer.Will Neide, a medical technologist, said he\u2019s considering chickens for his Hershey, Pa., property, which is partly wooded. He became concerned about ticks after seeing greater numbers in recent months and having to institute a nightly tick check for his four children.\u201cWorst case is I get eggs and a dinner out of them.\u201dWrite to Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 10:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-of-2017s-pecking-order-for-tick-eradication-chickens-1498746413", "news_title": "Got Ticks?

Even with the payout, the mortgage insurer said its capital levels remain in accordance with regulatory requirement imposed by Canada\u2019s bank watchdog, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and are enough to offset risks on its books.Canada\u2019s Finance Minister       Bill Morneau       said in a statement the dividend reflects \u201chow well CMHC is managing its mortgage-loan insurance and securitization business.\u201dCMHC raised its premiums earlier this year to comply with rules from OSFI that require mortgage insurers to hold bigger capital cushions for home loans in frothy markets.According to its first-quarter financial report, CMHC has on its books C$502 billion of insurance policies in force as of March 31. Under Canada\u2019s housing regime, mortgage insurance is generally required of anyone buying a home with a down payment of less than 20%.

Shares tumbled 22% to $9.65, levels not seen since before the spotlight was fixed on the company by the merger.The early version of the Walgreens-Rite Aid tie-up would have more than doubled the size of Fred\u2019s, which owned about 650 stores and had a market capitalization of roughly $400 million before the December announcement of its involvement in the deal. Shares in Fred\u2019s skyrocketed 81% when news broke about its plans to acquire 865 additional stores for $950 million, financed by pledging nearly all of its assets\u2014down to furniture\u2014to back some $1.65 billions in loans.\u201cWhile the acquisition of additional stores was an opportunity for growth, we always viewed it as a potential outcome that would accelerate our transformation, not define it,\u201d said       Michael Bloom,        Fred\u2019s chief executive, in prepared remarks Thursday.

Divestitures are often required in large deals to assuage concerns over market power and consolidation within specific markets and industries.U.S. regulators had to be convinced, among other concerns, that Fred\u2019s could legitimately replace the competition if Rite Aid merged with Walgreens.On Wednesday, Fred\u2019s also adopted a poison pill to limit the ability for investors such as Alden Global Capital LLC, which has a 25% stake in the company, to add to its holdings.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 241,000 new claims.\u201cNothing in these numbers suggests that the labor market is slackening,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.Estimates of jobless claims can be volatile from week to week, but generally have hovered near four-decade lows in recent months, suggesting that employers are holding on to workers.The four-week moving average of initial claims, which evens out weekly volatility, decreased last week to 242,250.The number of claims drawn by workers for longer than a week\u2014so-called continuing claims\u2014grew 6,000 to 1.948 million in the week ended June 17, the fourth consecutive week-over-week increase.

To look forward to a drink at the end of another bizarre day is not a crime. So it seemed well timed when an editor at The Wall Street Journal sent me a bottle. Then I saw it was whiskey. For a long time I\u2019ve thought whiskey tastes like old socks soaked in gasoline. I had an experience with Yukon Jack at a Ramones concert in 1982 and have kept whiskey at arm\u2019s length ever since.This bottle of Nelson\u2019s First 108 Tennessee Whiskey from Nelson\u2019s Green Brier Distillery arrived along with an official history:       Charles Nelson,        age 15, set sail from Germany, together with his parents and siblings, for a new life in America. His father, John, had liquidated the family\u2019s candle- and soap-making business, converted his assets into gold and had the gold sewn into his clothing for easy transport. On the crossing, John fell overboard and drowned. The family arrived without a penny but somehow recovered. Young Charles later moved to Tennessee and became one of the largest manufacturers of whiskey in America. But the business went belly-up in 1909, following the passage of legislation prohibiting the manufacture of alcohol in Tennessee. A century later, Charles\u2019s great-great-great-grandsons, Andy and Charlie Nelson, revived the brand.That told me very little about the whiskey itself\u2014and as I\u2019ve pointed out, my experience with whiskey had been extremely limited over the last 35 years\u2014so I decided to share the bottle with someone who knows something about spirits. The guy who lives next door to me here in D.C. retired from his job at NASA at 48 and turned to woodworking. Some years later he was hired to build the interior of a tasting room for a hard-cider manufacturer in Middleburg, Va., with wood-paneled walls that rise to the copper ceiling. One day, he and the guy who owns the cidery decided to buy a still, pour cider into it and make apple brandy. Peter\u2019s been making booze there ever since. They call their cidery and distillery Mt. Defiance.I bought my house from Peter, after he renovated it with his own hands. He built our kitchen using cherry he lathed in his basement and built our dining-room table from African mahogany. I\u2019m somewhat awed that he left his first career to be a woodworker, then changed again to be a booze-maker. This kind of thing isn\u2019t for everyone, but Peter seems to know what he\u2019s doing. At NASA he helped design the International Space Station, planned shuttle missions and negotiated international agreements, including bringing Russia into the program. He studied aerospace engineering and knows chemistry, though apparently making booze isn\u2019t rocket science. You run experiments and taste things, and when those things taste good you figure out what you did right.My neighbor\u2019s house is 18 feet away from mine. My wife and daughter and I can hear Peter and his wife, Peggy, on their back porch, almost every night, talking, chortling away\u2014not what they say, but the tone. There\u2019s a sound we\u2019ve grown used to over the years: Peter\u2019s big laugh, which peppers their dinners. Ho ho ho! It\u2019s not something I discuss with Peter, but it\u2019s a good sound in the evening. Sometimes I hear his laugh and think, \u201cI\u2019m maybe not as happy as I think I am.\u201d To me, this sound means that there are people who know how to let go of their worries at the end of the day.Since Peter works most days at the distillery in Middleburg, I drove out there with the whiskey. The distillery used to be a BP gas station, and sunlight pours through walls of glass that were once garage doors. We sat in one of the old bays with the ease of friends who share a fence, exchange cat- and dog-sitting, and deal from time to time with tree maintenance and basement floods. Around us were a 10-foot-tall still made of wooden barrels, a copper still shaped like a genie\u2019s bottle, a bigger one shaped like a wizard\u2019s hat and a huge stainless-steel fermenter. The rafters were strung with drying herbs; the smell of hay, lemon balm and lavender hung in the air. On the desk sat a huge bag of corks, a scale to weigh ingredients, a hammer, a tape measure, a wirecutter.For the sake of objectivity, we decided to compare the Nelson\u2019s First 108 to another fine, handcrafted whiskey, FEW Bourbon. We sniffed, swirled and rinsed between shots. Other employees of the cidery weighed in, agreeing that one had a better nose, the other a smoother, lighter finish. Or something. For my own part I\u2019d say that, drunk straight, both whiskeys tasted like rat poison.Then Peter mixed a batch of Manhattans using the First 108 in a Pyrex pitcher filled with ice, adding bitters, a slice of orange peel and Mt. Defiance sweet vermouth. He stirred it with the handle of a knife. Vermouth, I learned, is just wine fortified with honey and herbs\u2014or, in the case of Peter\u2019s own recipe, grapefruit peel, bitter lemon, peppermint, lavender, hyssop, orris root, bitter orange peel and shiitake mushrooms. The shiitake, I was told, helped bring out the smokiness in the whiskey. The bitters were made in the \u201cCreole style,\u201d whatever that means, using cinnamon, clove and star anise. I took the first sip, kept my mouth closed, and breathed out through my nose. All sorts of divine aromas and tastes registered. The drink was dusky, tangy and sweet.We sat and blabbed about his booze business, and about our neighbors, and about the book I\u2019m about to publish. I realized then that I\u2019d been carrying around an almost unspeakable weight, one that seemed to undermine the modest, happy little life I lead next door to Peter. I\u2019d been hired to write for a TV show in L.A. and was still trying to wrap my mind around going out there to live for six months.\u201cAlone?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll fly back when I can, which might be once a month.\u201d My daughter just turned 12. Peter knows me to be a fairly attentive father. I haven\u2019t missed many bedtimes.He thought about it. Our relationship isn\u2019t the kind that normally traffics in this sort of material. \u201cWhen I was a kid, my dad went to Vietnam for a year, and he had no way to communicate with us.\u201d He thought some more. I reminded myself that I\u2019d be able to FaceTime, that going off to L.A. for a few months is not like going off to war. Peter said, \u201cHe mailed us tapes every few months and we all listened to them.\u201d\u201cLike cassette tapes?\u201d\u201cNo, reel-to-reel.\u201d I pictured his concentrated stare, watching the wheels of the reel-to-reel spin, as his father\u2019s voice came forth. We finished the pitcher, talking in a way we hadn\u2019t before.Mr. Klam\u2019s novel \u201cWho Is Rich?\u201d will be published by Random House on July 4.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 10:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-get-over-an-aversion-to-whiskey-1498745313", "news_title": "How to Get Over an Aversion to Whiskey", "keywords": "best whiskey,creole bitters,manhattan cocktail,matthew klam,mt. defiance,tennessee whiskey,vermouth ,who is rich?,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits,reviews,beverages,tobacco,distilling,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"}, {"content": "The list of celebrities who have passed through Mag Black\u2019s Los Angeles home is classic Hollywood: Frank Sinatra, Mia Farrow, Audrey Hepburn, Eva Gabor.But when the 7,000-square-foot, Georgian Colonial-style home listed this month for almost $14 million, one star took center stage:       Paul Revere Williams,        the architect. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a thing about him, but everyone ooh\u2019d and ahh\u2019d when they heard this was a Paul Williams,\u201d says Ms. Black, who recently relisted her home for $13.95 million, an 8% increase, partly due to the growing strength of the Williams pedigree.The late Mr. Williams, whose career spanned five decades and an array of architectural styles, is back in vogue\u2014and not just with the Tinseltown set. The first African-American to be admitted to the American Institute of Architects in 1923, Mr. Williams has long been revered in the city\u2019s affluent pockets for his willingness to put the client before convention, and for his attention to detail. (His biographer said she can identify a bona fide Williams by the gentle rise of the staircase.) Now a number of posthumous honors, including an AIA Gold Medal in December, which is shared by the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, have shined a brighter spotlight on the architect\u2019s work.Agents say that renewed name-recognition can translate to a premium for home sellers. In June there were six Williams-designed homes publicly listed for sale, ranging from a $2.4 million auction for a Mediterranean four-bedroom in San Clemente, Calif., to an $88 million, 30,000-square-foot remodeled mansion in Los Angeles\u2019s Holmby Hills. In 2015, one of his 1931 Spanish Colonial Revivals sold for $38 million in the posh Bel-Air neighborhood\u2014almost $19 million more than when it sold in 2011. At least two other million-dollar homes for sale are described as \u201cWilliams inspired\u201d\u2014agents say that is common practice in a town that is inclined to name-drop.\u201cI think there\u2019s a resurgence of interest in him,\u201d says Robin Collins, an agent with Keller Williams who, in May, listed a $3.2 million Mediterranean Mr. Williams built in 1926.Mr. Williams, a Los Angeles native whose first luxury-home commissions began in the 1920s, designed over 2,000 private homes across the globe, about 300 of which are located in Los Angeles\u2019s so-called Platinum Triangle neighborhoods, says Karen Elyse Hudson, Mr. Williams\u2019s granddaughter and biographer. He died in 1980 at the age of 85.Mr. Williams amassed an impressive clientele, including Lucille Ball, Lon Chaney and Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson, thanks in part to his willingness to work in whatever style his client demanded, Ms. Hudson says.In an era of deeply held prejudice, he learned to draw renderings upside down, he wrote in an 1937 article, so as to never force his white patrons to sit beside him. Today his homes are prized for their intricate detailing and elegant proportions\u2014two qualities that have spared many of his homes from the wrecking ball of new-home developers.\u201cHe could see forward and around corners,\u201d says Ms. Black, 73, a wealth manager who owns the 1938 Georgian Colonial in Holmby Hills. She bought the home for $2.1 million in 1996, records show. Unlike many homes of that era, the 7,000-square-foot home has taller, 9-foot ceilings. Its largely open floorplan, with an emphasis on outdoor living, is echoed in new luxury homes today. The foyer and curving grand staircase, a hallmark of Williams\u2019s designs, is decorated with a Baccarat chandelier purchased by Hollywood starlet Ms. Gabor, the former homeowner, Ms. Black says.Former renters include Frank Sinatra, Mia Farrow and Audrey Hepburn, according to Ms. Hudson\u2019s book, \u201cPaul R. Williams: Classic Hollywood Style.\u201dThe sitting room hides an amenity from the first homeowner, \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d producer Buddy Adler: A hidden storage area once used for film reels and projector equipment in what was then a home theater.Ms. Black, who lives at the five-bedroom home with her husband, David Scott, a retired astronaut, is selling the 1.1-acre property to be closer to family in Florida. They listed the home last year for $12.95 million with Jade Mills of Coldwell Banker. They took it off the market near the end of 2016 \u201cto refresh\u201d it and redecorate, Ms. Black said. In June, they relisted it for $13.995 million on the strength of the market and Mr. Williams\u2019s surging name value, Ms. Mills said. (His AIA award and a subsequent honor from the University of Southern California Architectural Guild were given this year.)In Ontario, Calif., about an hour east of the heated Los Angeles market, Darius Long is preparing to sell a very different Williams home\u2014a 2,250-square-foot, International-style Midcentury Modern, circa 1947.\u201cPeople thought it was a pharmacy,\u201d says Mr. Long, 54, a semiretired aerospace electronics buyer, about the avant-garde design. Surrounded by Colonials, the two-level, two-toned, green-and-brown home is sited on an angle to create a large semicircular drive. Mr. Long bought the home from the original owner for $435,000 in 2004, records show.Inside, there is original woodwork and built-ins from renowned craftsman Sam Maloof. With ample glass on the front and rear of the home, the open floorplan is filled with natural light. Floor-to-ceiling glass sliders in the rear open to a yard with a centuries-old oak tree. The finishes, even down to the linoleum floors and the 1960s             General Electric                   stovetop, are as the prior owner left them. \u201cI consider myself a docent\u2014just a caretaker of the house,\u201d says Mr. Long, who says he has changed almost nothing about the home.Mr. Long plans to list the home for around $1 million in the next few months to downsize to a home in another western state. Matthew Berkley of Deasy/Penner & Partners, the listing agent and an architectural historian, says that the unusual design and the fact that this is one of only two known Paul Williams-designed homes in the city justifies the listing price. Homes of a similar size nearby are listed in the $600,000 range. Mr. Long says he will only sell to a buyer who wants to preserve the spirit of the home.Williams-designed homes haven't been immune to buyers\u2019 demands. Ms. Hudson estimates that, \u201con the low side,\u201d about 40 of her grandfather\u2019s homes have been demolished in the Los Angeles area. In 2006, one of his most notable homes, the Midcentury Modern bachelor pad of Mr. Sinatra, was torn down to make way for new construction, she says.In Los Angeles, due to the damaging effects of hot weather and limited housing supply, homes older than 20 years are becoming scarce, because developers believe they can maximize their investment by building new, says       Jeff Hyland       of Hilton & Hyland. But the rising profile of architects like Paul Williams is helping to turn the tide.\u201cIt\u2019s a reason to say to a seller, \u2018Wait, don\u2019t tear that down\u2014we think it\u2019s worth more if you keep it,\u2019 \u201d he says.There is another safeguard for Williams homes\u2014they seldom come up for sale.John Sweeney, 65, a civil-rights attorney, bought a 6,000-square-foot Spanish Colonial Revival in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles for $1.975 million in 2003, according to city records. \u201cI feigned that I didn\u2019t know Paul Williams,\u201d Mr. Sweeney recalls, to drive a hard bargain. \u201cOf course, I knew everything about him.\u201dMr. Sweeney, who is African-American, says he found a kindred spirit in Mr. Williams, who faced discrimination, even as he became a household name.\u201cIt was very special to me to live in a house that was designed by an African-American who couldn\u2019t live there,\u201d he says. The original neighborhood covenants, he discovered, only allowed the home to transfer to white home buyers.In 2008, he had the 1927 home designated a Los Angeles historic cultural monument, effectively making it more difficult for the home to be demolished. He has no plans to sell, but should his family decide otherwise, there are protections in place.\u201cI wanted to make sure,\u201d he says, \u201cthat nobody can take down these walls.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-29 09:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/architect-paul-williams-blazed-a-trail-now-more-home-buyers-are-discovering-his-work-1498744781", "news_title": "Architect Paul Williams Blazed a Trail, and More Home Buyers are Discovering His Work", "keywords": "african american architects,architecture,luxury homes, luxury real estate, paul revere williams ,paul williams,paul williams architect,American Institute of Architects,Paul Revere Williams,political,general news,personal finance,real estate,property,buying,selling a home,building construction,residential building construction,construction"}, {"content": "MELBOURNE, Australia\u2014Cardinal George Pell, Pope Francis\u2019 finance chief and one of the most senior officials in the Vatican, was charged Thursday with multiple counts of sexual abuse alleged to have occurred in Australia decades ago.The 76-year-old is the highest-level Vatican official to face charges in the sexual-abuse scandals that have beset the Catholic Church in the past two decades. He will be required to appear at the Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court on July 18, Shane Patton, deputy commissioner of Victoria state\u2019s police force, said at a news conference.Cardinal Pell told reporters in Rome on Thursday morning that he was \u201cinnocent of these charges\u201d and would be returning to Australia to clear his name in court. He said       Pope Francis,        with whom he had discussed the matter a day earlier, had granted him a leave of absence for that purpose.The Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said the Holy See noted with regret the charges against Cardinal Pell. Mr. Burke read a Vatican statement that praised the cardinal for efforts against sex abuse as a bishop in Australia, as well as his work at the Vatican, and said he had impressed the pope with his honesty.Australia doesn\u2019t have an extradition arrangement with the Vatican.Details of the charges, which involve multiple complainants, weren\u2019t disclosed.Last year, Pope Francis told reporters that he wouldn\u2019t comment on the Pell cases \u201cuntil the justice system passes judgment,\u201d adding, \u201cOnce it has spoken, then I will speak.\u201dThe Vatican and other Catholic Church leaders have contended with scandals over clerical sex abuse since 2002, with a series of revelations in Boston, followed by another series in Europe in 2010.Pope Francis instituted a Vatican commission on the problem, led by Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, in 2014, but the body\u2019s work has been marked by controversy. One of the two sex-abuse survivors on the panel was forced to take a leave of absence last year after criticizing Pope Francis\u2019 record on sex abuse, and the other survivor resigned this year in protest over Vatican inaction on the problem.Last month, Pope Francis said the Vatican office in charge of disciplining priests accused of sex abuse was understaffed and that many cases were delayed because they had been piling up.The charges against Cardinal Pell were announced as most of the world\u2019s cardinals were gathered in Rome, the day after Pope Francis added five men to their number in a ceremony at the Vatican. The Vatican said the cardinal would no longer be participating in public liturgical events. The Vatican also said that Cardinal Pell\u2019s office would carry out its institutional tasks in his absence.Born in Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, in 1941, Cardinal Pell studied for the priesthood at Australia\u2019s Corpus Christi College and Propaganda Fide College in Rome. He rose through the ranks of the church after being ordained as a priest in late 1966, working in various parishes around Melbourne from the early 1970s through the late 1990s and serving in senior roles in Catholic education there, according to the Archdiocese of Sydney.He was ordained as auxiliary bishop of Melbourne\u2019s archdiocese in 1987. In 1996, Pope John Paul II appointed him as the seventh metropolitan archbishop of Melbourne before naming him archbishop of Sydney five years later.In February 2014, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Pell prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy at the Vatican. The pope originally handed the cardinal sweeping powers over Vatican financial affairs but following tension with longer-established Vatican offices, reduced the secretariat to a more limited budget-making and supervisory role.Cardinal Pell also sits on the international, nine-member Council of Cardinals, which advises the pope on overhauling the Vatican and governance of the world-wide church.At the Vatican, Cardinal Pell has also served as a prominent voice for traditional Catholic teaching on marriage, amid Pope Francis\u2019 move toward a more lenient practice on divorce.Before his Rome appointment, Cardinal Pell was a prominent figure in his homeland due to his orthodox positions on social issues including opposition to abortion drugs, stem-cell medical research and homosexuality.In 2007, he threatened to refuse communion to Australian lawmakers who voted in support of bills allowing stem-cell research, describing it as \u201ca perverse new direction in human experimentation,\u201d while in 1990 he said homosexual activity \u201cis wrong and we believe for the good of society it should not be encouraged.\u201dBut the strongest controversy centered on his response to allegations of sexual assault within the Australian wing of the Catholic Church, dating back to the 1960s.In 1993, while an auxiliary bishop for Melbourne, he appeared at a court hearing in support of convicted pedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale. As Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996 he oversaw the church\u2019s response to child sexual abuse, masterminding a program that capped compensation for victims at 50,000 Australian dollars.In a statement Thursday, Melbourne Archbishop Denis Hart said he is aware of the significance of the decision to charge Cardinal Pell, who he added has been a friend and fellow priest for more than 50 years.\u201cIt is a matter of public record that Cardinal Pell addressed the evil of sexual abuse in the Church on becoming Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996,\u201d Archbishop Hart said. He said the cardinal\u2019s work had been acknowledged nationally and internally.Mr. Patton, the deputy police commissioner, said the charges were served to the cardinal\u2019s legal representatives in Melbourne, where Cardinal Pell was archbishop from 1996 to 2001. He said that the investigation and process in charging Cardinal Pell was the same that police have followed in other historical sexual allegations and that police had considered advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions before proceeding with the charges.\u201cIt is important the process is allowed to run its natural course,\u201d Mr. Patton said, adding that the police didn\u2019t plan to comment further.The Australian investigation stems from a royal commission inquiry, the nation\u2019s highest form of judicial inquiry, that has heard allegations of institutionalized child abuse in the Catholic and other churches, sports clubs and youth groups. The inquiry is expected to take years to complete.\u2014Rob Taylor contributed to this article.Write to Robb M. Stewart at robb.stewart@wsj.com and Francis X.

The occasion also is proving to be a cause for celebration in New York, especially at a time when Canadian food and culture have become buzz-worthy sensations in the city.Several events are being planned in connection with the\u00a0Saturday festivities. Dirt Candy, the popular Lower East Side vegetarian restaurant headed by Canadian-born chef       Amanda Cohen,        is hosting a Canada Day cookout. Joe\u2019s Pub, the Public Theater\u2019s cabaret space, is putting on a pair of \u201cNew York Rocks the Great Canadian Songbook\u201d shows, featuring the work of       Joni Mitchell,       Leonard Cohen       and       Neil Young,        among other Canadian performers.Also of note: Toronto\u2019s Soulpepper Theatre Company, a 20-year-old troupe that is widely recognized as one of Canada\u2019s leading dramatic institutions, begins a month-long residency in New York City on\u00a0Saturday. The company will offer several productions at Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Pershing Square Signature Center, its home for the New York stint.This flurry of activity didn\u2019t suddenly materialize: In recent years, New Yorkers have shown a growing fascination with all things Canadian. A number of Canadian-themed restaurants have opened, from Mile End, a delicatessen, with two New York City locations, which feature Montreal-style smoked meat, to the Gentry, a dining spot in Brooklyn\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood that offers another specialty\u2014poutine, a dish of fries topped with gravy and cheese curds.The Gentry, which opened in March, is marking Canada Day with a $5 poutine special. Mile End also is running holiday-themed menu items, including the \u201c150 burger,\u201d which is smothered in poutine.Then, there is \u201cCome From Away,\u201d the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical that chronicles the story of how a small Canadian town welcomed hundreds of stranded air travelers in the aftermath of 9/11.Some say interest in Canada has increased in recent months, as New Yorkers, if not all Americans, look to our northern neighbor as something of a peaceful counterpoint to a U.S. that increasingly has become divided politically and socially. Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau       also has played a growing role on the global stage.For certain New Yorkers, Canada is still home in a sense. About 53,000 residents of the state are Canadian-born, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau.Little wonder the city boasts its own Canadian club\u2014the Canadian Association of New York, which has a $20-a-year membership roster of more than 1,000.Club president Dean Keyworth says it is a proud and exciting time to be a Canadian in New York City, but he notes that some New Yorkers still misunderstand certain aspects about their northern brethren.Chief among them: All Canadians are friendly. \u201cI can assure you there are rude people in Canada as well,\u201d       Mr. Keyworth       said.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oh-canada-new-york-gears-up-to-celebrate-150-years-1498741200", "news_title": "Oh Canada!

CMCSA 0.41%       cable subscribers. The channel is primarily an on-demand service; however, subscribers also will be able to watch new episodes of AMC shows when they debut on the linear channel without commercials.Charlie Collier,        president of AMC, said the new service comes after speaking to customers who have \u201ca desire to go deeper and have a different viewing experience.\u201dBesides being able to catch up on current seasons of AMC\u2019s original series and watch new episodes as they debut, there will also be exclusive content on AMC Premiere as well as movies from the network\u2019s library.While $4.99 a month just to avoid commercials may sound steep,       Matt Strauss,        Comcast\u2019s executive vice president and general manager of video and entertainment services, notes that it\u2019s a better deal than buying episodes of shows on an individual basis, which can run $3 an episode.\u201cThere\u2019s always a segment of viewers willing to part with money for a more premium experience,\u201d Mr. Strauss said. Comcast is also talking with other networks about creating similar platforms, he said.Such an arrangement is one way for Comcast to fight back against cord-cutting and encourage cable subscribers to stick around and not defect to an ad-free online video service. For AMC parent company AMC Networks Inc., doubling-down with a traditional cable distributor helps protect its lucrative affiliate fees, at a time when the company\u2019s advertising revenue fell 6.2% in the first quarter.AMC\u2019s Mr. Collier didn\u2019t rule out offering full seasons of current shows at once a la             Netflix                   on AMC Premiere down the road. \u201cWe want this platform to evolve to meet consumer needs,\u201d he said.The service could also serve as a test to an eventual direct-to-consumer offering by AMC, he said, although there are no such plans at the moment.Unfortunately for consumers who subscribe to AMC Premiere, there isn\u2019t a refund for the AMC standard channel.Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-would-don-draper-say-amc-offers-commercial-free-version-1498741200", "news_title": "What Would Don Draper Say?

But a return to meaningful sales growth would be much better news.H&M doesn\u2019t disclose changes in same-store sales, but             Barclays                   estimates they were down between 4% and 5% in the six months through May. This has accelerated a decline in margins that started in 2010, when H&M moved to cut prices and improve quality amid intensifying competition.Historically, H&M has been reluctant to prop up margins. Roughly 30% of the company\u2019s shares are owned by Chairman       Stefan Persson,        son of the founder. Management\u2014now led by Mr. Persson\u2019s own son Karl-Johan\u2014hasn\u2019t seemed under pressure to conform to the Wall Street fashion for offsetting weak growth with muscular cost management.Until now: The quarterly operating margin reported Thursday was higher than a year earlier, despite the continuing decline in same-store sales. Brokerage Jefferies estimates that costs were down between 5% and 6% on a like-for-like basis. Profits consequently beat forecasts, and the shares jumped in early trading.There may be more fat to cut, but the junior Mr. Persson also needs to be careful he doesn\u2019t jeopardize the company\u2019s chances of recovery. The only way for H&M to woo back long-term investors is to reboot the top-line trend.Investments in a better, more integrated online approach are under way, which should help in rapidly-shifting markets like the U.S.\u2014H&M\u2019s second largest, after Germany.But the bigger problem may be that the company\u2019s key label no longer excites customers. Where             Inditex                  -owned Zara has maintained its fashion cred, H&M seems to have slipped. Once a youth fashion brand, it has turned into just another clothing chain, while the group\u2019s other brands are still too small to move the needle.Cost discipline is welcome, but isn\u2019t enough to woo back long-term investors.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 08:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-m-gets-with-the-fashion-for-cutting-costs-1498739966", "news_title": "H&M Gets With the Fashion for Cutting Costs ", "keywords": "h&m, h&m clothing, h&m cost cuts, h&m sales, h&m shares,Hennes & Mauritz,HM-B.SK,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,retail sales,political,general news,fashion,living,lifestyle,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores"}, {"content": "When China regained sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, the mainland\u2019s two stock markets\u2014in Shanghai and Shenzhen\u2014had a total market capitalization of $196 billion, equivalent to the combined size of just six of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest listed companies then.How times have changed. Twenty years after the handover, the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets together are valued at $7.5 trillion\u2014the second largest in the world and more than twice the size of Hong Kong\u2019s market.China\u2019s ascendancy hasn\u2019t been all bad for Hong Kong. Until recently, global investors have been all but locked out of mainland Chinese markets. So for decades, Hong Kong has benefited from being a place where global investors can best get exposure to China\u2019s growth. These days, companies based in mainland China constitute more than 60% of Hong Kong\u2019s market capitalization, and almost all of the city\u2019s new listings have been coming from there, too.But as the mainland\u2019s markets open up, the low-hanging fruits from being a conduit may have been already plucked. MSCI\u2019s decision last week to include China\u2019s domestic shares in its indexes means Chinese companies may soon not need to list in Hong Kong to attract foreign investors.The temptation now is for Hong Kong to mold itself further in the mainland\u2019s image. The risk is that would turn it into just another Chinese city.The gravitational pull from China is strong and visible. Even the wild trading common in mainland markets has spilled over to Hong Kong, usually considered a more rational market, following the opening of trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen that have led to a rush of traders from the north.However, China\u2019s influence shouldn\u2019t mean Hong Kong compromises in areas such as regulation and transparency. A series of high-profile market scandals have left investors with exactly that worry. China Huishan Dairy plunged 85% in one day earlier this year, though a number of market participants had long pointed out its shares were being fueled by leveraged buying by its chairman. This week saw a sudden plunge in more than a dozen small-cap stocks apparently linked by a network of cross-shareholdings\u2014an embarrassment for Hong Kong\u2019s market chiefs before the arrival Thursday of Chinese President       Xi Jinping.As its mainland rivals open up further, Hong Kong\u2019s market faces a struggle to stay relevant. Forging a clear identity as the Chinese market with the highest standard of corporate governance and investors\u2019 protection is the best way to do that. The city\u2019s rule of law and freedom of capital and information flows should also be defended at all costs.

It is China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201dA spokesman for China\u2019s Defense Ministry echoed the sentiment. \u201cWe have always firmly opposed any form of official contacts and military interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,\u201d Senior Col.       Wu Qian       told a regular news conference later Thursday, saying such contacts risk damaging China-U. S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The proposed policy change, which requires approval by the full U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and the signature of President       Donald Trump,        could renew recent uncertainty around U.S. policy on Taiwan, which first erupted in December when Mr. Trump, then president-elect, broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wenperson.In a January interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump suggested he would review the One China policy unless he saw concessions from China on trade. The next month he reaffirmed the U.S.\u2019s commitment to the policy in a phone call with China\u2019s President       Xi Jinping.The Senate committee vote reassures Taipei of its support in Congress and helps it push back against pressure from China, said       Yan Chen-shen,        a professor at the Institute of International Relations at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University.\u201cThis could be seen as a kind of leverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the United States is not abandoning Taiwan.\u201dWere the bill to become law, it is possible, though unlikely, that Beijing might try to punish Taiwan by peeling away another of the island\u2019s diplomatic partners, he said. Beijing refuses formal ties with countries that recognize the island\u2019s government. Earlier this month, Panama ended diplomatic relations with Taipei in favor of Beijing, leaving Taiwan with only 20 formal diplomatic partners, mainly small nations in the Pacific and the Caribbean.It is unclear how the vote was seen in the White House. Mr. Trump has recently sought China\u2019s help against North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and has also sought to focus the relationship around trade.Whether or not he supports the Senate bill, Mr. Trump could use it to pressure China, according to       Shi Yinhong,        professor of international relations at Beijing\u2019s Renmin University. \u201cHe could say, \u2018If you don\u2019t do more to help on trade or North Korea, there\u2019s an increasing number of people in the U.S. calling for a change in relations with Taiwan,\u201d he said.Yet that pressure is only likely to come into play if relations between Washington and Beijing take a bad turn, said Mr. Shi.\u201cThis raises the possibility that U.S.-China relations will worsen, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d he said.\u2014Jeremy Page and Dominique Fong contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 08:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tells-u-s-senate-to-keep-its-nose-out-of-taiwan-1498739362", "news_title": "China Tells U.S. Senate to Keep Its Nose Out of Taiwan", "keywords": "china-taiwan relations,china-u.s. relations,one china policy,renegade province,u.s. china policy,u.s. foreign policy,u.s.-taiwan,u.s. taiwan policy,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"}, {"content": "Pine River Capital Management plans to spin off a nearly $2 billion government bond-trading fund into a stand-alone firm Jan. 1, in what is likely to be one of the biggest new hedge-fund launches next year.The Minnetonka, Minn.-based firm profited big off the rebound in government-backed mortgage bonds following the financial crisis, but its assets have shrunk recently.

Mr. Dimitriou\u2019s fixed-income, relative value fund focuses on the debt of G-7 countries. The firm buys bond instruments it thinks are cheap and bets against related bonds or contracts it thinks are expensive, hoping the assets will converge in price. It doesn\u2019t make macroeconomic calls on the broader direction of interest rates.The fund\u2019s average annualized return since its late 2011 start was more than 11% through May, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Dimitriou became sole portfolio manager of the fund in 2014 after becoming co-portfolio manager in 2012.Mr. Dimitriou, who emigrated from Greece to the U.S. after getting a green card at the age of 15, has told investors the political instability and monetary policy shifts that have led to profitable trades for his fund will continue for the foreseeable future, said people familiar with the matter.Mr. Dimitriou spent 12 years on Wall Street trading government bonds before joining Pine River in 2012.Pine River executives told investors on the calls this week it would hold for an undisclosed number of years a passive minority stake in Elan, sharing in Elan\u2019s management and performance fees. Pine River plans to continue trading government rates, said people familiar with the matter.The spinoff is expected to further shrink Pine River\u2019s assets under management to a little more than $7 billion from a peak of about $15 billion in 2015.Pine River has returned billions of client money since 2015, including after the departure of a key portfolio manager and the poor performance of some funds. It plans to return more than $500 million in the next several months after another fund it planned to spin off, its China fund, lost money and investors redeemed. It said earlier this month it would be closing that fund.Pine River has raised some new money from investors recently. Its permanent capital business, advising mortgage real-estate investment trusts, has grown to make up about half its assets under management.People familiar with the planned spinoff said they believed Pine River would benefit because of its continued financial relationship with Mr. Dimitriou. At the same time, Mr. Dimitriou will be able to continue his relationships with existing investors.Current investors in Mr. Dimitriou\u2019s fund have until Nov. 15 to decide whether or not they want to stay invested through the spinoff. Mr. Dimitriou expects to replace any money that is redeemed with investors who have been on a wait list to get in, said people familiar with the matter.The name \u201cElan\u201d is meant to reflect energy and enthusiasm, one of the people said.Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 08:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pine-river-capital-management-plans-to-spin-off-nearly-2-billion-hedge-fund-1498738407", "news_title": "Pine River Capital Management Plans to Spin Off Nearly $2 Billion Hedge Fund", "keywords": "elan capital management,hedge fund,pine river,pine river capital management,renos dimitriou,spinoff,spin off,Pine River Capital Management,Elan Capital Management,Renos Dimitriou,corporate changes,plans,strategy,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,new companies creation,demergers,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "An analysis of millions of Americans\u2019 medical claims showed diagnoses of opioid-use disorder surged nearly 500% over the past seven years, according to a review by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.The analysis, which examined the claims of over 30 million people with commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers between 2010 and 2016, underscores the rising tide of addiction in the U.S. Opioid-use disorder is the clinical term for addiction to opioids, which include prescription painkillers and illicit narcotics such as heroin.Twenty-one percent of the people reviewed in the analysis filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to BCBSA, with higher doses and longer-duration prescriptions associated with higher addiction rates.Opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. And the disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration than a low dose for a long duration.\u201cYou have to be concerned not just how long the script goes but how high a dose you\u2019re prescribing,\u201d says David Pizza, BCBSA\u2019s managing director of strategy and data analytics. \u201cThe way in which they\u2019re provided is key to addressing the dependency issue.\u201dJohn Kelly, an associate professor of psychiatry in addiction medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said the results show \u201cwe are now at the public health equivalent of \u2018DEFCON 5\u2019 with this opioid crisis.\u201d\u201cHigh-dose, long-duration prescribing practices, which can drive up rates of opioid-use disorder, are still too common. This needs much closer attention and monitoring to curb the onset of new cases of opioid-use disorder,\u201d he said.The analysis also showed that use of medications to treat opioid addiction, such as buprenorphine or methadone, grew by 65% over the period of the study\u2014a rate dwarfed by the 493% increase in opioid-use disorder diagnoses.Kim Holland, vice president for state affairs at BCBSA, said the necessary infrastructure to support people getting the treatment they need to address substance abuse effectively is lacking.The analysis found more people with opioid-use disorder are treated with medication in New England than in the South and parts of the Midwest.\u201cIt tells us there\u2019s work to do,\u201d says Ms. Holland. \u201cNot everyone is getting the treatment they need.\u201dShe said opioids are an important part of a physician\u2019s ammunition to help alleviate pain.\u201cBut to recognize potential dangers it\u2019s important to understand the extent to which they are prescribed,\u201d she said.Ninety-one Americans die each day from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. has nearly quadrupled since 1999 even though there has been no change in the amount of pain reported by Americans, the CDC says. Meanwhile, deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled over the same period.Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opioid-addiction-diagnoses-up-nearly-500-in-past-seven-years-study-shows-1498737603", "news_title": "Opioid-Addiction Diagnoses Up Nearly 500% in Past Seven Years, Study Shows ", "keywords": "Blue Cross Blue Shield Association,political,general news,health,outbreaks,epidemics,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "Forget everything the physicists have said: Traveling back in time is super simple.Step 1: Get an original iPhone. (Craigslist pro tip: Make sure it powers up before handing over the cash.)Step 2: Find a cellular carrier that still has a so-very-slow 2G network. (Hello,             T-Mobile                  !) Insert the SIM card into your new old iPhone.Step 3: Pack a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, knitting supplies, fidget spinner, whatever you need to pass the time. There\u2019s a lot of waiting on technology in the past.Step 4: Power on phone. Welcome to 2007.To commemorate the iPhone\u2019s arrival in stores a decade ago this Thursday, I locked my iPhone 7 in a box and challenged myself to live with the original for a week. I made it 12 hours\u201412 full hours of complete frustration and complete amazement. I urge you to try it yourself. If you can\u2019t, join me in my day-in-the-life video above, then read on.What did I learn? In 2007, the iPhone was truly a technological wonder. Today, it is truly terrible. Actually terrible. When I called my mom, it was so muffled I wondered if she was in an airplane lavatory at 30,000 feet. (She wasn\u2019t. Hi Mom!) But that\u2019s the best part of being transported 10 years into the past: You can clearly see the mobile technology advancements we now take for granted.Speeds. You like your 4G LTE? Pfft, the original iPhone didn\u2019t even have 3G. It ran only on a 2G EDGE cellular network. It takes nearly a minute to fully load our president\u2019s             Twitter                   feed in the old iPhone\u2019s Safari browser (with an iPhone 7 on LTE, it takes just 5 seconds). You can already have eaten lunch by the time it loads your lunch-spot search results (\u201cpizza\u201d) in the Maps app. Wi-Fi is your new best friend, but even that\u2019s slower. (Fun fact:             AT&T no longer even has a 2G network. I had to call AT&T customer service to have the phone unlocked.)Screens. If the iPhone 7 Plus had a kangaroo pouch, it could easily carry around the original iPhone. The larger screen feels like a 5.5-inch Texas next to a 3.5-inch Oklahoma. The first thing most people now utter upon seeing the original iPhone: \u201cCute!\u201d What\u2019s not cute? The visible pixels and the washed-out colors when you aren\u2019t looking at the screen head on.Software.  It was touch-screen magic! A screen that becomes a keyboard! Pinch to zoom to see the details of a photo! Swipe through the colorful album covers! But there are no emojis, predictive text or Siri. No third-party apps to share or edit photos. Heck, you can\u2019t even text a photo, or load most websites. No Apple Music or Spotify. (You know what it does have though? A headphone port.)The original iPhone received iPhoneOS updates through 3.1.3\u2014but it never saw the rebranded iOS, which arrived at version 4. The first iPhone did eventually get an App Store, but today, most apps require iOS 8 or later to work, so it feels like a ghost town.Stills. The 2-megapixel camera takes surprisingly decent shots when the lighting is good. (I mean, I\u2019d still carry a point-and-shoot.)But want to take a shot where the light isn\u2019t great? Don\u2019t even try. Want to turn on the flash? There isn\u2019t one. Shoot video? No can do. And if you want to take a selfie? Use a mirror... like a caveperson! Seriously, no front-facing camera.Stamina. When you think about how little this iPhone can do, it\u2019s pretty nuts that I still had to charge it by lunchtime. This battery may be old, of course, but people who owned the first iPhone remember the midday top-up. It was             BlackBerry\u2019s       biggest bragging point. (We know how that ended for BlackBerry.) That said, you don\u2019t need to go back to 2007 to experience \u201cLow Battery\u201d iPhone frustration. Here\u2019s hoping that isn\u2019t the case 10 years from today.A special thank you to Stanley Fowler, father of Personal Tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler, for allowing me to borrow his 2007 iPhone.

Now, for two months this summer the eight-lane bridge that carries Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River will be down to half that many lanes as it undergoes repairs.\u201cYour knuckles turn white going over that thing,\u201d said       David Noell,        a commercial contractor and president of the Queensgate Business Alliance, a group of area businesses. \u201cEverything bottlenecks over that bridge.\u201dThe 53-year-old Brent Spence Bridge is just one of about 84,000 U.S. bridges that the Federal Highway Administration considers functionally obsolete. That means they no longer serve their intended use because the lanes are too narrow or there aren\u2019t emergency shoulders, among other factors. An additional 56,000 bridges are deemed structurally deficient by the agency.The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates it would cost $123 billion to repair all the nation\u2019s bridges. One reason for the cost is the age of the structures: About 40% of the U.S.\u2019s approximately 614,000 bridges are older than their average design life of about 50 years.Aging bridges are \u201cgoing to be a growing problem because the mathematics are against the available money to stay current with repairs on good bridges, let alone failing bridges,\u201d said Barry LePatner, a construction-industry lawyer who wrote \u201cToo Big to Fall: America\u2019s Failing Infrastructure and the Way Forward.\u201dMost of the funds for highways and bridges come from the federal gasoline tax, which hasn\u2019t been increased since 1993. That prompted about 25 states in recent years to boost their own pump taxes or recalculate formulas to generate funds for upgrades.President       Donald Trump       has promised $1 trillion worth of investments in the country\u2019s infrastructure, much of which would be funded by private sources. He pointed to the Brent Spence Bridge to illustrate America\u2019s infrastructure challenges.This summer\u2019s repairs on the Brent Spence cost $38 million for repaving, updating lighting and other improvements. But it won\u2019t solve the problem that has had Kentucky and Ohio lawmakers at loggerheads for years: how to pay for a major overhaul of the double-decker span that carries as many as 180,000 vehicles a day, including an estimated $1 billion worth of freight daily, according to the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments.A plan to build a companion bridge to handle much of the traffic is estimated to cost $2.6 billion\u2014funds the two states lack.Impasses over fixing infrastructure often revolve around philosophical differences over whether drivers, taxpayers or investors should foot the bill. That\u2019s true with the Spence: Ohio thinks tolls are unavoidable, while Kentucky has been hellbent on not letting that happen.And so, the bridge\u2014vital to a region of 2.1 million people that is home to the headquarters of             Procter & Gamble Co.      ,             Macy\u2019s Inc.,       and soon a world-wide cargo hub for             Amazon.com Inc.      \u2014remains jammed.Kentucky opened the cantilevered truss bridge in November 1963 to improve traffic and move trucks along the two interstates. The bridge was built to handle about 80,000 vehicles a day, but now handles at least twice as many.The American Transportation Research Institute, an Arlington, Va.-based research organization funded by the trucking industry, has ranked the bridge the fifth worst choke point for freight traffic in the nation.Engineers have tried to cope with the traffic increases, even eliminating the bridge\u2019s shoulder lanes and reducing the width of existing lanes in the 1980s. That allowed for four lanes in each direction instead of three. But the moves increased accidents, and lengthy delays from accidents, according to the regional council.The bridge is in no danger of collapsing, according to Kentucky transportation officials, though chunks of debris have fallen from it in recent years. In 2014, falling concrete crushed a parked car in Ohio. Nobody was injured.Area business leaders say conversations with the Trump administration and Kentucky state officials are giving them hope that a deal could be in the offing for a solution, perhaps as soon as this fall.\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d said       Brent Cooper,        interim president of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe finally have the chess pieces in place to win.\u201dA preliminary plan under discussion likely would involve a public-private partnership, substantial federal funding and some kind of toll, according to Mr. Cooper and other informed individuals.Kentucky\u2019s Gov.       Matt Bevin,        a Republican elected in 2015 with strong support from toll opponents, commissioned a study to analyze how to improve traffic in the area of the bridge. Part of it will examine a proposal by toll opponents to create a bypass away from the city and the bridge. The report is due this fall.A person with knowledge of the matter said early indications of the study\u2019s findings show such a bypass is impractical in part due to cost. A spokesman with Mr. Bevin\u2019s Kentucky Transportation Cabinet declined to comment on what the study\u2019s findings might be.Mr. Cooper at the Northern Kentucky Chamber said he and other business leaders met in Washington this spring with Transportation Secretary       Elaine Chao,        wife of Kentucky Republican Sen.       Mitch McConnell.\u201cThey want to find a way to make this work,\u201d Mr. Cooper said of the Trump administration. \u201cThe one thing business hates more than taxes is uncertainty, and this bridge gives us an abundance of uncertainty.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The chart lists the average improvement cost per bridge in millions of dollars. An earlier version of the chart incorrectly omitted the indication that the figures are in millions.

Just a bit ago, we got word that 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid to take full control of U.K. pay-TV giant Sky may face more regulatory scrutiny and delays. U.K. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley announced this morning that she is \u201cminded\u201d to refer the decision about whether to allow Fox to complete its \u00a311.7 billion ($15.2 billion) purchase of the 61% of Sky it doesn\u2019t already own to the competition authorities for more investigation into the combined company\u2019s influence over U.K. media. Ofcom, the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, found in its assessment that recent scandals at Fox in the U.S. represented \u201csignificant corporate failures\u201d but didn\u2019t affect its ability to adhere to U.K. broadcasting standards. Sky and Fox have until July 14 to make remedies to avoid a referral. (Reminder that 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp share common ownership.)Nike has resisted Amazon\u2019s advances for years. Nike refused to provide its goods for the e-commerce giant to sell because it wanted more control over the pricing and display of its sneakers and sporting apparel. But Nike recently capitulated and has begun selling its products directly on Amazon, in part so it can muffle the hordes of unofficial third-party resellers who are hawking its goods on the site, The Wall Street Journal reports. This month, Amazon told those sellers they will soon need to stop selling certain Nike items.\u2014She\u2019s Lost Control\u2014Cool companies like Nike consider Amazon \u201ca site that sells items, not one that builds brands,\u201d according to the report. This U-turn marks another direct example of Amazon\u2019s gobbling up of the brick-and-mortar retail industry. As malls and retail chains throw down the shutters, Nike\u2019s distribution network has become narrower. Ceding control of merchandising has become a necessary means of doing business and, as more people turn to Amazon as their first port of call when online shopping, Nike doesn\u2019t have a lot of choice. On a related note: Digiday reports that some retailers think Amazon is \u201cnot a great partner\u201d when it comes to sharing data.At most news organizations, there is the expectation of a so-called \u201cChinese Wall\u201d to separate editorial and commercial operations. But as traditional print advertising continues its precipitous fall and the majority of new digital spend is gobbled up by Facebook and Google, news organizations are increasingly turning to branded content to line their coffers, which is warping that traditionally solid barrier. Columbia Journalism Review has explored what it describes as the \u201cincreasingly slippery path between news and advertising\u201d at the New York Times. The longread describes how the Gray Lady\u2019s former executive editor,       Jill Abramson,        was uncomfortable with requests from higher-ups for the newsroom to help with commercial digital initiatives, and it also chronicles moments when Times\u2019 staffers admit, on the record, occasions when they should have made paid promotion disclosures more prominent. One line from the piece that will likely rattle old school journalists: \u201cT Brand [the Times\u2019 branded content studio], which started in 2014\u2026has grown rapidly as the newsroom continues to shrink.\u201dAs a naive Brit abroad, I was stereotypically befuddled on my first visit to the U.S. many years ago to discover that drugstores were the place to go to buy cigarettes. Right next to the pills designed to make you better were the sticks that kill you. A young me chalked it up to the sad, cynical state of capitalism. CVS Health is attempting to change those optics, WSJ reports. Having removed tobacco products from its stores in 2014, CVS is now hiding junk food away from the storefront, getting rid of tanning oils and low-protection sunscreens and banishing foods that contain artificial trans-fats. It wants to stand out from drugstore rivals by focusing more acutely on health-care goods and services. Its main competitor, however, said it isn\u2019t a retailer\u2019s job to \u201ctell [consumers] what is good for them.\u201d CVS\u2019s move to ban tobacco cost it $2 billion in annual revenue, but it thinks its health-focused modifications won\u2019t dent sales, despite the risk of disrupting its loyal shoppers\u2019 usual habits.No.Some agencies -- ones that rely mostly on Windows machines rather than Macs -- still haven\u2019t got their systems fully back up and running since the company was targeted by a cyberattack on Tuesday, sources told me. Other agencies were not affected at all, as WPP said in its official statement yesterday. Fortunately, a lot of WPP\u2019s software runs on the cloud, so as long as staffers can get access to a computer of some sort, they can still keep campaigns running. What\u2019s more of an issue, however, are the documents stored on the computers that are out of action. Imagine being in a pitch right now! It\u2019s also payday for staffers at many WPP agencies tomorrow, which could be a concern, although payroll isn\u2019t thought to have been affected by the hack. WPP hasn\u2019t provided an official public update on the matter since Wednesday, but Chief Executive Martin Sorrell sent out a second memo to staff yesterday afternoon U.K. time commending employees\u2019 efforts to keep the trains on the rails for clients. \u201cWhether devising new ways to stay in touch with one another or delivering work on deadline, no matter what, you have put in that extra effort that makes all the difference in our business,\u201d Mr. Sorrell wrote.Scripps and Time Inc. are among the publishers creating shows for the new Amazon Echo that comes with a screen.

He subsequently resigned from the firm and issued a public apology.Reid Hoffman,       \ufeff      Greylock partner and co-founder of LinkedIn, was among Silicon Valley leaders speaking out after the controversy. He proposed creation some kind of \u201cindustrywide HR function\u201d that could police VC misconduct.Because founders and investors don\u2019t work for the same company, there isn\u2019t a clear way to bring harassment complaints to a human-resources department. Many venture-capital firms employ a small number of people and have no dedicated human-resources staff or diversity policies.The National Venture Capital Association earlier this year issued guidelines on how firms should develop HR policies, in an effort to assist firms with recruitment and retention of people from underrepresented groups. The association didn\u2019t comment on whether it should play a role in developing an industrywide human-resources mechanism. However the group did condemn Mr. Caldbeck\u2019s alleged behavior.\u201cIt has no place in our industry and we are open to considering all suggestions for the role NVCA can play in ensuring it never happens again,\u201d a spokesman for the group said.Ms. Emerson of Paradigm,       \ufeff      which helps companies recruit and retain diverse talent, said it is too soon to tell if the furor over Binary Capital will lead to industry change.She said that before venture capitalists take on complex policy solutions to curb bad behavior, they need to address the incidents of bias and harassment.\u201cVCs should look in the mirror and think about what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.Silicon Valley\u2019s debate over sexism already had gained in intensity lately following the allegations of systemic harassment that paved the way for Travis Kalanick\u2019s forced resignation as chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc.Ellen Pao       sparked a dialogue on bias in the venture industry when she sued her former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Though she lost her case against the prominent firm in 2015, there has been increasing pressure for the industry to consider diversity and inclusion following the Kleiner trial.Venture capital continues to see a significant gender gap among its partnerships, which advocates for diversity and inclusion say has a ripple effect on the startups they invest in.Cowboy Ventures founder       Aileen Lee       said the industry must create an environment where women feel comfortable to come forward about mistreatment. But at the same time, she says firms also have a responsibility to stamp out bad behavior.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be laying all of the responsibility on the women\u2019s shoulders,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cOur industry isn\u2019t doing enough to remedy known problems fast enough.\u201dMs. Emerson said venture capitalists have to go beyond the verbal commitments to change the industry and truly commit to diversity and inclusion within their own firms and in their portfolio companies.\u201cI think VCs that don\u2019t invest in this now are going to lose millions of dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are getting quieter about these things.\u201dWrite to Cat Zakrzewski at cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com Twitter: @Cat_Zakrzewski", "news_time": "2017-06-29 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/growing-pressure-to-combat-sexual-misconduct-1498735801", "news_title": "Pressure Grows to Combat Sexual Misconduct", "keywords": "Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,National Venture Capital Association,Uber Technologies,Cowboy Ventures,Ellen Pao,Founder Aileen Lee,Joelle Emerson,Justin Caldbeck,Partner Reid Hoffman,political,general news,crime,legal action,harassment,sex crimes,analyses,commentaries,opinions,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,venture capital"}, {"content": "Some gambles don\u2019t pay off. Just over a year ago, a midsize U.K. food company,             Premier Foods,        PFD -3.13%batted away a takeover proposal from             McCormick                   & Co., the U.S. spice and herb group, promising that its own growth and a friendly tie-up with a Japanese noodle maker would bring better value.Since then, Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the collapse in the pound has forced Premier to abandon its revenue growth targets and cut costs to battle price inflation in ingredients for its products, which include Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes.But investors may get another shot at a sale because Premier has             Credit Suisse        CS 0.53%       conducting a strategic review of ways to lift value for shareholders, according to people familiar with the company. Options could include the sale of one or more Premier brands, a merger with another food group, or an outright sale. A person familiar with the company said such reviews were done regularly.It may be tough for any bid for Premier to reach the value offered by McCormick. The U.S. spice giant submitted several proposals last spring, the last of which valued Premier at \u00a3537 million (then $773 million), or 65 pence a share. The stock closed at 40 pence a share on Wednesday, roughly 40% below McCormick\u2019s proposal, which was withdrawn in April 2016. Of course, for a U.S. bidder the company would be cheaper now: Last year\u2019s proposal would now cost less than $695 million in dollar terms.However, analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts for Premier have also been cut from 4 pence a share to 2 pence for the year to March 2018, according to FactSet, and from 6 pence to 2 pence for 2019, meaning the company is probably now worth less. Premier is stuck trying to trim costs, pass on price inflation to customers in the highly competitive U.K. market, and make the best of a limited marketing budget.Another obstacle is the 20% stake held by Nissin, the Japanese food group that invented instant noodles. Nissin and Premier revealed they were discussing a deal to cooperate on distribution, marketing and products late last March when the U.K. group first rejected McCormick\u2019s approach. The next day it announced Nissin had bought the 17.3% stake held by private equity group Warburg Pincus. Nissin later added to that holding.Other large shareholders Standard Life and Paulson & Co were frustrated by this outcome and the latter has since cut its stake significantly. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based activist Oasis Management has built an 8% stake, and this year won a seat on Premier\u2019s board.Any transaction would need Nissin\u2019s support. But with Premier\u2019s stock price so low, the pressure on management to do something is building.Write to Paul J.

NCDs, a type of short-term loan, have become extremely popular in recent years with Chinese banks, especially smaller lenders due to their weaker ability to attract deposits.During a clampdown on runaway debt in April, Chinese regulators warned banks against abusing the tool for speculative, leveraged bets in capital markets. But after a deep but brief drop, NCD issuance has risen again as regulatory attention appeared to ease in recent weeks, hitting 1.96 trillion yuan ($287.73 billion) this month, up sharply from 1.23 trillion yuan in May and just a touch below March\u2019s record 2.02 trillion yuan.The latest development suggests a tug of war between some of China\u2019s most aggressive and speculative lenders and policy makers, who are trying to stem slowing economic growth and reduce financial risk at the same time.\u201cThe surge in NCD issuance volume this month in a way reflects a Tom and Jerry situation between regulators and markets,\u201d said Liu Dongliang, senior analyst at             China Merchants Bank,       referring to a famous cartoon cat-and-mouse rivalry.China introduced NCDs in 2013 as part of steps to liberalize interest rates, allowing banks to use the new fundraising tool to help set borrowing costs according to supply and demand.The NCD market started taking off last year, as a rallying bond market encouraged banks, particularly the more aggressive and profit-driven smaller lenders, to use such short-term loans to further leverage their investments.In early April, the country\u2019s banking regulator criticized such behavior as \u201cworking without bending down\u201d and \u201csitting there collecting free money,\u201d adding that banks should do more to ensure money flowed to China\u2019s \u201creal economy.\u201dThe regulator\u2019s warning came hot on the heels of the Chinese central bank\u2019s decision to raise short-term interest rates in February and March as Beijing intensified its campaign to discourage leveraged investment.However, after the so-called \u201cdeleveraging campaign\u201d caused Chinese bond prices to tumble a 29-month low last month, there has been a subtle change in both official rhetoric and action.In an apparent effort to appease nervous investors, the official Xinhua News Agency ran a commentary in early June that said the authorities will strive to maintain market stability. \u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d it urged investors.In the following week, the People\u2019s Bank of China injected the largest amount of cash into the financial system for a single week since mid-January, which led to large declines in bond yields as well as the cost of NCD issuance.The interest rate that banks pay to issue a three-month NCD fell to 4.40% Thursday after hitting a near 27-month high of 5.19% on June 8.There are signs that many banks are issuing NCDs to roll over maturing loans, giving themselves a lifeline to cover frequent short-term funding needs.Currently, NCD issuing costs are only marginally lower than the prevailing returns on Chinese corporate bonds, one of the most popular that banks purchase with such borrowed funds.Yields on three-year AA-rated, or high-yield Chinese corporate bonds are at 4.77%, while those on safer, AAA-rated debt are at 4.48%.In an indication of the banks\u2019 heavy reliance on this new tool, NCDs accounted for 56% of all newly issued bonds in China this month. That is down from the record in February, when seasonal slowness for government and corporate bond sales because of the Lunar New Year holiday pushed the proportion to 71%.\u201cThe government\u2019s deleveraging campaign is far from over because as long as people are borrowing more money, it simply means leverage is still high,\u201d said       Qu Qing,        chief fixed income analyst at Hua Chuang Securities.Apart from NCDs, another form of short-term loans known as \u201crepurchase agreements\u201d are also gaining popularity, Mr. Qu said.The total transaction value of repos, which use bonds as collateral, rose to 50.9 trillion yuan this month from 46.8 trillion yuan last month, hitting the highest level since the record 59.8 trillion yuan in August.\u201cIt\u2019s really like the game of a cat trying to catch a mouse.

Regulators and airlines overseas said they would study the mandate and work together to keep flights safe.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly outlined the new standards in a speech in Washington, where he said that terrorists are working hard to bring down aircraft and that the government must respond by increasing defensive measures.\u201cIt is time that we raise the global baseline of aviation security. We cannot play international Whac-A-Mole with each new threat,\u201d he said.Mr. Kelly added that various requirements, which will affect 180 airlines operating from 280 airports in 105 countries, can be \u201cdialed up and down\u201d depending on the threat. He said they would be enacted over the \u201cnext several weeks and months.\u201dIn March, DHS banned personal electronic devices from the cabins of aircraft flying to the U.S. from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa. The agency feared that terrorists could smuggle explosives inside a laptop or tablet past security and set off the device in the cabin when the plane is aloft.Airlines complained such a ban would disrupt their operations and inconvenience their passengers. Some airlines and industry experts also warned that storing more laptops powered by lithium batteries in the cargo hold raised the risk of an undetected fire.Mr. Kelly had previously suggested a wider ban affecting flights from Europe, or affecting all flights to and from the U.S. The stricter protocols outlined on Wednesday would preclude a wider ban and lift the in-cabin electronics prohibition at the 10 affected airports if officials there enact the new measures. The rules would affect nearly 2,000 flights carrying some 325,000 passengers a day, DHS officials said.The European Union is \u201ccarefully assessing these new security measures,\u201d Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said. Europe would continue to work with the U.S. to bolster protection of air travel, Ms. Bulc said. The EU has held weeks of talks with the U.S. amid concern the laptop ban could be expanded to European airports.Responsibility for airport security checks in Europe falls to government not airlines.             Deutsche Lufthansa AG       said it was working with its relevant authorities to assure compliance with the new U.S. requirements, a spokesman said. There is no impact for passengers on the use of laptops, tablets or other electronics on flights to the U.S.The International Air Transport Association, which lobbied heavily against the ban, said it welcomed the U.S. action and said it improved security. Still, the lobby group\u2019s Director General       Alexandre de Juniac       struck a note of caution. He said \u201cthe aggressive timeline\u201d would be \u201cchallenging.\u201dAirlines or airports that don\u2019t comply may be subject to a ban on large electronic devices or possibly be barred from flying to the U.S. altogether, Mr. Kelly said Wednesday at a conference sponsored by the Center for a New American Security. But he said he expected that all parties will be able and willing to meet the new standards.Mr. Kelly said the agency would work with its overseas partners to put the mandate in place. U.S. officials met with their European counterparts in Brussels this week to discuss aviation security.Delta Air Lines Inc.       said Wednesday that it is working with the government to implement the new measures and minimize their impact on customers.Qatar Airways Chief Executive       Akbar Al Baker       last week invited U.S. officials to audit his airline\u2019s Doha hub, which is affected by the ban. \u201cIt would be really impossible for somebody to pass explosives [on board] in their laptops and iPads,\u201d he said.Tim Clark,        president of Emirates Airline, whose Dubai hub has been affected by the March laptop ban, said last week that the airport was ready to make any upgrades the U.S. demanded. Emirates Airline is the largest airline by international traffic.DHS said the new measures, which could also include more sophisticated baggage screening technology and wider use of canine units, are designed to limit inconvenience to fliers.

And, while some officials in President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration privately cheer the Kurdish independence cause, maintaining the unity of Iraq remains the official policy of the U.S. and its Western allies.The country\u2019s Western partners are concerned that the referendum\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t lead to independence anytime soon\u2014will change the political climate in the rest of the country. With Iraq\u2019s federal elections looming next year, that could bring to power radical Shiite forces hostile to the more inclusive approach of Iraqi Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi.It all adds up to a greater risk to regional stability just as Islamic State is finally being defeated in Iraq and Syria.\u201cWe think the referendum is a bad idea, and the timing is a bad idea, first of all because the Kurds are not prepared for this,\u201d said a senior U.S. official. \u201cIf the Kurds go ahead with the referendum this year, it will strengthen the more polarizing and more sectarian figures [in Baghdad], and disadvantage those who are more moderate and who would reach across sectarian lines and form alliances.\u201dKurdistan officials retort that now is precisely the right time to tackle the historic Kurdish desire to form a separate nation, after Mr. Abadi\u2019s government and the Kurdish leadership established close cooperation fighting side-by-side to oust Islamic State from Mosul. Kurdistan plans detailed negotiations with Baghdad on how and when to implement the breakup, the officials said.\u201cTo answer the question of why now: We can achieve through this positive relationship a mutual understanding because, after Abadi, who knows who will be responsible in Baghdad? We want to avoid future confrontation and future bloodshed by ending this unhealthy interdependence in relations with Baghdad,\u201d said Hemin Hawrami, senior assistant to Kurdistan President       Masoud Barzani,        who called the referendum, and head of political affairs at the Kurdistan presidency.\u201cThe referendum is for independence, but it doesn\u2019t mean that on the 26th of September we are going to declare independence. It is the start of a long process,\u201d Mr. Hawrami added.While Iraq\u2019s federal government views the vote as illegal because no legislation to conduct it exists, Baghdad is unlikely to do anything to oppose it. \u201cMost Iraqis in federal areas right now are not supportive of the referendum, but to be frank they are not in a position to spend too much time worrying about it because there are so many other problems in the country,\u201d said Sajad Jiyad, managing director of the Al Bayan Center, a Baghdad think-tank.Kurdish-populated areas of northern Iraq have enjoyed broad self-rule since 1991, an arrangement expanded and enshrined in the 2005 Iraqi constitution. Kurdistan, a region roughly the size of Ireland that is home to some 5.2 million people, already has its own security forces and immigration controls. Federal troops and police aren\u2019t allowed on its soil without special permission.Complicating any move toward a breakup with Iraq is the issue of disputed territories\u2014areas outside the recognized boundaries of the Kurdistan Regional Government, such as the city of Kirkuk and nearby oil fields, that are controlled by Kurdish forces and contain large Kurdish populations.Kurdish Peshmerga troops took over many of these areas over the last three years, in the course of the war against Islamic State. Baghdad seeks to regain control of these contested territories and has condemned Kurdish plans to hold the referendum there, let alone to permanently annex them.\u201cIf the referendum is held and a breakup is achieved, it will create more conflicts over issues such as disputed territories,\u201d warned Ammar Tuma, head of the Shiite Fadhila bloc in the Iraqi parliament. \u201cThere will be no benefit for the Kurds, and no benefit for the Iraqis.\u201dThe only other recent example of a non-Arab area seceding from an Arab-majority country to form a separate nation isn\u2019t all that encouraging. South Sudan became independent following a referendum in 2011 and two years later descended into a civil war that has displaced millions.Iraqi Kurds had their own civil war in the 1990s. The Kurdistan region remains divided between western areas controlled by the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Mr. Barzani and eastern areas under the sway of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.The self-ruled region\u2019s institutions have been paralyzed by a political crisis that erupted in 2015, after Mr. Barzani\u2019s mandate expired. Kurdistan\u2019s parliament, which had planned a session to elect a successor, has been unable to meet for nearly two years because KDP forces prevent the entry of its speaker to the region\u2019s capital. Kurdistan\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections are slated for November, just weeks after the planned referendum.Mr. Barzani has called the long-promised independence vote just as protests against the political deadlock and corruption spread throughout Kurdistan. By doing so, he deftly exploited the Kurdish nationalist sentiment to stave off domestic unrest, at least for now.\u201cThe feeling of distrust was reaching a peak, and people were feeling that the Kurdish leadership was no longer entitled to lead the Kurdish national cause,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, a Kurdish-affairs specialist at the International Crisis Group. \u201cBut now the national feeling is prevailing, so far. The Kurdistan leaders have played this trick well.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-defeating-isis-together-iraqi-kurds-seek-divorce-from-baghdad-1498728603", "news_title": "After Defeating ISIS Together, Iraqi Kurds Seek Divorce From Baghdad", "keywords": "independence,kurdish,kurds,referendums,Haider al-Abadi,Masoud Barzani"}, {"content": "It\u2019s good to be in the graphics chip business these days. Sometimes too good.Graphics processors, otherwise known as GPUs, have long been the mainstay of personal computers tricked out for gaming. They are also now key components in the artificial intelligence systems being built into state-of-the-art data centers and self-driving cars. That has been driving up the stock prices of the two largest companies in the business\u2014            Nvidia                   and             Advanced Micro Devices.But some business also comes from less-than-stable corners. Graphics chips are also useful for a task called cryptocurrency mining. So-called \u201cminers\u201d are computers that match and update transactions for currencies such as bitcoin and the newly popular format called ethereum. A miner can earn rewards for that activity depending on the number of transactions processed and the value of the currency. Ethereum has proven to be the hottest money of late; its value surged from about $8 in January to just under $400 earlier this month.That has led to a spike in demand, as GPUs are particularly well suited for ethereum mining. Mitch Steves of RBC Capital estimates that about $100 million worth of GPU processors were added to the networks that mine Ethereum in just 11 days in early June. This has resulted in a shortage of GPU inventory, though neither Nvidia or AMD specifically market their products for this use.AMD in particular could use all the sales it can get. Its stock price has jumped more than 20% in just the last month, based on a mix of enthusiasm about digital currency mining as well as the launch of a new server chip that will challenge             Intel                   in a key market. Sharp gains over the last year, based on enthusiasm for several new chips, have driven AMD to about 95 times forward earnings\u2014a rich valuation to live up to.But while the recent rush of GPU sales will likely help both Nvidia and AMD in their next quarterly reports, investors should still be wary. The cryptocurrency markets have long been prone to wild swings\u2014ethereum is now about 23% off its peak from two weeks ago, according to CoinDesk. And recall that a spike in GPU demand for bitcoin mining in 2013 also proved to be short-lived. There are a lot of good reasons to be positive on the market for GPU chips.

Banking chiefs here have been left to wonder whether to accelerate plans to move operations into the EU.Earlier this week, Prime Minister       Theresa May      sealed a deal with a group of Northern Irish lawmakers that will keep her Conservative Party in government despite the loss of its parliamentary majority. But with Mrs. May\u2019s position weakened and a reshuffle of several high-level political backroom staff, the spectrum of Brexit outcomes facing banks has widened.The likelihood of the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal has increased, but equally so has the chance Britain could push for closer ties with the trading bloc, analysts and bankers say.\u201cA lot is open to debate again,\u201d says Stephen Adams, a partner at consultancy Global Counsel.Pressure from regulators is mounting. By July 14, financial firms in the U.K. must submit plans for life after Brexit to the Bank of England. In particular the central bank wants to know what lenders will do if the U.K. is suddenly cut off from the single market.Major banks have mostly drawn up their blueprints based on a worst-case scenario.             Morgan Stanley,       for instance, is expected to finalize a plan in the coming weeks to create a hub in Frankfurt and bulk up several European offices, according to people familiar with the matter. Japan\u2019s             Daiwa Securities Group Inc.       and             Nomura Holdings Inc.       both announced this week they will also look to move operations to Frankfurt.But the extent to which the banks will have to\u00a0execute these plans remains unknown. If the British government opts to negotiate close ties to the EU, then banks may be able to maintain a bigger chunk of their operations in the U.K.Summer drinks receptions around London\u2019s square mile this week were regularly punctuated with bankers lamenting Brexit uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who to call in government,\u201d says one public affairs chief at a major British bank. Another joked that the only person who would answer the banks calls was \u201cLarry,\u201d the Downing Street cat.Up until last month, investment banks in London were preparing for an exit from the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. Several lenders detailed plans to move operations and hundreds of staff into the EU to ensure they could sell to clients there. The lobbying battle had reduced to ensuring banks have enough time to restructure their operations before the U.K. formally quit the trading bloc.The surprise electoral result upended this. \u201cThe election results gave an opportunity to reflect and reset the tone as the U.K. enters negotiations,\u201d says Catherine McGuinness, Policy Chairman, City of London Corporation, which promotes the city as a financial services center.In the days after the vote, banks began to mull a public relations drive via trade associations to push the government to secure greater access to the EU for financial services and soften its stance on immigration, officials say. The momentum stalled as bank staffers struggled to get a clear understanding of the government\u2019s thinking on Brexit and which officials they should lobby, officials say.There have been wholesale changes in government, with key aides to Mrs. May resigning and a new City Minister, whose job is to manage relationships with financial services, appointed. It was the seventh new City Minister in five years.Some politicians have seemed open to the banks\u2019 demands.

Mr. Xi also said he would seek to ensure the stability of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement that gives Hong Kong citizens more freedom and rights than their mainland counterparts.Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, his first to Hong Kong as China\u2019s president, comes as mainland China is tightening its grip on the city of seven million. Last year, mainland authorities took steps to pave the way for the removal of lawmakers who questioned Beijing\u2019s authority from the local legislature. Beijing officials have also excoriated activists that it says are pushing for Hong Kong independence.Meantime, many of the leaders of the student-led protest movement that grabbed global attention in 2014 have faced prosecution, leading many Hong Kong residents to question the value of political activism. A pro-democracy rally is set for the July 1 anniversary, but some of its key organizers were arrested Wednesday after they staged a small sit-in.\u201cThe significance of the visit is to further show who is boss, show who is in control,\u201d said Kin-ming Liu, a longtime Hong Kong journalist turned consultant. Police have fanned out across town, blocking off parts of the normally bustling city.Since taking office in 2012, the 64-year-old son of a prominent Communist Party revolutionary has consolidated power, launching a far-reaching anticorruption campaign that often targeted political rivals. He has been recognized as the \u201ccore\u201d of party leadership, a designation that comes with sweeping decision-making power.During his three-day visit, Mr. Xi will oversee the swearing in of Hong Kong\u2019s new chief executive, Carrie Lam, who was widely seen in Hong Kong as Beijing\u2019s pick for the job. Ms. Lam is under pressure to introduce an antisedition law and a new national education curriculum that promotes China\u2019s Communist party, two measures that failed in the past after sparking protests.When Britain returned Hong Kong to China two decades ago, conventional wisdom was that the poor but fast-developing Communist mainland would converge with the richer, free-market Hong Kong; China would become more open and grounded in rule of law as its links to the global economy deepened.But while China\u2019s economic growth has surged, the country of 1.4 billion people has grown more authoritarian and assertive under Mr. Xi, sparking concerns in Hong Kong and elsewhere. In 2015, five Hong Kong booksellers were secreted to detention centers in China by Chinese agents. This year, a well-known mainland billionaire disappeared from a Hong Kong hotel under unclear circumstances and is believed to be detained or cooperating with anticorruption authorities in the mainland.In a statement, Hong Kong activists who organized the sit-in Wednesday called Beijing\u2019s government a \u201cbrutal regime\u201d that \u201cperverted Hong Kong people\u2019s civil and political rights.\u201d\u2014Jenny W.

Is the grain business one you would want to get into?This is roughly the situation the world\u2019s coal producers find themselves in with China, far and away the world\u2019s largest producer and user of coal, and which has been struggling with excess capacity at home for nearly half a decade. After warping global coal markets with ill-timed supply curbs in 2016, China is now poised to curtail coal imports. That could be bad news for commodities companies, particularly trading firms.The extent of the curbs remains unclear. Chinese state-owned media said Wednesday that many of China\u2019s small or midsize ports were already refusing imported coal shipments, although major ports appear to still be open. Even so, prices are already reacting: Asian benchmark coal futures are down around 4% over the past 10 days, while Chinese domestic prices have risen 2% to 4%.The Chinese authorities appear to be targeting dirty, low-quality coal with the import limits. State media said regulators want any benefit from its \u201csupply side reforms\u201d\u2014that is supply curbs\u2014to remain in China. Translation: higher coal prices and profits at home, not abroad. The Chinese coal sector is a major employer and a big source of bad debt, making its health a matter of national concern.Among commodity-producing nations, Indonesia will be the biggest loser. It sent piles of low-quality coal into China in late 2016 after China restricted its own mines\u2019 output. But coal traders like             Glencore                   and Noble could also be vulnerable: Noble\u2019s misreading of the market after last year\u2019s Chinese supply cuts is one reason the firm is now staring into the abyss.More generally, China\u2019s cavalier attitude toward the global consequences of its domestic policy-making for industries it dominates\u2014think steel, shipbuilding, solar panels and, increasingly, oil refining\u2014shows the danger of getting involved with any sector that China decides is strategic.China\u2019s environmental worries are real, and firms like Glencore may be smart to eye high-quality deposits like the ones it is currently bidding to buy from Rio Tinto\u2014which could pass muster with customs in both China and Japan\u2014if they want to stay in the coal business.But being in coal to begin with is a risky proposition these days: not just because of political risk related to climate change, but because of unpredictable Chinese regulators.An American Treasury secretary once said that the U.S. dollar is \u201cOur currency but your problem.\u201d China is essentially the Federal Reserve of coal\u2014everyone else is just a price taker both as a buyer or seller.

It is part of a plan to develop a \u201cglobal structure\u201d and a \u201cmultinational operation\u201d in keeping with China\u2019s ambition to become a force in the world auto industry, SAIC said.GM and SAIC are longstanding partners in China, where they jointly manufacture GM-badged and locally branded vehicles. Indian media reported that the Shanghai-based company is weighing whether to take over GM\u2019s recently closed plant in Gujarat or build new, and that it had tapped GM\u2019s former India president,       Rajeev Chaba,        to run its local unit.Just 3 million vehicles were sold in India in the 12 months ended March, compared with over 28 million in China in 2016.

SAIC already operates plants in Indonesia and Thailand, while manufacturers including Chery Automobile Co. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. have plants in a range of emerging markets.While India has obvious growth potential, SAIC will encounter \u201ccut-throat competition\u201d in a market where consumers demand not only low prices, but also aspirational products offering value for money, said       Anil Sharma,        principal analyst at IHS Markit.Indian buyers are agnostic when it comes to the origin of auto brands and would in theory embrace Chinese cars, Mr. Sharma said, though \u201cgood cars have failed in India before.\u201dSAIC\u2019s entry would be \u201ca litmus test for other Chinese auto makers,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, with more likely to pour into the country if SAIC prospers.\u2014Junya Qian contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-29 04:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-saic-plans-to-make-cars-in-india-1498723490", "news_title": "China\u2019s SAIC Plans to Make Cars in India", "keywords": "auto industry,auto market,auto sales,china auto exports,china auto makers,china car makers,chinese auto makers,chinese car makers,global auto market,global car market,gm,gm india,india car market,saic india,SAIC Motor,600104.SH,plans,strategy,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014One of the world\u2019s biggest satellite providers is betting big on in-flight broadband.Passengers used to watching movies or live sports on their smartphones at home or on the go have become increasingly frustrated when unable to stay connected when airborne.

Passengers \u201cwill have a high-quality Wi-Fi experience akin to a top-quality hotel or internet cafe,\u201d Inmarsat Chief Executive       Rupert Pearce       said in an interview.British Airways,        ICAGY -0.49%       a unit of International Continental Airlines Group SA, has committed to becoming the launch operator of the system on its short-haul planes. Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it would experiment with the system.The new satellite carries payloads for a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat and for Inmarsat, whose equipment serves as the key element of it in-flight connectivity offer. Inmarsat\u2019s dedicated in-flight system, called the European Aviation Network, relies on a network of terrestrial air-to-ground communications towers, built by             Deutsche Telekom AG      . The satellite link provides additional capacity and fills in the spots in Europe that the ground-towers can\u2019t cover. Using the ground towers will help cut costs, Mr. Pearce said, helping fuel passengers use of the service.The European Aviation Network could serve as a blueprint for the company to target other regions. \u201cThere is an opportunity to take that knowledge to work in other markets and North America could be one of them,\u201d Mr. Pearce said.Gogo Inc.,       which provides internet in the U.S. on planes from             American Airlines Group Inc.,Delta Air Lines Inc.       and others, has disappointed main travelers because of limited capacity and low speed. Gogo last year signed a contract with global satellite operator SES SA to boost bandwidth. SES last year also agreed to build a powerful new satellite to help France\u2019s             Thales SA       provide in-flight broadband equivalent to fiber connectivity starting in 2020.Inmarsat has made a big bet on providing broadband to planes. A series of other spacecraft, called Global Xpress, aim to beam the internet to planes, ships and users on the ground often in remote locations. The company this month announced it would buy a fifth of those spacecraft in a sign of confidence in the market.But its plans for Europe aren\u2019t without critics. Rival             ViaSat,       based in Carlsbad, Calif., said Inmarsat is violating key elements of its license, including relying too heavily on the ground portion. The company also has missed repeated milestones required by the license, said ViaSat president       Rick Baldridge.       Inmarsat\u2019s system \u201cis inconsistent with the initial tender,\u201d he said.ViaSat in April asked the European Court of Justice to instruct the European Commission to enforce Inmarsat\u2019s license rather than delegating that role to European Union member states.             Eutelsat,       ViaSat\u2019s European partner to provide in-flight broadband in Europe, is joining the case. The two are providing service to European airline             Finnair                   and El Al Israel Airlines Ltd.Mr. Pearce plays down the attack, saying rivals that are behind in deploying their own systems are using legal maneuvers to derail Inmarsat. \u201cTheir claims are completely false and without merit,\u201d he said.To avoid delays to its service, Inmarsat last year moved the launch of the European Aviation Network spacecraft to Ariane 5 rocket from the Falcon 9 made by       Elon Musk\u2019s       Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, as the U.S. rocket company had suffered an explosion during a fueling exercise in September at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Inmarsat worried SpaceX launches would be delayed as the company returned to flight.The satellite will undergo checks in the next few months before it is set to become operational in September. Inmarsat also still needs some European regulators to sign off on elements of its hybrid system. Although the space element has received all approvals, some regulators in big markets such as Germany and France still need to approve the use of the terrestrial system.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 03:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inmarsat-ceo-promises-top-quality-wi-fi-experience-in-flight-1498720304", "news_title": "Inmarsat Aims High on In-Flight Wi-Fi", "keywords": "inmarsat,internet coonection on planes,movies on plane,International Consolidated Airlines Group,IAG.LN,Inmarsat,ISAT.LN,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,computers,consumer electronics,networking,telecommunications technology,equipment,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,satellite telecommunications,air transport,broadband infrastructure,computing,technology,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "An FBI agent was indicted on charges that he failed to tell investigators he fired two shots at the scene of a fatal police shootout last year with a group occupying an Oregon wildlife refuge.The agent, W. Joseph Astarita, was charged by a federal grand jury with three counts of making false statements to Justice Department investigators and two counts of intent to obstruct justice, according to an indictment unsealed Wednesday.The Jan. 26, 2016, highway confrontation left 54-year-old Robert LaVoy Finicum dead and eventually brought to an end the 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge led by       Ammon Bundy,        a standoff that drew national attention and prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to intervene. A state and local investigation last year determined bullets from the Oregon State Police killed Mr. Finicum, in a justified manner.Wednesday\u2019s indictment revived allegations by antigovernment activists that federal officials precipitated the violent encounter. Friends and family of the slain Arizona rancher have previously criticized the highway confrontation.Mr. Astarita, who worked for the FBI\u2019s Hostage Rescue Team at the time, pleaded not guilty to the charges in an appearance Wednesday in U.S. District Court. The charges carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted. Trial was set for Aug. 29.Mr. Astarita didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking a comment, and FBI officials referred questions to the Justice Department.At a press briefing in Portland,       Billy Williams,        the U.S.\u00a0attorney for Oregon, wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny additional possible indictments in the case.The unsealed indictment says neither of the two shots allegedly fired by the FBI agent hit Mr. Finicum, although one did pass through the roof of his truck.Investigators had previously concluded that Mr. Finicum was fatally wounded by Oregon state police after he tried to drive a van through a roadblock police had set up to apprehend the leaders of the occupation. An investigation by Oregon state police and the Deschutes County sheriff\u2019s office found that the fatal shots were fired by state police while Mr. Finicum was attempting to reach for a handgun in his jacket.Mr. Bundy was arrested in the highway stop but was later acquitted, along with six co-defendants, of charges related to the Malheur refuge occupation, which he organized to protest federal land policies in the West.Mr. Bundy\u2019s supporters say the indictment of the FBI agent supports their belief that law-enforcement officers used excessive force in the highway stop, which occurred as leaders of the refuge takeover were en route to a meeting with sympathizers in a nearby county.\u201cIt\u2019s all corruption, the whole government is corrupt,\u201d said Jeff Banta, a 48-year-old carpenter from Yerington, Nev., who was one of the takeover defendants acquitted last year.According to the indictment, Mr. Astarita falsely told three FBI supervising agents that he hadn\u2019t fired the two shots. In so doing, the indictment said, he acted with the intent to prevent information from being made available to investigators relating to the possible commission of a federal offense.Mr. Bundy, along with his father, Cliven, and brother Ryan remain in federal custody in Las Vegas, Nev., awaiting trial on charges related to a 2014 standoff with federal officers near the family\u2019s ranch in southern Nevada.The Bundys and the other defendants have all pleaded not guilty to the charges.Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-29 00:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-agent-charged-over-oregon-refuge-standoff-shooting-1498709914", "news_title": "FBI Agent Charged Over Oregon Refuge Standoff Shooting ", "keywords": "bundy oregon occupation,malheur national wildlife refuge,oregun refuge occupation ,Federal Bureau of Investigation,Oregon State Police,Ammon Bundy,political,general news,crime,legal action,natural environment,murder,manslaughter"}, {"content": "Big U.S. banks plan to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks after the Fed approved capital plans for all 34 firms taking part in stress tests.Berkshire is on track to become Bank of America\u2019s top shareholder after the lender received permission to increase its dividend.Central-bank officials left investors with mixed impressions about stimulus plans, roiling currencies and bond markets.Sycamore agreed to buy Staples for about $6.9 billion, a bold bet on a firm whose sales have been shrinking.A U.K. regulator blasted the nation\u2019s asset-management industry and called for remedies to drive competition and performance.Booming demand for passive investments is making ETFs an increasingly crucial driver of share prices.Blue Apron stumbled in its IPO, a caution to firms seeking to live up to private valuations in the public markets.Tech and bank shares rallied, leading broad gains in U.S. stocks.
