Lam, most recently Hong Kong's number two official, has to unify the Chinese-ruled city as public resentment swells at Beijing's growing interference in its affairs despite being promised a high degree of autonomy. She also has to reinvigorate the economy and address growing social inequalities and high property prices, issues Chinese President Xi Jinping highlighted at her swearing-in ceremony. Several sources who have worked with Lam say she's intelligent, hard-working and able to push controversial government policies, earning her the trust of Beijing factions who strongly lobbied for votes on her behalf when she was chosen in March. But her hardline and pro-Beijing tendencies, say critics and opposition democrats, risk sowing further social divisions in the former British colony that returned to China 20 years ago under a  one country, two systems  formula that guarantees it wide-ranging freedoms.   Carrie Lam ... is a nightmare for Hong Kong,  said student activist Joshua Wong in March, one of the leaders of the student-led  Umbrella Movement  protests in 2014 which blocked the streets for 79 days demanding full democracy.  Theoretically, the chief executive is a bridge between the central government and the Hong Kong people. But Lam will be a tilted bridge. She will only tell us what Beijing wants, and won't reflect what the people want to the communist regime.  Lam, dubbed  the fighter  by media, was once the most popular official in the cabinet of staunchly pro-Beijing former chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, who in 2012 won a similar election restricted to just 1,200 voters.  Picking Carrie as chief secretary was Leung's best appointment,  said a senior government official who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. But she could also sometimes be a  bully , he added.

Her attempt to push through a planned Palace Museum in Hong Kong, showing artefacts from the museum in Beijing's Forbidden City, was criticized for being presented as a done deal without public consultation, highlighting what some describe as her  autocratic  style, according to a source who knows her. Slideshow (6 Images)She is not well regarded by the opposition democratic camp, with most of the 300 or so democrats seen having voted for former Financial Secretary John Tsang. The bespectacled Lam was also criticized by student leaders for being  vague  after their televised meeting failed to defuse the 2014 protests. The demonstration ran out of steam two months later and ended with police clearing the streets. During her campaign, Lam attempted to present a softer, more populist image, but was ridiculed for gaffes including not appearing to know how to use subway turnstiles. She was also lampooned for a late-night hunt for toilet paper which took her to her posh former home on the Peak after she failed to find any at a convenience store. The daughter of a Shanghainese immigrant who worked on ships and a mother who had never received a formal education, Lam grew up in a cramped apartment shared by four siblings and several families. A devout Catholic and a student of sociology at the University of Hong Kong, Lam took part in social activism before joining the government. She is married with two sons. Lam joins a select group of female leaders who have risen to the top job in Asia in recent years including Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, hugely distrusted by China, and ousted South Korean president Park Geun-hye, who angered Beijing with her plans to deploy a U.S. missile defense system to counter the threat from North Korea.

Since at least May, hackers used tainted  phishing  emails to  harvest credentials  so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.  A virus dubbed  NotPetya  attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories.  On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E; News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators. Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E; News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.  Department of Homeland Security emblem is pictured at the National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) located just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia September 24, 2010.Hyungwon Kang/File PhotoThe activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.  Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.  U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG (PEG.N), SCANA Corp (SCG.N) and Entergy Corp (ETR.N) said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said. A projection of cyber code on a hooded man is pictured in this illustration picture taken on May 13,  2017.Kacper Pempel/IllustrationAnother nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy (D.N), said it does not comment on cyber security.  Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe.  Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create  decoy documents  on topics of interest to their targets. In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

Feldman's side work with pitching coach Mack Jenkins paid off Friday night when he had Chicago Cubs hitters flailing for most of his seven innings. Adam Duvall hit a three-run homer and Feldman tossed seven shutout innings to lift the Reds to a 5-0 victory over the Cubs in the opener of a three-game series at Great American Ball Park. Feldman (7-5) allowed only two hits through seven innings with two walks and seven strikeouts. He held his former club hitless into the sixth inning.  I kind of lost feel for that breaking ball especially to righties the past two or three starts, but my fastball command was better so I was getting away with it,  Feldman said.  We kind of worked on it in between. It was better tonight.  Chicago (40-40) has won 23 of the past 29 meetings with the Reds but couldn't get anything going offensively without third baseman Kris Bryant, who is recovering from a sprained right ankle. The Cubs managed only three hits. Feldman didn't allow a hit until Ian Happ's single with two outs in the sixth inning, which put runners at first and third. But Anthony Rizzo lined to Billy Hamilton in center to end the inning. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at RedsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchThe Reds' rotation ranks last in the major leagues with a 6.29 ERA. Feldman's ERA now is 3.78.  We're lucky to have him,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  With everything that's gone on, the one constant has been the quality of Scott Feldman.  A perfectly executed squeeze bunt by Jose Peraza allowed Duvall to score from third in the bottom of the sixth, increasing the Reds' lead to 4-0. It was the second successful squeeze by Cincinnati this season.  I'm not a part of too many of those,  Duvall said.  It gets your adrenaline going and your blood pumping.  Cubs starter Mike Montgomery (1-5) made his fifth start since being moved into the rotation and allowed four earned runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out seven. Cincinnati (34-45) scratched across another run in the eighth when Joey Votto doubled for the second time in the game, stole third and scored on catcher Victor Caratini's throwing error. Caratini was making his first major league start.  He did a real nice job,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon.  I thought he had a good way about it, he was not overwhelmed by anything. He caught a good game.  Montgomery allowed three straight hits to begin the fourth inning, one a double by Hamilton, who was thrown out trying for a triple by center fielder Albert Almora Jr. as Javier Baez made a lunging tag. With runners on second and third, Duvall lined a 1-1 changeup from Montgomery to the opposite field for a three-run homer, putting Cincinnati ahead 3-0. It was Duvall's 19th home run this season.  I thought I did a good job early,  Montgomery said.  I made one mistake to Duvall, left it out and over. They just had some of those hits where I didn't make a bad pitch, they just hit it where we weren't.  Montgomery needed 31 pitches to get through the fourth, in which he allowed three runs and five hits with a walk. Feldman, meanwhile, allowed no hits with two walks and five strikeouts through five innings. The Cubs didn't come close to a hit aside from Caratini's bloop to left in the fifth inning that landed a foot foul.  He took advantage out of our aggressiveness and really got us to chase a lot out of the zone,  Maddon said.  He knew what he was doing. He used our aggressiveness against us.

The Reds announced RHP Jackson Stephens will start Saturday in his major league debut. ... Cubs 2B Ian Happ starred at the University of Cincinnati. ... Cubs RHP Kyle Hendricks played catch from 120 feet. He's expected to throw off the mound at Wrigley Field on Tuesday or Wednesday. ...

Francis' appointment of Pell, dogged for many years by victims' allegations that he shielded abusers and had himself molested two young boys in the 1960s, underscores a lack of sufficient vetting for top Vatican posts, Vatican sources said. Pell, appointed as Francis' economy minister in 2014, has always strongly denied he molested children or turned a blind eye to abuses. On Thursday, Australian police charged him with historical sex crimes after a two-year investigation. The charges bring the Church's global abuse scandal to the heart of the Vatican and, according to victims and their advocates, weaken the pope's credibility in tackling a decades-old crisis against which he vowed  zero tolerance .  I think his legacy is under severe threat,  said Peter Saunders, a victim of clergy abuse who took a leave of absence from the papal advisory commission on abuse last year in protest over a lack of progress.  I genuinely thought when I met with Francis three years ago that 'this man is the real deal' and he is going to get on with things and I really thought there was a prospect of real, significant, and rapid change,  Saunders, a Briton, said in a telephone interview.  But he is surrounded by people who don't want change.  The affair threatens to overshadow accolades the Argentine pope has won since his election in 2013 for bringing the Church closer to the poor and migrants and making it more welcoming to those who felt excluded in the past, such as homosexuals Church sexual abuse broke into the open in the United States with reports of cases in Louisiana in 1984 and exploded in 2002, when journalists in Boston found that bishops had systematically moved abusers to new posts instead of defrocking them. Thousands of cases have come to light around the world as investigations have encouraged long-silent victims to go public, shattering the Church's reputation in places such as Ireland, and more than $2 billion has been paid in compensation Pell, 76, has taken a leave of absence in order to return to Australia, saying:  I am looking forward finally to having my day in court. I repeat that I am innocent of these charges.  Victims groups have accused Pell of mishandling cases of abuse when he was in Australia as archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney.  Catastrophic Choices  Pope Francis leads his Wednesday general audience in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican June 21, 2017.Tony GentilePell told an Australian inquiry last year that the Church had made  catastrophic  choices by refusing to believe abused children, shuffling abusive priests from parish to parish, and relying too heavily on the counsel of priests to solve the problem. He denied involvement in any cover-up. Australian police did not detail the charges or specify the ages of the alleged victims or the period when the crimes were alleged to have occurred. Pell was ordered to appear before Melbourne Magistrates' Court on July 26. Marie Collins of Ireland, another non-clerical member of the Vatican commission Francis established in 2014, and also a victim of priestly abuse when she was a child, quit in frustration in March, citing a  shameful  lack of cooperation within the Vatican..  What I have no hesitation in saying is that it has been proved that Cardinal Pell is guilty of the appalling mishandling of cases of abuse when still in place in Australia and causing untold pain to the victims in those cases,  she wrote on her  website.  The fact that Cardinal Pell was appointed to a very senior post in the Vatican rather than having to face any sanction for his mishandling of abuse cases was a slap in the face to all those he had let down so badly,  she wrote. Slideshow (3 Images)The Pell case also pointed to what Vatican insiders says is an inherently opaque and lax system for the appointment of some officials and a tendency to look the other way if the pope really wants someone whose past may be less than limpid.  There really is no structured vetting process for top Vatican jobs as there is for when a priest is made a bishop or when a bishop is made a cardinal,  said a Vatican source who follows abuse cases.  When someone is already a cardinal, as Pell was in Sydney, the feeling is that there is little left to vet,  the priest said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the Pell case. Ex-Footballer Francis was impressed by Pell when they met in 2013. In meetings among cardinals before the conclave that elected Francis pope that year, the former Australian Rules football player stood out not only for his height and broad shoulders but also for his command of financial matters.     After becoming pope, Francis, hoping to put an end to Vatican financial scandals, moved Pell to Rome to head a new ministry, the Secretariat for the Economy.  More than a decade earlier, in 2002, Pell, the then archbishop of Sydney, faced an internal Church investigation relating to allegations that he had molested two boys at a holiday camp in the early 1960s when he was a trainee priest. A retired Australian judge, Alex Southwell, ran a closed hearing at a Melbourne hotel. He wrote in his findings that the alleged victim appeared to be telling the truth but that there was no evidence to substantiate it. He concluded that he was  not satisfied the complaint has been established , citing lack of evidence, Pell's sworn denial and the complainant's later alcoholism and criminal history. additional reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney; editing by Mark Bendeich and Ralph Boulton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-abuse-pell-idUSKBN19L2OJ"},

Its supporters will say the unpredictability adds to the spectacle, while detractors will point to the fact that, unlike in the men's game which is still in the midst of a golden era, there are few players capable of carrying the sport forward. With Serena on maternity leave since winning a 23rd major title at this year's Australian Open, the door has been open for a bunch of new names to barge through. Jelena Ostapenko did it at the French Open in stunning style to take the title, prompting none other than Chris Evert to proclaim the birth of a new star. Only time will prove whether the 20-year-old Latvian can establish herself as a consistent grand slam challenger. In the past years that has been something beyond pretty everyone apart from Williams, Maria Sharapova, who will be missing from Wimbledon as she makes a stuttering return from a doping ban, and former world number one Victoria Azarenka who is in the early days of a comeback from having a baby. Current world number one Angelique Kerber enjoyed an incredible 2016, winning two majors, but has struggled badly this year. The same can be said of Spain's Garbine Muguruza who has faded since winning the 2016 French Open. Twice champion Petra Kvitova returns to Wimbledon having recovered from injuries sustained in a stabbing last December and the fact that she is being tipped as favorite by many speaks volumes for the vacuum that currently exists. New Brigade  I said that at least 30 women could win the French, and I wouldn't even have put Ostapenko's name on the 30 because she hadn't won a WTA tournament,  former world number four Gilbert, who will be one of ESPN's analysts during Wimbledon, said this week as he looked ahead to the championships.

The field, without a doubt, is the clear favorite.  Incredibly, since Williams won the Australian Open no fewer than 22 players have won titles on the WTA Tour. Only world number five Elina Svitolina from Ukraine, with four, and Russian world number 17 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, with two, have managed multiple titles since the Australian Open. FILE PHOTO: Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 10, 2017.  Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko celebrates with the trophy after winning the final against Romania’s Simona Halep.Benoit Tessier/File Photo I think at the top of the game, it's very chaotic right now. I think there's a lot of fragility,  18-times grand slam winner Evert told an ESPN conference call.  I think the players that have been at the top have not lived up to their billing. I feel terrible saying that, but everyone who's reached number one, they haven't carried on the momentum, and they haven't stepped up and really embraced that position of leadership on and off the court.  You really can't count on any one player right now like you could count on Serena in the past.  There are signs though that a brash new brigade, led by Ostapenko, could start to usher the old guard, the likes of the still dangerous Svetlana Kuznetsova, Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwanska, out of the limelight.

The alliance, which comprises Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru, on Friday admitted Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Canada as associate members in a first step to broadening the reach of its trade flows and investments. Better market access and lower tariffs for exporters would be a major boost for Australia and New Zealand, which have been at the forefront of attempts to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in January. “The Pacific Alliance is a grouping of fast-growing, like-minded economies committed to the liberalization of trade,” New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay said in a statement. “Between them they have more than 221 million consumers and a combined GDP of $3.85 trillion, which is equivalent to the world’s sixth largest economy.” Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo said a successful free trade agreement would help lift high tariffs on Australian beef, dairy and service exports like mining. “Importantly, this FTA will open the door to Mexico for Australian exporters,” Ciobo said. Alliance members are among the keenest proponents of free trade in the Americas.  As well as reducing trade barriers, the bloc has sought to integrate in other areas, such as financial markets and free movement of people.

Shipments surged 13.7 percent to $51.41 billion from a year earlier, while imports jumped a faster 18 percent to $40.01 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $11.40 billion, government data showed on Saturday. Although June exports growth slightly missed a 17.1 percent expansion seen in a Reuters survey, double-digit growth for a sixth month in a row marks the longest stretch of expansion at such a pace since September 2011, an indication that the economy is gathering momentum.  South Korea's foreign trade is boosting the overall performance of the economy, thanks to increasing prices of memory chips and demand for petrochemical goods,  Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at HI Investment & Securities, said after the release.  Risks ahead include sliding oil prices, which may slow shipment growth in the second half. We still need to see some stronger demand for consumer goods to be able to say that the overall growth is strong.  The trade ministry expects exports to jump 10 percent this year, although uncertainties related to global oil prices and protectionist measures by the U.S. could limit trade expansion. Policymakers are cautiously watching Washington's next move on the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, after President Donald Trump told Reuters on April 28 that he will either renegotiate or terminate what he called a  horrible  deal. Trump told South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Washington on Friday the United States was renegotiating a  rough  trade deal with South Korea. In June, exports to the U.S. slipped 1.1 percent on-year, while shipments to China and the EU rose by 5.1 percent and 21.1 percent respectively, the trade ministry data showed. Of the nation's 13 major exports items, 10 items, including semiconductors, shipbuilding and petrochemical goods, surged. Exports of semiconductors soared 52 percent in June on-year, while shipbuilding and petrochemical goods were up 43.2 percent and 15.6 percent each. Imports surged for an eighth straight month, the longest stretch of growth since September 2014, signalling a rebound in domestic demand. Imports of consumer goods posted mere 1.5 percent growth in June, lagging behind a 41.8 percent surge in imports of capital goods, including components needed in production of memory chips.  Private consumption is improving, but at a much slower pace than external demand,  Park at HI Investment & Securities said. South Korea's industrial output barely gained in May after posting unexpected declines in April despite surging exports, as demand for consumer goods remained weak.

The announcement, timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, marks the latest step in the opening up of China's capital markets. It follows the introduction of similar programmes allowing two-way trading between stock markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai and Shenzhen. As previously announced by regulators, trading through the programme will initially commence  Northbound , meaning foreign investors will be able to buy and sell Chinese bonds. The authorities have not yet indicated when Chinese investors will be able to trade Hong Kong and overseas bonds, known as  Southbound  trading. Access to China's bond market through the programme will remain restricted to overseas institutional investors such as banks, insurance companies, securities companies and fund managers. Trades through the  Bond Connect  will not be subject to quotas. China granted eligible foreign institutional investors access to its interbank bond market in 2016, but the  Bond Connect  should add another, more convenient channel for foreigners looking to access the world's third largest bond market via Hong Kong, the regulators have said. However, market participants expect muted uptake of Chinese onshore bonds initially, due to ongoing fears over the depreciation of the yuan amid capital outflows and other technical investment hurdles. The People's Bank of China has taken steps to support the yuan, moving in May to set it daily at the mid-point and raising the cost of short-selling the currency. While pressure on the yuan has eased recently, authorities have continued to see the  Bond Connect  programme as an opportunity to attract global capital inflows. Eligible offshore investors will be able to conduct trades through the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) through Tradeweb, a fixed-income trading platform. Tradeweb is majority-owned by Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News. Separately, China's insurance regulator said in a statement late Friday that mainland Chinese insurance companies will be allowed to invest in Hong Kong shares via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect.

Flash purchasing managers' indexes for services in Europe in June, for example, were weaker than anyone in a Reuters poll had predicted, but the market paid scant attention.  Way below expectations, but let's not worry,  was the mantra. Such economic Panglossianism - all for the best in the best of all worlds - is based on what seems to be a majority view among policymakers and economists that the world is enjoying a broad expansion.  Faster growth this year reflects a synchronized improvement across both advanced and emerging market economies,  Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings' chief economist, wrote in an outlook projecting 2017 would have the fastest world growth - 2.9 percent - since 2010. Backing up this view, central banks in the United States, euro zone and Britain are leaning toward tightening, albeit with a cacophony of mixed signals about when. Financial markets are now pricing in a 90 percent chance of a euro zone rate hike by July next year, for example, to go with the Federal Reserve's ongoing upward tweaks. There are, however, some inconvenient trends out there that will need consideration in the second half. First, there have been some signs of a dip in economic activity, while inflation remains, in most places, stubbornly nonchalant toward the huge monetary stimulus thrown at it. The Citi Economic Surprise Index, which moves in tandem with data beating or underclubbing expectations, has plunged for the main industrial nations this year and is at negative levels not seen since 2011.  Real U.S. gross domestic product has been increasing, but the pace has been slower in each of the past two quarters up to the fairly slow annualized 1.4 percent in January-March. A report by the Atlanta Fed suggests second quarter growth will bounce back - but as a result of stronger home sales, a reflection of cheap money, offsetting sluggish equipment and inventory investment. Durable goods orders declined sharply and jobs growth slowed at their last readings.  In the euro zone, the overall picture is relatively positive with a current 1.9 percent year-on-year growth rate - but there are centers of trouble, such as in Italy, the bloc's third largest economy. And while deflation may have gone, inflation is still below target. FILE PHOTO: Ships are seen in New York Harbor in New York City, U.S. June 27, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe jobless rate is lower, but still above 9 percent (twice that for the young), consumer spending has been easing and wage growth is stubbornly slow. China, meanwhile, has avoided the slowdown some feared. Indeed, factories grew at their quickest pace in three month in June. But an official crackdown on excessive debt and shadow banking has been enough of a risk to economic stability to make the central bank cautious about taking further action, particularly ahead of this year's Communist Party Congress. In Japan, the government has raised its overall view of the economy because of growth in private consumption. But the latest data showed retail sales rising less than expected with slowing sales of durable goods and clothes. Britain, facing the huge unknown of leaving the European Union, is a case unto itself, with plummeting consumer confidence.  FILE PHOTO: Workers clean the windows of an apartment block in Beijing, China, June 27, 2017.Jason Lee/File PhotoCheck Up None of this is to say that the world economy is not in good shape, with (non-British) consumer and business confidence generally rising.  There are  mixed signals , David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote to clients, but these reflect  momentum softening in the margin, but still robust . But enough uncertainties exist for the Bank of International Settlements - the central bankers' banker - to warn of risks ahead from a turning financial cycle, unmanageable household debt, and weak productivity growth among others. These are hard to track, but there will be a number of data spot-checks in the coming week. Full purchasing manager indexes and equivalents such as Japan's Tankan will show whether manufacturing and services growth is keeping up with expectations or succumbing to a mild slowdown. Germany, France and Britain will also release their latest industrial output numbers. Finally, the end of the week brings the U.S. non-farm payrolls data for June. The number of new jobs is expected to rise from May's release, but still reflect a much lower pace of job creation than at the beginning of the year. In addition to the numbers, there will be talk. The Group of 20 nations meets in Berlin at the end of the week - seeking some kind of unity with U.S. President Donald Trump to keep things going through the second half and beyond.

Twice U.S. Women’s Amateur champion Kang and South Korean Kim took advantage of ideal morning conditions to card five-under-par 66 at Olympia Fields outside Chicago. Their seven-under 135 total stood up for the rest of the day, the pair leading by one stroke ahead of the South Korean trio of Amy Yang, Chella Choi and Lee Mi-hyang, as well as England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff and American Brittany Lincicome. New world number one Ryu So-yeon and defending champion Brooke Henderson are among a group two back, with ex number one Lydia Ko and Michelle Wie trailing by three. California-born Kang, a first generation American of Korean descent who was expected to take the tour by storm when she turned pro in 2011, is still seeking her first LPGA victory at the age of 24, though her progress has been halted by injury. Playing with her left wrist heavily strapped after suffering a fracture last year, she described her condition as “playable.” “As long as doctors give me the green light, I don’t think about it,” said Kang, whose hobbies include playing the piano and saxophone. “All the doctors, they ask: ‘How is it?’ and I say pain is mental. So if I don’t acknowledge it, it will just go away.” Jun 30, 2017; Olympia Fields, IL, USA; Danielle Kang tees off on the seventh tee during the second round of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship golf tournament at Olympia Fields Country Club - North.

My day was really relaxing. It was stressful but relaxing. I kept giving myself birdie opportunities.” Co-leader Kim, the 2015 LPGA Rookie of the Year, bounced back into position to challenge for the title, having finished runner-up in this event two years ago.

That was key.” Fellow South Korean Ryu eagled the par-five 18th, where she sank a 10-foot putt after a brilliant five-wood second shot.

U.S. fund investors put the most money into overseas equities since the second quarter in 2015, with more than half of the $90 billion outflows for the first half coming in the second quarter, according to preliminary Lipper data. The MSCI Emerging market index .MSCIEF has risen 17 percent year-to-date compared with a 4.9 percent rise for Europe's Stoxx 600  index and the S&P; 500 index's 8.0 percent gain. Since emerging market central banks have been lowering interest rates and their currencies have been falling in recent years this is now helping to boost economic growth, according to Northwestern Mutual's Chief Investment Strategist, Brent Schutte. But still the emerging market index is roughly 25 percent off its all-time high reached in 2007 while the Stoxx 600 is 8.0 percent off its record high. In comparison the S&P; 500 is just 1.0 percent below its latest record, reached in June 2017.  The overseas indexes could reach new record highs over the next two years, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago citing improving growth.   Finally the recovery has really picked up in the rest of the world. It's moving along faster than the U.S. because it's trailed. The U.S. is further along because the central bank here really was aggressive in quantitative easing first,  said Ablin. For the second quarter, revenue for companies in European markets are expected to grow 5.8 percent compared with 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 index companies and 11.5 percent for emerging markets in the Asia Pacific Region, according to Reuters data.  Earnings estimates for European companies for the period stand out with a 13.5 percent jump seen compared with 8.0 percent growth expected for the S&P; 500 and 6.4 percent for emerging markets.      Northwestern Mutual's Schutte said his company is betting that outperformance in emerging market and European stocks should continue and cited a one-two year timeframe for investment in eurozone stocks in particular.  His firm started moving money into non-U.S. stocks around February 2016 when it replaced investments in U.S. real estate investment trusts with equities in international developed markets in expectation of improving earnings growth. However, not everybody is convinced that the attraction of European stocks will last as long. John Praveen, chief investment strategist at, Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey was wary of predicting European outperformance beyond the next quarter. Praveen expects strong earnings growth in both Europe and emerging markets this year. But he said potential headwinds in Europe could include a pull back in European Central Bank monetary policy accommodation or uncertainly around a national Italian election, required by the end of the first half of 2018.    But for now he said,  Their earnings outlook is stronger and their central bank is still providing quantitative easing liquidity while ours is raising rates and the Fed is starting normalization.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was being treated in the city of Shenyang for late-stage liver cancer after being granted medical parole, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday.  His physical condition is not good and has shifted to ascites due to cirrhosis,  the family member said in a message seen by Reuters, referring to a build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity caused by advanced liver scarring.  It seems his time is limited,  the message said. Two sources close to the family confirmed the authenticity of the message, which was sent late on Thursday, but asked that both their identities and the identity of the sender remain secret to avoid harassment from authorities. A man who answered the phone at the hospital where Liu is being treated said he was not aware of the case. Chinese authorities on Thursday told U.S., German and European Union diplomats that Liu could not be moved to get medical treatment elsewhere due to his illness and that his family agreed he should be treated where he is, a source briefed on the meeting told Reuters. Asked on Friday about China's discussions with other countries, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said:  The relevant issue is an internal affair of China's. I cannot see any need to discuss this with any other country.  The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, called on China to immediately grant Liu parole on humanitarian grounds, allow him to be treated overseas if he wished and freely communicate with the outside world. One source close to Liu's family said he did not consider the change in Liu's illness sufficient reason for him to want to stay in China.  Liu Xiaobo is not just looking for a place to die free; he also wants to find a means of freeing his wife and brother,  the source said. In a late Friday statement, the Shenyang legal bureau cited Liu's wife, Liu Xia, as saying she believed the hospital was doing all it could for her husband, thanked the medical experts and agreed to traditional Chinese medicine to help the treatment. Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize in 2010. Amnesty International told Reuters on Tuesday she had told Chinese authorities she wanted her husband to get treatment abroad. Western politicians and rights activists have voiced concern about the quality of Liu Xiaobo's treatment and should be allowed to leave China if that was the best option.  On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the United States would like to see Liu treated elsewhere, if that would help him. A German foreign ministry source on Thursday told Reuters Liu should receive the medical treatment that he needs and wants.

As Williams takes time out to give birth to her first child, last year's losing finalist and world number one Angelique Kerber could be regarded as the favorite but the German has endured a poor season, and is lacking both confidence and form.  It is pretty open, you see the results of the tournaments you just can't pick a winner because you never know what to expect, who is going to have the better week or two,  world number nine Dominika Cibulkova told Reuters.  It is about who is going to be the most consistent, solid and have the luck,  the Slovakian added.  Such is the absence of a clear favorite, that the bookmaker's current choice, Petra Kvitova, would have to produce one of the most remarkable comebacks the sport has ever seen to claim her third Wimbledon title. In December, her career was hanging by a thread after she was knifed during a break-in at her house in the Czech Republic, suffering serious tendon damage to her left hand. The 27-year-old returned to action at the French Open last month and suffered a second round defeat on the Parisian clay, but the two-times Wimbledon champion, who triumphed in 2011 and 2014, clearly loves grasscourt tennis. Despite playing down her chances and talking only of getting back into the groove, she stormed to the title in a warm-up event at Edgbaston last week, showing the kind of tennis that makes her such an formidable opponent on the quickest surface. Yet it was typical of the current state of the women's game that even Kvitova's re-emergence had a modicum of doubt cast over it when she withdrew from this week's event at Eastbourne with an abdominal strain.  I showed myself that I can play five matches in six days, but now I need a bit to relax to be ready. I know how tough it is to win a grand slam, so I'm not really seeing myself as one of the favorites right now,  she said. Her compatriot Karolina Pliskova has had a strong year and will be expected to make a deep run, the tall, big-hitter filling the role usually occupied by Russia's Maria Sharapova, whose return from a drugs ban has been stalled by injury. Pliskova made her grand slam breakthrough with a run to the U.S. Open final last year, beating Serena along the way, and followed up by making the quarter-finals in Australia and claiming two tour titles before going to the French Open. Tennis - WTA Premier - Aegon International - Devonshire Park Lawn Tennis Club, Eastbourne, Britain - June 28, 2017   Germany's Angelique Kerber in action during her first round match against Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova   Action Images via Reuters/Matthew ChildsHome Chances There she reached the last four and was only a painful semi-final defeat by Simona Halep away from becoming the world number one. However, Pliskova's record at the All England Club is poor and she has never advanced past the second round at Wimbledon in five main-draw appearances. There are also local hopes that Johanna Konta could be the first British winner since Virginia Wade in 1977 after a year in which she has established herself in the top 10 and enjoyed her biggest tournament win at the Miami Open in March. The 26-year-old has shown improvement in slams, reaching the semi-finals and quarter-finals at the past two Australian Opens and the fourth round at last year's U.S. Open. Although her second round exit last year was her best showing at Wimbledon, she has shown decent form in the warm-up events on grass, losing in the final at Nottingham and beating Kerber in the quarter-finals at Eastbourne. Runner-up in 2015, the tall Spaniard Garbine Muguruza must also be part of the conversation after solid showings in Australia and at Roland Garros. Kerber certainly cannot be ruled out if she can return to her form of last year, nor can Venus Williams, who despite being 37 has shown solid form throughout the season and thrives on a surface that has seen her win five Wimbledon titles. Latvian 20-year-old Jelena Ostapenko came from nowhere to win the French Open and the 2014 Wimbledon girls winner certainly can adjust to grass. The woman she beat in the final at Roland Garros, Romania's Halep, has yet to win a slam but she has a quarter and a semi under her belt at Wimbledon and is one of the hardest players to beat on the tour. Victoria Azarenka, returning to the circuit after giving birth to a son in December, has twice reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon but this year may come too soon in her comeback. Caroline Wozniacki and Svetlana Kuznetsova are both regular WTA Tour winners loaded with the experience to go far, while American Coco Vanderweghe loves the surface and is capable of beating anyone in the field on her day.

The seven-member board reduced the rate to 5.75 percent, meeting expectations of nine of 22 analysts in a Reuters survey published last week. The other 13 had predicted a cut of 25 basis points. The board's vote was split, with four calling for the 50 basis point cut and the other three for a smaller reduction. It was the sixth reduction in an easing cycle intended to bolster Latin America's fourth-largest economy, hit hard by the global fall in prices for crude oil as it struggles with high inflation. Bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria, reading from a statement, said the board took the decision after considering the  growing weakness of economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond that compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income caused by the fall in oil prices.  They also discussed how recent economic indicators show that there is  significant increase  in excess capacity of the economy. There was some uncertainty expressed over how quickly inflation would come down to the ideal level of 3 percent, the statement said. Echavarria indicated earlier this month the rate could come down to as low as 5.25 percent by yearend, but the board has not been unanimous in a decision since late last year. While policymakers are aware of the need to lower the cost of money to encourage consumer spending, it must ensure the decision does not end up stimulating inflation, which remains above the target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. The bank expects the economy to expand about 1.8 percent in 2017.   We won't strangle the economy to achieve 3 percent now, we will get there at some point in 2018,  Echavarria told reporters. He said the biggest complication to economic growth was now. Inflation expectations for the close of this year were up to 4.30 percent in the Reuters poll. Annual inflation in May reached 4.37 percent.

The series explored the complex tension and bad blood between the two Hollywood screen legends in the later years of their life, especially during their filming on 1962's  What Ever Happened to Baby Jane.  Critics warmly received the series, touting it as a strong contender for next month's Emmy nominations.   De Havilland's complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Representative for Murphy and FX Networks, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. In an April interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy said he did not contact de Havilland because he  didn't want to be disrespectful and ask her,  Did this happen? Did that happen? What was your take on that?   In the complaint, lawyers criticized Zeta-Jones' depiction of de Havilland giving an interview that they said had never taken place in real life, even though the series intended for viewers to believe it was true. The complaint adds that de Havilland was portrayed as a  petty gossip  in the show, which her lawyers argued was damaging to her  professional reputation for integrity, honesty, generosity, self-sacrifice and dignity.   The complaint requests a jury trial to determine damages that include emotional distress and economic losses as well as profits made by defendants using de Havilland's likeness. De Havilland, best known for the 1939 film  Gone With the Wind,  won two Oscars in a career spanning 50 movies that was also marked by a legendary feud with younger sister and fellow Oscar-winner Joan Fontaine that was worthy of a screenplay. Fontaine died in 2013. De Havilland moved to Paris in the 1950s, where she currently resides, and has only made rare public appearances since retiring.

The order by Judge Joan Lefkow also stipulated that Illinois send $2 billion to Medicaid providers during the fiscal year that starts on Saturday to pay down the existing $3.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the state's bills, said the ruling  takes the state’s finances from horrific to catastrophic  and called on state lawmakers to immediately pass a budget.  Payments to the state’s pension funds; state payroll including legislator pay; general state aid to schools and payments to local governments – in some combination – will likely have to be cut,  she said in a statement.  Payments to the state’s bond-holders will continue uninterrupted.  The decision came as Illinois lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a budget on Friday, leaving a state with the worst credit rating in the nation poised to enter a third-straight fiscal year without a full operating budget. Governor Bruce Rauner's office had no comment on the ruling. Lefkow had issued an order on June 7 that concluded Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid. That order allowed attorneys representing Illinois' 3 million Medicaid recipients to seek a subsequent order forcing the state to increase payments to managed-care organizations, which in turn pay doctors, hospitals and others. In her latest order, the judge said the state failed to offer a payment plan that would result in substantial compliance with the consent decrees that stemmed from lawsuits filed against Illinois in 1992. Attorneys representing Medicaid recipients said Illinois, which has been allocating only $160 million a month to the healthcare program, will be able to subsequently seek reimbursement for about half of the higher payment from the federal government.  “Without these payments, doctors, hospitals, clinics and other key healthcare providers would stop seeing Medicaid patients, or else simply go out of business altogether,” Tom Yates of the Legal Council for Health Justice said in a statement.

The record stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has put the third-most populous U.S. state's credit rating in peril of dropping to junk. House Republicans on Friday helped advance a Democratic-drafted $36.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins on Saturday, but the deal stalled with negotiations continuing over a revenue package and an assortment of non-budgetary matters sought by Rauner. After a 90-25 test vote on the spending bill, House Speaker Michael Madigan said his legislative chamber will return to session on Saturday, and he sent letters to major bond-rating agencies imploring them not to downgrade the state’s credit ratings to junk as budget talks continue. Related CoverageJudge orders Illinois to boost Medicaid bill paymentsThe impasse has ballooned the unpaid bill pile to nearly $15 billion as the state operated on spending mandated by state law and courts. Illinois, already the lowest-rated state, risked becoming the first U.S. state to have its credit downgraded to junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at Baa3 with a negative outlook, said the rating agency  won't refrain from changing a rating no matter the reason when it's appropriate to take action.  S&P;, which also rates Illinois one step above junk at BBB-minus, and Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, declined to comment on Madigan's letter. Ahead of the House vote, Republican leader Jim Durkin said he and others in his caucus would support the budget bill amendment as a gesture of “good faith” while talks continue on new taxes and non-budgetary reforms.   We are close,  he said on the House floor.  We are so close I can taste it.”  House budget votes require Republican support to meet a three-fifths majority needed for passage. “I think it’s a good step forward, a step we can build upon. There’s much work yet to be done,  Madigan said following the vote. A final affirmative vote by the House on the spending plan would send it back to the Senate for concurrence. The House must still take up a revenue bill increasing personal and corporate income tax rates to raise more money for the cash-strapped state.

Trump said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and reiterated that an era of  strategic patience  over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended.  Together we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea,  Trump said as he stood alongside Moon in the White House Rose Garden.  The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response.  Despite the tough rhetoric, it remains unclear how Trump will find a way forward on North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned the consequences of any military solution would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale.  Trump had pinned his hopes on persuading China, North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner, to do more to rein in Pyongyang, although he has lately grown frustrated that Beijing has not taken stronger action.  Trump called on regional powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea  choose a better path and do it quickly.  Moon, who warned of a  stern response  to any provocations, urged Pyongyang to return promptly to talks.  Our two leaders will employ both sanctions and dialogue in a phased and comprehensive approach,  Moon said of South Korea and the United States. Trump and Moon have said they are open to renewed dialogue with North Korea but only under circumstances that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its weapons programs. Moon told an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank that moves by North Korea that could create conditions for dialogue could include a freeze on its nuclear and missile tests, or the release of three Americans it is holding in the country. To be successful, talks would have to involve North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and have as their ultimate aim the complete dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program, he added.    Trump sought to woo China since a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April but the honeymoon period appears to be over. On Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan - decisions that angered Beijing. Steel and Autos U.S. President Donald Trump  (R) greets South Korean President Moon Jae-in prior to delivering a joint statement from the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 30, 2017.Jim BourgSouth Korea is a long-standing American ally but Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances and threatened to tear up the bilateral trade pact.  We will do more to remove barriers to reciprocal trade and market access,  Trump said, adding that the two leaders had talked about the thorny trade areas of steel and autos. Trump said he was encouraged by Moon's assurances that he would seek a level playing field for American workers and businesses, particularly automakers. A joint statement said the two sides had agreed to work together to reduce over supply of basic materials such as steel and non-tariff barriers. It also said Trump had accepted an invitation from Moon to visit South Korea this year.  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was unwise for Trump to air the trade issue so publicly. Slideshow (8 Images) Public complaints by Trump about unfair trade and inadequate defense spending provide opportunities for China and North Korea to drive a wedge between the allies,  she said. Trump also emphasized the need to ensure equitable sharing of costs for defense, returning to a theme he raised during his campaign and brought up with other allies, including NATO countries and Japan. A senior U.S. official said in a briefing before the president's meeting with Moon that South Korea was in many respects a  model ally,  given its spending of 2.7 percent of GDP on defense and Moon's plan to grow capabilities.  We shouldn't view South Korea as somehow laggard on that front,  the official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the U.S.-Korea free trade pact known as KORUS took effect in 2012. The agreement was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year, but in 2016 they were $3 billion lower than in 2011. At the start of Friday's talks, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the largest component of the deficit was automotive trade and many non-tariff barriers to U.S. auto exports to South Korea remained.  I think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad imports side,  he said. Ross said later on Friday that some progress had been made in the talks. The current pact was agreed to despite protests by supporters of Moon, who was then in opposition. But analysts have suggested that given the need to preserve a unified front in the face of a hostile North Korea, there could be compromise on both sides to resolve issues.

Mexico's peso slipped 0.41 percent against the dollar, but posted its second quarterly gain in a row after hitting a record low in January on fears that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric could hurt the country's economy.     Those fears have since abated thanks to a more conciliatory tone from U.S. officials, but Trump's vow to renegotiate or ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement continues to generate uncertainty for the outlook on the Mexican economy.     Crude futures rose for a seventh straight session, in their longest bull run since April. Shares of Petrobras rose 1.56 percent, lifting the Bovespa stock index 1 percent.     Shares of sewage and water utility Cia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo SA advanced 2.76 percent after regulators allowed a higher-than-expected increase in tariffs charged by peer Copasa, fueling optimism over the sector.     Shares of Cia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais, as Copasa is formally known, jumped 3.36 percent.     Still, traders remained fearful of further delays in the implementation of President Michel Temer's agenda of structural reform amid mounting corruption scandals.     The Brazilian real dipped 0.15 percent, weighed down by political concerns that drove its biggest quarterly loss in nearly two years.

World number 99 Lingmerth, whose only PGA Tour victory came at the 2015 Memorial Tournament, birdied three of his first five holes at TPC Potomac in Maryland en route to a round that matched Ogilvy for the day's lowest score. Lingmerth won here on the developmental Web.com Tour five years ago and once again enjoyed stellar ball-striking as he hit 10 of 14 fariways and 13 of 18 greens in regulation to double his overnight lead.  I feel like that's kind of one of my strengths, a thing I pride myself in, hitting a lot of fairways,  said Lingmerth.  I like this type of golf course when you can see the definition. You can zone in on your targets. You've really got to stay committed off the tee.  TPC Potomac is hosting the event for the first time and has been redesigned since it last welcomed the PGA Tour in 2006. As a result, Lingmerth, who does not have a top-10 finish on the PGA Tour all year, is more familiar with the course than most and has happy memories to draw from. World number nine Rickie Fowler (72), the highest-ranked player in the field, was 12 shots off the pace after a round in which his only blemishes were bogeys at the par-four sixth and 18th holes. Former U.S. Open champion Ogilvy, who has fallen from a career-high third in the world rankings to 231st, started from the 10th tee and birdied three of his first four holes en route to a bogey-free 65.  Very nice to get off to a start like that,  said Ogilvy,     who has eight PGA tour wins but only two since 2009.  You kind of want to get under before you get over on a course like this because it's kind of hard to catch up because it kind of beats you over the head all day.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with Trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve.  I had a good conversation today with President Trump,  Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  As a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,  Corker said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of Trump's  America First  platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world's largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, welcomed the administration's decision to drop the order.  Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, said that with four potential famines in the world  it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.  Corker has been pushing for years to reform the U.S. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. He said in his statement he looked forward to working with Congress and the administration to achieve  long overdue reforms.  After hearing about the possible executive order, several members of Congress called the White House to express their concern, congressional aides said.  The administration's budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. That plan was also met with stiff opposition in Congress, as lawmakers argued that  soft power  options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. Supporters say Trump's initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict.  Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. They said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

Plans call for the project, BEYGOOD4BURUNDI, to help build wells and improve hygiene education and water and sanitation facilities in schools, UNICEF and the U.S. star said in online statements. Two in five people in Burundi in East Africa have no access to clean water, and water- and sanitation-related diseases are among the leading causes of death among children in the nation of 12 million people, they said. One in 12 children in Burundi dies before age 5, according to UNICEF.  Access to water is a fundamental right. When you give children clean and safe water, you don't just give them life, you give them health, an education, and a brighter future,  Beyonce, 35, said in the statement. Beyonce, 35, said more than two million people in Burundi spend more than 30 minutes a day collecting water, forcing children to miss school and putting girls in particular danger as they walk miles in search of wells. One of the most popular singers in the world, Beyonce has sold more than 100 million records as a solo artist. She has three children, including twins born earlier this month, with her husband, rap star and entrepreneur Jay Z.  This unique partnership combines UNICEF's decades of expertise in providing clean water to children in Burundi and around the world with the power and influence of the entertainment world to bring about social change,  said Caryl Stern, chief executive of UNICEF USA, in a statement. Asked how much money the entertainer and UNICEF were putting toward the water project, neither the agency nor a representative for Beyonce responded immediately to requests for information. The first phase of BEYGOOD4BURUNDI focuses on four rural regions of the landlocked East African nation that has been racked by civil unrest and violence as well as drought and malnutrition. It was plunged into crisis in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he planned to run for a third term, which the opposition said was unconstitutional and violated a peace deal that had ended the country's civil war 10 years earlier. Nkurunziza was re-elected, but some opponents took up arms. At least 700 people have been killed, and rights groups estimate more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes.

Most of the funds will go to a two-year program by the British-based Halo Trust, a demining group, said New Zealand's foreign minister, Gerry Brownlee, in a statement. The balance will go to the United Nations in support of mine clearance in Colombia. Getting rid of mines is seen as critical for the South American nation of mountains and jungles to recover from its civil war, allowing for rural development and for millions of displaced people to return home safely.  More than 50 years of conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC) and the Colombian government has left the country heavily littered with mines, posing significant safety risk for its citizens,  said Brownlee, who was in Colombia attending the Pacific Alliance summit. Colombia's FARC rebels handed over all their weapons this week to the U.N. as part of a peace deal signed last year with the government. The move helps pave the way to expand mine clearance as security improves in areas once under rebel control.  Colombia's historic peace agreement has seen about 200 new municipalities become eligible for demining assistance but this requires a substantial increase in resources,  Brownlee said. After Cambodia and Afghanistan, Colombia has had the third highest number of landmine casualties, with more than 11,000 people killed or injured by landmines since 1990, government figures show. Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, this year pledged to make the country free of mines by 2021.   Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

This commission was formed to try to find basis for the lie that President Trump put forward that has no foundation,  Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told Reuters in an interview.     Republican Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. He established the panel by executive order in May despite evidence that voter fraud was  not widespread. Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sent a letter to all 50 states on Wednesday asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. The request from commission Vice Chairman Kris Kobach  caused a backlash in states including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, where election officials said they would not provide all the data.  California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said on Thursday that handing over information would only serve to legitimize debunked claims of widespread voter fraud.  More than 20 states said they would not or could not provide some or all of the information requested, according to statements from election officials and media reports. Some said certain data such as social security numbers were not publicly available and that they would turn over only public information. Others raised privacy concerns or questioned the need to examine voter fraud. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said in a statement that he had not seen the letter but would rebuff the commission.  They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,  he said. Kobach, the secretary of state for Kansas, has been a high-profile advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification. His office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Kobach was quoted in a Kansas City Star article as saying that his own state would not provide social security numbers at this time since they are not publicly available. Kobach did not rule out providing that information in the future.  In his letter, a copy of which was provided to Reuters by the Connecticut Secretary of State's office, Kobach also asked states for feedback on how to improve election integrity and for evidence of voter fraud and convictions of voter-related crimes since 2000. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the commission a tactic to suppress votes against Republicans.     States are right to balk at turning over massive reams of personal information in what clearly is a campaign to suppress the vote,  Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, said in a statement on Friday.          While the public availability of voter data varies by state, the request raises privacy concerns, said Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, professor who studies election law.

The filing regarding the former consultant, Ahmad Sheikhzadeh, does not contain criminal charges, but was made to support prosecutors' request for a tough prison sentence for him for tax fraud and conspiracy to violate sanctions against Iran. Sheikhzadeh pleaded guilty last November to the charges, which do not involve the Iranian nuclear program. In the filing, prosecutors said that, starting around 2005, Sheikhzadeh helped arrange meetings between the scientist and Iran's current president, Hassan Rouhani, previously the country's chief negotiator on nuclear issues, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, formerly Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations. Sheikhzadeh's lawyer, Steve Zissou, said on Friday,  The only goal Dr. Sheikhzadeh has ever had was to improve relations between the two countries so that they could both live in peace.  A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors did not name the scientist, who they said was an Iranian national who had worked at a U.S. nuclear power plant. They said the scientist, working with Sheikhzadeh, provided advice to help Iran negotiate with other countries over its nuclear program. For example, they said, he gave an estimate of how many gas centrifuges - devices used in enriching uranium - Iran would need to accomplish its nuclear goals. The scientist also helped develop Iran's public messaging around the nuclear program, prosecutors said. Iran reached a deal with the United States and other nations in 2015 to limit its nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the deal and in April ordered that it be reviewed. Federal guidelines call for a sentence of up to four years and nine months for the crimes Sheikhzadeh pleaded guilty to, but prosecutors on Friday said in their filing that his  brazen  conduct warranted more than that. Sheikhzadeh is scheduled to be sentenced on July 17 by U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn. Zissou asked in a letter filed with the court on Friday to postpone the sentencing in light of the new filing. Authorities originally charged that Sheikhzadeh under-reported his U.N. income on his personal tax returns. They also said he used his bank account to help U.S.-based co-conspirators invest money in Iran, violating sanctions.

The court decision follows a Reuters report that Venezuela is seeking to sell some $710 million in fixed-income securities back to Nomura, which originally issued them in 2008, to raise cash amid an economic crisis. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the request, according to court papers.  The company, which cited the Reuters report in its request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent it from collecting on the award.    The move is one of the most aggressive legal gambits to date by a company seeking compensation for a wave of nationalizations under the leadership of late Socialist leader Hugo Chavez.  The ruling further complicates Venezuela's efforts to raise cash from international financiers amid a crippling financial crisis. Opposition leaders are already urging banks not to finance Maduro's government, citing human rights violations that have been registered during the crackdown on three months of opposition protests. Crystallex, which cited the Reuters report in its request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent it from collecting on the award. Crystallex's dispute with Venezuela dates back to the 2008 nationalization of the Las Cristinas gold mine.  Around 20 companies have filed suits against Venezuela in the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, primarily to seek compensation for nationalizations under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Both Nomura and Venezuela will be able to respond to the restraining notices, Crystallex said in its request. Nomura and Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The talks revolve around $710 million in securities known as credit-linked notes that were issued by Nomura to Venezuela in 2008, according to a finance industry source. One of the notes has a face value of $390 million and matures at the end of 2018 while the other, with a face value of $320 million, matures in 2023, said the finance industry source, who asked not to be identified. Venezuela is seeking to sell those securities before they mature, the source said, effectively accepting a loss on the notes as a way of getting the cash back sooner. The government of President Nicolas Maduro is struggling under the collapse of the country's socialist economic model that suffers triple-digit inflation, chronic product shortages and rising incidence of malnutrition. Maduro insists his government is victim of an  economic war  and has lambasted the opposition's campaign to block financing deals. Julio Borges, head of the opposition-run Congress, this month publicly chided Nomura for participating along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a $2.9 billion bond operation in May.

Nike shares (NKE.N) rose 11 percent on Friday after the world's largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com (AMZN.O). Nike shares gave the biggest boost to the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. Even as technology shares limped through June, the sector has been the big story of the first six months of the year. Tech shares gained 16.4 percent in the first-half, double the S&P; 500's 8.2 percent rally so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 14.1 percent in the first half.  The S&P; technology index .SPLRCT ended down 0.1 percent on Friday, while for all of June it posted its first monthly loss of the year. A decline in biotech shares .NBI, which had surged of late, also limited the Nasdaq.  Are we going to see a broadening of the rally, where you see more of the financials and other sectors fill in some of the gaps?  said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.   It hasn’t been a broad encompassing rally, that I think investors will have to see a little bit more conviction rather than just in a handful of stocks,  Lancz said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 62.6 points, or 0.29 percent, to 21,349.63, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 3.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,423.41, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 3.93 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,140.42. Industrials .SPLRCI were the top-performing sector, rising 0.8 percent.  When you look at some of the stocks that are doing particularly well today, they are some of those economically sensitive-type stocks,  said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  The Goldman Sachs and Nike corporate logos are displayed on a post above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, September 11, 2013.Lucas Jackson During a time when it seems like there are still a fair amount of naysayers out there about the economy and GDP, anytime you get some of those stocks showing some strength, it probably emboldens the market,” Carlson said. The S&P; 500's percentage gain in the first half was its biggest since climbing 12.6 percent in the first six months of 2013. The Nasdaq posted its biggest first-half gain since 2009. U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion. The Commerce Department data bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter. Investors have been concerned about recent mixed economic data at a time that the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates from very low levels. The release of second-quarter corporate results is set to begin in earnest in the coming weeks, with S&P; 500 companies expected to post an 8 percent rise in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Investors have been looking for earnings to support historically high valuations. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with the long-term average of 15 times.  We can talk about the economy and geopolitical risk but earnings drive the market,  said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital Management in Sarasota, Florida.  We’re bumping right along the top end of  historic valuation levels. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The gunman, wearing a white medical lab coat, stalked two floors of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, in the New York borough of the Bronx, and tried to set himself on fire before police searching the building found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said. One female physician was shot to death, and six other people were wounded, five seriously, including one who was shot in the leg, O'Neill said at a news conference.  Mayor Bill de Blasio characterized the shooting as an  isolated incident  that appeared to be  a workplace-related matter.  He said that it was  not an act of terrorism.    One doctor is dead, and there are several doctors who are fighting for their lives right now amongst those who are wounded,  de Blasio told reporters.  This is a horrific situation unfolding in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort.  O'Neill said the gunman was armed with an assault rifle. Neither the mayor nor police immediately identified the suspect or any of the victims. O'Neill said the gunman was a former employee of the 972-bed hospital. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, in an interview with WABC News, identified the gunman as Dr. Henry Bello and said he had been fired by the hospital. Other media reports said Bello was 45 years of age. The New York Times and the New York Daily News reported, citing unnamed sources, that Bello had resigned from the hospital rather than face termination over accusations of sexual harassment. From Nigeria to Caribbean Medical School Police officers patrol the scene after an incident in which a gunman fired shots inside the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in New York City, U.S. June 30, 2017.Brendan McdermidBello had received a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate in order to gain experience so he could be fully licensed, but that permit expired a year ago, the Times reported. It said he also had a pharmacy technician license from California. The Daily News said he had been a pharmacy tech at the hospital before he quit in 2015. A native of Nigeria, Bello earned a medical degree from Ross University on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica and later worked briefly as a pharmacy technician for Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan in 2012, according to David Wims, a lawyer who represented Bello in an unemployment insurance claim against that hospital. In a telephone interview, Wims told Reuters Bello was injured on the job at Metropolitan a few months after being hired, then went on leave and never returned. In a decision upheld by the state's appellate court division, Bello ultimately was denied unemployment benefits on grounds he quit without good cause. Wims said he remembered Bello as  an even-keeled, respectful, humble person  and knew nothing of his history at the Bronx hospital. Slideshow (21 Images)Details about the shooting were still sketchy. Authorities said the rampage unfolded shortly before 3 p.m. when the gunman went on a rampage on the 16th and 17th floors of the hospital. He and the slain physician both were found on the 17th floor, while the six other victims were found on the 16th floor, O'Neill said. The incident sent waves of panic throughout the hospital, and police swarmed the building searching for the gunman.  People were running. People were afraid,  said Jane Vachara, 50, a clerical associate on the ninth floor, who said she huddled with colleagues in a locker room for about an hour. Adding to the pandemonium was the gunman's attempt to set himself ablaze, which apparently triggered the hospital's fire alarm system and halted elevator service, hampering efforts by first responders to reach victims and evacuate the building.

Cook County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Kubasiak granted the group of retailers a temporary restraining order on the penny-per-ounce county tax, which was to take effect on Saturday. The county gave notice it would appeal the judge's order and  aggressively defend  the tax, according to a statement from Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. The grocers filed the lawsuit on Tuesday, arguing the ordinance is  unconstitutionally vague,  difficult to implement and unlawful because it would tax similar beverages differently.  I believe that it's necessary to maintain the status quo in order to protect the interest of all consumers, all taxpayers and the affected merchants,  Kubasiak said. Cook County, which includes Chicago, joined a growing number of localities that have adopted measures to cut consumption of sugary drinks for health reasons, including Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. The Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the tax last November, lauding it as a benefit to public health and a way to boost revenue. It applies to bottled sweetened beverages including soda, sports drinks and energy drinks. The temporary restraining order was necessary because if the tax was implemented and then rescinded, it would be impossible for consumers to be refunded, David Ruskin, attorney for the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, said on Thursday. He also argued that failure to comply with an unlawfully vague tax could leave retailers vulnerable to  monumental  penalties. Cook County attorney Sisavanh Baker said Thursday the tax need not be perfect to be reasonable, and the county would lose about $17 million per month if the tax was shelved. Preckwinkle said in the statement that she has asked officials to consider ways of making up for the lost revenue, including potential personnel reductions. The lawsuit also argued that the tax could make retailers ineligible for participation in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which prohibits purchasing food that has a state or local sales tax. Attorney James Beligrates, who represents the county, said the lawsuit's assertion about SNAP, which helps millions of U.S. low-income individuals and families buy food, is a  red herring  because the county agreed retailers should not collect the sweetened beverage tax on SNAP products. A hearing for the preliminary injunction was scheduled for July 12.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-tax-soda-idUSL1N1JR200"},

Subway and bus services shut down in Brasilia, the nation's capital, while demonstrations blocked roads and snarled traffic in the megacities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as union activists took to the streets. However, the protest appeared to have limited impact and triggered none of the violent clashes between police and protesters that marked a much larger strike in April. It came after Brazil was riveted this week by a corruption charge filed against Temer by the country's top prosecutor.  The charge, the first ever leveled against a sitting president in Brazil, marked a milestone in a three-year probe by investigators that has revealed stunning levels of corruption in Latin America's largest country.  Temer, one-third of his cabinet, four past presidents and dozens of lawmakers are either on trial, facing charges or under investigation for corruption. Over 90 people have been found guilty so far.  Brazil's largest oil workers federation said in an emailed statement that Friday's work stoppage would continue for an indefinite period, and that all 10 refineries where it represents workers were affected. Demonstrators prepare a burning barricade during a protest against President Michel Temer's proposal reform of Brazil's social security system in the general strike in Sao Paulo, Brazil, June 30, 2017.Leonardo BenassattoExecutives at state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA acknowledged that the job action had a limited impact at oil refineries. But they said exploration and production activity, along with logistics, carried on as normal. Temer, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year, was charged with graft on Monday by Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot after executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA, accused him of taking millions in bribes. He has denied any wrongdoing and resisted repeated calls to resign. But the lower house of congress is preparing to vote on whether he should face a trial in the Supreme Court, which would prompt his removal from office for at least 180 days. Slideshow (21 Images)Other criminal charges against Temer are widely expected to be filed by Janot, and a ruling on Friday by Supreme Court Judge Edson Fachin appeared to come in anticipation of that. Fachin said each and every charge against the president would have to be investigated separately, meaning that Temer could potentially face more than one trial before the court. Unions fiercely oppose Temer's labor reform bill as it reduces their power over workplaces by cutting mandatory dues and allowing companies and employees to negotiate contract terms more freely. The bill has already been approved by the lower house of Congress and will likely pass the Senate within a few weeks. Unions also criticize Temer's pension overhaul proposal as it would make Brazilians work more years before retiring. Economists and investors see pension reform as the only way for Brazil to shore up its finances in the long run without resorting to tax hikes.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with Trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve.  I had a good conversation today with President Trump,  Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  As a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,  Corker said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of Trump's  America First  platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world's largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, welcomed the administration's decision to drop the order. Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, said that with four potential famines in the world  it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.  Corker has been pushing for years to reform the U.S. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. He said in his statement he looked forward to working with Congress and the administration to achieve  long overdue reforms.  After hearing about the possible executive order, several members of Congress called the White House to express their concern, congressional aides said. The administration's budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. That plan was also met with stiff opposition in Congress, as lawmakers argued that  soft power  options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. Supporters say Trump's initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. They said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

Democratic Governor Tom Wolf has 10 days to sign the legislation before it becomes law automatically, as it did last year.  This budget is not perfect,  said Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, a Republican.  Like many budgets, it is a compromise.  The fiscal 2018 budget is about $450 million higher than last year. The Republican-led legislature, which opposes tax increases, could return as early as Wednesday to decide how to fill the hole in the budget. The shortfall is due in large part to revenue collections this fiscal year falling $1.6 billion short of expectations. In order to close the gap, the state is considering borrowing $1 billion, to be repaid with money U.S. states still receive every year from their 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies for health expenses. Pennsylvania also could raise revenue by further privatizing the state's liquor sales system or by allowing thousands of video gambling devices to be installed in bars and clubs, a move being fought by the state's casino industry. Democrats want a severance tax on oil and gas production that would feed the general fund. That idea has failed to pass in previous years. Wolf said the plan provides $175 million more for public schools, including special education. He said his administration restored $800 million of public education cuts made by his Republican predecessor.  But there is still work to do,  Wolf said in a statement.  Pennsylvania cannot get ahead if we do not take our responsibility for long term financial stability seriously.  Many line items in the 2018 budget are flat or below last year. Public library funding went unchanged, welfare fraud investigation was cut by almost $1 million, prison medical care by $4.6 million, and the state police by $4.7 million.  I feel like we've been running on a treadmill for years,  Senator Daylin Leach, a liberal Democrat who voted against the budget, said in a statement.  We should be considering options that honestly pay for our priorities but instead, year after year, we borrow money, shift around money, and magically make money using inflated estimates,  he said.

This commission was formed to try to find basis for the lie that President Trump put forward that has no foundation,  Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told Reuters in an interview. Republican Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. He established the panel by executive order in May despite evidence that voter fraud was not widespread. Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sent a letter to all 50 states on Wednesday asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. The request from commission Vice Chairman Kris Kobach caused a backlash in states including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, where election officials said they would not provide all the data. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said on Thursday that handing over information would only serve to legitimize debunked claims of widespread voter fraud. More than 20 states said they would not or could not provide some or all of the information requested, according to statements from election officials and media reports. Some said certain data such as social security numbers were not publicly available and that they would turn over only public information. Others raised privacy concerns or questioned the need to examine voter fraud. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said in a statement that he had not seen the letter but would rebuff the commission.  They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,  he said. Kobach, the secretary of state for Kansas, has been a high-profile advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification. His office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Kobach was quoted in a Kansas City Star article as saying that his own state would not provide social security numbers at this time since they are not publicly available. Kobach did not rule out providing that information in the future. In his letter, a copy of which was provided to Reuters by the Connecticut Secretary of State's office, Kobach also asked states for feedback on how to improve election integrity and for evidence of voter fraud and convictions of voter-related crimes since 2000. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the commission a tactic to suppress votes against Republicans.  States are right to balk at turning over massive reams of personal information in what clearly is a campaign to suppress the vote,  Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, said in a statement on Friday. While the public availability of voter data varies by state, the request raises privacy concerns, said Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, professor who studies election law.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-vote-idUSL1N1JR1W7"},

We will respect it,  the minister, Jassim Saif Al Sulaiti, said in an interview in Montreal, where he is meeting officials of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). He did not provide specific details. Al Sulaiti repeated Qatar's request for the ICAO to intervene over Gulf neighbors closing their airspace to state-owned Qatar Airways flights in early June. Qatar has also asked for the ICAO to open international airspace over Gulf waters currently managed by the United Arab Emirates. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar, forcing Qatar Airways to fly longer, more expensive routes over Iran. The four countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and have made various demands on Doha. Qatar denies the allegations. On Friday, top ICAO officials briefed members of the agency's governing council on the safety and efficiency of air traffic in the Middle East region. During the briefing, which was closed to media and the public, members were told that the diplomatic rift did not cause serious safety concerns because aircraft operated by non-Qatar carriers could still fly to Doha, two sources familiar with the matter said.  Nevertheless, while no decision was reached at the briefing, ICAO will still hold future talks to discuss new contingency routes for Qatar Airways, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential. Representatives of the UAE and Saudi Arabia could not be reached for comment on Friday. ICAO's 36-state governing council can act to settle the overflights issue presented by Qatar, but such interventions are rare and time-consuming because the specialized United Nations  agency usually negotiates disputes diplomatically through consensus.

Premium channels like CBS Corp's Showtime have done this for years to entice new subscribers, but cable networks have not, fearing they might cannibalize TV ratings. But today viewers have many more choices as streaming companies like Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc bring a year-round slate of new shows on top of broadcast television.  As a result, networks need to do more to promote new shows, according to Dave Morgan, head of advertising technology company Simulmedia. Previously, networks focused all marketing around a show's premier, said Kevin Reilly, chief creative officer at Turner.   Today, the entire first season is a marketing vehicle,  he said. “If I said that five years ago, people would have said 'You're out of your mind'.  Over the past year, Turner put five premiers on Facebook and Google's YouTube. Discovery's true crime channel, Investigation Discovery (ID), plans to put the first episode of at least five of its series on its app for cable subscribers before they air on TV, said Kevin Bennett, general manager of ID. When college football season starts in August, Walt Disney Co's sports network ESPN, which is struggling with declining subscribers, will let online viewers watch 10 minutes of any game or show for free on its app.  If the app recognizes the viewer as a fan of a specific team, it will showcase that team's games, Justin Connolly, executive vice president, affiliate sales and marketing at ESPN, told Reuters. After 10 minutes, they will have to verify they are a cable subscriber or sign up. File Photo: The Discovery Communications headquarters building is seen in Silver Spring, Maryland December 3, 2009.Brad Bower/File PhotoEarly Success? By putting some episodes online for free, Turner faces the added risk of upsetting its cable and satellite partners. Aware of that, Turner has only selected certain shows to put online.  Last June, Turner's TNT got about 6 million viewers for the first episode of its new family crime drama,  Animal Kingdom,  which it streamed on Facebook and YouTube before it aired on TV. Turner said 16 percent of those online viewers - or about 960,000 people - came back to watch the show on TV. Turner believes that putting the premier online helped the show to increase its share of younger viewers, between 18 and 49 years old, from 899,000 at the show's television debut to 1.15 million by the final episode.  Ticker and trading information for media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 21, 2016.Brendan McDermid It might not build Nielsen ratings, but it builds engagement,  said Michael Engleman, executive vice president of entertainment marketing at Turner, referring to the TV industry's leading ratings firm. ID has put the second episodes of some shows on its ID GO app for cable subscribers immediately after the first episodes aired on TV in a bid to drive people to its app and to create a buzz, Bennett said. Last Spring, Discovery streamed the second episode of its miniseries about Casey Anthony, the Florida mom acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter, right after the first episode aired on TV.  When the episode aired on TV the next night, it was the highest-rated second episode for ID ever on TV, Bennett said.  For Discovery, whether viewers watch its shows on its app or on TV is not a key distinction. Discovery gets a 50-percent premium on ads sold through the app since they are more targeted and viewers cannot skip ads, said Paul Guyardo, chief commercial officer at Discovery. Such tactics can help when Discovery begins negotiations with its pay TV partners, he said.  When we come up for renewals, we aren't just providing a linear channel,  Guyardo said.  That helps with renewals and rate increases.  Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; editing by Anna Driver and Bill Rigby","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-television-internet-idUSKBN19K2G2"},

It came after Brazil was riveted this week by a corruption charge filed against Temer by the country's top prosecutor.  The charge, the first ever leveled against a sitting president in Brazil, marked a milestone in a three-year probe by investigators that has revealed stunning levels of corruption in Latin America's largest country.  Temer, one-third of his cabinet, four past presidents and dozens of lawmakers are either on trial, facing charges or under investigation for corruption. Over 90 people have been found guilty so far.  Brazil's largest oil workers federation said in an emailed statement that Friday's work stoppage would continue for an indefinite period, and that all 10 refineries where it represents workers were affected. Demonstrators prepare a burning barricade during a protest against President Michel Temer's proposal reform of Brazil's social security system in the general strike in Sao Paulo, Brazil, June 30, 2017.Leonardo BenassattoExecutives at state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA acknowledged that the job action had a limited impact at oil refineries. But they said exploration and production activity, along with logistics, carried on as normal. Temer, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year, was charged with graft on Monday by Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot after executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA, accused him of taking millions in bribes. He has denied any wrongdoing and resisted repeated calls to resign. But the lower house of congress is preparing to vote on whether he should face a trial in the Supreme Court, which would prompt his removal from office for at least 180 days. Slideshow (21 Images)Other criminal charges against Temer are widely expected to be filed by Janot, and a ruling on Friday by Supreme Court Judge Edson Fachin appeared to come in anticipation of that. Fachin said each and every charge against the president would have to be investigated separately, meaning that Temer could potentially face more than one trial before the court. Unions fiercely oppose Temer's labor reform bill as it reduces their power over workplaces by cutting mandatory dues and allowing companies and employees to negotiate contract terms more freely. The bill has already been approved by the lower house of Congress and will likely pass the Senate within a few weeks. Unions also criticize Temer's pension overhaul proposal as it would make Brazilians work more years before retiring. Economists and investors see pension reform as the only way for Brazil to shore up its finances in the long run without resorting to tax hikes.

Qatar has also asked for the ICAO to open international airspace over Gulf waters currently managed by the United Arab Emirates. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar, forcing Qatar Airways to fly longer, more expensive routes over Iran. The four countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and have made various demands on Doha. Qatar denies the allegations. On Friday, top ICAO officials briefed members of the agency's governing council on the safety and efficiency of air traffic in the Middle East region. During the briefing, which was closed to media and the public, members were told that the diplomatic rift did not cause serious safety concerns because aircraft operated by non-Qatar carriers could still fly to Doha, two sources familiar with the matter said.

(Reuters) - Venus Williams was sued on Friday by the family of a Florida man who died after being involved in a two-vehicle crash that police say was the fault of the world's former top-ranked tennis player. A civil complaint filed Friday, days before the revered Wimbledon tournament, claims that Williams was negligent in the June 9 crash near her Florida residence in Palm Beach Gardens. A passenger in a small sedan that collided with Williams' larger SUV, Jerome Barson, 78, died June 22, according to the suit and, separately, the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's office. While Williams was not given a citation by police for the crash, she was found at fault for failing to yield the right of way, according to a police report filed by the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department. The Barson’s lawsuit for wrongful death comes just days before Williams is scheduled to begin play at tennis’ most prestigious event, Wimbledon, and casts a cloud over her involvement in the tournament, where she is slated to play on Monday against Belgian Elise Mertens.  Williams, 37, has won the tournament five times, although her last title there came in 2008. The suit says Barson died as a result of his injuries in the crash. The suit says those injuries included  severed main arteries, massive internal bleeding, a fractured spine and massive internal organ damage.  The suit alleges that Williams was  driving carelessly and recklessly  and that led to the collision of the Toyota Sequoia she was driving and the Barson's Hyundai Accent. Malcolm Cunningham, attorney for Williams, said by telephone on Friday,  We think it's an unfortunate accident.  Cunningham on Thursday and Friday told Reuters that Williams,  expresses her deepest condolences  to the Barson family, but offered no comment on the lawsuit.  The point is,  Cunningham said Friday,  that Ms. Williams entered into that intersection on a green light. She was there lawfully.  Williams told police she drove into an intersection on a green light, but stopped at the intersection to wait for cross-traffic to clear, then proceeded without seeing Barson's car coming from the side. The police report estimated Williams was traveling at about 5 miles per hour (8 kph) at the time of impact and was not distracted or suspected of any drug or alcohol use. Jerome Barson's wife of 33 years, Linda Barson, who was driving the sedan, survived but, the suit says, sustained multiple injuries.

The opinions expressed here are his own.) By John Lloyd June 30 (Reuters) - London’s Grenfell Tower fire victims aren’t furious just with local authorities for ignoring safety concerns raised before this month’s blaze killed at least 79 residents. They’re angry with journalists too. As reporters covered the fire at the apartment block last week, some residents turned on Jon Snow of Channel Four News, the most senior of Britain’s news presenters, and accused journalists of being vultures attracted to death and tragedy. “You didn’t come here when people were telling you that the building was unsafe!” one man told Snow. “That is not newsworthy. You come here when people die. Why?” The Grenfell residents are hardly alone in accusing the media of not serving their needs. It’s no secret that trust in the media has declined. But the latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report, published this week, provides sobering insights into how the digital revolution has disrupted the way we gather the information we believe we need to orient ourselves in the world, or in our neighborhood. The report shows that trust in the media varies from country to country, from over 60 percent in the Scandinavian countries to the low 20s in Greece and South Korea. In the United States, trust in the media has risen from 33 percent during last year’s election campaign to 38 percent this year. That may be because, as the Reuters report notes, “concern about the spread of false news online” increased the perception of the value of professional journalism. Most sobering is the report’s comment that “the economic outlook for most media companies remains extremely difficult.” That statement doesn’t include the communications giants like Twitter, Facebook and Google, the latter two of which garner more than 80 percent of the advertising that used to go to traditional media. But two issues are likely larger. One is what Janine Gibson, the chief editor of Buzzfeed UK, calls “representation without judgment.” Speaking at a seminar in London this week, Gibson said that the digital and social media world implicitly equates what news organizations spend time and money verifying, with “the guy in an attic” who puts out a piece of opinion masquerading as news, without having had to exercise his judgment on the veracity of his narrative. The latter, said Gibson, “is of course much quicker than the news which checks, because checking takes time.” The result, too, can be duller. The more careful is the reporter, the more complex becomes the story. But the guy in the attic can be simple, dramatic - and attract the eyeballs. At an extreme, the attic-writer is putting out “fake news” - a commodity popularized by President Trump, who seems to see all news which does not praise him as “fake.” Fake news may have won Trump the presidency. Even if not, his use of it gives credence to a tendency to distrust news we don’t like. It’s also becoming clearer that measurements of “trust” in the news media don’t really measure trust in the news media. They measure pleasure gained from the media. The Digital News Report says that there exists “a strong connection between trust in the media and perceived political bias.” That is, people trust the reports which flatter and further their views. This isn’t new: people have chosen publications which line up with their political choices throughout the history of news. But for most of that history, those who consumed journalism did so passively. There was no comeback, except through a letter to the editor (probably unpublished) or a cancelled subscription. Now readers are empowered by technology, often aggressive in their distrust and disgust, to intervene in stories. James Harding, director of news at the BBC, speaking at the same event as Buzzfeed’s Gibson, said that “we at the BBC are very careful to make clear what we don’t know as well as what we know. But people now can fill the space of ’don’t know’ themselves”. We still live in the first phase of a revolution, not just of journalism but also in the ways in which we seek and use information, and in what we place our trust. As printing disrupted the late medieval world, so the replacement of print by digits has disrupted the 21st century. It is presently calling into question the nature of truth, and the trust we can place in it. Truth is hard to get right, especially at times of tragedies like that at Grenfell Tower. Finding and publishing it won’t always avoid anger directed at the messenger, but journalists need to show they are truth seekers rather than vultures feeding on tragedy. That will give substance to journalism's necessary democratic role – and perhaps answer the “why” asked by the man who confronted Jon Snow.

In a June 30 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group said that including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to mandatory programs could be  extremely problematic  for tax reform and asked for a budget delay until Senate Republicans finish their debate on healthcare legislation.  We fear that if the House persists on pursuing this course, it could imperil tax reform,  wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Republicans must pass a 2018 budget resolution to unlock a key legislative tool known as reconciliation, which the party needs to move a tax bill forward without support from Democrats.  But members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they will back a spending plan only if it cuts mandatory programs including Medicaid and food stamps, reductions that moderates oppose.  House Republicans have made significant progress on budget decisions and these family discussions will continue amongst the conference,  Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. The Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group each represents enough House Republicans to stymie legislation on its own.  Outside organizations including powerful business lobby groups are increasingly worried that the disagreement could lead to a political stand-off that prevents tax reform from occurring.  No other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform,  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business said in a joint letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday. Republican moderates also worry that adding mandatory cuts to a reconciliation bill would create unpalatable legislation that reduces benefits for the poor while granting tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, according to aides.  The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, after the chairmen of several other committees rejected efforts to wring $250 billion in mandatory spending from spending.

But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp (VC.N) found: a mess. As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers. Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.  Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars. What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Markit to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.  The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do,  Boyadjis said. He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today. Digital Makeover  One of Visteon's solutions is a computer module dubbed  SmartCore.  This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.  So far this year, the Detroit-based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums. One, announced in April, is with China's second-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Corp. The other is with Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE), Reuters has learned. Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment. Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.  Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.  It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co (F.N) a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.   You have to be changing and adapting fast. If not, you're not going to keep up in this market,  said Tim Yerdon, Visteon's head of global marketing.  It's about reinventing yourself to stay ahead.  A 'SmartCore' dashboard is seen at the technical center of U.S. automotive supplier Visteon in Karlsruhe, Germany June 23, 2017. Picture taken June 23, 2017.Ralph OrlowskiDashboard Deals Visteon's makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit. The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers. Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' (JCI.N) electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung (005930.KS) completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia (EPED.PA), a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019. Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.  Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi (NSUG.DE) was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system. Cheaper, Lighter, Smarter Slideshow (12 Images)Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.  They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years. But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D. Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio, communications, entertainment and maps systems.   Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers, who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars, or even driving, that their parents did. Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles.  Disjointed dashboards  are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience - what you see right in front of you,  said Andrew Hart of UK-based consultancy SBD Automotive. On many car models, he said, audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio, meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep.   That's a crazy example of something when you don't consolidate ECUs,  Hart said. Industry watchers say this and other safe-driving features are among the systems ripe for integration. Additional targets include rear-seat entertainment systems and so-called heads-up displays that project data such as the car's speed onto the windshield for easy viewing. Back in Detroit, Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller, a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi (DLPH.N), Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], Continental (CONG.DE), and Denso (6902.T). While it isn't clear who will prevail, electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected.  Five years ago, the dashboard was  a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into,  said Yerdon, Visteon's marketing chief.  Now it's more about an electronic architecture that's experience-driven, and we mold plastic around it.

Cook County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Kubasiak granted the group of retailers a temporary restraining order on the penny-per-ounce county tax, which was to take effect on Saturday. The county gave notice it would appeal the judge's order and  aggressively defend  the tax, according to a statement from Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. The grocers filed the lawsuit on Tuesday, arguing the ordinance is  unconstitutionally vague,  difficult to implement and unlawful because it would tax similar beverages differently.    I believe that it's necessary to maintain the status quo in order to protect the interest of all consumers, all taxpayers and the affected merchants,  Kubasiak said. Cook County, which includes Chicago, joined a growing number of localities that have adopted measures to cut consumption of sugary drinks for health reasons, including Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. The Cook County Board of Commissioners passed the tax last November, lauding it as a benefit to public health and a way to boost revenue. It applies to bottled sweetened beverages including soda, sports drinks and energy drinks. The temporary restraining order was necessary because if the tax was implemented and then rescinded, it would be impossible for consumers to be refunded, David Ruskin, attorney for the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, said on Thursday. He also argued that failure to comply with an unlawfully vague tax could leave retailers vulnerable to  monumental  penalties.   Cook County attorney Sisavanh Baker said Thursday the tax need not be perfect to be reasonable, and the county would lose about $17 million per month if the tax was shelved.  Preckwinkle said in the statement that she has asked officials to consider ways of making up for the lost revenue, including potential personnel reductions. The lawsuit also argued that the tax could make retailers ineligible for participation in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which prohibits purchasing food that has a state or local sales tax. Attorney James Beligrates, who represents the county, said the lawsuit's assertion about SNAP, which helps millions of U.S. low-income individuals and families buy food, is a  red herring  because the county agreed retailers should not collect the sweetened beverage tax on SNAP products.

Unlike other Illinois school districts, which are part of a state-wide teachers retirement system subsidized with state dollars, CPS has its own pension fund. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nation's third-largest public school system. There was no immediate comment from the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund. The retirement system was due $733.2 million this fiscal year and CPS had paid only about $19 million prior to Friday. The district said it plans to make the remaining $250 million payment with a fall infusion of property taxes. Earlier this week, the district completed a $387 million short-term loan with J.P.

Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, captured more than $3 billion in new money in the first five months of the year, according to two people familiar with the figures, which have not been previously reported. Compared with the $4.6 billion that all quantitative funds tracked by Hedge Fund Research took in during the first three months of the year, Renaissance's haul is even more remarkable, fund managers and industry analysts said. Long Island-based Renaissance, founded 35 years ago by mathematician James Simons, has attracted investors based on the strong returns of its portfolios as well as shifting investor tastes. Years of lackluster returns and high fees at hedge funds have frustrated big investors, who are increasingly swapping funds run by stock-pickers like John Paulson or Leon Cooperman for quants, which rely on mathematical models to make their bets. Last year, investors pulled some $70 billion out of all hedge funds, but they added $13.3 billion in new money to quant funds, data from Hedge Fund Research show. In the first quarter of 2017, investors pulled $5.5 billion out of all hedge funds, compared with inflows of $4.6 billion into quant funds. The trend is expected to continue, as investors have come around to the idea that algorithms can make better decisions than human stock-pickers, especially when markets are volatile or uncertain. While Renaissance and well-known competitors like D.E. Shaw and AQR have been around for decades, they have become newly popular after a run of strong returns, as has a growing crop of smaller rivals.  Another stand-out fund that has been pulling in hundreds of millions in recent months is Quantitative Investment Management, which manages roughly $3.5 billion in several strategies.

Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, captured more than $3 billion in new money in the first five months of the year, according to two people familiar with the figures, which have not been previously reported. Compared with the $4.6 billion that all quantitative funds tracked by Hedge Fund Research took in during the first three months of the year, Renaissance's haul is even more remarkable, fund managers and industry analysts said. Long Island-based Renaissance, founded 35 years ago by mathematician James Simons, has attracted investors based on the strong returns of its portfolios as well as shifting investor tastes. Years of lackluster returns and high fees at hedge funds have frustrated big investors, who are increasingly swapping funds run by stock-pickers like John Paulson or Leon Cooperman for quants, which rely on mathematical models to make their bets. Last year, investors pulled some $70 billion out of all hedge funds, but they added $13.3 billion in new money to quant funds, data from Hedge Fund Research show. In the first quarter of 2017, investors pulled $5.5 billion out of all hedge funds, compared with inflows of $4.6 billion into quant funds. The trend is expected to continue, as investors have come around to the idea that algorithms can make better decisions than human stock-pickers, especially when markets are volatile or uncertain. While Renaissance and well-known competitors like D.E. Shaw and AQR have been around for decades, they have become newly popular after a run of strong returns, as has a growing crop of smaller rivals.  Another stand-out fund that has been pulling in hundreds of millions in recent months is Quantitative Investment Management, which manages roughly $3.5 billion in several strategies. Its Quantitative Tactical Aggressive Fund gained 55 percent in the first five months of 2017.

Watson is Ryu’s Australian caddie, and his name is no coincidence. His father, a huge fan of the Tom Watson, named his son after the American great. It has been more of a curse than a blessing for the caddie, who once embraced the name, even using ‘eightmajors’ in his email address, but is now sick of being asked about it. “Watson won his second British Open in ‘77, beating (Jack) Nicklaus in that famous ‘Duel in the Sun’ and I was born about eight months later and it went from there,” Watson, 39, told Reuters at the Women’s PGA Championship. Watson flirted with a professional career before becoming a full-time caddie, and hooked up with Ryu in 2012. “Definitely didn’t help me when I was playing,” he said of his name. “I found it a struggle. I just got sick of it, the pressure of it, especially when I was playing a couple of pro tournaments. “It was tough. Now it is what it is.

She has even picked up some salty language in her second tongue. “I’m surrounded by Australians so I’ve learned a lot of swear words but at the same time I’ve learned a lot of good English as well,” said a smiling Ryu. “I think Australia is one of the warmest-hearted countries in the world.” Caddie Watson acknowledged that Ryu is now proficient in the Australian vernacular. “Her English is nine out of 10 now,” he said. “She’s dropping (swear word) bombs everywhere.” Reporting by Andrew Both; editing by Ken Ferris","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-pgachamp-watson-ryu-idUSKBN19L2W6"},

The government and the National Liberation Army (ELN), the second-largest insurgent group, began formal peace negotiations in February after more than three years of secret talks to draw up the agenda and logistics. The parties agreed to form a special panel on  humanitarian actions and dynamics  that will assess whether conditions are adequate to call a ceasefire and an end of hostilities, a Colombian government statement said. Pablo Beltran, leader of the ELN negotiating team in Quito, Ecuador, said the rebels would like to see a ceasefire in place before Pope Francis visits Colombia in September. Friday's agreement includes the creation of a team that would provide education and communication and representatives of other countries to provide support and cooperation at the negotiating table.

The next cycle begins on July 24 in Quito. The government and the ELN want an agreement similar to last year's deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's biggest rebel group. In the past two weeks, FARC fighters have handed in all but a few of their firearms - and the bigger explosive weapons - to the United Nations to end its part in Latin America's oldest conflict in which more than 220,000 were killed over five decades. The ELN, which has some 2,000 combatants and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, is accused of kidnapping, killing and attacks on Colombia's oil and energy infrastructure, as well as extortion of oil and mining multinationals.

The court decision follows a Reuters report that Venezuela is seeking to sell some $710 million in fixed-income securities back to Nomura, which originally issued them in 2008, to raise cash amid an economic crisis. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the request, according to court papers.  Crystallex understands and believes that the debt is an asset of Venezuela, owed by Nomura Bank International and Nomura Securities and currently sited in New York,  Crystallex wrote in a request filed to the court, which was seen by Reuters. The company, which cited the Reuters report in its request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent it from collecting on the award. The move is one of the most aggressive legal gambits to date by a company seeking compensation for a wave of nationalizations under the leadership of late Socialist leader Hugo Chavez. The ruling further complicates Venezuela's efforts to raise cash from international financiers amid a crippling financial crisis. Opposition leaders are already urging banks not to finance Maduro's government, citing human rights violations that have been registered during the crackdown on three months of opposition protests. Crystallex, which cited the Reuters report in its request, said Venezuela was seeking to draw down assets in the United States to prevent it from collecting on the award. Both Nomura and Venezuela will be able to respond to the restraining notices, Crystallex said in its request. Nomura and Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The talks revolve around $710 million in securities known as credit-linked notes that were issued by Nomura to Venezuela in 2008, according to a finance industry source. One of the notes has a face value of $390 million and matures at the end of 2018 while the other, with a face value of $320 million, matures in 2023, said the finance industry source, who asked not to be identified. Venezuela is seeking to sell those securities before they mature, the source said, effectively accepting a loss on the notes as a way of getting the cash back sooner. The government of President Nicolas Maduro is struggling under the collapse of the country's socialist economic model that suffers triple-digit inflation, chronic product shortages and rising incidence of malnutrition. Maduro insists his government is victim of an  economic war  and has lambasted the opposition's campaign to block financing deals. Julio Borges, head of the opposition-run Congress, this month publicly chided Nomura for participating along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a $2.9 billion bond operation in May.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with Trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve.  I had a good conversation today with President Trump,  Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  As a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,  Corker said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of Trump's  America First  platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world's largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, welcomed the administration's decision to drop the order.  Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, said that with four potential famines in the world  it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.  Corker has been pushing for years to reform the U.S. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. He said in his statement he looked forward to working with Congress and the administration to achieve  long overdue reforms.  After hearing about the possible executive order, several members of Congress called the White House to express their concern, congressional aides said.  The administration's budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. That plan was also met with stiff opposition in Congress, as lawmakers argued that  soft power  options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. Supporters say Trump's initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict.  Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. They said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

Nike shares (NKE.N) rose 11 percent on Friday after the world's largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com (AMZN.O). Nike shares gave the biggest boost to the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. Even as technology shares limped through June, the sector has been the big story of the first six months of the year. Tech shares gained 16.4 percent in the first-half, double the S&P; 500's 8.2 percent rally so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 14.1 percent in the first half.  The S&P; technology index .SPLRCT ended down 0.1 percent on Friday, while for all of June it posted its first monthly loss of the year. A decline in biotech shares .NBI, which had surged of late, also limited the Nasdaq.  Are we going to see a broadening of the rally, where you see more of the financials and other sectors fill in some of the gaps?  said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.   It hasn’t been a broad encompassing rally, that I think investors will have to see a little bit more conviction rather than just in a handful of stocks,  Lancz said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 62.6 points, or 0.29 percent, to 21,349.63, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 3.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,423.41, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 3.93 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,140.42. Industrials .SPLRCI were the top-performing sector, rising 0.8 percent.

The Goldman Sachs and Nike corporate logos are displayed on a post above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, September 11, 2013.Lucas Jackson During a time when it seems like there are still a fair amount of naysayers out there about the economy and GDP, anytime you get some of those stocks showing some strength, it probably emboldens the market,” Carlson said. The S&P; 500's percentage gain in the first half was its biggest since climbing 12.6 percent in the first six months of 2013. The Nasdaq posted its biggest first-half gain since 2009. U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion. The Commerce Department data bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter. Investors have been concerned about recent mixed economic data at a time that the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates from very low levels. The release of second-quarter corporate results is set to begin in earnest in the coming weeks, with S&P; 500 companies expected to post an 8 percent rise in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Investors have been looking for earnings to support historically high valuations. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with the long-term average of 15 times.  We can talk about the economy and geopolitical risk but earnings drive the market,  said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital Management in Sarasota, Florida.  We’re bumping right along the top end of  historic valuation levels. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

{"news_time":"2017-06-30 17:36:00","news_title":"Minneapolis approves gradual minimum wage hike to $15 an hour","keywords":"Blong Yang,Linea Palmisano,MINNESOTA,MINIMUMWAGE/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - The Minneapolis City Council approved a measure on Friday requiring large companies to pay workers least at $15 an hour by 2022, following moves by other liberal-leaning U.S. cities to raise the minimum wage. The pay hike will be phased in citywide by 2024 and makes Minneapolis the first city in the Midwest to set a timetable for a $15 minimum wage. The measure, an effective pay increase of 58 percent for workers at large businesses and 94 percent for those at small ones, was approved by an 11-1 vote. Large businesses, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning Jan. 1, according to a news release from the city. On July 1, 2018, small businesses will have to pay $10.25 and the rate will go to $11.25 for large ones. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business.  The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that,  City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota's biggest city, more than 70,000 workers stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city.  We cannot make Minneapolis an island,  Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some others have already approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/minnesota-minimumwage-idUSL1N1JR1VC"},

The world's largest asset manager and issuer of ETFs will move 30 of its iShares-brand ETFs to CBOE Holdings Inc's (CBOE.O) Bats exchange and an additional 20 ETFs to Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), the New York-based company said in a statement. BlackRock managed $1.4 trillion in ETFs on March 31. Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) NYSE Arca exchange is home to the lion's share of the more than 2,000 U.S.-listed ETFs, but competitors have been aggressively trying to win away issuers and traders. After the changes are made on Aug 1, iShares will still have 209 ETFs listed on NYSE Arca, the company said. NYSE has faced scrutiny for technical glitches affecting ETFs, including a March issue that prevented some ETFs from completing an auction at the end of the day. In a statement, Samara Cohen, Americas Head of iShares Capital Markets at BlackRock, said  a thriving market for ETFs requires a robust, resilient ecosystem, with multiple participants committed to continuous innovation and improving the client experience.  A NYSE spokeswoman declined to comment. ETFs are absorbing an increasing share of market activity, and listing them is valuable to exchanges hoping to win more trading volume and also sell data. More value is exchanged each day in the top ETFs like the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF (SPY.P) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) than in most stocks.

The value of the dollar's net long position fell to $4.50 billion in the week ended June 27, from $7.82 billion the previous week, and the lowest since the first week of July last year.  That's a massive adjustment driven off the back of Draghi's hints towards tightening and the overall weaker-than-expected economic data in the U.S.,  said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the bank's aggressive monetary stimulus policy on Tuesday, fuelling market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September. The U.S. dollar recovered slightly on Friday, but posted its biggest quarterly decline against a basket of rival currencies in nearly seven years after hawkish signals from foreign central banks this week pressured the greenback further. The greenback may have benefitted a little from end-of-quarter adjustments this week and could come under further pressure next week, Schamotta said. Euro net longs, meanwhile, rose in the latest week, CFTC data showed. This week, euro net longs rose to 58,695 contracts, from 44,852 contracts the previous week. The single currency has gained against the dollar over the past few months, benefiting from broad greenback weakness and the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to hike interest rates in early 2018. In other currencies, speculators pulled back their net short position on the Canadian dollar to 49,495 contracts from 82,881, a week prior.  The shorts are really getting wiped out of the market and you could continue to see that next week given the ongoing hawkinshness that's coming from the Bank of Canada,  Schamotta said. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand is driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, the Canadian central bank said in a report on Friday that increased expectations for a rate hike. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

Friday's recovery in stock prices limited the damage for investors who have bet against rising volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose to a six-week high on Thursday, as a selloff in technology stocks deepened. VIX-linked exchange traded products (ETPs), VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV.O) and ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY.P), which are designed to weaken when volatility of the S&P; 500 goes up, fell as much as 15 percent on Thursday. However, the two ETPs remain up more than 75 percent for the year and are unlikely to fall out of favor, market experts said.  It used to be that people would pull back on a day like yesterday,  said Matt Thompson co-head Of Volatility Group at Typhon Capital LLC, in Chicago.  People still do that, but the net effect is there are more people coming in to sell these (volatility) spikes.  Appetite Investors have responded to the most recent bouts of stock market volatility by increasing bets that calm will return to markets in short order, said Anand Omprakash, director, equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, in New York. Commodity Futures Trading Commission positioning data through June 20, also show big speculators' net short position in VIX futures at a record 146,845 contracts. Increased difficulty in finding investment yields across asset classes and a belief that central banks will keep a lid on market volatility have boosted interest in this strategy known as selling volatility.  Even though the Fed has raised interest rates, finding yield is still very difficult. Equity markets are near all-time highs, equity earnings yield is not terribly high,  said Omprakash, who added interest in these trades has broadened over the last decade. Omprakash and analysts at other big banks have warned that heightened interest in volatility trading poses a risk where a sudden shock to stocks could be exacerbated by investors rushing to cover their short positions. But any such shock would have to be a lot more sustained, they say.  Just because volatility rises a little bit is not going to do anything.

But investors should not expect so-called quad-play bundles to be as popular as in some other countries anytime soon. In a market where wireless service is typically purchased separately from the triple-play bundle offered by pay-TV companies, there are obstacles to broad adoption, investors and industry analysts said. The benefit to bundling more services together is that it makes consumers stickier, or more loyal.  The biggest hurdle in the U.S. is footprint mismatch,  said Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer at GAMCO Investors Inc.  The cable companies are all regional, and the wireless business is more of a national market. In Europe, cable is more national.   The sticker shock of having all four bills combined does not help.  Consumers don’t necessarily want to see one bill that has a massively ballooning cost to the service provider,  said Jefferson Wang, senior partner heading mobile innovation at IBB Consulting Group.  Market research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that roughly 10 percent of U.S. households use quad-play. Penetration is expected to increase to 17 percent in 2020 but is still low compared to France's 25 percent and Spain's 60 percent. In those countries, companies like Iliad SA (ILD.PA) and Telefonica SA (TEF.MC) have driven adoption over the past five years. So far, U.S. companies have yet to focus on quad-play. AT&T; Inc (T.N) offers four-service bundles in states where it sells broadband but says it is mainly focused on combining wireless service with entertainment as it waits for regulatory approval of its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) launched its wireless service Xfinity Mobile earlier this year but is not yet actively promoting it as a bundle with voice, Internet and television.  FILE PHOTO: An AT&T sign is seen outside a branch in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, U.S., October 24, 2016.Jim Young/File PhotoAnd Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, offered quad-play in the past but found that it did not resonate with customers, who expected big discounts.  That could shift as cable companies expand into wireless and see an opportunity to undercut rivals on price. Comcast and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) are in talks with Sprint Corp (S.N) on a wireless deal to sell mobile service on Sprint's network. The two companies already have a similar agreement with Verizon, and Charter is expected to launch a wireless service next year.  We're really at an inflection point now,  said Mark Bower, a partner with Bain & Co's telecom, media and technology practice. Markets where quad-play has taken off have all had either an incumbent that was losing share or an aggressive new challenger that won customers through significant discounting. In the United States, that disruptor could soon be a cable company. The cable industry has experimented with wireless in the past. In 2005, Sprint formed a $200 million venture with Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc, now owned by Charter, Cox Communications Inc and Advance/Newhouse Communications to offer combined cable and wireless services. Cable companies pulled out in 2008, citing  operational complexities.   Things could turn out differently this time, especially if cable companies eventually bought a wireless carrier, giving them ownership of a cellular network as opposed to having to rely on a third party, analysts said. It also helps that the lines between wireless and broadband connectivity are blurring as people use more connected devices over WiFi. That may provide more of a reason for cable companies to want to control both.  While sources told Reuters it is unlikely that Comcast and Charter would make an equity investment in Sprint, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp (LBRDA.O) is Charter's largest stakeholder, in January raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy a wireless carrier.

Rising wholesale pork values underscored strong meat demand and also bolstered futures while rising temperatures forecast next week could slow the rate of weight gain in hogs, limiting the supplies available to packers.               The demand seems to be there,  said Rosenthal Collins Group broker James Burns.  Hogs have been coming in underweight consistently for a while now and we have some heat that's coming to Iowa next week.       Chicago Mercantile Exchange July hogs        hit a peak of 90.850 cents per pound, the highest levels on a continuous chart        since November 2014, before settling at 90.625 cents, up 1.150 cents.      Most-active CME August hogs        rose by their daily trading limit of 3.000 cents to a contract high of 83.750. Trading limits will be expanded to 4.500 cents on Monday, according to the CME Group.     Futures remained discounted to the exchange's index of the cash hog market       , which reached 91.660 cents, also a roughly 2-1/2-year high.         The gains came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a quarterly report showed a record-large U.S. herd for the March-May quarter. However, record hog supplies this year have been met by robust demand.                       CATTLE MOSTLY HIGHER ON TECHNICALS     CME June live cattle futures        expired down 1.110 cents at 119.100 cents per pound while most-active August live cattle        eased 0.200 cent to 116.300 cents. However, most other deferred cattle contracts notched small gains.      CME August feeder cattle futures        were up 0.750 cent to 147.925 cents per pound.     Technical short-covering and bear-spreading remained a theme in cattle trading as investors exited positions in nearby futures contracts. But recent declines in cash cattle prices and wholesale beef continued to limit the upside.     The USDA said wholesale choice beef prices eased $1.82 to $224.73 per cwt and select cuts were down $1.74 to $208.42.

In a June 30 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group said that including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to mandatory programs could be  extremely problematic  for tax reform and asked for a budget delay until Senate Republicans finish their debate on healthcare legislation.  We fear that if the House persists on pursuing this course, it could imperil tax reform,  wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Republicans must pass a 2018 budget resolution to unlock a key legislative tool known as reconciliation, which the party needs to move a tax bill forward without support from Democrats.  But members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they will back a spending plan only if it cuts mandatory programs including Medicaid and food stamps, reductions that moderates oppose.  House Republicans have made significant progress on budget decisions and these family discussions will continue amongst the conference,  Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. The Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group each represents enough House Republicans to stymie legislation on its own.  Outside organizations including powerful business lobby groups are increasingly worried that the disagreement could lead to a political stand-off that prevents tax reform from occurring.  No other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform,  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business said in a joint letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday. Republican moderates also worry that adding mandatory cuts to a reconciliation bill would create unpalatable legislation that reduces benefits for the poor while granting tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, according to aides.  The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, after the chairmen of several other committees rejected efforts to wring $250 billion in mandatory spending from spending. Freedom Caucus members want much larger cuts.  Reporting by David Morgan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-tax-idUSL1N1JR1UE"},

The pay hike will be phased in citywide by 2024 and makes Minneapolis the first city in the Midwest to set a timetable for a $15 minimum wage. The measure, an effective pay increase of 58 percent for workers at large businesses and 94 percent for those at small ones, was approved by an 11-1 vote. Large businesses, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning Jan. 1, according to a news release from the city. On July 1, 2018, small businesses will have to pay $10.25 and the rate will go to $11.25 for large ones. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business.  The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that,  City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota's biggest city, more than 70,000 workers stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city.  We cannot make Minneapolis an island,  Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some others have already approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year.

The central bank also said Canadian companies were more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand was driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, in a report on Friday that further increased expectations for a rate hike.                  At 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2967 to the greenback, or 77.12 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent. It touched its strongest since Sept. 9 at C$1.2947 during the session.     But further appreciation for the currency will require follow-through on the newly hawkish tone, according to Brad Schruder, a director of foreign exchange sales at BMO Capital Markets.      The Bank of Canada has talked the talk and now they need to walk the walk,  he said.  In addition, they need to convince the market that this is the beginning of cycle towards tighter monetary policy rather than just removal of the emergency cut Governor Poloz put in a couple of years ago.      Speculators cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a fifth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. Canadian dollar net short positions tumbled to 49,495 contracts as of June 27 from 82,881 a week earlier.     Canada's economy expanded by 0.2 percent in April after a 0.5 percent increase in March, Statistics Canada said. The gain matched analysts' estimates.                  It leaves the economy on track to grow at a 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter, which is  more than enough to justify the recent change in tone from the Bank of Canada,  Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets said in a research note.     Chances of a Bank of Canada rate hike in July have increased to one-in-two from just 20 percent after subdued inflation data last week, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                Oil prices climbed for a seventh straight session in their longest bull run since April but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998.                  U.S. crude futures        settled up $1.11, or around 2.5 percent, at $46.04 a barrel.

The value of the dollar's net long position fell to $4.50 billion in the week ended June 27, from $7.82 billion the previous week, and the lowest since the first week of July last year.  That's a massive adjustment driven off the back of Draghi's hints towards tightening and the overall weaker-than-expected economic data in the U.S.,  said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the bank's aggressive monetary stimulus policy on Tuesday, fuelling market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus as soon as September. The U.S. dollar recovered slightly on Friday, but posted its biggest quarterly decline against a basket of rival currencies in nearly seven years after hawkish signals from foreign central banks this week pressured the greenback further. The greenback may have benefitted a little from end-of-quarter adjustments this week and could come under further pressure next week, Schamotta said. Euro net longs, meanwhile, rose in the latest week, CFTC data showed. This week, euro net longs rose to 58,695 contracts, from 44,852 contracts the previous week. The single currency has gained against the dollar over the past few months, benefiting from broad greenback weakness and the view that rising inflation would prompt the ECB to hike interest rates in early 2018. In other currencies, speculators pulled back their net short position on the Canadian dollar to 49,495 contracts from 82,881, a week prior.  The shorts are really getting wiped out of the market and you could continue to see that next week given the ongoing hawkinshness that's coming from the Bank of Canada,  Schamotta said. Canadian companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, while improving demand is driving capacity pressures that should boost investment and hiring, the Canadian central bank said in a report on Friday that increased expectations for a rate hike. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

Friday's recovery in stock prices limited the damage for investors who have bet against rising volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose to a six-week high on Thursday, as a selloff in technology stocks deepened. VIX-linked exchange traded products (ETPs), VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV.O) and ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY.P), which are designed to weaken when volatility of the S&P; 500 goes up, fell as much as 15 percent on Thursday. However, the two ETPs remain up more than 75 percent for the year and are unlikely to fall out of favor, market experts said.  It used to be that people would pull back on a day like yesterday,  said Matt Thompson co-head Of Volatility Group at Typhon Capital LLC, in Chicago.  People still do that, but the net effect is there are more people coming in to sell these (volatility) spikes.  Appetite Investors have responded to the most recent bouts of stock market volatility by increasing bets that calm will return to markets in short order, said Anand Omprakash, director, equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, in New York. Commodity Futures Trading Commission positioning data through June 20, also show big speculators' net short position in VIX futures at a record 146,845 contracts. Increased difficulty in finding investment yields across asset classes and a belief that central banks will keep a lid on market volatility have boosted interest in this strategy known as selling volatility.  Even though the Fed has raised interest rates, finding yield is still very difficult. Equity markets are near all-time highs, equity earnings yield is not terribly high,  said Omprakash, who added interest in these trades has broadened over the last decade. Omprakash and analysts at other big banks have warned that heightened interest in volatility trading poses a risk where a sudden shock to stocks could be exacerbated by investors rushing to cover their short positions. But any such shock would have to be a lot more sustained, they say.  Just because volatility rises a little bit is not going to do anything. They (volatility sellers) really need to be challenged by a much bigger selloff in the S&P; 500,  said Ilya Feygin, managing director at WallachBeth Capital in New York.

The pay hike will be phased in citywide by 2024 and makes Minneapolis the first city in the Midwest to set a timetable for a $15 minimum wage. The measure, an effective pay increase of 58 percent for workers at large businesses and 94 percent for those at small ones, was approved by an 11-1 vote. Large businesses, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning Jan. 1, according to a news release from the city. On July 1, 2018, small businesses will have to pay $10.25 and the rate will go to $11.25 for large ones. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business.  The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that,  City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota's biggest city, more than 70,000 workers stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city.  We cannot make Minneapolis an island,  Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some others have already approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year.

The Rating Outlook on the Long-Term ratings is Stable. Simultaneously, Fitch has assigned an expected Long-Term rating of 'B(EXP)/RR4' to Invatlan's proposed senior notes. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to the information already received. The proposed senior notes, up to USD150 million, will have a maturity of five years (due 2022) with semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments and the principal will be paid on the maturity day. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs and Senior Debt Ratings Invatlan's IDRs reflect the financial profile of its main subsidiaries, mainly Banco Atlantida (Atlantida), rated 'A+(hon)' on the national scale by Fitch, which has demonstrated sound financial performance through the economic cycle. The ratings also consider Invatlan's high operational integration with its operating subsidiaries, as well as the light restrictions on subsidiaries upstreaming liquidity to Invatlan. Invatlan's ratings also reflect the expected moderate levels of double leverage. Invatlan's creditworthiness is aligned with its main operating subsidiary, Atlantida, since its status as a pure holding company with low ability to generate profits in an unconsolidated basis creates a natural dependence on the dividend flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial commitments. This is particularly relevant because of Invatlan's expected moderate levels of double leverage, defined as equity investments in subsidiaries plus the holding company's intangibles, divided by the holdco's common equity. Fitch expects Invatlan's double-leverage ratio to increase due to the holdco's future plans to issue USD150 million of debt, although in Fitch's view it will be maintained below 120%. According to Fitch's criteria, a double-leverage ratio of 120% or below indicates a manageable level of debt service costs, thus supporting the equalization of Invatlan's creditworthiness with that of Atlantida. The agency considers as positive for Invatlan that Honduran regulations do not establish restrictions to capital and liquidity fungibility. Thus, Invatlan's subsidiaries can pay dividends to their holdco or inject liquidity efficiently. Dividend flows from its subsidiaries are expected to be ample and more than sufficient to service the entity's debt issue. Atlantida is the second largest bank in the country by loans and the first by customer deposits, with an important position in the corporate lending market. Its ample footprint helps serve clients nationwide and provides a solid base for expanding the bank's operations. Atlantida's financial performance is highly sensitive to Honduras' operating environment. The bank's ratings consider the adequate quality of its loan portfolio, solid local franchise, good operating profitability, low funding cost, adequate liquidity and sound capitalization. The expected rating of 'B(EXP)' reflects that these are senior obligations of Invatlan that rank pari passu with other senior indebtedness, and therefore this rating is aligned with the company's Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs of 'B'. The recovery rating of 'RR4' assigned to Invatlan's senior debt issuance reflects the average expected recovery in case of the company liquidation. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs and Senior Debt Ratings Invatlan's creditworthiness will likely move in line with that of its main subsidiary, Atlantida. Although it is not Fitch's base case scenario, a downgrade could also take place due to a significant weakening of Atlantida's financial performance and company profile. This includes a deterioration of asset quality that negatively affects operating profitability and a significant weakening in the bank's capital position that leads to a reduction in dividend payments available to service Invatlan's debt. Also Invatlan's IDRs could be downgraded by one notch if the company's double-leverage ratio is sustained above 120%. Given their senior nature, these notes will typically be aligned with the company's IDRs, and the rating of the notes will mirror any potential change to Invatlan's IDRs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --Long-Term Foreign and Local currency IDRs at 'B'; --Short-Term Foreign and Local currency IDRs at 'B'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next week's recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trump's tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trump’s suggestion, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Related CoverageWhite House says fully committed to draft Senate healthcare billTrump wrote on Twitter Friday morning,  If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!   The White House said later that Trump was still  fully committed  to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The president hasn't changed his thinking at all,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks down while speaking to reporters about healthcare during an energy policy discussion with leaders of American Indian tribes and U.S. governors at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe current Senate legislation would repeal parts of Obamacare, roll back its expansion of the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, eliminate most of Obamacare's taxes and replace Obamacare insurance subsidies with a system of tax credits to help individuals buy private health insurance. Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted:  Glad you agree, Mr. Pres.  Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it,  senators would have done that in January. It doesn't have the votes, and it's a waste of valuable time to discuss it.  Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnell's spokesman declined to comment on Trump's tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPAN's  Newsmakers  program that lawmakers' goal should continue to be  not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.

U.S. fund investors put the most money into overseas equities since the second quarter in 2015, with more than half of the $90 billion outflows for the first half coming in the second quarter, according to preliminary Lipper data. The MSCI Emerging market index .MSCIEF has risen 17 percent year-to-date compared with a 4.9 percent rise for Europe's Stoxx 600  index and the S&P; 500 index's 8.0 percent gain. Since emerging market central banks have been lowering interest rates and their currencies have been falling in recent years this is now helping to boost economic growth, according to Northwestern Mutual's Chief Investment Strategist, Brent Schutte. But still the emerging market index is roughly 25 percent off its all-time high reached in 2007 while the Stoxx 600 is 8.0 percent off its record high. In comparison the S&P; 500 is just 1.0 percent below its latest record, reached in June 2017.  The overseas indexes could reach new record highs over the next two years, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago citing improving growth.   Finally the recovery has really picked up in the rest of the world. It's moving along faster than the U.S. because it's trailed. The U.S. is further along because the central bank here really was aggressive in quantitative easing first,  said Ablin. For the second quarter, revenue for companies in European markets are expected to grow 5.8 percent compared with 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 index companies and 11.5 percent for emerging markets in the Asia Pacific Region, according to Reuters data.  Earnings estimates for European companies for the period stand out with a 13.5 percent jump seen compared with 8.0 percent growth expected for the S&P; 500 and 6.4 percent for emerging markets.      Northwestern Mutual's Schutte said his company is betting that outperformance in emerging market and European stocks should continue and cited a one-two year timeframe for investment in eurozone stocks in particular.  His firm started moving money into non-U.S. stocks around February 2016 when it replaced investments in U.S. real estate investment trusts with equities in international developed markets in expectation of improving earnings growth. However, not everybody is convinced that the attraction of European stocks will last as long. John Praveen, chief investment strategist at, Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey was wary of predicting European outperformance beyond the next quarter. Praveen expects strong earnings growth in both Europe and emerging markets this year. But he said potential headwinds in Europe could include a pull back in European Central Bank monetary policy accommodation or uncertainly around a national Italian election, required by the end of the first half of 2018.    But for now he said,  Their earnings outlook is stronger and their central bank is still providing quantitative easing liquidity while ours is raising rates and the Fed is starting normalization.

The note's contents were among new information offered by local District Attorney Hillar Moore III that provided the most extensive details to date of the shooting rampage. It was the second racially-charged incident in July 2016 in the city, where angry protesters decried the police shooting of a black man outside a convenience store. Citing computer records, Moore said gunman Gavin Long had searched for the addresses of the two Baton Rouge police officers involved in the July 5, 2016, death of Alton Sterling, 37, outside the Baton Rouge store.  But investigators found no evidence that Long, 29, who was black, did anything else to pursue those officers, the prosecutor said.  We don't have a clear answer as to why, exactly, he came  to Baton Rouge versus targeting another city, Moore told reporters.   Long, who was angered by the deaths of black men in police shootings, wrote in the suicide note that his actions were  a necessary evil  that needed to happen  in order to create substantial change within America's police force and judicial system.  During the incident, witnesses alerted Baton Rouge police officer Matthew Gerald and East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola to a man circling behind a shop with an assault rifle. Baton Rouge officer Montrell Jackson, who was at a nearby car wash, joined the lawmen to search for the suspect. In a surprise ambush, Long fired multiple rounds toward the three officers, killing them.  He injured three more Baton Rouge police officers before he was killed in a gunfight.  There was no doubt  the officers' decision to kill Long was necessary, Moore said.  These courageous officers who responded to this tragedy were completely justified in dispensing of their duties and certainly saved more lives than what was taken,  Moore said.  Long's ambush followed an attack on police in Dallas that left five officers dead and unrest over the police killing of Philando Castile, 32, near St. Paul, Minnesota, on July 6. Federal prosecutors declined to charge the officers involved in Sterling's death, and the officer who killed Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted in that case this month.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) replaces more than a dozen federal and state levies and unifying a $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into one of the world's biggest common markets. The measure is expected to make it easier to do business by simplifying the tax structure and ensuring greater compliance, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic credentials  before a planned re-election bid in 2019. At a midnight ceremony in parliament's central hall Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee together launched the new tax by pressing a button.  With GST, the dream of 'One India, Great India' will come true,  Modi said. For the first midnight ceremony in the central hall in two decades, Modi was joined by his cabinet colleagues, India's central bank chief, a former prime minister and major company executives including Ratan Tata. The launch, however, was boycotted by several opposition parties including the Congress Party, which first proposed the tax reform before it fell from power three years ago.  Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh - the architect of India's economic reforms - also gave it a miss. Complex Structure It has taken 14 years for the new sales tax to come into being. But horse trading to get recalcitrant Indian states on board has left Asia's third-largest economy with a complex tax structure. In contrast to simpler sales taxes in other countries, India's GST has four rates and numerous exemptions.  Members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) youth wing dance as they celebrate the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in New Delhi, India June 30, 2017.Adnan AbidiThe official schedule of rates runs to 213 pages and has undergone repeated changes, some taking place as late as on Friday evening.  Many businesses are nervous about how the changes will unfold, with smaller ones saying they will get hit by higher tax rates.  Adding to the complexity, businesses with pan-India operations face filing over 1,000 digital returns a year. While higher tax rates for services and non-food items are expected to fuel price pressures, compliance is feared to be a major challenge in a country where many entrepreneurs are not computer literate and rely on handwritten ledgers. Slideshow (2 Images) We have jumped into a river but don't know its depth,  said A. Subba Rao, an executive director at power firm CLP India. 'One Tax, One Market, One Nation' Poor implementation would deal a blow to an economy that is still recovering from Modi's decision late last year to outlaw 86 percent of the currency in circulation. In a bid to mitigate the impact on the farm sector, the GST rates for tractors and fertilizer were slashed on Friday to 18 percent and 5 percent, respectively. HSBC estimates the reform, despite its flaws, could add 0.4 percentage points to economic growth. An end of tax arbitrage under the GST is estimated to save companies $14 billion in reduced logistics costs and efficiency gains.  As the GST is a value added tax, firms will have an incentive to comply in order to avail credit for taxes already paid. This should widen the tax net, shoring up public finances.  The old India was economically fragmented,  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.  The new India will create one tax, one market for one nation.

The meal-kit investments have come as out-of-favor brands, increased competition and pricing wars among grocers weigh on sales and profitability at the biggest food companies.  The packaged food companies hope that the new and growing meal delivery industry, with its detailed consumer preferences data and feedback, will help big brands reconnect with young shoppers who have moved to new distribution channels or abandoned staple labels for fresher, healthier or specialty items.  Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N), the 148-year-old Camden, New Jersey-based packaged food manufacturer best known for its canned soups, last month invested $10 million in El Segundo, California-based Chef'd LLC, a Blue Apron competitor that allows users to personalize meal-kits with branded pairings.  Even if Blue Apron and its competitors struggle to make their model profitable and attractive to public markets, Mark Alexander, who oversees Campbell's digital and e-commerce initiatives, expects benefits from the relatively tiny investment for $16 billion Campbell.  Meal kits may not turn into the biggest thing, and I think even if they don't, we would have learned a lot about consumer shopping, food preferences, what consumers like about bundled services and what they don't like,  Alexander said in an interview earlier this week. Campbell has struggled with weakening demand for its core products, and warned in May that its full-year sales could decline.    Blue Apron, the biggest meal-kit delivery company, was forced this week to accept a valuation and public offering that were about a third smaller than it hoped, after investors expressed concerns about its lack of profitability, marketing costs and the impact of Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) $13.7 billion deal earlier this month to buy U.S. grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). Blue Apron shares last traded around $9.45 on Friday, below their $10 IPO price, giving the company a market capitalization of around $1.8 billion, less than the $2.2 billion valuation of its latest private fundraising round two years ago. While the vast majority of investments in meal-kit companies, totaling $1.4 billion in 2016, came from venture capital firms hoping to reap big profits as these startups expand, a tiny fraction came from big food companies. Nestle SA (NESN.S) led a $77 million investment round in Freshly in June, while Unilever Plc's venture capital arm (ULVR.L) led a $9.2 million investment in Sun Basket in May.  Noodles are held in an undated photo illustration provided by New York-based meal kit delivery service Blue Apron. Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSBlue Apron does not have any investment from a major food company. While Amazon's splashy bet on Whole Foods sent jitters across the food retail sector over its potential to revolutionize the e-commerce company's reach, the investments in meal-kit delivery companies are a way for major companies to carry out smaller-scale experiments as consumers move to buying food online.  Just 23 percent of Americans buy groceries online, but that share is expected to more than triple in under 10 years, according to data provider The Nielsen Company.   I think Nestle and other consumer packaged good companies said we want to be part of this new industry and understand more in-depthly how it affects our business,  said Freshly Chief Executive Michael Wystrach.  Data Labs Meal delivery companies rely on online registration for their services. Customers can provide feedback on the meals and information on their preferences, representing a valuable data trove that can be used to develop targeting advertisement.  We can ask people questions to help them find items and collect data that is individual and granular. That data is different than the demographic data (at supermarkets) because it can tell us more, such as a person's lifestyle, cooking habits or allergies,  said Chef'd CEO Kyle Ransford. To be sure, meal-kit investments by big food companies are in their infancy, and the value they can offer as consumer data labs is unproven. Supermarkets have also been tracking shopping habits for years, with varying degrees of success.  And as Blue Apron's IPO shows, investors are concerned about how sticky the meal-kit subscription models actually are, raising the risk of consumers moving on to the next food trend before providing enough data to be meaningful. Still, the delivery services offer a venue to quickly test new products and ideas, in contrast to lengthy and often costly focus groups usually used by big consumer companies.   We have real-time response to the consumers; what do they like, what do they buy rapidly, and what should we make rapidly. It is a real-time test market,  said Campbell Soup's Alexander.

The fire has damaged buildings, but there were no reported  serious injuries, said Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire spokeswoman Tiffany Davila.  The blaze, dubbed the Goodwin Fire, has charred nearly 25,000 acres (10,120 hectares) and destroyed an unknown number of homes after erupting last Saturday in the Prescott National Forest, 70 miles (110 km) north of Phoenix. Stoked by high winds as it roared through dense, sun-baked chaparral, the blaze raged largely unchecked for the first few days, but by late Thursday evening firefighting teams had managed to contain 43 percent of the fire. Authorities reopened part of Highway 69 in Mayer, a town of 1,400 people, and residents from the east side of nearby Poland Junction were allowed to return home on Friday, Davila said.  Still, at least 1,000 residents from about 10 other communities were waiting to return home.  Officials lifted evacuation orders on Thursday for several parts of the area, including Mayer, that was evacuated on Tuesday.  Diminished winds and increased humidity helped slow the fire's growth and intensity, aiding a force of about 1,000 firefighters, including crews in airplane tankers dumping payloads of flame retardants, officials said.  Within the first few days of the fire, weather conditions – wind - and thick vegetation really hindered firefighters' operations,  Davila said. The Goodwin blaze was among the largest of the 17 active wildfires burning across Arizona on Friday.  Heavy rainfall in parts of the West over the winter and spring helped delay the onset of the fire season, but also spurred the growth of dense vegetation that has now dried out and become highly combustible as summertime heat sets in. On Friday, Tennessee prosecutors dropped arson charges against two juveniles in connection with a November wildfire, where fourteen people died, in the eastern part of the state around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, officials said.  Prosecutors are unable to prove criminal responsibility of the two juveniles beyond a reasonable doubt because of weather conditions, according to a statement from Fourth Judicial District Attorney General Jimmy Dunn.  The deadly fire was the highest death toll from wildfires in the United States since 2013, when 19 firefighters died near Prescott, Arizona.

AT&T;, which is in the process of buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, said the service now offers live local channels to 70 percent of U.S. households, more than double at its launch in November. The number of streaming services is growing rapidly as technology and telecommunications companies target about 20 million U.S. households which have no pay-TV package. Dish Network Corp sells a streaming service called Sling TV. Hulu LLC, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp, Time Warner and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc , launched its service in May.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - As U.S. officials investigated in January the FSB's alleged role in election cyber attacks, U.S. technology firms were quietly lobbying the government to soften a ban on dealing with the Russian spy agency, people with direct knowledge of the effort told Reuters.  New U.S. sanctions put in place by former President Barack Obama last December - part of a broad suite of actions taken in response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election - had made it a crime for American companies to have any business relationship with the FSB, or Federal Security Service.  Previous Reuters Cyber coverage: Under pressure, Western tech firms bow to Russian demands to share cyber secretsMore Cyber Risk news U.S. authorities had accused the FSB, along with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, of orchestrating cyber attacks on the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a charge Moscow denies.  But the sanctions also threatened to imperil the Russian sales operations of Western tech companies. Under a little-understood arrangement, the FSB doubles as a regulator charged with approving the import to Russia of almost all technology that contains encryption, which is used in both sophisticated hardware as well as products like cellphones and laptops.  Worried about the sales impact, business industry groups, including the U.S.-Russia Business Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, contacted U.S. officials at the American embassy in Moscow and the Treasury, State and Commerce departments, according to five people with direct knowledge of the lobbying effort.  The campaign, which began in January and proved successful in a matter of weeks, has not been previously reported.  In recent years, Western technology companies have acceded to increasing demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets, including source code, Reuters reported last week.  Russia's information technology market is expected to reach $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation.  The sanctions would have meant the Russian market was  dead for U.S. electronics” said Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, who argued against the new restrictions. “Every second Russian has an iPhone, iPad, so they would all switch to Samsungs,  he said.  A spokesman for the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. A State Department official said Washington considered a range of factors before amending the FSB sanction and regularly works with U.S. companies to assess the impact of such policies.  The lobbyists argued the sanction could have stopped the sale of cars, medical devices and heavy equipment, all of which also often contain encrypted software, according to a person involved in the lobbying effort. The goal of the sanctions was to sever U.S. business dealings with the FSB - not end American technology exports to Russia entirely, the industry groups argued.  “The sanction was against a government agency that has many functions, only one of them being hacking the U.S. elections,” said Rodzianko.  The lobbyists assembled representatives from the tech, automotive and manufacturing sectors to make the case to the U.S. Treasury Department, said the person involved in the lobbying effort.  FILE PHOTO: Police guard the FSB headquarters during an opposition protest in Moscow, Russia, on March 5, 2012.Mikhail Voskresensky/File PhotoThe industry groups did not argue against the intent of the sanction but asked for a narrow exception that would allow them to continue to seek regulatory approvals from the FSB while still keeping in place the broader ban on doing business with the spy agency.     PUNISHMENT FOR VERY BAD ACTS     The industry groups represent a number of technology firms with a large presence in Russia, including Cisco and Microsoft.  Reuters was unable to determine which companies were directly involved in the lobbying. Microsoft said it did not ask for changes to the sanctions. In a statement, Cisco said it also did not seek any changes to the sanction but had asked the Treasury Department for clarification on how it applied.  In order to get encrypted technology into Russia, companies need to obtain the blessing of the FSB, a process that can sometimes take months or even years of negotiation. Before granting that approval, the agency can demand sensitive security data about the product, including source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment.  The United States has accused Russia of a growing number of cyber attacks against the West. U.S. officials say they are concerned that Moscow’s reviews of product secrets could be used to find vulnerabilities to hack into the products.  Some U.S. government officials rejected the industry groups' arguments. They openly embraced the prospect of any ripple effect that cut further trade with Russia.  Kevin Wolf was assistant secretary at the Commerce Department and oversaw export control policy when the FSB sanction was put in place. Wolf said within days of the sanction taking effect, Commerce received numerous calls from industry groups and companies warning of the unintended consequences.  But for Wolf, who was  furious  with Moscow over the alleged cyber attacks, any additional curbs on trade with Russia was a bonus rather than an unintended downside.   I said, 'Great, terrific, fuck 'em ... The whole point is to interfere with trade',  recounted Wolf. “The sanction was meant to impose pain (on Russia) and send a signal as punishment for very bad acts.   Wolf left the Commerce Department when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.  Other officials felt that the impact on legitimate trade was too great. “The intention of the sanction was not to cut off tech trade with Russia,” said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the process.  The lobbyists had also argued that since the sanctions only applied to U.S. technology makers, it would put them at a disadvantage to European and Asian companies who would still be able to interact with the FSB and sell products in Russia.   We were asking for a narrow technical fix that would give a fair deal for American companies,  Dan Russell, CEO of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, said in an interview.  The advocacy worked. State and Treasury officials began working to tweak the sanction in January before Obama left office, according to people involved in the process.  On Feb. 2, the Treasury Department created an exception to the sanction, about two weeks after Trump took office, to allow tech companies to continue to obtain approvals from the FSB.

Redfin is part of a wave of U.S. real estate technology companies such as Zillow Group (ZG.O), Compass and Open Door Labs Inc looking to improve home sales marketing. Mealkit maker Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) had a lackluster debut this week after the company reduced its valuation while storage company Tintri Inc (TNTR.O) went public on Friday after delaying its IPO by a day and cutting its price. Based in Seattle, Redfin launched its home-buying services in February 2006. It charges customers a commission of 1.5 percent, less than half the average listing fee, to list their homes, according to its website, which says it has helped more than 30,000 families buy and sell homes. Redfin generated a loss of $22.5 million on $267.2 million of revenue in 2016, the filing said. Redfin also makes money from commissions when customers make an offer on homes on Redfin.

AT&T;, which is in the process of buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, said the service now offers live local channels to 70 percent of U.S. households, more than double at its launch in November. The number of streaming services is growing rapidly as technology and telecommunications companies target about 20 million U.S. households which have no pay-TV package. Dish Network Corp sells a streaming service called Sling TV. Hulu LLC, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp, Time Warner and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc , launched its service in May. New additions to DirecTV Now, which starts at $35 a month, include Disney's ABC in 30 new markets including Atlanta and Boston. But the lineup does not include CBS Corp, which sells its own streaming service called All Access. Adding more local channels allows AT&T; to offer customers a viewing experience more similar to a larger TV bundle. AT&T; spokeswoman Erin McGrath said by phone that local news and sports are key considerations for consumers thinking of switching to a streaming service. AT&T; has been pushing DirecTV Now by bundling the service with wireless plans and has added support for Roku streaming devices.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 31.23 points, or 0.21 percent, at 15,182.19. For the week, the index lost 0.9 percent, while it ended 1.1 percent lower for the month.  A lot of people don't like to be long over the weekend, let alone long over four days,  said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities. The Canadian stock market will be closed on Monday for Canada Day, while some investors could stay away from their desks on Tuesday as Wall Street closes for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.  We may be into the summer doldrums a little early,  Kinsey said. Some of the most influential movers on the index were its biggest banks and insurers, with Royal Bank of Canada down 0.6 percent at C$94.16 and Manulife Financial Corp off 0.7 percent at C$24.31. The financials group, which accounts for a third of the index's weight, lost 0.4 percent. Exploration stage uranium company Nexgen Energy Ltd advanced 8.7 percent to C$2.87 after saying it had secured $110 million in financing. But Cameco Corp, a larger uranium producer, shed 3.8 percent to C$11.81. Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note that oversupply in the uranium market would likely weigh on Cameco's stock for several years. The broader energy group fell 0.5 percent even as oil climbed for a seventh straight session, boosted by decrease in the U.S. rig count and stronger demand data from China. Six of the index's 10 main industry groups ended lower. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.2 percent, while the consumer discretionary sector rose 0.5 percent as Canada's economy showed signs of strength. Restaurant Brands International Inc, which operates the Tim Hortons and Burger King franchise restaurants, rose 0.9 percent to C$81.14 and global automotive supplier Magna International Inc climbed 1.1 percent to C$60.07. Canada's economy grew for a sixth consecutive month in April, while a central bank survey of business sentiment showed firms were feeling more upbeat. Top Bank of Canada officials' recent assertions that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts did their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices appear to be paving the way for a tightening move as soon as next month.

Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Labor Department has continued to fight a challenge to an Obama administration-era rule to raise the pay threshold for overtime eligibility. But it has not endorsed the former administration's move to nearly double that threshold, an increase strongly opposed by business groups.  The Labor Department told a federal appeals court on Friday it had the power to use salaries to set thresholds for mandatory overtime pay, without advocating for the $47,500 maximum salary level set by the department under Obama. The Labor Department is challenging a November decision from a federal judge in Texas that blocked the Obama rule, a decision that the department said could prevent it from setting a new threshold below that set by the Obama administration.  The Obama rule was expected to extend overtime pay eligibility to more than 4 million salaried workers. Nevada and 20 other states sued last year to block the rule. Business groups criticized the increase as too drastic and costly, potentially forcing employers to convert salaried workers to hourly wages. Trump's Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during his confirmation hearing in March that the correct threshold might be around $33,000. The Labor Department took initial steps earlier this week to begin developing a new threshold. In its Friday brief to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, the Labor Department made it clear it did not support the salary threshold developed under Obama. But the department told the court it was “reluctant” to move forward with the rulemaking necessary to set a new threshold as long as its authority was in question. Nevada and the other states have said that the use of a salary threshold to determine overtime eligibility has been controversial for decades, but appeals courts allowed it because it had been set low enough to exempt management workers.  But the Obama administration rule is far more drastic, the states said, expanding overtime pay to tens of thousands of state employees. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, criticized the Labor Department's handling of the appeal, saying in a statement that the administration  appears to be preparing to roll back overtime protections for millions of workers.

More than half the patients in a recent study reported taking prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements along with chemotherapy, and roughly one in six patients were using products that put them at risk for potentially harmful drug interactions.  “Patients with cancer frequently use herbal supplements and other medications,” said lead study author Dr. Allan Ramos-Esquivel of the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. “These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions and drug-drug interactions,” he told Reuters Health. Ramos-Esquivel and colleagues surveyed 149 newly diagnosed cancer patients about prescription or over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements they were taking as they started on new anti-cancer therapies.  Working with a clinical pharmacist, the researchers identified 36 potential interactions in 26 patients, or 17 percent. The researchers then notified the oncologist who prescribed the anti-cancer drugs, and in all cases, oncologists modified the patients’ therapy.  “The treatment of cancer has shifted in the past decade to the use of more oral agents,” said John Bossaer of East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Bossaer, who wasn’t involved with this study, has researched drug interactions and anti-cancer drugs.  “Because these newer drugs are taken orally, many patients (and I fear some clinicians) perceive them as safer,” he told Reuters Health by email. “While these oral agents do not generally cause the life-threatening toxicities of IV chemotherapy, they cause many other side effects, which can be worsened by other medications.” Herbal-drug interactions, in particular, are concerning because of unanswered questions and scientific gaps, Bossaer added. Herb-drug interactions go unnoticed because formal drug interaction studies don’t typically include them.  “Moreover, many patients do not openly disclose their use of herbal medications, either because of fear of judgment from their physician or assuming their use isn’t related to their treatment,” he said. In this study, 84 patients, or 56 percent were using herbal supplements at the time of their first cancer drug prescription. Using two or more medicinal products in addition to the anti-cancer therapy was associated with a two times higher risk of a drug interaction, the authors found.  “It is not as black and white as it may seem,” Bossaer said.  For example, he explained, the prostate cancer drug enzalutamide decreases the effectiveness of several medications, including ticagrelor, which is often used after stent placement for heart disease. A drug interaction may put the patient at greater risk for a heart attack, which isn’t typically noticed until the heart attack happens. “This nuance requires both extensive drug and clinical disease-state knowledge,” Bossaer said. “This is exactly what clinical pharmacists are trained to do.” A limitation of the study is that it relies on the self-reporting nature of the questionnaire. Future research should better identify drug and herbal interactions with chemotherapy, the study authors wrote in the Journal of Oncology Practice. “Patients or family members of patients should explicitly ask if a clinical pharmacist has checked their medications for any significant drug interactions,” Bossaer said. “Some may require a medication change, and others may require more frequent lab monitoring.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tthiMN Journal of Oncology Practice, online June 19, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-drug-safety-idUSKBN19L2T7"},

The bond was originally sold in 2014 for $3.25 billion with a 8.75 percent coupon. At the time the country was locked out of the international capital markets due to a debt default that was resolved last year, soon after Macri came to power in late 2015. The president promised to  normalize  the economy after eight years of heavy trade and currency controls imposed by his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, a free-spending populist who feuded with international investors and Argentina's key farm sector. But the wave of bricks-and-mortar investment promised by Macri has been slow to come and the economy is mired in inflation that, while slowing, remains above 20 percent. Macri has increased welfare and public works spending ahead of the mid-term election four months from now. The vote will determine if he has the legislative clout to get market-friendly reforms through Congress in the second half of his term. His success will influence his chances of being re-elected in 2019 as he tries to reintegrate Argentina into the global financial and trade system. Some glimmers of hope for the economy are beginning to show. Argentina offered $2.75 billion of a 100-year bond this month that sold out quickly, and the Macri administration increased its overall 2017 foreign currency bond issuance target to $12.75 billion. Investors should monitor how long the government continues financing its deficit by borrowing and spending, said Jay Newman, a private investor and former executive with Elliott Management, a hedge fund involved in a decade-long court battle settled last year over bonds Argentina defaulted on in 2002. Former leader Fernandez, a standard bearer of the country's Peronist movement, is running for the Senate in October.  Macri had a great first year. But Peronism is still strong, unions are strong, and historical relationships and patterns die hard. If Macri is given eight years to really make changes, maybe there will be a paradigm shift,  Newman said.  But it's too soon to tell.” Argentine industrial production turned positive in May, snapping a 15-month streak of declines. May economic activity numbers have not yet been released. The economy grew by 0.6 percent in April.  We expect the cyclical economic recovery to strengthen and broaden with private consumption supported by rising real wages and public investment adding a significant impulse to growth,  Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

A complete list of members and ratings are attached below. The Rating Outlook for all ratings is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating rationale reflects the company's very strong capitalization and leverage, along with FAF's continued strong profitability. The rating also reflects an improving reserve position at FAF that Fitch views as sufficient. Fitch views FAF's capitalization and leverage as being very strong. FAF's risk adjusted capital (RAC) score for year-end 2016 was 188% up modestly from prior year due to an increase in policyholder surplus and reduction in affiliated investments. Fitch anticipates that FAF's RAC score will remain near current levels over the near term. Reported debt-to-capital and debt-to-tangible capital of approximately 19% and 27% respectively at year-end 2016 exceeds median guidelines for FAF's rating category. FAF's profitability is considered strong, with a reported consolidated GAAP pretax operating margin of 8.2% at year-end 2016 down slightly from 8.5% during the prior year. Additionally, title operating margins increased year-over-year from 10.4% in 2015 to 11.3% as of year-end 2016. FAF's profitability benefited from both a reduction in paid title claims as well as an increase in title orders closed. Fitch does note that title insurance revenues are subject to several macroeconomic conditions beyond the control of the company, making expense management critical to sustained profitability going forward. Fitch considers FAF's reserves to be sufficient, and neutral to the rating. Fitch expects FAF reserve position to continue to improve as the company's legacy reserves mature. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following are key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade: --A solid reserve position such that GAAP reserves develop favorably on a consistent basis; --Improvement in capital strength demonstrated by an increase in RAC score to 200% or greater; --A sustained pretax GAAP operating margin of 12% or better; --Demonstration of greater operating performance stability in the next period of unfavorable mortgage and real estate market cycle. Conversely, the following are key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade: --Adverse GAAP reserve development in excess of 10% of total reserves; --Sharp deterioration in earnings performance, primarily measured by pre-tax GAAP margins, at a pace greater than peer averages. --A sustained increase in financial leverage above 30%; --A RAC score below 130% or deterioration in capitalization profile that would lead to a material weaker balance sheet. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: First American Financial Corporation (FAF) --IDR at 'BBB+', Stable Outlook; --$700 million revolving bank line of credit due 2019 at 'BBB'; --$250 million 4.3% debt due 2023 at 'BBB'; --$300 million 4.6% debt due 2024 at 'BBB'. Fitch has affirmed the IFS ratings of the following entities at 'A' with a Stable Outlook: --First American Title Insurance Company; --First Title Insurance, PLC.; --Ohio Bar Title Insurance Co.; --First American Title Insurance Company of Louisiana; --First American Title Guaranty Company.

Nike shares rose 11 percent after the world's largest footwear maker reported a quarterly profit that topped estimates and said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com. Nike shares gave the biggest boost to the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. The S&P; technology index ended down 0.1 percent and posted its first monthly loss of the year, while a decline in biotech shares, which had surged of late, also limited the Nasdaq. Tech has led the S&P; 500's 8.2 percent rally this year, but its recent pullback suggests investors may be cashing in those profits to rotate to other sectors.  Are we going to see a broadening of the rally, where you see more of the financials and other sectors fill in some of the gaps?  said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.  It hasn’t been a broad encompassing rally that I think investors will have to see a little bit more conviction rather than just in a handful of stocks,  Lancz said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.6 points, or 0.29 percent, to 21,349.63, the S&P; 500 gained 3.71 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,423.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.93 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,140.42. Industrials were the top performing sector, rising 0.8 percent.  When you look at some of the stocks that are doing particularly well today, they are some of those economically sensitive-type stocks,  said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  During a time when it seems like there are still a fair amount of naysayers out there about the economy and GDP, anytime you get some of those stocks showing some strength, it probably emboldens the market,” Carlson said. With the second quarter coming to a close, the S&P; 500 recorded its biggest percentage first-half gain since climbing 12.6 percent in the first six months of 2013. The Nasdaq posted its biggest first-half gain since 2009. U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion. The Commerce Department data bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter. Investors have been concerned about recent mixed economic data at a time that the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates from very low levels. Second-quarter corporate results are set to begin in earnest in the coming weeks, with S&P; 500 companies expected to post an 8-percent rise in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors have been looking for earnings to support historically high valuations, with the S&P; 500 trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared to the long-term average of 15 times.  We can talk about the economy and geopolitical risk but earnings drive the market,  said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital Management in Sarasota, Florida.  We’re bumping right along the top end of  historic valuation levels. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The record stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has put the third-most populous U.S. state's credit rating in peril of dropping to junk. House Republicans on Friday helped advance a Democratic-drafted $36.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins on Saturday, but the deal stalled with negotiations continuing over a revenue package and an assortment of non-budgetary matters sought by Rauner. After a 90-25 test vote on the spending bill, House Speaker Michael Madigan said his legislative chamber will return to session on Saturday, and he sent letters to major bond-rating agencies imploring them not to downgrade the state’s credit ratings to junk as budget talks continue. Related CoverageJudge orders Illinois to boost Medicaid bill paymentsThe impasse has ballooned the unpaid bill pile to nearly $15 billion as the state operated on spending mandated by state law and courts. Illinois, already the lowest-rated state, risked becoming the first U.S. state to have its credit downgraded to junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at Baa3 with a negative outlook, said the rating agency  won't refrain from changing a rating no matter the reason when it's appropriate to take action.  S&P;, which also rates Illinois one step above junk at BBB-minus, and Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, declined to comment on Madigan's letter. Ahead of the House vote, Republican leader Jim Durkin said he and others in his caucus would support the budget bill amendment as a gesture of “good faith” while talks continue on new taxes and non-budgetary reforms.   We are close,  he said on the House floor.  We are so close I can taste it.”  House budget votes require Republican support to meet a three-fifths majority needed for passage. “I think it’s a good step forward, a step we can build upon. There’s much work yet to be done,  Madigan said following the vote. A final affirmative vote by the House on the spending plan would send it back to the Senate for concurrence. The House must still take up a revenue bill increasing personal and corporate income tax rates to raise more money for the cash-strapped state.

The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's rating action is predicated on Stewart's strong capitalization, improved profitability, and forecast sustainability of positive trends. Offsetting some of the positives is a business profile that has scale but trails larger peers, and a macroeconomic environment that will likely cause interest rates to rise, thereby dampening mortgage originations. Stewart's strong capital position is characterized by a Risk Adjusted Capital (RAC) score and operating leverage of 172% and 3.1x respectively, at year-end 2016. The RAC score improved from 153% in the prior year, facilitated by 5% growth in surplus, and a 25% reduction in the R10 charge which relates to large losses and ceded reinsurance. Stewart's financial performance has improved recently. The company reported a full-year 2016 consolidated GAAP operating margin of 4% - the highest in the last three years - and a statutory combined ratio of 96% for year-end 2016. While these results were enough to support a revision in the Outlook to Stable, Fitch notes that there is a difference in performance between Stewart and larger, higher rated peers due to its absence of higher margin ancillary services. Financial leverage was 14% at the end of 1Q17 and is anticipated to remain relatively steady. The majority of STC debt is bank debt that carries a lower interest rate, which promotes higher fixed charge coverage. Fitch views Stewart's financial flexibility as limited moderately by the higher emphasis on borrowings under bank liquidity facilities as opposed to longer term debt. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following could lead to a downgrade: --Sustained operating profit margin below 3%; --Capital deterioration whereby Stewart's RAC ratio drops below 125% and/or operating leverage increases above 4.5x; --Financial leverage ratio above 20%; --A large reserve charge that exceeds 10% of prior year reserves. The following could lead to an upgrade: --Consolidated operating profit margin above 8%; --A sustained RAC score above 175% and operating leverage ratio below 4.0x.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The accord disclosed on Thursday in filings with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan ends the 75-year-old McCartney's pre-emptive effort to ensure that the copyrights, once owned by Michael Jackson, would go to him starting in October 2018. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos signed an order dismissing the case, but agreed to revisit it if a dispute arose. The dismissal request had been made by Michael Jacobs, a lawyer for McCartney, on behalf of the singer and Sony/ATV. It is unclear how the accord affects McCartney's copyright claims. The singer's representatives could not immediately be reached on Friday for comment. McCartney had sued on Jan. 18 for a declaration that he could reclaim more than 260 copyrights, including for songs credited to him and John Lennon such as  I Want to Hold Your Hand,   Yesterday  and  Hey Jude.  The registrations at issue also covered  Maybe I'm Amazed  and several other songs McCartney recorded as a solo artist. FILE PHOTO:  Paul McCartney celebrates after performing with Ringo Starr (not pictured) during the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Cleveland, U.S. on Ohio April 18, 2015.Aaron Josefczyk/File PhotoThey even covered such titles as  Scrambled Egg,  which is close to the working lyric  Scrambled Eggs  that McCartney once used for the song that became  Yesterday.  McCartney had been outbid by Jackson in 1985 for the Beatles' song rights, which were later rolled into Sony/ATV, a joint venture with Sony Corp. The pop star's estate sold its stake in that venture to Sony for $750 million last year. McCartney sued 1-1/2 months after a British court said the pop group Duran Duran could not reclaim rights to their songs, in its case against Sony/ATV's Gloucester Place Music unit. Changes made in 1976 to U.S. copyright law let authors like McCartney reclaim song rights after periods of time elapsed. In his lawsuit, McCartney said he could begin exercising his rights on Beatles songs, starting with  Love Me Do,  on Oct. 5, 2018. The case is McCartney v Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-00363.

Trump,Kelly Nokes,RYAN ZINKE,USA,GRIZZLY/YELLOWSTONE (UPDATE 1,PIX,TV),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - Conservationists threatened to sue on Friday in order to block a plan by U.S. wildlife managers that strips grizzly bears of federal protection, opening them to hunting around Yellowstone National Park. Three coalitions - the Humane Society, WildEarth Guardians and another that includes the Sierra Club and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe - each formally notified Republican President Donald Trump's administration that they intend to file lawsuits to prevent the delisting of the bears as endangered species. “Truly recovering grizzly bears requires more than making Yellowstone into a proverbial zoo,  said WildEarth Guardians carnivore advocate Kelly Nokes in a statement.  Bears need protections across their range.” An Interior Department official said in a statement on Friday that the agency had not yet received notices of possible litigation. A request for comment was referred to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. Last week, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former Montana congressman, said Yellowstone-area grizzlies would be removed from the list of endangered species this summer, a move he hailed as  one of America's great conservation successes  due to the animals' rebounding population. The delisting plan, scheduled to go into effect at the end of July, was initially proposed during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration. The number of grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone region has climbed to roughly 700 from 136 in 1975, when the bears in the Lower 48 states were formally listed as threatened after being hunted, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction. The current total exceeds the government's minimum recovery goal of 500 animals in the region. Despite those gains, the grizzly is found in only about 2 percent of its original range in the Lower 48 states. Delisting the bears is strongly supported by hunters, who prize them as trophy animals, and ranchers, a powerful political constituency in the region who say the bears' growing numbers pose a threat to humans and livestock. Environmentalists, meanwhile, argue that while the grizzlies have made a comeback, their recovery could falter without federal safeguards. The groups on Friday said they had sent Zinke letters that they will sue the Interior Department in 60 days unless the government abandons the delisting plans. They contend that habitat loss due to livestock grazing and timber harvesting, as well as dwindling food supplies due to climate change, were not accurately assessed by federal officials in making the decision. Yellowstone National Park is mostly in Wyoming but spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho as well.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-grizzly-yellowstone-idUSL1N1JR1HF"},

The deal is expected to bring Sri Lanka more than $6 billion over five years, which would help Colombo tackle a growing debt crisis. But the deal has drawn strong opposition and led to violent protests by thousands of local people who have their land taken from them for the project. The court threw out the case filed by opposition legislator Vasudeva Nanayakkara against cabinet ministers and others involved in the project including the Chinese company. Nanayakkara said letting the Chinese lease a 15,000-acre plot to develop an industrial zone near the Chinese-built port in Hambantota was an  unlawful decision .  The Supreme Court said there was no infringement as filed and dismissed the case,  Anusha Perusinghe, Nanayakkara's lawyer told Reuters.  China is in the final round of talks to take an 80 percent stake in the industrial zone on a 99-year lease, as part of its  One Belt, One Road  initiative. But sources close to its embassy in Colombo have said China was concerned over the case, which has delayed the formal signing of an agreement on the lease since early January. After signing an agreement on the port deal in December, state-run China Merchants Port Holdings (0144.HK) had been expected to pay $1.12 billion for the stake. It has not yet paid, however, due to the delay in finalizing the deal. China has already spent almost $2 billion on Hambantota, mostly on the port close to the busy East-West shipping route and on a new airport. It plans to spend much more. The port deal was amended to address security and ownership concerns raised by the local Sri Lanka Ports Authority, after being delayed due to protests by trade unions, landowners and political opposition led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and some current coalition government ministers.  In January, hundreds of protesters refused to vacate their land and clashed with police at the opening of the industrial zone - the first violent opposition to Chinese investment in Sri Lanka. When President Maithripala Sirisena unseated Rajapaksa in 2015 he froze all Chinese investments, alleging unfair dealings by his predecessor. He eventually negotiated a new deal with China including the Hambantota project and other plans for industrial zones.

The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. Fitch has also affirmed the long- and short-term National scale ratings of BBVA Valores Colombia S.A. and BBVA Asset Management S.A. at 'AAA(col)' and 'F1+(col)'. The affirmation of BBVA Colombia's IDRs and National scale ratings for all entities covered in this release reflects Fitch's unchanged view of potential support, if it were needed. The consistency of BBVA Colombia's overall profitability metrics through the cycle, underpinned by its retail banking focus, strong recurring and diversified revenues and sound lending activities, drove the affirmation of the bank's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The bank's IDRs, National and senior debt ratings reflect the support it would receive from its parent should it be required. Given its profitability, growth potential, integration with its parent in terms of franchise, business model and management, BBVA Colombia is considered a strategic subsidiary of its parent Banco Bilbao Viscaya Argentaria (BBVA; 'A-'/Stable Outlook) in Latin America. VR The bank's VR is highly influenced by the bank's sound asset quality. BBVA Colombia's rating also considered its strong risk management structure which is fully integrated with that of its parent, stable capitalization metrics and operating environment, sustained profitability and reserve cushions, which are generally in line with other similarly rated entities. BBVA shows one of the best asset-quality metrics compared to that of its local and regional peers. Concentration by industry is very moderate, with participations below 10% of the total loan portfolio, and currently no economic sector is a source of concern for the bank. Amidst economic turmoil, portfolio quality remained stable, non-performing loans (NPLs) increased slightly to 2.1% at March 2017 due to expected asset deterioration, but the ratio compares very well with similarly rated peers. Fitch considers the bank's risk appetite as conservative, supported by its retail focus, collateral requirements, sound risk management, with well-defined systems and procedures. The bank's risk management structure is fully integrated with that of its parent, and it applies all of BBVA's global risk management policies. The risk appetite of the entity follows a global statement, core and specific risk metrics and capital consumption. Despite cyclical deterioration, BBVA Colombia continues to report solid profitability metrics that are in line with its current VR. The bank's operating profitability, as measured by operating profit to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), decreased to 2.0% in recent years (2012-2016 average: 2.46%) due to greater sensitivity of net interest margins to market conditions, its still high dependence on institutional deposits, and decelerating interest income growth. The bank's strong and continuously improving (YE16: 50.8%) operating efficiency ratio (cost-to-income) partially compensated for lower revenues. Operating efficiency compares favorably with other banks in Latin America and underpins the bank's relatively stable operating results over the cycle. Earnings also benefit from BBVA Colombia's retail banking focus. Sustained profitability and a moderate dividend policy support BBVA Colombia's stable capital ratios. The bank's capital is deemed adequate considering its solid asset quality, conservative risk management and good profitability. However, the bank's current capitalization levels compare unfavorably with similarly rated international peers (universal commercial banks in a 'bbb' operating environment), and is considered by Fitch as the main constraint on the bank's VR. Given the importance of the bank in Colombia - both for the regional franchise and for the parent's financial capacity - Fitch believes that the parent organization will provide BBVA Colombia with additional capital should the need arise. BBVA Colombia enjoys a broad and growing customer base that funds 80%-90% of the bank's operations. Deposits come primarily from institutional and public investors, resulting in higher funding costs compared to banks with a wider retail deposit base, and higher depositor concentration (top 20 equalled 37% at YE16). Liquidity risk is carefully monitored, and the bank's liquidity position is ample, according to the parent's strict guidelines which include Basel III guidelines and European regulatory requirements. . SUPPORT RATING The bank's Support Rating (SR) of '2' reflects its role as one of the important subsidiaries of BBVA in Latin America. In Fitch's opinion, BBVA Colombia is strategically important to BBVA's strategy and institutional support should be forthcoming if required. BBVA has a consistent track record of support for its subsidiaries and its ability to support them is illustrated by its 'A-' rating. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES BBVA Colombia's subordinated debt is rated one notch below its IDR to reflect lower expected recoveries, while there is no notching differentiation due to incremental non-performance risk given the terms of the issuances (plain-vanilla subordinated debt) and Fitch believes that parent support can be used effectively to neutralize the non-performance risk of its subsidiary. It has thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of BBVA Colombia's IDR. BBVA VALORES COLOMBIA S.A. and BBVA ASSET MANAGEMENT S.A. NATIONAL RATINGS BBVA Valores and BBVA Asset Management's National ratings reflect the potential support they would receive from their main shareholder, BBBVA Colombia, should it be required. The ratings reflects Fitch's view that the entities are an integral part of BBVA Colombia's business model and core to the strategy of universal banking in Colombia. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The bank's IDRs, National and senior debt ratings would change if Fitch's assessment of its parent's ability and/or willingness to support the bank changes. In general, the IDRs would move in line with those of the parent, subject to country ceiling restrictions on the upside, while the VR shows the minimum level at which the IDRs would be if support propensity were to weaken materially, which is not Fitch's baseline scenario. VR Upside potential for the VR is limited given the sovereign's current rating and Outlook, BBVA Colombia's capital levels, and its relatively moderate franchise. The VRs could be pressured by severe asset quality deterioration or a dismal performance that would erode its capital and reserve cushion in a sustained manner (90-day past-due loans above 3.5% and Fitch Core Capital ratio consistently below 9%). SUPPORT RATING BBVA Colombia's SR would be affected by a change in BBVA's ability or willingness to support the bank. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt ratings will mirror any action on the banks IDR. BBVA VALORES COLOMBIA S.A. AND BBVA ASSET MANAGEMENT S.A. NATIONAL RATINGS BBVA Valores and BBVA Asset Management ratings will mirror any action on the bank's National Ratings. Fitch has affirmed the following: BBVA COLOMBIA S.A. --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BBB+'; Stable Outlook; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDR at 'F2'; --Support Rating at '2'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB'; --National Long-Term Rating at 'AAA(col)'; Stable Outlook --National Short-Term Rating at 'F1+(col)'; --National senior unsecured debt at 'AAA(col)'; --National Long-Term subordinated debt at 'AAA(col)'.

The fiery crash was captured on cell-phone video by a driver and broadcast on local KABC-TV. It showed the twin-engine Cessna 310 as it passed low over the northbound side of the San Diego (405) freeway in southern California before slamming into the ground on the southbound lanes. The aircraft, which appeared to be rapidly losing power, is seen leveling out slightly before hitting the ground and bursting into flames about 1,000 feet from a runway at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana.  Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said  the pilot declared an emergency shortly after taking off from John Wayne airport and was trying to return there when the plane crashed at about 9:35 a.m. local time. Captain Larry Kurtz of the Orange County Fire Authority told KABC that the plane clipped a car on the freeway immediately before crashing, but the occupants of the vehicle were not hurt.

Connecticut, which has one of the lowest credit ratings of all U.S. states despite being one of the wealthiest by personal income, will continue operations under an emergency executive order signed in Hartford by Malloy, a Democrat.  I regret that our state is in this position,  Malloy said in a televised news conference, after signing the order giving him spending control.  But I promise you this - I will not stop working.  The impasse has some precedent. Connecticut started new fiscal years in 1991, 2003 and 2009 without enacted budgets. This year, a huge slump in April income tax revenues compounded the state's weak economic outlook, leading to the big deficit and downgrades from three credit rating agencies in May. Making matters worse, Aetna Inc, the nation's third-largest U.S. health insurer, is moving its corporate headquarters to New York City, the latest company to pull out of the state. The move takes about 250 jobs from the former insurance capital of the world despite Connecticut's efforts to retain the health insurer with incentives. Thousands of jobs will remain on its Hartford campus. Malloy's contingency spending plan preserves essential services like health, safety and human services but drastically cuts other spending by at least $560 million over a full year. Though his fellow Democrats dominate the House and are evenly split with Republicans for control of the Senate, the legislature could not craft its own budget plan or reach compromise with Malloy. They disagree about how to close the deficit and whether to cram down costs, including for teacher pensions, onto local governments. After lawmakers ended their regular session June 7 without a budget, Malloy asked them to come back and approve his  mini-budget,  for fiscal first quarter spending and revenues while making less severe cuts. Instead, House Democrats on Thursday introduced a roughly $40 billion biennial budget for fiscal 2018 and 2019 that would raise the sales tax rate to 6.99 percent from 6.35 percent. House leaders expect to return July 18 for a vote on their plan. Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, a Democrat, disagreed with Republican proposals to cut from local governments and higher education. In the House, Speaker Joe Aresimowicz, has said not all Democrats were in agreement on which programs should be protected. Until it has a full budget, the state is not allowed to approve new general obligation bonds, except for cash flow needs, according to the text of Malloy's plan, released on Monday. His plan anticipates no near-term deterioration of the state's cash position. However, without the ability to issue new debt to replenish funds for ongoing capital projects, the state could potentially need to borrow for cash flow as the year progresses. Such financing  could be difficult and expensive  for Connecticut without a budget in place by then, the order said. On Wednesday, Connecticut completed its last borrowing of fiscal 2017, a $300 million private placement of variable rate debt with Barclays Capital Inc. The credit spread on Connecticut's 10-year debt over other top-rated municipal issuers has widened 26 basis points since the start of the calendar year to 92 basis points, according to Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data division.

The meal-kit investments have come as out-of-favor brands, increased competition and pricing wars among grocers weigh on sales and profitability at the biggest food companies.  The packaged food companies hope that the new and growing meal delivery industry, with its detailed consumer preferences data and feedback, will help big brands reconnect with young shoppers who have moved to new distribution channels or abandoned staple labels for fresher, healthier or specialty items.  Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N), the 148-year-old Camden, New Jersey-based packaged food manufacturer best known for its canned soups, last month invested $10 million in El Segundo, California-based Chef'd LLC, a Blue Apron competitor that allows users to personalize meal-kits with branded pairings.  Even if Blue Apron and its competitors struggle to make their model profitable and attractive to public markets, Mark Alexander, who oversees Campbell's digital and e-commerce initiatives, expects benefits from the relatively tiny investment for $16 billion Campbell.  Meal kits may not turn into the biggest thing, and I think even if they don't, we would have learned a lot about consumer shopping, food preferences, what consumers like about bundled services and what they don't like,  Alexander said in an interview earlier this week. Campbell has struggled with weakening demand for its core products, and warned in May that its full-year sales could decline.    Blue Apron, the biggest meal-kit delivery company, was forced this week to accept a valuation and public offering that were about a third smaller than it hoped, after investors expressed concerns about its lack of profitability, marketing costs and the impact of Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) $13.7 billion deal earlier this month to buy U.S. grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). Blue Apron shares last traded around $9.45 on Friday, below their $10 IPO price, giving the company a market capitalization of around $1.8 billion, less than the $2.2 billion valuation of its latest private fundraising round two years ago. While the vast majority of investments in meal-kit companies, totaling $1.4 billion in 2016, came from venture capital firms hoping to reap big profits as these startups expand, a tiny fraction came from big food companies. Nestle SA (NESN.S) led a $77 million investment round in Freshly in June, while Unilever Plc's venture capital arm (ULVR.L) led a $9.2 million investment in Sun Basket in May.  Noodles are held in an undated photo illustration provided by New York-based meal kit delivery service Blue Apron. Blue Apron/Handout via REUTERSBlue Apron does not have any investment from a major food company. While Amazon's splashy bet on Whole Foods sent jitters across the food retail sector over its potential to revolutionize the e-commerce company's reach, the investments in meal-kit delivery companies are a way for major companies to carry out smaller-scale experiments as consumers move to buying food online.  Just 23 percent of Americans buy groceries online, but that share is expected to more than triple in under 10 years, according to data provider The Nielsen Company.   I think Nestle and other consumer packaged good companies said we want to be part of this new industry and understand more in-depthly how it affects our business,  said Freshly Chief Executive Michael Wystrach.  Data Labs Meal delivery companies rely on online registration for their services. Customers can provide feedback on the meals and information on their preferences, representing a valuable data trove that can be used to develop targeting advertisement.  We can ask people questions to help them find items and collect data that is individual and granular. That data is different than the demographic data (at supermarkets) because it can tell us more, such as a person's lifestyle, cooking habits or allergies,  said Chef'd CEO Kyle Ransford. To be sure, meal-kit investments by big food companies are in their infancy, and the value they can offer as consumer data labs is unproven. Supermarkets have also been tracking shopping habits for years, with varying degrees of success.  And as Blue Apron's IPO shows, investors are concerned about how sticky the meal-kit subscription models actually are, raising the risk of consumers moving on to the next food trend before providing enough data to be meaningful. Still, the delivery services offer a venue to quickly test new products and ideas, in contrast to lengthy and often costly focus groups usually used by big consumer companies.   We have real-time response to the consumers; what do they like, what do they buy rapidly, and what should we make rapidly. It is a real-time test market,  said Campbell Soup's Alexander.

Three coalitions - the Humane Society, WildEarth Guardians and another that includes the Sierra Club and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe - each formally notified Republican President Donald Trump's administration that they intend to file lawsuits to prevent the delisting of the bears as endangered species. “Truly recovering grizzly bears requires more than making Yellowstone into a proverbial zoo,  said WildEarth Guardians carnivore advocate Kelly Nokes in a statement.  Bears need protections across their range.” An Interior Department official said in a statement on Friday that the agency had not yet received notices of possible litigation. A request for comment was referred to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.     Last week, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former Montana congressman, said Yellowstone-area grizzlies would be removed from the list of endangered species this summer, a move he hailed as  one of America's great conservation successes  due to the animals' rebounding population. The delisting plan, scheduled to go into effect at the end of July, was initially proposed during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration.  FILE PHOTO - A grizzly bear and her two cubs approach the carcass of a bison in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, U.S. on July 6, 2015.Jim Urquhart/File PhotoThe number of grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone region has climbed to roughly 700 from 136 in 1975, when the bears in the Lower 48 states were formally listed as threatened after being hunted, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction. The current total exceeds the government's minimum recovery goal of 500 animals in the region. Despite those gains, the grizzly is found in only about 2 percent of its original range in the Lower 48 states. Delisting the bears is strongly supported by hunters, who prize them as trophy animals, and ranchers, a powerful political constituency in the region who say the bears' growing numbers pose a threat to humans and livestock. Environmentalists, meanwhile, argue that while the grizzlies have made a comeback, their recovery could falter without federal safeguards.  The groups on Friday said they had sent Zinke letters that they will sue the Interior Department in 60 days unless the government abandons the delisting plans. They contend that habitat loss due to livestock grazing and timber harvesting, as well as dwindling food supplies due to climate change, were not accurately assessed by federal officials in making the decision. Yellowstone National Park is mostly in Wyoming but spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho as well.

The move is another step by the world's largest social network to weed out spam, a battle Facebook has fought for years but that gained urgency after hoax news stories spread widely during last year's U.S. presidential campaign.  Facebook said the change would reduce the influence of a  tiny group  of people it has identified who share vast amounts of low-quality public posts daily. Only about 0.1 percent of people who share more than 50 posts a day fall into that category, the company said. The change would affect only links shared by those people, not their photos or other posts, the company said.  Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people's feeds,  said Adam Mosseri, Facebook's vice president for the News Feed, in a blog post.  Ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Facebook users saw false news reports saying Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. The Facebook logo is displayed on their website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.Regis DuvignauThe algorithm behind the News Feed determines which posts people see from friends, advertisers and other sources, and the order in which they appear depending on how users responded to previous posts.  Facebook, which has 2 billion monthly active users, frequently tweaks the computer code behind the News Feed. The latest tweak will have a negligible effect, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who monitors social media, in a telephone interview, adding that Facebook needs to hire more content moderators.  Communications platforms used to employ a whole lot more humans, but what we've been led to believe now is that technology will solve everything,  Grygiel said.  In May, Facebook announced a change that would give lower prominence to links that lead to pages full of deceptive or annoying ads. A change in August was designed to deemphasize stories with clickbait-style headlines.  Friday's change will de-prioritize links from specific spammers, Mosseri said.

Presenting its annual monetary policy report, the Bank of Greece said Greece's creditors needed to specify their commitment to medium-term debt relief measures to ensure the sustainability of debt over the medium to long term. Greece's public debt levels are presently at 180 percent of GDP. It has received three bailouts since 2010, and the latest runs out in mid-2018.  Letting this pending matter drag on poses potentially serious risks and might even foreshadow the need for a new financial assistance agreement post-2018, something that neither Greece nor its partners would want,  the Bank of Greece said. A review of Greece's bailout progress was wrapped up this month after more than six months of talks. Its euro zone lenders approved 8.5 billion euros ($9.70 billion) in bailout loans which Greece needs to pay bonds maturing in July and state arrears. The lenders also offered some further detail on debt relief measures that will be carried out in 2018.  But delays in wrapping up the most recent bailout review meant the country's economy would only expand by 1.6 percent this year, less than a previous forecast of 2.5 percent, the Bank of Greece said. The Greek government had already cut its own growth projection to 1.8 percent from 2.7 percent previously. The European Commission projects growth of 2.1 percent.   The weaker growth dynamics can be attributed to the long delay in completing the second review and to the consequent surge in uncertainty, which led to a considerable decline in investment,  the central bank said in the report which was submitted to parliament.    The Bank of Greece added that the medium-term growth outlook remained favorable but was conditional  on the continued smooth implementation of reforms .  It also said that following the agreement the conditions have improved for Greece to regain market access.

The measure, approved by a vote of 11 to 1, will extend the required $15 minimum to smaller businesses in Minnesota's largest city by 2024. Businesses of all sizes, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning next year. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business.  The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that,  City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, a city with about 415,000 residents, the measure will provide a lifeline to the more than 70,000 workers who stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest.  There's going to be intense scrutiny of what happens with this minimum wage and I think that's right,  City Councilwoman Elizabeth Glidden, one of the authors of the proposal, said on Friday after the measure was approved. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city.  We cannot make Minneapolis an island,  Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some other urban areas have approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year. Maryland and Oregon and the cities of Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco have previously approved minimum wage hikes taking effect on Saturday, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

I am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,  said one woman on Thursday at a Sams Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia.      This looks tasty, worth a try,  she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price.  Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits.  China's beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the world's fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand.  U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang.      Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sams Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak.

It doesn't have the mutton smell of domestic beef.   Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO [CNCOF.UL], said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday.

Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.com's meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said.  Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijing's stringent import requirements.  One Sams Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling:  We should not only stick to foreign beef.

The move is another step by the world's largest social network to weed out spam, a battle Facebook has fought for years but that gained urgency after hoax news stories spread widely during last year's U.S. presidential campaign.  Facebook said the change would reduce the influence of a  tiny group  of people it has identified who share vast amounts of low-quality public posts daily. Only about 0.1 percent of people who share more than 50 posts a day fall into that category, the company said. The change would affect only links shared by those people, not their photos or other posts, the company said.  Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people's feeds,  said Adam Mosseri, Facebook's vice president for the News Feed, in a blog post.  Ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, Facebook users saw false news reports saying Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. The Facebook logo is displayed on their website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.Regis DuvignauThe algorithm behind the News Feed determines which posts people see from friends, advertisers and other sources, and the order in which they appear depending on how users responded to previous posts.  Facebook, which has 2 billion monthly active users, frequently tweaks the computer code behind the News Feed. The latest tweak will have a negligible effect, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who monitors social media, in a telephone interview, adding that Facebook needs to hire more content moderators.  Communications platforms used to employ a whole lot more humans, but what we've been led to believe now is that technology will solve everything,  Grygiel said.  In May, Facebook announced a change that would give lower prominence to links that lead to pages full of deceptive or annoying ads. A change in August was designed to deemphasize stories with clickbait-style headlines.  Friday's change will de-prioritize links from specific spammers, Mosseri said.

The deal is expected to bring Sri Lanka more than $6 billion over five years, which would help Colombo tackle a growing debt crisis. But the deal has drawn strong opposition and led to violent protests by thousands of local people who have their land taken from them for the project. The court threw out the case filed by opposition legislator Vasudeva Nanayakkara against cabinet ministers and others involved in the project including the Chinese company. Nanayakkara said letting the Chinese lease a 15,000-acre plot to develop an industrial zone near the Chinese-built port in Hambantota was an  unlawful decision .  The Supreme Court said there was no infringement as filed and dismissed the case,  Anusha Perusinghe, Nanayakkara's lawyer told Reuters.  China is in the final round of talks to take an 80 percent stake in the industrial zone on a 99-year lease, as part of its  One Belt, One Road  initiative. But sources close to its embassy in Colombo have said China was concerned over the case, which has delayed the formal signing of an agreement on the lease since early January. After signing an agreement on the port deal in December, state-run China Merchants Port Holdings (0144.HK) had been expected to pay $1.12 billion for the stake. It has not yet paid, however, due to the delay in finalizing the deal. China has already spent almost $2 billion on Hambantota, mostly on the port close to the busy East-West shipping route and on a new airport. It plans to spend much more. The port deal was amended to address security and ownership concerns raised by the local Sri Lanka Ports Authority, after being delayed due to protests by trade unions, landowners and political opposition led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and some current coalition government ministers.  In January, hundreds of protesters refused to vacate their land and clashed with police at the opening of the industrial zone - the first violent opposition to Chinese investment in Sri Lanka. When President Maithripala Sirisena unseated Rajapaksa in 2015 he froze all Chinese investments, alleging unfair dealings by his predecessor. He eventually negotiated a new deal with China including the Hambantota project and other plans for industrial zones.

The dollar recovered slightly but hawkish signals this week from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada kept the greenback on track for its biggest quarterly decline against a basket of currencies in nearly seven years. Among other sharp contrasts, the euro rose 7 percent in its best quarter since 2010, while the benchmark S&P; 500 stock index was set to post its best first half of the year since 2013 and gold notched its first monthly loss this year. U.S. drillers cut their rig count for the first time since January, energy services company Baker Hughes said, while Chinese factories boosted output at their fastest pace in three months. The strong data from China  certainly gives you hope that demand is growing globally,  said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. U.S. crude futures settled up $1.11 at $46.04 a barrel, the first close above $46 in two weeks. Benchmark Brent crude futures rose 50 cents to settle at $47.92 a barrel. Crude had slumped to a 10-month low last week as rising output revived concerns about global oil glut. A weaker greenback has made dollar-denominated crude less expensive for purchasers using other currencies. Ramped-up expectations for tighter monetary policy from major central banks and skepticism the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year has made the dollar less attractive. The dollar index was last up 0.05 percent at 95.674, while the euro was down 0.17 percent against the dollar at $1.1420. The euro touched its strongest in nearly 14 months on Thursday, at $1.1445, while the dollar index touched a roughly nine-month low of 95.470 early Friday. Nike shares rose 10.5 percent after the world's largest footwear maker reported a quarterly profit that topped estimates and said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com. Nike shares were the biggest boost to both the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. The S&P; technology index climbed 0.34 percent but was still on track to post its first monthly loss of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.25 points, or 0.47 percent, to 21,386.28. The S&P; 500 gained 9.95 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,429.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.92 points, or 0.24 percent, to 6,159.27. In Europe, shares closed lower and ended June with their biggest monthly loss in a year as worries over tighter monetary conditions soured the mood. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares lost 0.44 percent while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.01 percent, lifted by Wall Street. U.S. Treasury yields rose after inflation data was not seen as weak enough to delay the Fed’s expected path on rate hikes.

The drugmakers engaged in a  fraudulent, decades-long marketing campaign to profit from the suffering of thousands of Oklahomans,  Hunter said.  The lawsuit claims the companies knowingly marketed their drugs as safe for chronic pain management while downplaying the risk of opioid dependency,  he added. Purdue, which makes OxyContin, said it denies the allegations but shares Hunter's concerns about the epidemic. J&J; said it acted appropriately, adding that its opioid medications carry U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated warnings about their risks. Allergan said it supports the safe, responsible use of prescription medications. Teva said it is committed to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Oklahoma's lawsuit followed similar cases brought against some of the same companies by Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri. Several cities and counties in California, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and New York have also filed lawsuits over companies' marketing of opioids. A group of state attorneys general announced an investigation this month of the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the opioid epidemic. The states investigating include New Hamsphire, where the highest state court on Friday overturned a lower-court ruling that prevented the enforcement of subpoenas against five drugmakers. The lower-court's decision was based on a finding, now reversed, that the attorney general acted outside his authority by executing a contingency fee agreement with a private law firm to pursue the case.  This case is massive in scope, and we do not have sufficient resources without assistance of outside counsel,  said James Boffetti, chief of the New Hampshire attorney general's consumer protection bureau. Boffetti said Purdue is the probe's current focus. The state had been working with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll to push its investigation forward but it is now relying on Motley Rice after the case's lead attorney switched firms. Purdue said it was disappointed and believes  that privatizing law enforcement presents serious public policy concerns.

In New York State, where the study was done, black seniors on traditional Medicare were 33 percent more likely than whites to be readmitted to hospitals within a month of surgery, researchers found. Moreover, the disparity nearly doubled for black seniors covered by the more expensive and supposedly superior Medicare Advantage.  Blacks covered under private Medicare Advantage plans were 64 percent more likely than whites to be readmitted to hospitals within a month of surgery, according to the report in Health Affairs.  Medicare beneficiaries pay additional premiums for Medicare Advantage programs – commercial insurance plans touted as offering comprehensive disease management and care coordination to help seniors manage health conditions.  “Medicare Advantage has not been successful in reducing the readmission rate for black beneficiaries,” lead author Yue Li, a health policy professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said in a phone interview. “What are the mechanisms? I don’t know for sure.” The study analyzed data from 13,703 patients with traditional Medicare and 6,632 with Medicare Advantage plans who underwent one of six types of major surgeries in New York in 2013. All were 65 and older; the average age was 66.  Overall, 30-day readmission rates were almost identical for traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients: 13.2 percent among Medicare patients and 13.1 percent among Medicare Advantage patients.  For whites, Medicare Advantage reduced the likelihood of 30-day hospital readmission rates by more than 12 percent over traditional Medicare. For blacks, however, Medicare Advantage increased the odds of readmission by nearly 11 percent over traditional Medicare, the study found.  Dr. Joseph Betancourt, who directs The Disparities Solutions Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved with the new study, expected to see racial disparities in hospital readmissions. But the fact that the disparities were nearly twice as large for black Medicare Advantage patients compared to traditional Medicare patients surprised him. “That gap’s pretty big,” he said in a phone interview. “So there’s something significant going on here. Now we need to figure out why is it worse – counterintuitively – if you have Medicare Advantage.” Since Medicare was established in the U.S. more than 50 years ago, disparities in health outcomes have persisted between whites and blacks, prior studies have shown. But the new report is the first to examine the impact of Medicare Advantage on the disparities, Li said. Medicare Advantage data is not generally available to researchers, but New York State granted access to Li and his colleagues. “The great unknown is why do we see greater disparities in Medicare Advantage than in traditional Medicare,” Betancourt said. “The government is expecting if you get people into Medicare Advantage the readmission rate will be lower.” “But as we move people toward Medicare Advantage, African-Americans have worse outcomes,” he said. Though most people in the U.S. over age 65 receive health coverage through traditional Medicare, 31 percent were enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans in 2015, the authors write.  In spite of financial incentives for Medicare Advantage plans to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions, previous research shows mixed results when comparing the two programs’ readmission rates. Betancourt believes racial disparities could arise from challenges around communication, trust and health literacy when patients are discharged. “These issues impact all populations, but they impact some more than others. It’s not just what happens in the hospital. Once they leave the hospital, do they have the services they need?” he asked. “We can’t do one-size fits all,” he said. “We need to tailor our discharge process to meet the needs of diverse patient populations.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2t4REOf Health Affairs, online June 21, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-medicare-blacks-idUSKBN19L2QO"},

(Bogota) and selected related entities and subsidiaries' international and national ratings. Fitch also affirmed Bogota's Viability Rating (VR) and Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'bbb' and 'BBB', respectively. The Rating Outlook was revised to Stable from Negative. Fitch has also revised the Outlook on the Long-term ratings of several of Bogota's affiliated companies to Stable from Negative. A complete list of rating actions is provided at the end of this release. The Stable Outlook on Bogota's Long-Term IDRs now mirrors that of Colombia's Sovereign Rating Outlook. It has been revised to Stable from Negative as part of a peer review of major Colombian banks. The review included an update to Fitch's broad assessment of Bogota's capital adequacy, including recent progress toward rebuilding the country's Fitch Core Capital ratio to levels closer to 10% in the near future. KEY RATING DRIVERS VIABILITY RATING (VR), IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT BOGOTA Bogota's ratings consider its solid and consistent financial performance, sound asset quality and reserves, conservative credit and risk policies, its ample and diversified funding base and its leading franchise. Capitalization remains the bank's main credit weakness relative to international peers (emerging market commercial banks in the 'bbb' category). More importantly, its ratings remain constrained by Fitch's assessment on the operating environment of the jurisdictions in which Bogota's businesses are performed. Bogota's operating profit to risk weighted assets ratio remained robust at 2.8% as if YE16 comparing favourably to international peers. The deconsolidation of Corficolombiana from Bogota's financial statements resulted in extraordinary income that positively influenced overall profitability in 2016. The bank registered a gain of COP2.2 trillion as a result of the difference between the fair value of the bank's investment in Corficolombiana at the date when control was lost and its book value at that date, plus reclassification of other comprehensive income items to income for the period. Fitch expects moderate growth with loans increasing by 10%-12% over the medium term. A lower cost of funding related to an easing of monetary policy will support margins. Operating expenses should remain stable in relative terms, while the cost of credit is expected to grow above loan growth depending on the resolution of specific corporate exposures. Profitability should remain stable with ROAA expected to remain above 1.75% and ROAE inching toward the mid-teens by year-end 2017, in line with the bank's 1Q17 results. Bogota's conservative credit and strong risk management policies have resulted in good asset quality despite a challenging economic environment in Colombia and Central America. PDL ratios (defined as 90+ days past due) deteriorated in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, with PDLs reaching 2.02% of gross loans at end-March. Despite this cyclical deterioration, Fitch expects Bogota to maintain its asset quality ratios at levels commensurate with its current VR due to the bank's conservative risk culture. Bogota's FCC ratio stabilized around 10% in 2016. Measures to strengthen the bank's capital position and focus the bank's activities on the financial business, as well as increased net income, conservative growth and improved efficiency increased Bogota's FCC to 10.06% at YE16 from 8.84% at YE15. In Fitch's opinion, Bogota's sound internal capital generation and sustained moderate growth will support the maintenance of the bank's FCC ratio at around 10%. The bank enjoys a wide customer base and relatively lower funding costs compared to peers. Customer deposits fund Bogota's loan portfolio in its entirety, and the bank has ample access to domestic and international capital markets. Bogota is Colombia's second largest bank by assets (14.6% market share at December 2016) and a market share of 14.4% of deposits and 12.9% of gross loans It is the largest bank by assets in Central America (8.7% market share). Additionally, the bank's Central American operations contribute to a diversified revenue base, a balanced credit portfolio and critical credit card and retail know-how. GRUPO AVAL ACCIONES Y VALORES S.A. Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores S.A. (Grupo Aval)'s ratings are driven by the business and financial profile of its subsidiaries, particularly its main operating subsidiary, Bogota. Low double leverage, adequate cash flow metrics and a sound competitive position in multiple markets also support Grupo Aval's ratings. On a consolidated basis, asset quality remains strong, reflecting diversification and the specific strengths within each of the group's banks. On an unconsolidated basis, Grupo Aval's double leverage is moderate (1.09x at December 2016) and is expected to remain fairly stable unless the group embarks on rapid asset or inorganic growth, which is a scenario not expected by Fitch in the short term. GRUPO AVAL LIMITED The ratings for Grupo Aval Limited's senior secured debt are aligned with those of Grupo Aval, as this entity guarantees the senior bonds issued by the former. CORPORACION FINANCIERA COLOMBIANA S.A. (CORFICOLOMBIANA) Corficolombiana's ratings reflect the potential support it would receive from its main shareholder and its controlling companies, Banco de Bogota and Grupo Aval, respectively, should it be required. In Fitch's opinion, Corficolombiana's long-term equity investments and active treasury activity make it a core part of the wider Grupo Aval businesses. Bogota's willingness to support the entity remains unchanged as long as the bank remains Corficolombiana's main shareholder. Corficolombiana is an investment-holding company that controls or holds significant interests in various companies in Colombia and abroad. In addition, Corficolombiana has invested in agribusiness and hospitality. The entity's equity investment policy is focused on low risk, consistent dividend-generating companies. CREDOMATIC INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (CIC) Credomatic International Corporation's (CIC) IDRs reflect the high probability of the support it would receive from its parent, Bogota, should it be required. Bogota's IDR reflects its ability to support CIC. Fitch considers the financial support to CIC would be timely and sufficient. CIC's IDRs mirrors its parent's ratings because is a strongly performing subsidiary with generally good prospects and valuable experience in retail financing, therefore, in Fitch's view, it would be somewhat more likely to be supported by its parent. Additionally, some of Bogota's debt issuances state that a CIC default will constitute a technical default on its obligations. In Fitch's opinion, these clauses provide strong incentives to prevent CIC's default. FIDUCIARIA CORFICOLOMBIANA S.A. Fiduciaria Corficolombiana's ratings reflect the potential support it would receive from its parent, Corficolombiana, should it be required. In Fitch's view, Fiduciaria Corficolombiana is an integral part of Corficolombiana's business model and core to its strategy. BANCO DE OCCIDENTE (OCCIDENTE) Occidente's Long-Term Local and Foreign Currency IDRs are driven by its viability rating (VR) of 'bbb'. The bank's ratings considers its solid capital ratios, healthy profitability and asset quality metrics, moderately concentrated funding, as well as its low-risk and diversified business model. Consistent capital generation and moderate dividend policies underpin Occidente's solid capital metrics. The declining trend of recent years in the bank's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio reverted in 2016, reaching 14.32% by year-end as internal capital generation materially exceeded asset growth. In Fitch's view, Occidente's capital ratios are adequate given the bank's strong loan loss reserves and loan quality as well as its stable earnings generation. This level continues to exceed that of its domestic peers and is in line with international peers. As a medium-sized bank with ample presence throughout the country, Occidente boasts a stable and ample deposit base. Deposits come primarily from institutional and public investors, resulting in higher funding costs and depositor concentrations compared to banks with a wider retail deposit base. Fitch believes that Occidente's less diversified company profile relative to other larger Colombian banks could be a potential limitation to future rating upgrades. Occidente's conservative credit and risk management policies underpin its good asset quality indicators. The bank's impaired loan ratio decreased slightly to 1.9% as of December 2016, due to less dynamic economy, as expected by Fitch. Despite cyclical deterioration, Occidente's ratios compare well with those of similarly rated peers. Sufficient loan loss reserves (1.7x its 90-day PDL portfolio) also complement this metric. In spite of resilient margins and the sustained generation of non-interest revenues, an increase in delinquency levels accompanied by the need for additional loan loss provisions weighed on profitability. In Fitch's opinion, Occidente's profitability is aligned to its corporate focus and the limited size of the bank. Furthermore, profitability metrics are in line with the bank's VR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR BOGOTA Given its size and systemic importance, Bogota is likely to receive support from Colombia's government, should it be required. Colombia's ability to provide such support is reflected in Colombia's sovereign rating ('BBB'/ Outlook Stable) and drives Bogota's support rating floor of 'BBB-'. GRUPO AVAL As the focus of regulators is on protecting banks' depositors, not their shareholders, it is not likely that they would support a bank holding company. Hence Grupo Aval's SR and SRF are rated '5' and 'No Floor', respectively. CORFICOLOMBIANA AND CIC Given their importance to the strategy and business of their respective parents, support for these entities would come from Grupo Aval and Banco de Bogota respectively. The parents' ability to support their subsidiaries is reflected in their support rating of '2' and IDRs of 'BBB'/Outlook Stable. OCCIDENTE The bank's Support Rating of '2' reflects its role as one of the most important subsidiaries of Grupo Aval, as the second largest bank of the Group. In Fitch's opinion, Occidente is core for Grupo Aval's strategy and institutional support should be forthcoming, if required. Grupo Aval has a consistent track record of support for its subsidiaries and its ability to support them is illustrated by its BBB rating. SUBORDINATED DEBT BOGOTA Bogota's subordinated debt is rated one notch below the bank's VR. The notching reflects higher expected losses in case of liquidation but no additional notching for non-performance, given its gone concern-only characteristics (plain-vanilla subordinated debt). RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS, SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT BOGOTA There is limited upside potential for Bogota's ratings given the bank's capitalization metrics and the Stable Outlook on the Sovereign. On the other hand, any negative rating action on the sovereign would also lead to a similar action on Bogota's IDRs, VR and senior debt ratings. Furthermore, Bogota's ratings could also be negatively affected if the bank is not able to sustain a FCC ratio of around 10%, its impaired loan ratio deteriorates to a level consistently above 4%, or its financial performance weakens (operating earnings relative to risk-weighted assets consistently below 1.5%). GRUPO AVAL and GRUPO AVAL LIMITED Grupo Aval's IDR would remain at the same level as Bogota's and would move in tandem with any rating actions on its main operating subsidiary. However, the relativity between these two entities' ratings could also be affected, in the event of a material and sustained increase in Grupo Aval's double-leverage metrics (above 1.2x), but also considering the holding company's liquidity position and its management. Additionally a change in the dividend flows from the operating companies or debt levels at the holding company that affects its debt coverage ratios could also be detrimental to its ratings. The ratings for Grupo Aval Limited's senior secured debt would move in line with Grupo Aval's IDRs. CORFICOLOMBIANA, FIDUCIARIA CORFICOLOMBIANA AND CIC Corficolombiana's, CIC's and Fiduciaria Corficolombiana's IDRs and National ratings are support-driven, and therefore these ratings would mirror any changes in its main shareholders' IDRs. OCCIDENTE Occidente's Rating Outlook is Stable reflecting Fitch's expectation of no substantial changes in the bank's financial profile over the rating horizon. Nevertheless, the bank's VR, IDRs, and National ratings could be pressured if its performance deteriorates (Operating Profit to Risk Weighted Assets below 1.5%) or its capital weakens (FCC consistently below 10%), though this is not Fitch's base case scenario. While there is limited upside potential given the current relatively high rating level of the bank, Occidente's VR and IDRs could benefit over the medium term by the confluence of a sovereign upgrade, with material and sustained improvements in its competitive position, deposit concentration, and more diversified funding, combined with the maintenance of its overall solid asset quality, capital and performance metrics over the medium term. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The SR is potentially sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of the Republic of Colombia or the entity's parent to provide timely support to Bogota. Bogota's and Grupo Aval's SR and SRF would be affected if Fitch changes its assessment of the government's ability and/or willingness to support the bank or the holding company. Corficolombiana's, CIC and Occidente's SR would be affected if Fitch changes its assessment of the parents' willingness and/or ability to provide support.

Other companies looking at assets of Cemig Telecom, whose fiber optic network stretches 9,500 km (5,900 miles) across five Brazilian states, are Vogel Soluções SA,  Algar Telecom SA and infrastructure funds managed by UBS AG (UBSG.S), the people said. The sale could close as early as October, two of the sources said. Parent company Cemig has hired the investment banking unit of Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA) to conduct the auction, the people said. The sources, who requested anonymity because the process remains private, did not give an estimate for the value of Cemig Telecom. The sale is part of parent Cemig's plan to divest 6.5 billion reais ($2 billion) in assets and refinance 4.8 billion reais of debt by year-end. The potential bidders and Cemig had no immediate comment. Bradesco declined to comment. For a year, Cemig has struggled to decide what assets to sell, underscoring the difficulties of downsizing after growing rapidly. Some of the conglomerate's acquisitions over the past decade, ranging from gas distribution to information technology, have underperformed.

The government is sending federal agents to Chicago and plans to prosecute firearms cases aggressively, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News when asked about Trump's statement about the plan in an early-morning Twitter post.  Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year!  Trump wrote on Twitter. The president has regularly singled out Chicago's violent crime problem and in January decried the high crime rate in the third-most populous U.S. city as  carnage.  In 2016, the number of murders in Chicago exceeded 760, a jump of nearly 60 percent, and was more than New York and Los Angeles combined. There were more than 4,300 shooting victims in the city last year, according to police.  The number of murders, shootings and shooting victims have all decreased slightly this year in the city of 2.7 million. There have been 320 murders, down from 322 over the same period last year. There have been 1,703 shooting victims, down from 1,935, according to police figures.  Sessions said the anti-crime policies in Chicago have not worked and police  have been demoralized in many ways.  The federal assistance will come in the form of the Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force, a collaboration between the police and the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  The group, including police officers, federal agents and intelligence analysts, will work to impede the flow of illegal guns throughout Chicago and target repeat gun offenders.  FILE PHOTO - A Chicago Police vehicle patrols a neighborhood as it drives past a memorial for kids killed by violence in Chicago, August 3, 2011.Jim Young The Trump Administration will not let the bloodshed go on; we cannot accept these levels of violence,  Sessions said in a statement on Friday afternoon. The group became operational on June 1, Sessions said.  It will  significantly help our police officers stem the flow of illegal guns and create a culture of accountability  for the gangs that drive violence in the city, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement. On Monday, the Chicago police announced that the ATF's mobile ballistics lab had arrived in the city to help process shooting scenes.

But the progress CPD (Chicago Police Department) has made this year has happened without any of the new resources from the federal government we requested.  Chicago is also in the midst of reforming its police department after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated the civil rights of people, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct. Joseph Ferguson, the city’s inspector general, called on Chicago officials to agree to a consent decree to oversee changes to the department at a committee meeting on Tuesday – splitting with the mayor, who has said a court-enforced settlement is not necessary for reform. In response to questions about Ferguson’s comments, Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday that the Justice Department has  walked away  from doing consent decrees, and so the city has sought a different strategy.   There are multiple roads that allow you to make sure you make the changes and reform,  he said.

The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Washington upheld a lower court's finding that it lacked the authority to question decision-making by the government over the missile strike. The case began in 2015 when the families of Salem bin Ali Jaber, an imam, and Waleed bin Ali Jaber, a police officer, filed a  wrongful death  suit against the U.S. government, then President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials. They claimed the deaths were collateral damage in an August, 2012 Hellfire missile attack by a U.S. drone in the eastern Yemeni village of Khashamir targeting three extremists, court papers said. Salem had recently preached against al Qaeda and brought Waleed, his nephew, along for protection to a meeting requested by the other three, the papers said. All five men were killed in the strike. The families sought a court declaration that the strike violated international and U.S. law. The lawsuit did not seek monetary relief. The United States has been conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen for years against militant groups like al Qaeda. In 2013, Obama set tighter rules on drone strikes and promised greater transparency. Monday's ruling tossing the suit said that, based on legal precedent, judges cannot second-guess the government's military judgment. It is  the Executive, and not a panel of the D.C. Circuit, who commands our armed forces and determines our nation's foreign policy,  the ruling said. Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown, who wrote the decision, also issued a rare separate opinion calling for greater oversight over the drone program. She said the legal doctrine preventing courts from reviewing the decision-making by the president and Congress in foreign policy or national security matters may be  deeply flawed  because it blocks any court supervision of the use of sophisticated new military technologies like drones.  Of course, this begs the question: if judges will not check this outsized power, then who will?  said Brown, who was appointed to the appeals court bench by Republican former President George W. Bush. She called congressional oversight  a joke -- and a bad one at that.  The other two judges on the panel, both appointed by Obama, did not join her separate opinion.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-yemen-idUSL1N1JR1HM"},

He did not provide specific details. Al Sulaiti repeated Qatar's request for the ICAO to intervene over Gulf neighbors closing their airspace to state-owned Qatar Airways flights in early June. Qatar has also asked for the ICAO to open international airspace over Gulf waters currently managed by the United Arab Emirates. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar, forcing Qatar Airways to fly longer, more expensive routes over Iran. The four countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and have made various demands on Doha. Qatar denies the allegations.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter filed a lawsuit in Cleveland County District Court against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan Plc and units of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The drugmakers engaged in a  fraudulent, decades-long marketing campaign to profit from the suffering of thousands of Oklahomans,  Hunter said.  The lawsuit claims the companies knowingly marketed their drugs as safe for chronic pain management while downplaying the risk of opioid dependency,  he added. Purdue, which makes OxyContin, said it denies the allegations but shares Hunter's concerns about the epidemic. J&J; said it acted appropriately, adding that its opioid medications carry U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated warnings about their risks. Allergan said it supports the safe, responsible use of prescription medications. Teva said it is committed to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Oklahoma's lawsuit followed similar cases brought against some of the same companies by Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri. Several cities and counties in California, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and New York have also filed lawsuits over companies' marketing of opioids. A group of state attorneys general announced an investigation this month of the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the opioid epidemic. The states investigating include New Hamsphire, where the highest state court on Friday overturned a lower-court ruling that prevented the enforcement of subpoenas against five drugmakers. The lower-court's decision was based on a finding, now reversed, that the attorney general acted outside his authority by executing a contingency fee agreement with a private law firm to pursue the case.  This case is massive in scope, and we do not have sufficient resources without assistance of outside counsel,  said James Boffetti, chief of the New Hampshire attorney general's consumer protection bureau. Boffetti said Purdue is the probe's current focus. The state had been working with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll to push its investigation forward but it is now relying on Motley Rice after the case's lead attorney switched firms. Purdue said it was disappointed and believes  that privatizing law enforcement presents serious public policy concerns.

Petrobras has been caught flat-footed by more nimble competitors that have been able to import gasoline and diesel they can sell more cheaply to gas station networks in the country. Since 2016, the state oil company has set fuel prices at least once a month, which is not often enough to keep up with international oil price changes and volatility in Brazil's exchange rate, the company said in a press statement on Friday. From July 3, the Petrobras sales and marketing division will adjust diesel and gasoline prices a maximum of 7 percent from a reference point set by an executive committee. The reference price will include the cost of imports, taxes and margins.  What the commercial area asked for was that we give them tools so that the company can charm the customer, can win him back,  Chief Financial Officer Ivan Monteiro said at a press conference on Friday. That committee includes the company's chief executive, Pedro Parente, as well as Monteiro and Jorge Celestino, the company's head of refining and natural gas. In exceptional circumstances, it could approve a price change larger than seven percent. After years of subsidizing local consumption by keeping fuel prices low despite high international fuel costs, Petrobras kept prices fairly steady to make a profit after oil prices plunged in 2014. But that led the company to lose market share, so last  October it introduced a policy of following international markets more closely.   Petrobras continues to dominate fuel production and retail sales in Brazil, but its higher wholesale prices have led to a sharp rise in imports of gasoline and diesel as competitors seek to undercut Petrobras at the pump. Petrobras supplied 92.2 percent of the gasoline consumed in Brazil in 2016, down from 93.3 percent in 2015.

The families sought a court declaration that the strike violated international and U.S. law. The lawsuit did not seek monetary relief. The United States has been conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen for years against militant groups like al Qaeda. In 2013, Obama set tighter rules on drone strikes and promised greater transparency. Monday's ruling tossing the suit said that, based on legal precedent, judges cannot second-guess the government's military judgment. It is  the Executive, and not a panel of the D.C. Circuit, who commands our armed forces and determines our nation's foreign policy,  the ruling said.  Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown, who wrote the decision, also issued a rare separate opinion calling for greater oversight over the drone program.  She said the legal doctrine preventing courts from reviewing the decision-making by the president and Congress in foreign policy or national security matters may be  deeply flawed  because it blocks any court supervision of the use of sophisticated new military technologies like drones.  Of course, this begs the question: if judges will not check this outsized power, then who will?  said Brown, who was appointed to the appeals court bench by Republican former President George W. Bush. She called congressional oversight  a joke -- and a bad one at that.  The other two judges on the panel, both appointed by Obama, did not join her separate opinion.

Petrobras has been caught flat-footed by more nimble competitors that have been able to import gasoline and diesel they can sell more cheaply to gas station networks in the country. Since 2016, the state oil company has set fuel prices at least once a month, which is not often enough to keep up with international oil price changes and volatility in Brazil's exchange rate, the company said in a press statement on Friday. From July 3, the Petrobras sales and marketing division will adjust diesel and gasoline prices a maximum of 7 percent from a reference point set by an executive committee. The reference price will include the cost of imports, taxes and margins.  What the commercial area asked for was that we give them tools so that the company can charm the customer, can win him back,  Chief Financial Officer Ivan Monteiro said at a press conference on Friday. That committee includes the company's chief executive, Pedro Parente, as well as Monteiro and Jorge Celestino, the company's head of refining and natural gas. In exceptional circumstances, it could approve a price change larger than seven percent. After years of subsidizing local consumption by keeping fuel prices low despite high international fuel costs, Petrobras kept prices fairly steady to make a profit after oil prices plunged in 2014. But that led the company to lose market share, so last  October it introduced a policy of following international markets more closely.   Petrobras continues to dominate fuel production and retail sales in Brazil, but its higher wholesale prices have led to a sharp rise in imports of gasoline and diesel as competitors seek to undercut Petrobras at the pump. Petrobras supplied 92.2 percent of the gasoline consumed in Brazil in 2016, down from 93.3 percent in 2015.

Investors have ramped-up expectations for tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada after hints from officials this week. This has made the greenback less attractive, in addition to skepticism that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year given a recent batch of weak U.S. economic data and doubts that U.S. President Donald Trump could enact his pro-growth agenda. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, declined about 4.6 .DXY percent for the second quarter to mark its steepest quarterly percentage drop since the third quarter of 2010. The euro accelerated more than 7 percent against the greenback for its biggest quarterly percentage gain since the third quarter of 2010. The euro racked up about 2 percent of its gains and the dollar index posted about 1.6 percent of its losses this week alone. The dollar gained about 1 percent against the Japanese yen over the quarter.  FILE PHOTO: A U.S. five dollar note is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017.Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo What really gave the hawkish central banks extra punch was how it seemed to be a coordinated effort to signal a shift away from low-rate policies,  said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationHe said improving economic growth in Europe and Canada opened the door for those comments and was  a reality check how the U.S. isn't standing head and shoulders above everyone else.  The dollar index was last up 0.1 percent at 95.704, while the euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1416. The euro touched its strongest in nearly 14 months on Thursday, at $1.1445, while the dollar index touched a roughly nine-month low of 95.470 early Friday. Analysts said Friday's bounce for the dollar came as some traders likely took profits on gains in the euro as well as the sterling. The dollar fell against the Canadian dollar, however, and was last at C$1.2971 after touching a nearly 10-month low of C$1.2948 earlier.   It appears as though the euro and the pound could be testing some resistance levels, and that could also contribute to ... the profit-taking,  said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

This allowed a patent on a drug to be ruled invalid if a court decided the medication had not lived up to all the promises that a firm had made to be granted the patent in the first place. U.S. companies, complaining that this meant it was far too easy for them to lose patents on drugs they had spent a fortune on developing, wanted the doctrine to be raised as part of the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The nine judges on the top court unanimously backed an appeal by AstraZeneca Plc against generic drug maker Apotex, which wanted to invalidate a patent on a medication used to tackle excess gastric acid.

Berkshire will take a roughly 7 percent ownership stake, worth about $17 billion based on Bank of America's closing price of $24.32 on Thursday. The transaction will make Bank of America one of Berkshire's largest equity investments, joining Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the nation's third-largest bank. It was made possible by Bank of America's June 28 decision to boost its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 7.5 cents, after passing the Federal Reserve's latest  stress test  of its capacity to weather difficult markets. Shares of Bank of America were up 16 cents at $24.48 in early trading on Friday. Berkshire will exercise warrants to acquire the 700 million common shares when Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America increases its dividend, expected in the third quarter. It will swap the $5 billion of Bank of America preferred shares it bought in August 2011 for the common stock, in a cash-free exchange. Warren Buffett, chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, speaks at a National Auto Dealers Association event in New York March 31, 2015. Buffett said he would not raise interest rates significantly if he ran the Federal Reserve, at an automotive industry conference in New York along with chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway automotive dealer group, Larry Van Tuyl.Brendan McDermid - RTR4VNWWBerkshire is sitting on a roughly $12 billion paper profit, because Bank of America's stock price is more than triple the $7.14 exercise price for the warrants. After the swap is completed, Buffett will begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, more than the $300 million he gets from the preferred shares, which have a 6 percent dividend. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, which sends Buffett close to $800 million of annual dividends.

Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, accepted Buffett's investment when many investors worried whether the lender would have enough capital. The bank was only about midway through a multi-year process to clean up its balance sheet, litigation and regulatory probes, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co. That process cost more than $70 billion. Buffett has often praised Moynihan's leadership, telling CNBC in September 2015 that Moynihan resuscitated a bank that had been a  terrible mess.

Jurors in a federal court in Manhattan found Brian Block guilty of fraud and conspiracy following a three-week trial.  We were hoping for a different verdict,  Mike Miller, an attorney for Block, said shortly after the verdict was announced.  We still believe Brian Block is innocent. We will be appealing.  American Realty shares plunged as much as 37 percent on Oct. 29, 2014, wiping out roughly $4 billion of market value, after the company said employees intentionally concealed accounting errors. It also said Block and its chief accounting officer, Lisa McAlister, had resigned the previous day. Block was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy last year. Prosecutors said that in July 2014, he plugged fake numbers into a spreadsheet that was used to prepare the company's financial report for the second quarter of that year in order to disguise a calculation error in a previous report. In closing arguments on Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imparatore reviewed testimony from McAlister, who has pleaded guilty, and Ryan Steel, American Realty's former director of financial reporting. Both testified that they saw Block falsify numbers.

Nike shares rose 11.3 percent after the world's largest footwear maker reported a quarterly profit that topped estimates and said it would launch a pilot online sales program with Amazon.com. Nike shares gave the biggest boost to the Dow industrials and the S&P; 500. A pullback in biotech shares, which had surged of late, limited the Nasdaq's gains. The S&P; technology index climbed 0.3 percent but was still on track to post its first monthly loss of the year. Tech has led the S&P; 500's 8.4 percent rally this year, but its recent pullback suggests investors may be cashing in those profits to rotate to other sectors.  Are we going to see a broadening of the rally, where you see more of the financials and other sectors fill in some of the gaps?  said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.  It hasn’t been a broad encompassing rally that I think investors will have to see a little bit more conviction rather than just in a handful of stocks,  Lancz said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93.2 points, or 0.44 percent, to 21,380.23, the S&P; 500 gained 8.5 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,428.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.76 points, or 0.21 percent, to 6,157.11. Industrials led gains among sectors, rising 0.9 percent, while financials lagged, falling 0.2 percent. With the second quarter coming to a close, the S&P; 500 was on track to record its biggest percentage first-half gain since climbing 12.6 percent in the first six months of 2013. U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion. The Commerce Department data bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter. Investors have been concerned about recent mixed economic data at a time that the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates from very low levels.  In the next four to six weeks we'll get another set of economic data that will tell us if the Fed is justified in raising rates again this year,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Second-quarter corporate results are set to begin in earnest in the coming weeks, with S&P; 500 companies expected to post an 8-percent rise in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Mosby,Tyler Ventura,US,USA,BANKS,RESULTS,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Performance / Results / Earnings,Wealth Management,Banks (TRBC),Funds,Company News,Corporate Events,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,United Kingdom,Banking Services (Legacy),United States","sector":"Business","content":"(Reuters) - For the fourth straight quarter, several of the biggest U.S. banks are reporting earnings on the same day, setting up a situation that overwhelms analysts covering the industry. In a report on Friday, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg noted that 10 of the 19 largest banks by market value are reporting results on just two days next month, on July 14 and 21st.  Seems excessive,  he wrote. Big bank earnings days can be a hectic and frazzled experience for analysts, who must interpret thick documents packed with financial arcana, juggle multiple conference calls with management teams, investor relations departments and clients, and meet hard deadlines to distribute a final take on whether stocks remain a buy, hold or sell. They arrive at work before 7 a.m. to prepare for the news and often stay late into the evening working on their reports and financial models. On July 14, analysts expect to pore through more than 200 pages of press releases, slide decks and financial supplements released by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, PNC Financial Services Group and First Republic Bank before the market opens. JPMorgan is due to start a conference call with analysts at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT). That will be followed by PNC Financial Services Group's call beginning at 9:30 a.m, Wells Fargo at 10 a.m. and Citigroup at 11:30 a.m. Each call typically lasts an hour or more.  It can be maddening and frenetic, particularly when all these firms are reporting in the morning before the bell,  said Tyler Ventura, a research analyst with investment management firm Diamond Hill.  We're going back and forth and saying, 'What did he say on this call versus that call?'  Until recently, it was rare to see more than two of the six biggest lenders report results on the same day. According to a Reuters analysis, that only happened twice in the 22 quarters leading up to the middle of 2016. It is not clear what changed. Bank representatives said earnings are determined by a combination of meeting dates for boards of directors, holidays and travel schedules of CEOs, and that banks do not coordinate with each other on scheduling. Some banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, recently began setting earnings dates years in advance, though most still schedule the event a few months ahead of time. Marty Mosby, a former chief financial officer of First Horizon National Corp, said chief executives he worked for were eager to report results as early as possible, to appear financially strong, even if it meant competing for attention with other banks. But Mosby, who is now a bank stock analyst at Vining Sparks, would advocate for reporting results later so that analysts and investors could give First Horizon their full attention, rather than having to make quick decisions to buy or sell based on the headline number alone.  If you have five banks in a day you can't get all that done,  said Mosby.  It's just impossible. Three is about the most that we can really handle.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent in May from April and, when food and energy were excluded, was up 0.1 percent.                  The 12-month reading for the so-called core inflation has been slowing since February, although Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier this month said the dip was likely temporary.     “It’s not enough to make you optimistic about either delaying the Fed or about the potential for actual inflation,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     Fed officials have indicated another rate hike this year is likely, while the U.S. central bank is also likely to begin slowly reducing its bond holdings.     Other data on Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell also fell this month to its lowest since November.                  Benchmark 10-year notes             fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.29 percent, after reaching an more than six-week high of 2.30 percent overnight, up from 2.27 percent late on Thursday.     The yields have risen from 2.13 percent on Tuesday on concerns that European central banks would also be less accommodative at the same time as the Fed continues its tightening path.     The 10-year notes are on track for their biggest weekly yield increase since the week ending March 3.      European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday the ECB might tweak its stimulus so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers. Sources on Wednesday, however, said he had not intended to signal imminent tightening.                               Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity.                  Next Friday’s U.S. employment report for June will be the next major economic release to give guidance on the Fed’s next rate hike. The U.S. central bank is also due to release minutes from its June meeting on Wednesday.

The amount of reserves held in dollars rose to $5.71 trillion even as the greenback's share fell to roughly 64.5 percent of allocated reserves in the first three months of 2017, down from 65.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year, according to the data from the International Monetary Fund. The amount of reserves held in dollars stood at $5.50 trillion in the fourth quarter. Global reserves are assets of central banks held in different currencies primarily used to back their liabilities. Central banks have sometimes cooperated in buying and selling official international reserves in order to influence exchange rates. The euro was a distant second to the dollar, with a share of 19 percent of allocated reserves, little changed from the fourth quarter. At its peak in 2009, the euro's share of global reserves was 28 percent. The yen's share of currency reserves rose to 4.6 percent in the first quarter, from 3.9 percent previously. The Japanese currency had the largest quarterly rise in the share of allocated reserves. The Chinese yuan's share of allocated currency reserves was 0.9 percent in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter. The IMF had reported the yuan's share of central bank holdings for the first time for the fourth quarter of 2016. IMF data also showed that global foreign exchange reserves rose to $10.90 trillion in the first quarter, up from $10.72 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The first quarter's total reserves reversed a portion of the fourth-quarter decline and represented the first meaningful quarterly rise since 2014, said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The total amount of allocated currency holdings also grew, to $8.85 trillion, from $8.43 trillion previously. Allocated reserves now include part of China's official reserves, with full currency allocation disclosure set to take two to three years.  China's gradual disclosure continues,  Osborne said.  The share of allocated reserves as a percentage of total reserves now exceeds 80 percent.  Unallocated reserves, or those that have not been reported to the IMF, slid to $2.05 trillion in the first quarter from $2.29 trillion in the last three months of 2016. Unallocated reserves represented just 19 percent of the total global FX reserves. It was widely believed in the currency market that part of China's reserves was in the unallocated pool. The Australian and Canadian dollars, which over the last year have been included in the reserves composition, showed shares of roughly 2 percent each.

Communist-run Cuba said in December its economy shrank 0.9 percent in 2016, as it wrestled with declining oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, a slide in exports and a lack of cash. Western diplomats said there are no signs that any of those problems are abating. Cuba is struggling to pay foreign providers on time and seeking longer payment terms, they said. President Raul Castro is expected to deliver a full update on the economy in his speech to the national assembly in mid-July. Meanwhile, Cabrisas highlighted sectors such as agriculture, where production is rising, and tourism, which continues to grow, that are doing well this year. However, tourism could be impacted by tightened U.S. travel rules going forwards. Marino Murillo, the chief of the commission charged with carrying out reform to update the Soviet-style economy, was cited as saying farmers would now be able to lease parcels of land for 20 years instead of 10, with the option of renewing. Since deciding in 2008 to lease small parcels of fallow land to would-be farmers, Cuba has leased 1.9 million hectares, representing 31 percent of the country's arable land, he added. Demand for new parcels was limited because those available were less productive, far away from infrastructure and infested by the highly invasive marabu weed, he added. Murillo announced a new package of measures to  contribute to improving the organization and the control  of the fledgling private sector. State-media did not include any further details on the measures. He then listed various infractions that had been detected in the private sector, from use of goods with illicit provenance to failure to fulfill tax obligations. Workers in the private sector report having to bend Cuba's strict rules and operate in a grey legal area at times for their business to function in the tightly controlled economy with scarce supply of goods. Restaurants and bars periodically report being closed down by authorities that suspect them of committing infractions.

We were hoping for a different verdict,  Mike Miller, an attorney for Block, said shortly after the verdict was announced.  We still believe Brian Block is innocent. We will be appealing.  American Realty shares plunged as much as 37 percent on Oct. 29, 2014, wiping out roughly $4 billion of market value, after the company said employees intentionally concealed accounting errors. It also said Block and its chief accounting officer, Lisa McAlister, had resigned the previous day. Block was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy last year. Prosecutors said that in July 2014, he plugged fake numbers into a spreadsheet that was used to prepare the company's financial report for the second quarter of that year in order to disguise a calculation error in a previous report. In closing arguments on Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imparatore reviewed testimony from McAlister, who has pleaded guilty, and Ryan Steel, American Realty's former director of financial reporting. Both testified that they saw Block falsify numbers. A lawyer for Block, Reid Weingarten, later told jurors in his closing argument that Block changed numbers because the company had switched its accounting methods for legitimate business reasons. He said there was never any accounting error for Block to cover up, and that the government's witnesses were not credible.

The U.S. Supreme Court said as much in its 2006 decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos, which held that the First Amendment didn’t protect an assistant district attorney from workplace retaliation after he wrote a memo recommending the dismissal of a case involving a supposedly falsified police affidavit. The Supreme Court said that the assistant D.A. wrote his fateful memo as part of his official duties, and “when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.”  On Thursday, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered a case in which a public defender stepped outside of his job description to complain to government officials about his office’s supposed policy of encouraging quick plea deals. U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe of Philadelphia had ruled the First Amendment applied to that speech. The 3rd Circuit panel – Judges Thomas Vanaskie, Cheryl Ann Krause and Richard Nygaard – said it did not. Under the balancing test for speech by public employees that the Supreme Court established in 1968’s Pickering v. Board of Education, the 3rd Circuit held in De Ritis v. McGarrigle, the public defender’s free speech rights were outweighed by his office’s countervailing interest in fulfilling its job.  The appellate panel’s decision, I should point out, was based on the particular facts of the De Ritis case. According to the 3rd Circuit opinion, written by Judge Krause, Joseph De Ritis was an assistant public defender in a 27-lawyer office in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. After 12 years of service, he was transferred from a trial team to the juvenile court unit. Upset at the transfer, De Ritis asked around to find out why he’d been moved. One current and one former lawyer from his office told him the public defender, Douglas Roger, moved De Ritis because his clients were not pleading guilty fast enough to satisfy the county’s chief judge.  Without asking his boss, Roger, if it was true, De Ritis repeated the rumor to judges, colleagues and prosecutors during off-the-record kibitzing in court, complaining that he was “being punished” for “taking too many cases to trial.”  De Ritis didn’t stop there, however. According to the 3rd Circuit opinion, after several months, he asked to move back to the trial team, where there was an opening. Roger declined the transfer. De Ritis then went to see the county solicitor, alleging that he’d been demoted because he refused to compromise the constitutional rights of his clients. De Ritis made the same allegations in a meeting with the chairman of the county council.  Soon after, De Ritis’ boss, Roger, heard from a judge that De Ritis was telling people he’d been punished for taking too many cases to trial. Roger was “astonished,” according to the 3rd Circuit, and confronted the assistant. De Ritis admitted he’d made such statements in court and to county officials. Roger fired him.  De Ritis sued Rogers and a slew of other officials, alleging illegal retaliation. Judge Rufe winnowed the case to his claims against Roger, whom she said was not immune from his former assistant’s suit because the First Amendment covered some of the statements De Ritis alleged he was fired for making.  The 3rd Circuit began its analysis with the observation that De Ritis’ speech as a public employee is only protected by the First Amendment to the extent he was speaking as a private citizen, not as an employee, on a matter of public concern – and, if he met that standard, only if his boss had no adequate justification for treating him differently from a member of the general public.  Under that test, the court easily disposed of De Ritis’ claim to First Amendment protection for his comments to judges and lawyers while he was in court. That kind of idle courtroom chatter, even though it was not part of actual proceedings, was “part and parcel of his ordinary job duties - not citizen speech,” the 3rd Circuit said. When De Ritis griped to other lawyers outside of court, the 3rd Circuit held, he may have been speaking as a private citizen, but he was only talking about his own employment, not a matter of public concern.  First Amendment protection for De Ritis’ reports to county officials was the hardest part of the 3rd Circuit’s examination. Because De Ritis couched his complaints to the officials in terms of protecting clients, he was addressing a public concern. The 3rd Circuit held in a footnote that as a matter of law, De Ritis’ allegations about an office policy of rushing clients into plea deals were recklessly false because he was spreading unconfirmed hearsay without ever asking Roger if it was true. But even “rumormongering,” to adopt the appellate court’s phrase, can be protected if De Ritis was acting as a whistleblower.  He wasn’t, according to the 3rd Circuit: He acted because he was upset about his own job, not because of concerns about clients of the public defender’s office. “Even as De Ritis urged (the county officials) to investigate alleged misconduct,” the opinion said, “De Ritis remained focused on how his perceived demotion ‘was hurting his career.’” The 3rd Circuit considered it notable that De Ritis waited more than six months to raise concerns after he first heard rumors that he was transferred for taking too many cases to trial. That delay gave less weight to his assertion of acting in the public interest.  On the other side of the scale, the 3rd Circuit said, De Ritis’ boss, Roger, had powerful reasons to fire an assistant spreading what the court called “‘fourth-person hearsay’ gleaned from after-work ‘gossip.’” De Ritis was disrupting the work of the office, the court said.  Applying the Supreme Court’s balancing test, the 3rd Circuit found no constitutional protection for De Ritis’ complaints to county officials. “Whatever First Amendment value De Ritis’ statements had, those statements gave Roger adequate justification to treat him differently from a member of the public,” the court ruled. “For that reason, we conclude at this third stage of the analysis that De Ritis’ speech was not protected, putting a hard stop to his First Amendment claim against Roger and entitling Roger to qualified immunity for his decision to fire De Ritis.”  My Reuters colleague Robert Iafolla reached out to both sides on Thursday but did not hear back.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-freespeech-idUSKBN19L2MU"},

The 32-year-old Team Dimension Data rider has bounced back from having a  zero percent  chance of making the start line because of a bout of glandular fever to targeting at least one stage win over the next three weeks. He needs four to draw level with the 34 of Merckx.  I'm not in ideal condition but the good thing about being a sprinter is that you can win on luck,  Cavendish told reporters at a news conference on Friday.  You get the right wheel, you get the right run and there is a chance you can win. So it was worth coming with that chance.  This year I would be happy to win one stage, but it wouldn't be a failure if I don't.  Isle of Man-born Cavendish, known as the Manx Missile, enjoyed a superb 2016, winning four stages on the Tour de France and finally securing an Olympic medal when he finished runner-up behind Italy's Elia Viviani in the omnium track event. His prospects of increasing his Tour tally looked bleak, however, when he struggled to recover from illness.  A few weeks ago there was a zero percent chance of making it and I had to race to see if I could put myself forward,  Cavendish said.  But I started to feel better every day and I'm happy the team selected me.  While he may not be starting at full gas, Cavendish is confident he will grow stronger during the 21-stage race which begins with a time trial along the banks of the majestic River Rhine on Saturday.  I normally get stronger as it goes on, that's where my strength has been,  Cavendish said.  Other sprinters get fatigued on Grand Tours but I've always seemed to get better and that's something I've always taken advantage of.  While Merckx's record is tantalisingly close, Cavendish said it was only after last year that it became a realistic target.  One Tour de France stage win usually makes a career let alone winning a stage every year,  he said. Doug Ryder, manager of the African-based team that supports the Qhubeka charity that has provided thousands of bicycles for Africans, said Cavendish was riding for two goals.  If Mark goes beyond 34 it would be one of the greatest achievements in sport,  Ryder, told Reuters.  And, selfishly it would be amazing for us because we could help so many more people though Qhubeka.  Mark knows that and cares deeply about it.  Cavendish added:  If I'm only good enough to win one more then so be it. But if we put 5,000 more children in Africa on bikes that's the biggest victory.

Bond sales from corporate and sovereign issuers across developing nations have risen to just over $355 billion in the first six months of 2017 -- the strongest half-year performance in at least 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. All global regions saw an increase in both the volume and amount of deals, the data showed, with issuers in the Asia-Pacific region making up nearly 50 percent of all debt sales.  It's an alliance of convenience,  said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.  Emerging markets want to borrow and on the other side are people who want the yield.  Fund managers, faced with low interest rates across much of the developed world, have been plowing money into emerging markets for months, at levels similar to those seen during the so-called commodity super cycle. Yet the prospect of policymakers in the developed world hiking interest rates or withdrawing stimulus has also prompted issuance, said Patrick Esteruelas at Emso Asset Management.  It makes sense to lock in long-term funding at favorable rates,  said Esteruelas, adding the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump's reflationary policies had contributed to the mix.   If all those policies had actually materialized, emerging markets would have been on a different planet, so there was a lot of front loading before the new Trump term got going.  Issuance from emerging market governments, which account for around a third of debt sales, is expected to continue at a fast pace, said JPMorgan in its emerging market outlook sent to clients earlier in the month. A number of governments joined the latest issuance wave. Egypt sold $3 billion in May -- twice as much as expected -- following a five-year hiatus after the Arab Spring uprising. Argentina surprised markets with a 100-year issue in June, of which it sold $2.75 billion just over a year after emerging from its latest default. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used emerging debt indexes, expects total sovereign debt issuance from developing countries to amount to $143 billion in 2017, compared to just under $130 billion last year.  It estimated corporate debt issuance across emerging markets would amount to $380 billion in 2017, with just over $208 billion already issued by early June.  Equity markets painted a similar picture. The first six months of the year saw 405 companies listing on stock exchanges across emerging markets - the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in at least 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. In volume terms, this raised nearly $30 billion, almost double the amount raised in the first half of last year but short of the nearly $40 billion brought in the second half of 2016.  The Asia-Pacific region accounted for nearly $25 billion of IPO volume across 375 stock market debuts - the highest number of listings in at least 10 years. The total amount of funds raised on equity markets, including rights issues, stood at $87.5 billion since the start of the year, the data showed. Emerging equities have had a stellar start to the year, with the MSCI emerging benchmark .MSCIEF up nearly 18 percent since the start of the year. reut.rs/2ne9sjH Reporting by Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-emerging-debt-idUSKBN19L2MG"},

I grew up witnessing a lot of people working in horrible conditions and not getting paid, working for food or a place to sleep. And I grew up thinking these kinds of things were normal,  Moura told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   I remember girls, 11, 12-year-old girls, mostly black girls. They would spend their whole lives working in homes and some of them wouldn't even go to school. So they were basically slaves.  It was when Moura aged 17 went to Salvador, the capital of Bahia, that he realized what he had witnessed as a boy was wrong.  It was a shock to me because I really believed that it kind of was what it was .. it was then I realized people should get paid for their labor,  Moura said. Brazil acknowledged the use of slave labor in its economy - Latin America's largest economy - in 1995. But more than two decades on, many people in Brazil, and across the world, still do not know slavery exists.  I've been talking to people and they say they had no idea that this was happening. Slave labor - what are you talking about?,  said Moura, 41. Globally there are 21 million people in forced labor, including children, in a business worth $150 billion a year, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). In Brazil, forced labor is defined as a form of slavery. This includes degrading work conditions and long hours that pose a risk to a worker's health and or life and debt bondage. But activists fear a bill being debated by Brazilian lawmakers that seeks to limit the country's broad definition of slave labor, including what constitutes degrading work conditions, could put more workers at risk of slavery.  Changes to our definition of slave labor, I think it's very possible for it to happen,  Moura said. Worked to Death As a goodwill ambassador on forced labor for the ILO, Moura earlier this year spoke to sugar cane workers who had been rescued from slave labor, including one who saw his friend die next to him in a field from exhaustion.   He remembers the guy said to him. 'I can't see. I'm blind'. Then he goes to sit down and the guy just falls down dead,  Moura said.  He worked until he died. His body just couldn't it anymore.  Moura believes tackling slavery is about promoting empathy between employers and their workers.  When I talk to businessmen and politicians in my country, most of all I see a big lack of empathy with people. It's all about profit.  Brazil has been praised by the ILO and activists for making progress on tackling slavery in the past decade. They highlight the government's mobile units - made up of labor inspectors, prosecutors and police - who raid places where slave labor is suspected. Since the initiative was launched in 1995, more than 50,000 workers, many on farms and cattle ranches, have been rescued from slavery-type conditions. But there are fewer mobile units operating in Brazil today, and tackling slavery is less of a priority since conservative Michel Temer became president last year, activists say. Dirty List Moura said a key weapon in Brazil's fight against slavery  is the so-called  dirty list  of employers published by the labor ministry. Launched in 2003, the blacklist has made public hundreds of companies and individual employers who were investigated by labor inspectors and found to be using slaves. The dirty list was banned from being published following a nearly three-year legal dispute over its release but since March is has been published again.  If we can make the dirty list more accessible I think it's a powerful tool,  Moura said.

Mosby,Tyler Ventura,US,USA,BANKS,RESULTS,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Performance / Results / Earnings,Wealth Management,Banks (TRBC),Funds,Company News,Corporate Events,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,United Kingdom,Banking Services (Legacy),United States","sector":"Business","content":"(Reuters) - For the fourth straight quarter, several of the biggest U.S. banks are reporting earnings on the same day, setting up a situation that overwhelms analysts covering the industry. In a report on Friday, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg noted that 10 of the 19 largest banks by market value are reporting results on just two days next month, on July 14 and 21st.  Seems excessive,  he wrote. Big bank earnings days can be a hectic and frazzled experience for analysts, who must interpret thick documents packed with financial arcana, juggle multiple conference calls with management teams, investor relations departments and clients, and meet hard deadlines to distribute a final take on whether stocks remain a buy, hold or sell. They arrive at work before 7 a.m. to prepare for the news and often stay late into the evening working on their reports and financial models. On July 14, analysts expect to pore through more than 200 pages of press releases, slide decks and financial supplements released by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, PNC Financial Services Group and First Republic Bank before the market opens. JPMorgan is due to start a conference call with analysts at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT). That will be followed by PNC Financial Services Group's call beginning at 9:30 a.m, Wells Fargo at 10 a.m. and Citigroup at 11:30 a.m. Each call typically lasts an hour or more.  It can be maddening and frenetic, particularly when all these firms are reporting in the morning before the bell,  said Tyler Ventura, a research analyst with investment management firm Diamond Hill.  We're going back and forth and saying, 'What did he say on this call versus that call?'  Until recently, it was rare to see more than two of the six biggest lenders report results on the same day. According to a Reuters analysis, that only happened twice in the 22 quarters leading up to the middle of 2016. It is not clear what changed. Bank representatives said earnings are determined by a combination of meeting dates for boards of directors, holidays and travel schedules of CEOs, and that banks do not coordinate with each other on scheduling. Some banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, recently began setting earnings dates years in advance, though most still schedule the event a few months ahead of time. Marty Mosby, a former chief financial officer of First Horizon National Corp, said chief executives he worked for were eager to report results as early as possible, to appear financially strong, even if it meant competing for attention with other banks. But Mosby, who is now a bank stock analyst at Vining Sparks, would advocate for reporting results later so that analysts and investors could give First Horizon their full attention, rather than having to make quick decisions to buy or sell based on the headline number alone.  If you have five banks in a day you can't get all that done,  said Mosby.  It's just impossible. Three is about the most that we can really handle.

The second-term Republican said repeatedly this week that he would be ready to close down non-essential government services as the July 4 holiday weekend starts if the lawmakers cannot agree on a $7.055 billion two-year budget that would require no new taxes. The deal reached late on Thursday called for $7.1 billion in spending.  I'm out of ink,  LePage told reporters in the state capital of Augusta.  There will not be a signature on a budget that increases taxes.  The full legislature was due to vote on Friday, the day after a six-member bipartisan budget committee reached a deal that would repeal a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. The proposed budget also increases public education funding by $162 million. The leaders of Maine's Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and Republican-controlled Senate supported the measure, but it was unclear if they could garner the two-thirds support needed for passage. Even if they do, state law gives the governor 10 days to respond to any budget passed by the legislature. LePage said on Friday that he was ready to wait that long before vetoing any budget that raises taxes. Most of the government would shut during that time. Without a shutdown,  I lose all my leverage for negotiation for the next 10 days,  LePage said, adding that he did not think lawmakers could reach a budget deal on Friday that he would accept.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue would continue to operate during a shutdown, LePage has said. The state's Democratic House speaker urged lawmakers to back the budget deal.  In a divided government, compromise is the only option,  Speaker Sara Gideon said in a statement. A Maine advocacy group sued the state in federal court on Thursday, seeking an order that would ensure that public assistance payments continue uninterrupted to the 450,000 people, about one in three residents, who receive them. In 1991 Maine's government shut down for several weeks due to a budget impasse, and lawmakers reached a deal only after furloughed state workers picketed the capitol.

The economy grew by 0.2 percent in April, Statistics Canada said on Friday, matching expectations and indicating Canada continues to pick up speed after a slump triggered by the oil price crash in 2014.  The data suggested the economy carried momentum into the second quarter from the first, when growth hit an annualized 3.7 percent pace, the best in the G7, said David Madani, economist at Capital Economics.  Needless to say, this will reinforce market speculation that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates soon,  Madani said. Bank of Canada policymakers have taken a more hawkish tone this month, ramping up market expectations for a rate increase on July 12.  Friday's business survey, which showed companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, added to expectations of a July hike, with odds now greater than 50 percent. FILE PHOTO: People shop during the going-out-of-business sale at Target Canada in Toronto, February 5, 2015.Mark Blinch/File Photo The survey is consistent with broad-based improvement in the overall economy and may have prompted the central bank to shift away from its previous cautious tone, said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. With only trade and jobs data ahead of the bank's next meeting,  there is little to keep the bank from hiking rates,  Reitzes said. Chances of a rate hike in July increased to 57.7 percent following the survey, up from 51.4 percent just before it was released and significantly higher than the 20 percent markets were pricing after subdued inflation data last week.  The Canadian dollar was stronger against the greenback at C$1.2990, or 76.98 U.S. cents, after earlier touching a nine-month high following the gross domestic product data.  The central bank cut rates twice in 2015 to keep the economy on track. A Reuters poll in May before the central bank adopted a more hawkish tone had showed most economists did not expect a rate hike until 2018.  Statscan said 14 out of the economy's 20 sectors grew in April. Service-producing industries posted a 0.3 percent gain while the goods sector was largely unchanged as a decline in manufacturing offset growth in mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices in May fell for the first time in nine months, dropping by 0.2 percent from April.

He appears to have a fragile, impetuous, child-like ego that we've seen over and over again, especially with women,  Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's  Morning Joe,  said on the program.  He attacks women because he fears women,  added co-host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican U.S. congressman. Brzezinski and Scarborough fired back on their program and in an opinion piece in The Washington Post after Trump's Twitter messages on Thursday, which attacked them, particularly Brzezinski, in highly personal terms. Trump called Brzezinski  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and alleged that she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida around New Year's Eve. He called Scarborough  Psycho Joe.  Scarborough said Trump packed  five or six lies into two tweets,  including mischaracterizing their meetings at Mar-a-Lago. Brzezinski said she has never had a face-lift. Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, speaking on ABC's  Good Morning America,  defended Trump's  ability to fight back when he is attacked.  She declined to endorse the content of his tweets.  Well it's incredible to watch people play armchair psychologist, outright ridiculing the president's physicalities, his mental state, calling him names that you won't want your children to call people on a playground,  Conway told Fox News. Trump's tweets, his latest attacks on the U.S. news media, were roundly condemned by lawmakers in both parties and became a distraction as his fellow Republicans in the Senate try to iron out their differences over major healthcare legislation. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with immigration crime victims at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Yuri GripasBrzezinski and Scarborough, who were on friendly terms with Trump in the past but have been critical of him since he took office in January, described White House pressure over a planned negative story about them in the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper.  Trump was friends with David Pecker, chief executive of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media, Inc. The tabloid specializes in scandalous stories about celebrities and has been supportive of Trump.   This year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas,  they wrote in the Post. Scarborough said on the program he received calls from three top administration officials asking the co-hosts to call Trump and apologize for their coverage of his administration. They told him that if he called and apologized, Trump would get the story killed, Scarborough said. He did not identify the administration officials.  The calls kept coming, and kept coming. And they were like 'Call, you need to call. Please call. Come on, Joe. Just pick up the phone and call him,'  Scarborough said.  That's blackmail,  said MSNBC panelist Donny Deutsch. In a Twitter post on Friday, Trump gave a different account, saying Scarborough  called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no!  American Media said in a statement  we have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions.   I am very concerned as to what this once again reveals about the president of the United States,  Brzezinski, who is engaged to be married to Scarborough, said of Trump's Twitter attacks.  President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. America's leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president,  the co-hosts wrote in the Post column.

(Reuters) - United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co , for the first time beat Elon Musk's SpaceX in competition for an Air Force satellite launch, both launch companies said on Friday. The contact covers launch services for multiple satellites aboard an Atlas 5 rocket in June 2019. The contract value is just over $191 million, the Air Force said.  The award is the first for United Launch Alliance since the Air Force certified rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets for flight and opened bidding for launch contracts in 2015. ULA, which previously had a monopoly on the military’s launch business, sat out the Air Force’s first solicitation and lost the second. Both were awarded to SpaceX. A SpaceX official told Reuters it did not expect to win this bidding competition because the mission required a heavy-lift launcher and its Falcon Heavy booster has not yet flown. “The mission performance required that we bid Falcon Heavy,” SpaceX spokesman John Taylor wrote in a email. “We did submit a bid, but with the knowledge that our first Falcon Heavy flight might occur after the time of the award.  Given we have not flown Falcon Heavy, we did not anticipate winning this mission,” he said. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is expected to debut this year. The new booster would need to fly successfully at least once before the Air Force would award SpaceX a Falcon Heavy launch contract, three times before any high-priority military satellites would fly on it, Claire Leon, the launch enterprise director for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, told reporters during a conference call. Typically, the Air Force awards contracts two years ahead of a launch. Another branch of the Air Force that handles experimental programs bought a Falcon Heavy rocket ride in 2012. That mission is currently targeted to fly early next year, Leon said. SpaceX also won Falcon 9 contracts to fly a U.S. National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite, which launched in April, and is scheduled to launch the X-37B robotic space plane for the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office later this year.

Regulators and market participants argue the agencies were slow to adjust ratings of some companies that defaulted. Each of the big three global agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service - are majority owners of firms in India which operate independently of their parent companies with different rating standards. Under existing rules, ratings agencies operating in India are already required to  continuously monitor  the securities they rate and disseminate any changes  promptly.   But the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulator said they would henceforth have to track whether debt issuers were meeting payments for each rated instrument and be alert for any deterioration of financial conditions. Credit agencies would also need to review ratings after every  material event  and request monthly  no default statements  from issuers, SEBI added. SEBI has threatened to impose tougher rules since the agencies were perceived to have responded slowly to changing conditions in several companies that defaulted, including Amtek Auto (AMTK.NS).  Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern, said the rules would put the onus on agencies to more closely supervise the ratings they assigned.     These new guidelines makes it obligatory for rating agencies to provide closer monitoring,  he said, noting they would also encourage issuers to be  more transparent  with the agencies.

Bond sales from corporate and sovereign issuers across developing nations have risen to just over $355 billion in the first six months of 2017 -- the strongest half-year performance in at least 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. All global regions saw an increase in both the volume and amount of deals, the data showed, with issuers in the Asia-Pacific region making up nearly 50 percent of all debt sales.  It's an alliance of convenience,  said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.  Emerging markets want to borrow and on the other side are people who want the yield.  Fund managers, faced with low interest rates across much of the developed world, have been plowing money into emerging markets for months, at levels similar to those seen during the so-called commodity super cycle. Yet the prospect of policymakers in the developed world hiking interest rates or withdrawing stimulus has also prompted issuance, said Patrick Esteruelas at Emso Asset Management.  It makes sense to lock in long-term funding at favorable rates,  said Esteruelas, adding the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump's reflationary policies had contributed to the mix.   If all those policies had actually materialized, emerging markets would have been on a different planet, so there was a lot of front loading before the new Trump term got going.  Issuance from emerging market governments, which account for around a third of debt sales, is expected to continue at a fast pace, said JPMorgan in its emerging market outlook sent to clients earlier in the month. A number of governments joined the latest issuance wave. Egypt sold $3 billion in May -- twice as much as expected -- following a five-year hiatus after the Arab Spring uprising. Argentina surprised markets with a 100-year issue in June, of which it sold $2.75 billion just over a year after emerging from its latest default. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used emerging debt indexes, expects total sovereign debt issuance from developing countries to amount to $143 billion in 2017, compared to just under $130 billion last year.  It estimated corporate debt issuance across emerging markets would amount to $380 billion in 2017, with just over $208 billion already issued by early June.  Equity markets painted a similar picture. The first six months of the year saw 405 companies listing on stock exchanges across emerging markets - the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in at least 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. In volume terms, this raised nearly $30 billion, almost double the amount raised in the first half of last year but short of the nearly $40 billion brought in the second half of 2016.  The Asia-Pacific region accounted for nearly $25 billion of IPO volume across 375 stock market debuts - the highest number of listings in at least 10 years. The total amount of funds raised on equity markets, including rights issues, stood at $87.5 billion since the start of the year, the data showed. Emerging equities have had a stellar start to the year, with the MSCI emerging benchmark .MSCIEF up nearly 18 percent since the start of the year. reut.rs/2ne9sjH Reporting by Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/emerging-debt-idUSL8N1JR572"},

Polyus, controlled by the family of Russian tycoon Suleiman Kerimov, delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2015 after Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis began to bite for Russian companies. It returns to London buoyed by an 8 percent rise in global gold prices this year. British investors bought about half of the shares, VTB Capital, a bookrunner on the deal, said in a statement. The share of investors from North America totaled around 20 percent. The sale of 9 percent of the company's shares follows a separate $887 million sale of 10 percent to a Chinese consortium led by Fosun International. The offer price was set at $33.25 per global depositary receipt (GDS), corresponding to a price of $66.50 per ordinary share, at the lower end of a previously announced range. Half of the proceeds from the deal went to Polyus and will be used for general corporate purposes, Chief Executive Pavel Grachev told an event at the Moscow Exchange. The other half went to the Kerimov family. Appetite for Russian assets has been strengthening since the start of this year, driven by a rising oil price and expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would ease fraught U.S.-Russian relations.  We see sufficient interest toward the Russian risk and equity in general from foreign institutional investors,  Kvasov told the Moscow Exchange event.  I hope that this deal will not be the last one this year. We see a window for further potential placements this year.  Colin Croft, fund manager at Jupiter Fund Management, said the sale showed there was still good demand for Russian assets.  Despite all of the on-going geopolitical concerns – all the worries about Trump and sanctions and so on - they still managed to get it out the door,  he said.  It was a pretty sizeable deal so that shows that Russia is still open for business.”  Anton Malkov, head of equity capital markets at Sberbank CIB, said further Russian deals were possible in the market in the autumn if oil markets and geopolitics remained calm. Market optimism has been tempered in the past few weeks, with Trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates' ties to Russia, and the United States imposing a fresh round of sanctions on some Russian entities. However, Polyus is a pure producer of gold, considered a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty.     Russian, European and Middle Eastern investors each took about 10 percent of the offering, Boris Kvasov, the head of equity capital markets at VTB Capital, said. The $879 million includes an over-allotment option, the sale was worth $799 million excluding it. Long-term investors, including sovereign funds, took about 80 percent of the allocation. Russian pension funds took less than 1 percent, Kvasov said.  The quality of investors, not only the fact of the placement itself, was important to Polyus,  Grachev said. A consortium formed of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) with Middle-Eastern Sovereign Wealth Funds participated in the deal. It included investors from the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain.

At the same time, embattled President Jacob Zuma admitted that the economy may not hit the forecast 1.3 percent growth target set by his government, and urged political allies to discuss policies, including land redistribution, to revamp the economy. He called for  radical solutions  -- albeit within the constitution --  to redistribute land to the country's black majority. Both men were speaking at a conference of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), which will be looking for a new leader to replace Zuma in December. South Africa is in recession and has an unemployment rate of close to 28 percent. It is also immersed in political rows over Zuma's abilities and over how independent the central bank should be. Gigaba, who was appointed as finance minister in March after Zuma sacked internationally respected Pravin Gordhan, said South Africa may need to get outside financial help.  Should the main indicators continue to disappoint any further we may have to seek assistance from quarters we have thus far avoided,  Gigaba added, without elaborating. Asked by Reuters if he was referring to the International Monetary Fund, Gigaba smiled and said  Any . The rand extended its losses against the dollar as much as 0.7 percent lower, while bonds weakened after Gigaba's comments on the possibility of seeking outside assistance. Isaac Mashego, senior economist at Nedbank, said with slow economic growth, the government is going to have to borrow more.   This might mean going to multilateral institutions like the IMF. This is the worst case scenario,  he said. The fund's senior resident representative in South Africa Montfort Mlachila was not immediately available to comment. A senior ANC member said Gigaba might have been talking about the IMF but it could also be China or other sources. With their economies floundering and currencies sinking, African states from Nigeria to Zambia have been seeking IMF assistance to fund infrastructure and plug budget deficits. African nations broadly see China as a healthy counterbalance to Western donors, and Beijing has plowed billions of dollars into agriculture, roads, ports and railways projects. Credit downgrades by two of the top three ratings agencies, based on the economic and political turmoil, have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa, which has just suffered two quarters of contraction. Touching on the political row over the central bank, Gigaba accused the country's anti-corruption agency of overstepping the mark in suggesting changes to the way the central bank works. A call by South Africa's public protector for an overhaul of Reserve Bank's mandate -- to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency -- rattled investors this month, hitting the rand. The Reserve Bank has filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. [nL8N1JH0JX] [nL8N1JO3M7]  The public protector does not have the power to direct parliament to amend the constitution,  Gigaba told business leaders at the start of a six-day policy conference.  These recommendations should have been directed at the finance ministry. We should all insist on the independence of the South African Reserve Bank.  Land Ownership The row also exposed worsening divisions between state institutions just as Zuma is embroiled in a net of scandals.  Zuma has drawn unprecedented criticism from senior ruling party members in recent weeks. A shock cabinet reshuffle prompted in March ratings agencies to downgrade South Africa to  junk  status and unemployment is at a 14-year high. The parliament said Zuma would face a no-confidence vote brought by the opposition on August 3. [nJ8N1JJ001] Zuma's critics see the public protector's comments as an attempt to undermine the bank’s authority as part of a broader attack on state institutions, including the finance ministry, the tax authorities and the public protector’s office. The president rejects such criticism. Zuma will be replaced as ANC leader at a national conference in December. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the incumbent's ex-wife,  widely viewed as frontrunners. The conference should offer clues to who may be in the ascendant. [nL8N1JQ265] Gareth Newham, a governance specialist at Pretoria-based think tank Institute for Security Studies said although the conference will focus on policy, the leadership battle to succeed Zuma would be at the heart of the discussions.  The way policy is spoken about and framed is going to be a proxy for leadership battle,  he said.

The economy grew by 0.2 percent in April, Statistics Canada said on Friday, matching expectations and indicating Canada continues to pick up speed after a slump triggered by the oil price crash in 2014.  The data suggested the economy carried momentum into the second quarter from the first, when growth hit an annualized 3.7 percent pace, the best in the G7, said David Madani, economist at Capital Economics.  Needless to say, this will reinforce market speculation that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates soon,  Madani said. Bank of Canada policymakers have taken a more hawkish tone this month, ramping up market expectations for a rate increase on July 12.  Friday's business survey, which showed companies are more optimistic about future sales and exports, added to expectations of a July hike, with odds now greater than 50 percent. FILE PHOTO: People shop during the going-out-of-business sale at Target Canada in Toronto, February 5, 2015.Mark Blinch/File Photo The survey is consistent with broad-based improvement in the overall economy and may have prompted the central bank to shift away from its previous cautious tone, said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. With only trade and jobs data ahead of the bank's next meeting,  there is little to keep the bank from hiking rates,  Reitzes said. Chances of a rate hike in July increased to 57.7 percent following the survey, up from 51.4 percent just before it was released and significantly higher than the 20 percent markets were pricing after subdued inflation data last week.  The Canadian dollar was stronger against the greenback at C$1.2990, or 76.98 U.S. cents, after earlier touching a nine-month high following the gross domestic product data.  The central bank cut rates twice in 2015 to keep the economy on track. A Reuters poll in May before the central bank adopted a more hawkish tone had showed most economists did not expect a rate hike until 2018.  Statscan said 14 out of the economy's 20 sectors grew in April. Service-producing industries posted a 0.3 percent gain while the goods sector was largely unchanged as a decline in manufacturing offset growth in mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices in May fell for the first time in nine months, dropping by 0.2 percent from April.

(Reuters) - United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co , for the first time beat Elon Musk's SpaceX in competition for an Air Force satellite launch, both launch companies said on Friday. The contact covers launch services for multiple satellites aboard an Atlas 5 rocket in June 2019. The contract value is just over $191 million, the Air Force said.  The award is the first for United Launch Alliance since the Air Force certified rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets for flight and opened bidding for launch contracts in 2015. ULA, which previously had a monopoly on the military’s launch business, sat out the Air Force’s first solicitation and lost the second. Both were awarded to SpaceX. A SpaceX official told Reuters it did not expect to win this bidding competition because the mission required a heavy-lift launcher and its Falcon Heavy booster has not yet flown. “The mission performance required that we bid Falcon Heavy,” SpaceX spokesman John Taylor wrote in a email. “We did submit a bid, but with the knowledge that our first Falcon Heavy flight might occur after the time of the award.  Given we have not flown Falcon Heavy, we did not anticipate winning this mission,” he said. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is expected to debut this year. The new booster would need to fly successfully at least once before the Air Force would award SpaceX a Falcon Heavy launch contract, three times before any high-priority military satellites would fly on it, Claire Leon, the launch enterprise director for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, told reporters during a conference call. Typically, the Air Force awards contracts two years ahead of a launch. Another branch of the Air Force that handles experimental programs bought a Falcon Heavy rocket ride in 2012. That mission is currently targeted to fly early next year, Leon said. SpaceX also won Falcon 9 contracts to fly a U.S. National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite, which launched in April, and is scheduled to launch the X-37B robotic space plane for the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office later this year. SpaceX is preparing for its 39th launch -- and third in nine days -- on Sunday. Reporting By Irene Klotz.

Regulators and market participants argue the agencies were slow to adjust ratings of some companies that defaulted. Each of the big three global agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service - are majority owners of firms in India which operate independently of their parent companies with different rating standards. Under existing rules, ratings agencies operating in India are already required to  continuously monitor  the securities they rate and disseminate any changes  promptly.   But the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulator said they would henceforth have to track whether debt issuers were meeting payments for each rated instrument and be alert for any deterioration of financial conditions. Credit agencies would also need to review ratings after every  material event  and request monthly  no default statements  from issuers, SEBI added. SEBI has threatened to impose tougher rules since the agencies were perceived to have responded slowly to changing conditions in several companies that defaulted, including Amtek Auto (AMTK.NS).  Shriram Subramanian, founder of shareholder advisory firm InGovern, said the rules would put the onus on agencies to more closely supervise the ratings they assigned.     These new guidelines makes it obligatory for rating agencies to provide closer monitoring,  he said, noting they would also encourage issuers to be  more transparent  with the agencies.

At the same time, embattled President Jacob Zuma admitted that the economy may not hit the forecast 1.3 percent growth target set by his government, and urged political allies to discuss policies, including land redistribution, to revamp the economy. He called for  radical solutions  -- albeit within the constitution --  to redistribute land to the country's black majority. Both men were speaking at a conference of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), which will be looking for a new leader to replace Zuma in December. South Africa is in recession and has an unemployment rate of close to 28 percent. It is also immersed in political rows over Zuma's abilities and over how independent the central bank should be. Gigaba, who was appointed as finance minister in March after Zuma sacked internationally respected Pravin Gordhan, said South Africa may need to get outside financial help.  Should the main indicators continue to disappoint any further we may have to seek assistance from quarters we have thus far avoided,  Gigaba added, without elaborating. Asked by Reuters if he was referring to the International Monetary Fund, Gigaba smiled and said  Any . The rand extended its losses against the dollar as much as 0.7 percent lower, while bonds weakened after Gigaba's comments on the possibility of seeking outside assistance. Isaac Mashego, senior economist at Nedbank, said with slow economic growth, the government is going to have to borrow more.   This might mean going to multilateral institutions like the IMF. This is the worst case scenario,  he said. The fund's senior resident representative in South Africa Montfort Mlachila was not immediately available to comment. A senior ANC member said Gigaba might have been talking about the IMF but it could also be China or other sources. With their economies floundering and currencies sinking, African states from Nigeria to Zambia have been seeking IMF assistance to fund infrastructure and plug budget deficits. African nations broadly see China as a healthy counterbalance to Western donors, and Beijing has plowed billions of dollars into agriculture, roads, ports and railways projects. Credit downgrades by two of the top three ratings agencies, based on the economic and political turmoil, have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa, which has just suffered two quarters of contraction. Touching on the political row over the central bank, Gigaba accused the country's anti-corruption agency of overstepping the mark in suggesting changes to the way the central bank works. A call by South Africa's public protector for an overhaul of Reserve Bank's mandate -- to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency -- rattled investors this month, hitting the rand. The Reserve Bank has filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. [nL8N1JH0JX] [nL8N1JO3M7]  The public protector does not have the power to direct parliament to amend the constitution,  Gigaba told business leaders at the start of a six-day policy conference.  These recommendations should have been directed at the finance ministry. We should all insist on the independence of the South African Reserve Bank.  Land Ownership The row also exposed worsening divisions between state institutions just as Zuma is embroiled in a net of scandals.  Zuma has drawn unprecedented criticism from senior ruling party members in recent weeks. A shock cabinet reshuffle prompted in March ratings agencies to downgrade South Africa to  junk  status and unemployment is at a 14-year high. The parliament said Zuma would face a no-confidence vote brought by the opposition on August 3. [nJ8N1JJ001] Zuma's critics see the public protector's comments as an attempt to undermine the bank’s authority as part of a broader attack on state institutions, including the finance ministry, the tax authorities and the public protector’s office. The president rejects such criticism. Zuma will be replaced as ANC leader at a national conference in December. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the incumbent's ex-wife,  widely viewed as frontrunners. The conference should offer clues to who may be in the ascendant. [nL8N1JQ265] Gareth Newham, a governance specialist at Pretoria-based think tank Institute for Security Studies said although the conference will focus on policy, the leadership battle to succeed Zuma would be at the heart of the discussions.  The way policy is spoken about and framed is going to be a proxy for leadership battle,  he said.

The government is sending federal agents to Chicago and plans to prosecute firearms cases aggressively, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News when asked about Trump's statement about the plan in an early-morning Twitter post.  Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year!  Trump wrote on Twitter. The president, who in January decried the high crime rate in the third-most populous U.S. city as  carnage,  did not specify what type of help he planned to send. In 2016, the number of murders in Chicago exceeded 760, a jump of nearly 60 percent, and was more than New York and Los Angeles combined. There were more than 4,300 shooting victims in the city last year, according to police. The number of murders, shootings and shooting victims have all decreased slightly this year in the city of 2.7 million. There have been 320 murders, down from 322 over the same period last year. There have been 1,703 shooting victims, down from 1,935, according to police figures. Sessions said the anti-crime policies in Chicago have not worked and police  have been demoralized in many ways.   We're sending in additional gun investigators. We've directed our U.S. attorneys to prosecute these gun cases aggressively,  he told Fox News. Sessions' comments came as Chicago police announced the formation of the Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force, a collaboration between the Chicago Police Department and the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The group, including police officers, federal agents and intelligence analysts, will work to impede the flow of illegal guns throughout Chicago and target repeat gun offenders. The group will  significantly help our police officers stem the flow of illegal guns and create a culture of accountability  for the gangs that drive violence in the city, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement. On Monday, the Chicago police announced that the ATF's mobile ballistics lab had arrived in the city to help process shooting scenes.  Six months ago we made it clear that we would welcome additional federal support, and six months later we appreciate the 20 new ATF agents that are now arriving,  Adam Collins, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said.  But the progress CPD (Chicago Police Department) has made this year has happened without any of the new resources from the federal government we requested.  Chicago is also in the midst of reforming its police department after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated the civil rights of people, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct. Joseph Ferguson, the city’s inspector general, called on Chicago officials to agree to a consent decree to oversee changes to the department at a committee meeting on Tuesday – splitting with the mayor, who has said a court-enforced settlement is not necessary for reform. In response to questions about Ferguson’s comments, Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday that the Justice Department has  walked away  from doing consent decrees, and so the city has sought a different strategy.  There are multiple roads that allow you to make sure you make the changes and reform,  he said.

But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U.S. auto supplier Visteon Corp (VC.N) found: a mess. As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems, the electronics holding it all together have become a rat's nest of components made by different parts makers. Now the race is on to clean up the clutter.  Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler, cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so-called virtual cockpit - an all-digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self-driving cars. What's at stake is a piece of the $37-billion cockpit electronics market, estimated by research firm IHS Markit to nearly double to $62 billion by 2022. Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car's value in the next two years, up from 13 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more, according to Mark Boyadjis, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit.  The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do,  Boyadjis said. He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model, down from six to 10 today.

This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle's instrument cluster, infotainment system and other features, all on the same tiny piece of silicon.

Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018, according to Visteon.  Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics, having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016. The bet so far is paying off. The company secured $1.5 billion in new business in the first quarter, helped by growth in China. Visteon's stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year.  It's a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Co (F.N) a decade ago. Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later.

The trend is already triggering acquisitions, as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers. Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls' (JCI.N) electronics business, which was also developing a domain controller. In March, Samsung (005930.KS) completed its $8-billion purchase of infotainment company Harman. France's Faurecia (EPED.PA), a top seating and interiors supplier, last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris-based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019. Deal-making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. Activity in the sector was worth $41 billion in 2016, according to PwC.  Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard. Audi (NSUG.DE) was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system. Cheaper, Lighter, Smarter Slideshow (12 Images)Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers, who can save as much as $175 per car with an integrated cockpit, according to Munich-based management consulting firm Roland Berger.  They can also help with fuel efficiency. That's because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind-the-scenes computers, known as electronic control units (ECUs). Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs, numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years. But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales. Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today's dashboard offerings clunky and non-intuitive. A J.D.

Polyus, controlled by the family of Russian tycoon Suleiman Kerimov, delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2015 after Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis began to bite for Russian companies. It returns to London buoyed by an 8 percent rise in global gold prices this year. British investors bought about half of the shares, VTB Capital, a bookrunner on the deal, said in a statement. The share of investors from North America totaled around 20 percent. The sale of 9 percent of the company's shares follows a separate $887 million sale of 10 percent to a Chinese consortium led by Fosun International. The offer price was set at $33.25 per global depositary receipt (GDS), corresponding to a price of $66.50 per ordinary share, at the lower end of a previously announced range. Half of the proceeds from the deal went to Polyus and will be used for general corporate purposes, Chief Executive Pavel Grachev told an event at the Moscow Exchange. The other half went to the Kerimov family. Appetite for Russian assets has been strengthening since the start of this year, driven by a rising oil price and expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump would ease fraught U.S.-Russian relations.  We see sufficient interest toward the Russian risk and equity in general from foreign institutional investors,  Kvasov told the Moscow Exchange event.  I hope that this deal will not be the last one this year. We see a window for further potential placements this year.  Colin Croft, fund manager at Jupiter Fund Management, said the sale showed there was still good demand for Russian assets.  Despite all of the on-going geopolitical concerns – all the worries about Trump and sanctions and so on - they still managed to get it out the door,  he said.  It was a pretty sizeable deal so that shows that Russia is still open for business.”  Anton Malkov, head of equity capital markets at Sberbank CIB, said further Russian deals were possible in the market in the autumn if oil markets and geopolitics remained calm. Market optimism has been tempered in the past few weeks, with Trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates' ties to Russia, and the United States imposing a fresh round of sanctions on some Russian entities. However, Polyus is a pure producer of gold, considered a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty.     Russian, European and Middle Eastern investors each took about 10 percent of the offering, Boris Kvasov, the head of equity capital markets at VTB Capital, said. The $879 million includes an over-allotment option, the sale was worth $799 million excluding it. Long-term investors, including sovereign funds, took about 80 percent of the allocation. Russian pension funds took less than 1 percent, Kvasov said.  The quality of investors, not only the fact of the placement itself, was important to Polyus,  Grachev said. A consortium formed of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) with Middle-Eastern Sovereign Wealth Funds participated in the deal. It included investors from the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain.

The Republican-dominated court said the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, which made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, did not resolve issues such as payments of municipal employees' spousal benefits.  The Supreme Court held in Obergefell that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages,  the Texas court wrote,  but it did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons.  The Texas Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court, adding that it could not reach a decision on whether to grant the plaintiff's request to claw back previously paid benefits. Texas Values, an activist group for social conservatives, and Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who supported the challenge on the benefits, applauded the decision.  While the U.S. Supreme Court declared a right to same-sex marriage, that ruling did not resolve all legal issues related to marriage,  Paxton said in a statement. In 2013, two Houston taxpayers, backed by Texas Republican leaders, sued the city after then-Mayor Annise Parker gave municipal spousal benefits to same-sex couples married in places where the unions were recognized. At the time, Texas had a constitutional amendment that barred same-sex marriage. That law was later struck down. The plaintiffs, Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks, a pastor and an accountant, argued that the top U.S. court's same-sex marriage decision was poorly reasoned and same-sex couples were not entitled to spousal employment benefits. Rights groups for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people contended the plaintiffs were trying to erode the U.S. Supreme Court's decision. “This absurd contortion of the Obergefell ruling defies all logic and reason,  said Kenneth Upton, senior counsel in LGBT rights legal group Lambda Legal’s Dallas office. LGBT rights groups have said they intended to appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if Texas courts decide against them. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a state court ruling allowing Arkansas to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates, clarifying the scope of protections provided by its gay marriage decision.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-gaymarriage-idUSL1N1JR132"},

The company had priced its initial public offering (IPO) at 25.50 euros a share, the top end of the price range, selling shares worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and giving it a market capitalization of 4.4 billion euros.  The stock rose to 27.80 euros after it started trading on Friday.  It's a positive sign for Europe's tech sector, which has seen very few IPOs this year,  an equity capital markets banker said, adding that one of the sector's next listings is likely to be meal kit group HelloFresh and music streaming service Spotify after the summer break. In Europe, Norwegian technology group Evry EVRY.OL joined the Oslo bourse this month and X-FAB Silicon Foundries floated on Euronext, but the sector's European offerings have raised less money than counterparts in the United States, where messaging app Snap (SNAP.N) listed recently. The 10 high-tech IPOs in Europe this year have fetched proceeds of about $2.4 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. The same number of flotations in the Americas has raised $5.2 billion, lifted by Snap's $3.9 billion IPO. A successful listing for Delivery Hero was important for German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which cut its stake to 25.7 percent from 35.7 percent in the deal, having failed to bring a company to market since 2014. Delivery Hero is using the 483 million euros in proceeds to pay off its debt, grow its own business and for acquisitions to help to fend off the increasing competition.  The company is still loss-making, mainly because of costs related to its rapid growth, but it is aiming to break even next year.  We are profitable in an increasing number of markets,  Chief Executive Niklas Oestberg said, adding that the company now wants to use equity primarily for expansion. Delivery Hero's listing contrasts with Thursday's lackluster debut for Blue Apron (APRN.N), which had reduced its price in the shadow of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) deal to buy retailer Whole Foods, leaving investors worried about the prospects of the meal-kit industry. Sources close to the deal said that the Delivery Hero order book was 16 times oversubscribed, leaving many investors with smaller allocations than expected and 40 percent of investors without any shares at all.

Movistar's Quintana came in for some criticism during the Giro d'Italia for not attacking hard enough and with a Tour route that does not necessarily suit his strengths he will have his work cut out to unseat Britain's Chris Froome. But the 27-year-old was upbeat about his chances when he held a news conference in Duesseldorf on Friday ahead of this weekend's Grand Depart in the German city.  We will play with our strategy,  Quintana, who has been on the podium in Paris three times, told reporters.  It wouldn't be the first time we have done it. But we need to be daring.  Quintana, third last year, having finished second in 2013 and 2015, began the year targeting a Giro-Tour de France double but was beaten at the death by Tom Dumoulin in Italy when he was overhauled on the final-day time trial. After that setback former Tour great Greg LeMond said Quintana needed to be more explosive when he attacked in the mountains to have any chance of taking time out the likes of Team Sky's reigning champion Froome and BMC's Richie Porte. Quintana's time trialing also came under scrutiny, although this year's Tour route has only two short individual TTs. The down side for Quintana is there are only three of the summit finishes that he revels in.  Maybe it's a bit less favorable than other years,  he said.  For me the more climbs the better,  he said.  But the sensations are positive, I'm looking forward to coming to this race because it's the main objective for me and for our team.  Quintana said he had no worries about his energy levels after the Giro -- saying the build-up was always focused on peaking at the Tour de France.  Last year at the Vuelta (which he won) I was better than at the Tour de France,  he said.  This is a course that, because of my characteristics, is good for me.  Team manager Eusebio Unzue said he was confident his leader would deliver -- explaining why only Quintana addressed the media and not the likes of Spanish team mate Alejandro Valverde.  The team has only one leader, Nairo,  he said, before underling Valverde's importance to the cause.  Having Valverde around gives Nairo tranquillity. If everything develops normally he will have a great companion.  The big favorite again is Froome but 'Bird' (Quintana's nickname) is in good shape,  he said.  It's not a typical Tour, it's weird, we'll have to improvise. I see it like a Tour without any script.

As council leader, I have to accept my share of responsibility for these perceived failings,  Nicholas Paget-Brown, the leader of Kensington & Chelsea council, said in a statement. He acknowledged criticism of his decision on Thursday to suspend a council meeting on the June 14 disaster at Grenfell Tower when media attempted to follow proceedings, something he said was necessary to avoid compromising a public inquiry. A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May earlier on Friday criticized the decision to try to hold the council meeting in private.  It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or are unaccounted for,  Paget-Brown, a member of May's Conservative Party, said. Britain named a former judge on Thursday to lead the  inquiry into the inferno. Residents of the block want to know why the fire spread so rapidly and whether proper fire safety measures had been in place. They also want explanations about why their concerns had been ignored. May has also been widely criticized for her initial response to the blaze.

He appears to have a fragile, impetuous, child-like ego that we've seen over and over again, especially with women,  Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's  Morning Joe,  said on the program.  He attacks women because he fears women,  added co-host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican U.S. congressman. Brzezinski and Scarborough fired back on their program and in an opinion piece in The Washington Post after Trump's Twitter messages on Thursday, which attacked them, particularly Brzezinski, in highly personal terms. Trump called Brzezinski  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and alleged that she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida around New Year's Eve. He called Scarborough  Psycho Joe.  Scarborough said Trump packed  five or six lies into two tweets,  including mischaracterizing their meetings at Mar-a-Lago. Brzezinski said she has never had a face-lift. Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, speaking on ABC's  Good Morning America,  defended Trump's  ability to fight back when he is attacked.  She declined to endorse the content of his tweets.  Well it's incredible to watch people play armchair psychologist, outright ridiculing the president's physicalities, his mental state, calling him names that you won't want your children to call people on a playground,  Conway told Fox News. Trump's tweets, his latest attacks on the U.S. news media, were roundly condemned by lawmakers in both parties and became a distraction as his fellow Republicans in the Senate try to iron out their differences over major healthcare legislation. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with immigration crime victims at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Yuri GripasBrzezinski and Scarborough, who were on friendly terms with Trump in the past but have been critical of him since he took office in January, described White House pressure over a planned negative story about them in the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper.  Trump was friends with David Pecker, chief executive of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media, Inc. The tabloid specializes in scandalous stories about celebrities and has been supportive of Trump.   This year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas,  they wrote in the Post. Scarborough said on the program he received calls from three top administration officials asking the co-hosts to call Trump and apologize for their coverage of his administration. They told him that if he called and apologized, Trump would get the story killed, Scarborough said. He did not identify the administration officials.  The calls kept coming, and kept coming. And they were like 'Call, you need to call. Please call. Come on, Joe. Just pick up the phone and call him,'  Scarborough said.  That's blackmail,  said MSNBC panelist Donny Deutsch. In a Twitter post on Friday, Trump gave a different account, saying Scarborough  called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no!  American Media said in a statement  we have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions.   I am very concerned as to what this once again reveals about the president of the United States,  Brzezinski, who is engaged to be married to Scarborough, said of Trump's Twitter attacks.  President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. America's leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president,  the co-hosts wrote in the Post column.

The company had priced its initial public offering (IPO) at 25.50 euros a share, the top end of the price range, selling shares worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and giving it a market capitalization of 4.4 billion euros.  The stock rose to 27.80 euros after it started trading on Friday.  It's a positive sign for Europe's tech sector, which has seen very few IPOs this year,  an equity capital markets banker said, adding that one of the sector's next listings is likely to be meal kit group HelloFresh and music streaming service Spotify after the summer break. In Europe, Norwegian technology group Evry EVRY.OL joined the Oslo bourse this month and X-FAB Silicon Foundries floated on Euronext, but the sector's European offerings have raised less money than counterparts in the United States, where messaging app Snap (SNAP.N) listed recently. The 10 high-tech IPOs in Europe this year have fetched proceeds of about $2.4 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. The same number of flotations in the Americas has raised $5.2 billion, lifted by Snap's $3.9 billion IPO. A successful listing for Delivery Hero was important for German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which cut its stake to 25.7 percent from 35.7 percent in the deal, having failed to bring a company to market since 2014. Delivery Hero is using the 483 million euros in proceeds to pay off its debt, grow its own business and for acquisitions to help to fend off the increasing competition.  The company is still loss-making, mainly because of costs related to its rapid growth, but it is aiming to break even next year.  We are profitable in an increasing number of markets,  Chief Executive Niklas Oestberg said, adding that the company now wants to use equity primarily for expansion. Delivery Hero's listing contrasts with Thursday's lackluster debut for Blue Apron (APRN.N), which had reduced its price in the shadow of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) deal to buy retailer Whole Foods, leaving investors worried about the prospects of the meal-kit industry. Sources close to the deal said that the Delivery Hero order book was 16 times oversubscribed, leaving many investors with smaller allocations than expected and 40 percent of investors without any shares at all.

Analysts, however, noted the weekly decline in the rig count was likely just a brief pause in a drilling recovery expected to continue through at least 2019. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to June 30, bringing the total rig count down to 756, still more than double the 341 rigs in the same week a year ago, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report on Friday. That decline followed a record 23 consecutive weeks of rig additions, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1987. Drillers have added rigs in 52 of the past 57 weeks since the start of June 2016. The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the past few months with the decline in oil prices. In the second quarter, drillers added 94 rigs, which is less than the 137 added during the first quarter. For the first half of the year, or since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries began to curb output, U.S. drillers added 231 rigs, up from 195 in the second half of 2016. During the first half of 2016, drillers removed 206 rigs. Crude oil prices, however, were on track for their worst first-half performance since 1998. [O/R] Lingering worries about oversupply have knocked around 15 percent off U.S. crude futures so far this year, despite a deal involving OPEC members and some other major producers to curb production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). U.S. crude futures on Friday were trading almost $46 per barrel, putting the front-month on track for its first gain in six weeks. Analysts said those OPEC-led cuts were being frustrated by rising output from U.S. shale drillers and other producers hoping to capture higher oil prices in future months. U.S. shale oil producers said they plan to keep drilling new wells despite this month's crude price drop but expect to revisit spending should pricing remain below $45 a barrel for several months. Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Tim Dove said newer operating efficiencies allow his company - one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield - to continue to drill more.  But if prices were to remain depressed for a longer term,  we can pare away and still be a growth company even in a $45 environment,  he said. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading around $46 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching almost $48 a barrel. However, U.S. shale companies are drilling themselves into a deep hole as they are barely breaking even or losing money, costs are starting to rise and share prices are sliding, according to Reuters market analyst John Kemp. Some analysts still maintained their forecasts for the rise in rig counts. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 883 in 2017, 1,101 in 2018 and 1,212 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 819 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

An acquisition offers a chance for bidders to grab control of Asia's biggest warehouse operator, which counts Amazon (AMZN.O) among its clients and is benefiting from rising demand for modern logistics facilities, driven by a boom in e-commerce business. Friday marked the deadline for parties to submit binding offers for GLP. Reuters was not able to confirm if more than two bids were submitted. At current valuations, a successful transaction will rank as the largest Asian buyout by private equity groups, which are  increasingly targeting bigger takeovers after raising record funds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Singapore-listed GLP was thrust into the spotlight late last year after sovereign wealth fund GIC, which owns a 37 percent stake, nudged it to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to the highest in more than three years. After months of negotiations with a special committee of GLP's independent directors, the race has narrowed to between a group led by Chinese private equity firms Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group, with the support of GLP CEO Ming Mei, and a rival consortium headed by Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood, the sources said. GLP, GIC, Warburg Pincus, Hopu, Hillhouse and a spokeswoman for the consortium declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the deal. Hopu's founder Fang Fenglei, one of China's best known dealmakers, is a GLP board member, and Hopu, partly owns GLP's China business. The Chinese consortium has also brought in co-investors such as property developer China Vanke (000002.SZ) and Ping An Insurance Group of China (2318.HK) for a bid for GLP, sources have said.     The management group and Warburg Pincus are the most serious bidders. Some other parties are keen on picking up specific assets and not the entire company,  said one source.    Concerns over the transparency of the sale process and business ties of the management-backed consortium have forced some potential bidders to re-evaluate their interest and sparked complaints to GIC, sources said.    Last week, GLP said it was in discussions with shortlisted bidders and had taken measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest following a Financial Times report that almost all the potential bidders were dropping out due to concerns an insider bid will make other submissions pointless.    Some of the potential bidders such as Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Asian buyout firm RRJ Capital were unlikely to submit individual bids, sources said. Blackstone declined to comment. RRJ did not respond to an emailed request for comment.    GLP owns and operates a $41 billion portfolio of industrial assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States. It gets two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has a dominant market position.    Around 20 lenders are working with three consortia in the hope of securing a role on the deal, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported last week.

The Republican-dominated court said the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, which made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, did not resolve issues such as payments of municipal employees' spousal benefits.  The Supreme Court held in Obergefell that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages,  the Texas court wrote,  but it did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons.  The Texas Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court, adding that it could not reach a decision on whether to grant the plaintiff's request to claw back previously paid benefits. Texas Values, an activist group for social conservatives, and Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who supported the challenge on the benefits, applauded the decision.  While the U.S. Supreme Court declared a right to same-sex marriage, that ruling did not resolve all legal issues related to marriage,  Paxton said in a statement. In 2013, two Houston taxpayers, backed by Texas Republican leaders, sued the city after then-Mayor Annise Parker gave municipal spousal benefits to same-sex couples married in places where the unions were recognized.  At the time, Texas had a constitutional amendment that barred same-sex marriage. That law was later struck down.  The plaintiffs, Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks, a pastor and an accountant, argued that the top U.S. court's same-sex marriage decision was poorly reasoned and same-sex couples were not entitled to spousal employment benefits. Rights groups for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people contended the plaintiffs were trying to erode the U.S. Supreme Court's decision.  “This absurd contortion of the Obergefell ruling defies all logic and reason,  said Kenneth Upton, senior counsel in LGBT rights legal group Lambda Legal’s Dallas office.  LGBT rights groups have said they intended to appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if Texas courts decide against them. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a state court ruling allowing Arkansas to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates, clarifying the scope of protections provided by its gay marriage decision.

In the past, it hasn’t been clear whether physical activity staves off low back pain, or people without back pain are more likely to be active, the researchers write in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. To help determine which comes first, the review team analyzed data from 36 studies that followed nearly 160,000 people over time who didn’t have back pain at the start. “Systematic reviews of clinical trials suggest that exercise reduces low back pain intensity and its recurrence. In addition, the current review suggests that exercise or other leisure time activity also protects against developing chronic low back pain,  lead author Dr. Rhaman Shiri, a researcher with Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki, told Reuters Health by email. To standardize definitions from the various studies, Shiri and a colleague counted any non-work-related physical effort, including walking and climbing stairs, as physical activity in addition to sports or other forms of intentional exercise. People were considered active if they engaged in such physical activity at least once or twice a week for at least 30 to 60 minutes, or if they were in the middle or high end of total physical activity within their study group.  The researchers found that for moderately or highly active people, the risk of developing chronic low back pain was 14 percent and 16 percent, respectively, lower compared with people in the least-active category. Chronic low back pain was defined as pain that lasts for three months or more, or pain for more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.  For acute or occasional low back pain, however, physical activity levels didn’t seem to make a difference in risk. The same was true of hospitalizations or disability leave related to low back pain. Limitations of the review, the authors note, include the fact that some studies did not account for factors that might influence the results, such as work-related physical exertion, depression or smoking, all of which are associated with both lack of physical activity and risk of low back pain.  There were also too few elderly or very young adults to determine whether the apparent protective effect of physical activity is true for all age groups. Older people are more likely to be inactive as a result of back pain, for example, the authors point out. People are becoming more and more aware of the need for activity, Dr. Joel Press told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “We were meant to move. We were not meant to be stagnant in any way, so I think this study does confirm that. It's a big study where they looked at a lot of people,” said Press, who is physiatrist-in-chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.  Usually, Press tells people who already have back pain to cut down on the sitting and increase movement with low-impact activities such as walking. “Generally lower impact, walking type things are probably the starting point. Swimming is another low impact activity that puts less load on your back, but you're still getting a lot of cardiovascular fitness and movement with it,” said Press, who was not involved in the current study. It may be best to avoid starting out with sports that have a lot of twisting and turning, such as golf, baseball and tennis unless you take precautions to try not to get into a position where you're going to make it worse, he noted.  “I think the biggest thing is, if you're doing an activity and every time you're doing it the pain intensifies while you're doing the activity, or even afterward, you're worse off than you were before,” Press said. “If somebody does an exercise and they're a little sore right afterward, but by later that day they feel fine, and the next day they're no worse, they feel fine, that's a green light - go ahead, you're doing okay.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sKHxxh British Journal of Sports Medicine, online June 14, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-lowbackpain-physical-activity-idUSKBN19L2IE"},

Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Tim Dove said newer operating efficiencies allow his company - one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield - to continue to drill more.  But if prices were to remain depressed for a longer term,  we can pare away and still be a growth company even in a $45 environment,  he said. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading around $46 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching almost $48 a barrel. However, U.S. shale companies are drilling themselves into a deep hole as they are barely breaking even or losing money, costs are starting to rise and share prices are sliding, according to Reuters market analyst John Kemp. Some analysts still maintained their forecasts for the rise in rig counts. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 883 in 2017, 1,101 in 2018 and 1,212 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 819 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

Hawke,Gary Pusey,Raj Rajaratnam,Rudy Giuliani,Steven A Hartung,Steven McClatchey,Todd Ehret,BC,FINREG,DATA,ANALYTICS","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Insider trading cases often capture headlines and widespread attention as true-life crime stories. Often they include complex schemes, large dollar amounts, celebrities, or well-known Wall Street players. However, many recent cases have involved small trades by ordinary individuals that resulted in relatively small profits.  The question many ask is, why does the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) bother with these small dollar cases? And, how did they uncover these needles in the enormous haystack of trades that occur every day? These small cases serve as a reminder that even the smallest violations are detected and aren't overlooked. Furthermore, the announcements of these small-fry cases may serve as a deterrent, although quantifying such an effect is difficult. Under the direction of the prior SEC Chair Mary Jo White, there was an enforcement initiative known as the  broken windows  theory where the SEC was determined to not overlook small violations. The initiative was described in a speech by Chair White(here) where she explained that the agency was making better use of resources, including new data tools, and pursuing all types of violations, big and small. She compared it the efforts by law enforcement in New York in the 1990s. In New York, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton declared that no infraction was too small to be pursued. The theory is  that when a window is broken and someone fixes it – it is a sign that disorder will not be tolerated,  White said. Critics have claimed the  broken-windows  approach draws heavily on SEC enforcement and examination resources. In particular, the SEC enforcement division's approach is best described as one of  zero tolerance.  Furthermore, the speed and efficiency that comes with the use of enhanced data analytics is helping the SEC to quickly detect and successfully enforce insider trading cases no matter how small. These successful prosecutions of small or one-off cases of insider trading where individuals trading in personal accounts net relatively small profits, confirm this  zero tolerance  policy and that  broken windows  cases in the enforcement Division are not overlooked. Although it is the objective to unearth the larger cases like the hedge fund, Galleon and its founder, Raj Rajaratnam as well as the associated cases that ensnared more than a dozen traders and portfolio managers, small infractions are definitely not being ignored. Below is a review the SEC's enhanced capabilities and methods for gathering evidence of insider trading.  Traditional  Security-Based  Approach  The most commonly used method of investigating suspected insider trading historically is known as the  security-based  approach. This method has been used by the agency for nearly 50 years and has been very successful. In a  security-based  investigation, the SEC begins its investigation based on suspicious activity in an individual security where the SEC typically notices a news report or receives a referral from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) related to suspicious trading activity in advance of a merger or acquisition announcement, corporate event, or other significant news causing a sudden or significant movement in the price of the security. The agency then expands its investigation to identify who traded the security in advance of the event and then seeks to find out the motives for the trading activity. To determine who traded the security, the SEC searches literally billions of rows of data in what is commonly referred to as  blue sheets  which are provided to the agency from brokerages and clearing firms. This approach is inherently reactive and also has its drawbacks because an investigation doesn't begin until after a security has already moved and suspicious activity has been detected. More importantly, once the agency reaches out to contact the traders involved to inquire about motive, the investigation is unveiled which allows the traders or others possibly involved to coordinate their stories or rationale for the trades. It is also a very narrowly targeted approach to a single security or single occurrences of insider trading or trading on material non-public information. The Use of Data and Analytics and the Market Abuse Unit  In 2010 the SEC restructured its enforcement Division by creating specialized units. The Market Abuse Unit (MAU) created a platform for the staff to study how traders use information to make trading decisions and detect how information could flow from trader to trader. This technological breakthrough allowed the MAU to uncover and detect patterns of suspicious activity where they could see, for example, that groups of traders often trade the same stocks at the same time therefore there could be sharing of information. These efforts led the MAU staff to refine the way insider trading or suspicious activity is identified and to change the tactics and strategies involved in how it is investigated.  According to Daniel M. Hawke, a former top enforcement official at the SEC and now a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, LLP in Washington, D,C,, the SEC gave  the MAU wide latitude to develop new technological capabilities, invent quantitative and statistical metrics to evaluate different types of trading activity, and incorporate automated data analysis into how it originates investigations and identifies suspicious traders and potential sources of material nonpublic information.  Hawke wrote last year in an article for the Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer website(here),  Empowered with this mandate, the MAU established an Analysis and Detection Center (A&D; Center), a virtual, decentralized group within the MAU comprised of ten industry specialists hired specifically because they possessed unique analytical, statistical, programming or investigative skills. These specialists include (1) a former FBI agent skilled in conducting insider trading investigations; (2) two quantitative analysts trained in applying statistical metrics to trading data; (3) a trading strategies expert; (4) an index arbitrage and ETF specialist; (5) a market structure expert skilled in analyzing latent compliance and regulatory risks in market centers; (6) a broker dealer analyst; (7) a high-frequency trading expert; and (8) an experienced accountant investigator who utilizes market intelligence and trading data to connect the dots between traders and their potential sources of information.  The New  Trader-Based  Approach  In contrast to the  security-based  approach, the  trader-based  approach examines or mines  blue sheet  data to detect and analyze individual and institutional traders to determine which securities they trade. They then attempt to see which traders trade common securities and other patterns. The patterns of trading and relationships to other traders are sometimes potentially suspicious. After detecting suspicion the SEC will then figure out the correlative relationships among and between traders and seek to identify which potential sources of material nonpublic information they may have in common.  This  trader-based  approach is proactive and broad-based because the staff is looking at trading across multiple securities that may be common to the traders. The SEC's focus on an individual's pattern of trading can detect important information about who that person knows or where they obtained the information used to make trading decisions. By focusing on the patterns of an individual or a firm's trading activity and utilizing this quantitative approach to identify suspicious activity, the SEC is able to identify correlative relationships among traders and, most importantly, can deduce potential common sources of material nonpublic information.  Perhaps most important and valuable to the SEC's  trader-based  approach is that these investigations are done covertly, and in many instances the cases are solidified before ever unveiling the investigation to the traders to inquire about motive before the SEC commences its enforcement action. Cases Where Data Analytics Played a Role  In a March 2017 case, involving a Pennsylvania man who allegedly traded based on information he learned from a relative who worked at the acquiring company, the SEC specifically noted the work of the MAU's A&D; Center. According to the SEC's complaint(here) Steven A Hartung allegedly purchased 3,345 shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals while in possession of material non-public information that Merck & Co. would acquire the company through a tender offer. After the deal was announced Hartung sold the shares for a total profit of $59,688. Hartung agreed to a settlement requiring him to disgorge the ill-gotten plus interest of $3,210 and a civil penalty of $59,688. In January 2017, a former director at Barclays Plc was sentenced to five months in a U.S. prison for repeatedly passing tips about mergers under way at the bank to a plumber, who profited trading ahead of the deals' announcements(here). Steven McClatchey, was also ordered by the court to pay a $10,000 fine and jointly with the plumber forfeit $76,000 after pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges. McClatchey admitted in court that he had provided the insider tips to the plumber, Gary Pusey. The SEC said the probe began after the MAU analyzed data  detected an illicit pattern of trading  by Gary Pusey(here), a plumber from Long Island, who traded ahead of a series of mergers involving Barclays as an adviser. In December 2015 federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation joined the probe and Pusey began cooperating with them, providing  detailed information  about his source, according to court papers. That source was McClatchey, who according to his lawyers was an avid recreational sailor who had befriended Pusey at a marina in Freeport, New York, where they both docked their boats, spending most Saturdays together. Prosecutors said from February 2014 to September 2015, McClatchey tipped Pusey about more than 10 deals enabling him to make about $76,000. Finra Is Also Using Data Analytics in Its Surveillance  FINRA’s Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence (OFDMI) also conducts surveillance for potential fraud and misconduct in U.S. markets. Like the SEC's MAU, FINRA's data-driven surveillance includes sophisticated analysis of trading activity across U.S. equity and options markets surrounding material news announcements for evidence of potential insider trading. OFDMI combines data analytics and old-school detective work to identify people who make well-timed, suspicious trades. If suspicious trading is detected FINRA will flag that unusual activity and FINRA investigators will then leverage that data extensively as they put together an  Identification List  of people who placed the well-timed or suspicious trades to then hand over to the SEC's Enforcement unit.  On Offense   According to Hawke, the idea behind the MAU was  to go on offense…to be proactive by identifying patterns, connections and relationships among traders and institutions at the outset of investigations  and to develop and deploy  automated trading data analysis that would give the SEC strategic advantages in the way it conducts complex trading investigations, particularly those involving large institutions.  Clearly, these approaches are working to enhance the SEC's ability to detect illicit activity and conduct investigations with increased efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the approaches combined with the agency's zero tolerance policy towards insider trading is yielding results. This big net cast via using enhanced data analysis is not just catching big fish but lots of small fish as well. The SEC's ability to connect patterns of trading and sources of information should be a warning and deterrent to all investors but particularly professional traders and portfolio managers as well. For compliance professionals tasked with oversight and monitoring of such activity, it serves as a reminder that non-public information controls, reviewing employee personal trading, and conducting trading surveillance reviews is of the utmost importance.  Compliance officers must understand these new approaches and methodologies by the regulators will detect illicit activity. And, most importantly, compliance departments must adopt their own procedures to proactively detect and prevent the activity as well, given the reputational risk associated with even being investigated for insider trading.

The inland city of around 400,000 in Argentina’s Pampas region also aims to cut violent crime, boost social inclusion and kick-start projects including a new airport, as it tries to create jobs and become better connected, said Santa Fe’s chief resilience officer, Andrea Valsagna.  Like many Latin American cities, as Santa Fe has expanded, new residents have settled in low-lying areas, she noted.  “The challenge is to organize the growth of the city in a way that reduces the risk of floods,” said Valsagna by telephone from Santa Fe in northeast Argentina.  The new resilience strategy will help position the city to “deal with the problems climate change is generating in the region”, she said, adding that heavy rains and flooding are likely to increase.  Santa Fe lies near the junction of two major waterways - the Paraná and Salado rivers - and suffered serious floods in 2003 and 2007, which forced mass evacuations.  The city now has early warning systems in place, and relies on costly infrastructure made up of 40 miles (64 km) of defenses and pumps that help minimize flood risk from the rivers. The new strategy - released under the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, a global network of cities working to tackle modern-day shocks and stresses - said Santa Fe had taken steps to reduce its vulnerability, but work was needed to bolster flood defenses, drainage systems and other critical infrastructure. Santa Fe is one of Argentina’s oldest cities, with over 70 percent of its territory made up of rivers, lakes and marshes. An effort to relocate nearly 4,000 people living in 1,500 homes situated in flood-prone areas and curb informal settlement must consider how to integrate communities, and provide education and job opportunities, said Valsagna. “The problem of families in low-lying or informal settlements is multi-dimensional, and you can’t just think about the housing problem,” she said of the city which suffers from a shortage of accommodation. “It’s very difficult to generate alternatives for many of these families - they have a history in these places... they have their links with work, schools, health,” she said. Crime and Waste  Major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed new airport for the regional capital and relocation of its river port, would broaden opportunities for economic growth and jobs, besides improving transport links, said Valsagna. Santa Fe is expected to funnel 10 percent of its municipal budget into ways of making the city more resilient. City authorities are also talking to regional development banks, the private sector and the national government about funding the port and the airport, she said. Reducing crime is another big challenge for Santa Fe, where homicides reached 22 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014. Young men from poor, under-served neighborhoods are most at risk, while police corruption and a weak justice system compound the issue.  Valsagna said a new observatory would analyze crime in the city, which is seeking ways to bring more jobs and services to inhabitants of its poorest areas. Other goals are to improve drainage and waste services in the city where over 600 families, including children, make a living out of informal rubbish collection and are exposed to health risks and poor sanitation, said the report.  Santa Fe wants to halve their number within the next five years by offering alternative sources of income.  Santa Fe Mayor José Manuel Corral noted in the report that cities around the world are facing complex challenges. “We believe that a resilience approach will allow us to tackle this complexity, putting the focus on the capacity of communities to face crises, prepare themselves for acute impacts but also to deal with and overcome chronic stresses,” he wrote.

Contador used to be one of a very few riders who went out for victory and nothing else when they pinned a race number on their back. This time he has switched to a different approach, one adopted by three-time champion Chris Froome: use all other races just to prepare for the Tour. The Spaniard said his all-for-the-Tour strategy should mean he starts the race fresher than ever.  Cycling is very difficult and I would prefer to win each race but I understand than this is a better approach. I feel better than last year,  the 34-year-old Contador told a news conference on Friday. His Trek-Segafredo sports director Luca Guercilena explained that Contador was too old to chase other stage races as well as the Tour.  I'm not stressed about it (him struggling at the Dauphine earlier this month). He's ready to be up there and we are ready as a team,  the Italian said.

Gazprom, the leading global gas producer, enjoys monopoly rights on gas pipeline exports from Russia. It has lost its exclusive rights to ship seaborne LNG overseas to Rosneft and Novatek, Russia's largest non-state gas producer. Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been vying for pipeline gas exports as it strives to grow globally. It has a memorandum with BP, which owns a 19.75 stake in the Russian company, to trade up to 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually in Europe. Rosneft Vice President Vlada Rusakova, a former Gazprom executive, said the company wants to conduct  an experiment  in supplying gas to new markets in coordination with Gazprom.  We are not counting on a total lifting of export restrictions. This would be harmful for Gazprom, especially against the background of a difficult financial and economic situation at the company,  she said in emailed comments. She said as part of the experiment, Rosneft could supply gas to markets where Gazprom is not present and where U.S. LNG could be imported. Rusakova did not identify any such European countries.   Of course, this should be done in close coordination with Gazprom, in order to avoid competition between Russian gas suppliers.  Gazprom is targeting $32 billion to $34 billion in revenue from exporting more than 180 bcm to Europe and Turkey this year. Rosneft produced almost 70 bcm of gas last year, earning 208 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) from gas sales at home.

It is also eyeing Asian markets and plans to build an LNG plant in Russia's far east.   The company wants to export gas to China, where Gazprom plans to start shipping gas in 2019-2021 via the Power of Siberia pipeline, currently under construction. It also wants access to China's domestic gas market and end-users via swap deals.   There are significant gas resources in Russia's east, while no infrastructure has been built. And that's why we are interested in gaining access to the future Power of Siberia pipeline,  Rusakova said. Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, however, said it had no plans to allow other companies to ship gas via the pipeline.  Gazprom is not involved in such talks. The conditions, which are stipulated in the contract signed as part of the intergovernmental agreement with China, are such that all the gas volumes in Power of Siberia belong to Gazprom,  he said at a news conference on Friday. But Miller also said Gazprom may allow a Russian company to enter the Baltic LNG project, due to be launched in 2023. Rosneft plans to produce 100 bcm of gas per year by 2020 and become the world's third-largest producer of natural gas sometime later, thanks to a number of international projects. Last year, Rosneft agreed to buy a stake of up to 35 percent in Egypt's Zohr offshore gas field from Italy's Eni. The Russian company also plans to expand in gas projects elsewhere, including Mozambique and Venezuela.  Rusakova said Rosneft and Venezuelan state company PDVSA may consider building an LNG plant in Venezuela.

Commander Sipan Hemo did not give a timeline or details of plans to take the area, which was seized by the Turkey-backed rebels last autumn from Islamic State, but said he regarded Turkey as an occupying force there. His comments, in a statement to a Kurdish newspaper, were distributed on a social networking feed by Naser Haj Mansour, a senior official in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the YPG is a leading component. Increasing tensions between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish groups led to an exchange of fire between Turkish artillery and YPG targets near Azaz on Tuesday.  Ankara had sent new military reinforcements, including troops, vehicles and equipment into the zone between Azaz and Jarablus held by rebels it supports, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and rebel and Kurdish sources said on Wednesday. The Observatory said the reinforcements were part of preparations by Turkey to attack the YPG-held areas near Azaz.  Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency inside Turkey for three decades.  It has strongly criticized the United States for arming the YPG as part of efforts to support the SDF in its battle to recapture Raqqa from Islamic State.  Kurdish officials have warned that any Turkish attack on areas held by the SDF or YPG in northern Syria would distract from their offensive to defeat Islamic State in Raqqa.

In Iraq, dozens of civilians poured out of Mosul, long held by IS, and fled in the direction of the Iraqi forces, many of them women and children, thirsty, tired and some wounded. Iraqi authorities say they are only days away from a victory over militants in their remaining redoubt in Mosul, though commanders of counter-terrorism units fighting their way through the narrow streets of the Old City say die-hard IS fighters are dug in among civilians and the battle ahead remains challenging. Across the border in Syria, parts of which the IS says fall under its self-proclaimed caliphate, the picture was more complex. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the group had retaken most of the industrial district of Raqqa after mounting a fierce counter-attack against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias. But west of Raqqa, the Syrian army put the group under more pressure, driving it from its last territory in Aleppo province, a Syrian military source said, in a strategically-important move that relieves pressure on a government supply route.  Even though the IS group is under pressure in these urban strongholds in Iraq and Syria its fighters still occupy an area as big as Belgium across the two countries, according to one estimate. Thousands Displaced, Killed Related CoverageKurdish YPG plans to take Azaz-Jarablus area in Syria: statementIn Iraq, grinding warfare in Mosul has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands of civilians, according to aid organizations. Major General Maan al-Saadi, of the Counter Terrorism Service, told Reuters it could take four to five days to capture the insurgents' redoubt in Mosul by the Tigris River which was defended by about 200 militants.  Tens of thousands of civilians are trapped in the city in desperate conditions, with dwindling supplies of food, water or  medicine and no access to health services, according to those who have managed to flee. The capture of the city would in effect mark the end of the Iraqi half of the caliphate, although the group still controls territory west and south of the city, holding sway over hundreds of thousands of people. Those who escaped on Friday streamed through alleyways near the Grand al-Nuri Mosque, where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the caliphate in 2014 and which Islamic State fighters blew up a week ago rather than see it fall to the Iraqi army. An armoured fighting vehicle of the Counter Terrorism Service is seen at the Grand al-Nuri Mosque at the Old City in Mosul, Iraq, June 30, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of the caliphate on Thursday after CTS units captured the ground of the ruined 850-year-old mosque. A Reuters correspondent on Friday saw smoke billowing over the riverside districts amid artillery blasts and burst of gunfire. Western troops from the U.S.-led coalition were helping adjust artillery fire with air surveillance, he said.   Battle for Raqqa The SDF, the U.S. backed alliance in Syria, took the industrial district of Raqqa this month in its biggest gain so far in its fight for IS's Syrian capital and if, as the Observatory has reported, IS has regained control there it would be a setback. Slideshow (13 Images)The SDF, on its social media feed, acknowledged there had been intense clashes, but added that the whole industrial district was still in its hands and the attack had been thwarted.  Equally, IS appeared to have suffered a setback in Syria with the army taking the last stretch of the Ithriya-Rasafa road, part of the highway from Hama to Raqqa, forcing IS fighters to withdraw from a salient it held to the north, a Syrian military source and the Observatory said.  Islamic State had used that salient, an area containing a range of hills and a dozen villages, to mount frequent attacks on a different road linking Ithriya to Khanaser, part of the government's only available land route to Aleppo.  The capture of the Ithriya-Rasafa road also shortens the Syrian army's route to its battlefront with Islamic State south of Tabqa, a possible route for its multi-pronged offensive to relieve the government's enclave in Deir al-Zor.  On Thursday, the Observatory said the SDF had managed to take the last stretch of the Euphrates' south bank opposite Raqqa, completely encircling Islamic State inside the city. Since all Raqqa's bridges were already destroyed, and the U.S.-led coalition was striking boats crossing the river, the city had already been effectively isolated since May.  The secretive Baghdadi, who has scarcely been seen publicly since proclaiming the caliphate, has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding on the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. He has often been reported killed or wounded. Russia said on June 17 its forces might have killed him in an air strike in Syria. But Washington says it has no information to corroborate such reports and Iraqi officials have also been skeptical.

Most returned to Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus, it said, on the view that security had improved in parts of the country.  This is a significant trend and a significant number,  UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a Geneva news briefing.  Most of these people are returning to check on properties, to find out about family members ... They have their own perceptions about the security situation, real or perceived improvements in areas they are returning to.   He said it was premature to say whether de-escalation zones set up via talks held by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Astana or U.N.-led peace talks in Geneva had accelerated the return trend. An estimated 6.3 million people remain internally displaced across Syria after more than six years of war, Mahecic said.  A further 5 million are refugees in neighboring countries. A survey conducted by the UNHCR in recent weeks showed that more than 80 percent of Syrian refugees expressed their wish to return home, he said.  Of those, only about 6 percent were considering that to be a possibility in the near future,  he said UNHCR believes that conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity  are not yet in place in Syria , he added.

He is coming off a victory against Colorado in his last start, in which he gave up one run and three hits in six innings. He's 8-0 with a 1.86 ERA in 13 games (11 starts) this season while striking out 79 and walking 17 in 67 2/3 innings. Wood is 2-1 with a 2.19 ERA in nine career games (five starts) against San Diego. LHP Clayton Kershaw gave up one unearned run and three hits in seven innings in the Dodgers' 6-2 victory over the Angels on Thursday. Kershaw, who earned his major league-leading 12th win of the season, struck out 12 and walked two. The only run the Angels scored against him came after Dodgers LF Trayce Thompson's error led to an RBI fielder's choice by Angels DH Albert Pujols in the fourth inning.  I feel good, I think tonight was another step in the right direction,  Kershaw said.  I threw everything pretty decently tonight, a few fastball mistakes but overall, I'll take tonight for sure.

We have to heat him back up,  Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said.  We have to get him back in games. Like A.J. (Pollock), he hasn't played in awhile.  IF Ildemaro Vargas was 0-for-1 in his major league debut after being recalled from Triple-A Reno on Thursday, when the Diamondbacks sought to return their roster balance to 13 position players and 12 pitchers by returning RHP Braden Shipley to Reno. Vargas was hitting .303 with 24 doubles, two triples, six home runs and 43 RBIs at Reno. He spent 10 years and played 738 games in the minors. Vargas was signed out of the independent Atlantic League by Arizona in 2015 after being released by St. Louis. Vargas said he gained inspiration from fellow Venezuelan OF David Peralta, released by the Cardinals before signing with the Diamondbacks out of an independent league.  To be honest, I'm nervous a little bit,  Vargas said through an interpreter.  But that's OK. I want to play.' Vargas, 25, arrived at the park after buying a pair black spikes Thursday morning. Reno was on the road, and all Vargas had was blue spikes. CF A.J. Pollock (groin) is unlikely to join the team during this homestand that ends Sunday, general manager Mike Hazen said.  We'd prefer to stay away from that,  Hazen said. Pollock, who has been out since May 15, was given a scheduled off day Thursday on his rehab assignment at Triple-A Reno and is expected to return to the lineup Friday. He has nine at-bats since being sidelined with a minor quad issue last week, and the Diamondbacks have said they would like him to get between 10-15 at-bats before he is recalled, health permitting. RHP Braden Shipley was returned to Triple-A Reno after making relief appearances in the last two games since being recalled Tuesday. With RHP Randall Delgado available in the bullpen for the first time since throwing 75 pitches in his Sunday spot start, the bullpen is back to seven available arms and Shipley will return to the starting rotation in Reno.  We were thin in the bullpen and asked him to switch roles, and he made that as adjustment seamlessly and gave us innings that were much needed,  manager Torey Lovullo said. The Diamondbacks, who added IF Ildemar Vargas in the corresponding move, carried 13 pitchers while Delgado served as a starter. Shipley, 25, is 0-1 with a 6.35 ERA in four appearances during three stats this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6UDDXP55"},

He finished with one run allowed on four hits over two innings in relief.  He got in a little trouble, but he kept throwing strikes, and that was the big thing,  Counsell said. Lopez went 3-6 with a 5.04 ERA in 16 appearances including 13 starts for Biloxi. 1B Eric Thames' struggles, according to manager Craig Counsell, are related more to what pitches he's swinging at than scouting reports catching up to him or pitchers beginning to make adjustments to him.  We'll have the answer when he gets hot again,  Counsell said.  That's usually how it works.  Thames was given a day off Thursday to reset. He's 2-for-20 with no homers or RBIs during the current road trip. After hitting eight home runs in seven games against the Reds in April, Thames is 0-for-8 with five strikeouts in the first two games of the series at Great American Ball Park. He hasn't homered since June 17. RHP Chase Anderson will meet with the team's medical staff Friday to determine the full extent of his left quad strain. Anderson left Wednesday night's game in Cincinnati after pitching one inning. He appeared to grab his left side after striking out to end the second. Anderson was 11-3 with a 2.87 ERA in his 27 starts dating to last July. Brewers manager Craig Counsell expects Anderson to miss up to two months but will know more Friday. He was placed on the 10-day DL. RHP Jimmy Nelson held the Reds hitless until Joey Votto's solo homer with one out in the fourth inning Thursday.

If you are the best matchup we believe at this particular time in this particular game, it could be you. So stay on point. Right now we're in fight mode. In fight mode, you have to stay prepared.

Nike shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to a three-month high, after the world's largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com to sell a limited product assortment on its website. The Nasdaq biotech index was down 0.71 percent, dragged lower by Regeneron and Celgene. The S&P; technology index was up 0.28 percent but was still on track to post its biggest weekly loss in six months as worries about the sector's valuation prompted investors to buy defensive stocks.  Tech has gone too far too fast and was due for a correction,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.  The sector's valuation is elevated but hasn't reached a point of extreme concern because it is still a 'buy-the-dip' sector and is expected to grow further.  A fall in bank shares kept the financial sector flat with Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs dragging down the S&P; and the Dow. All three indexes are on track to post weekly losses.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 7.41 points, or 0.12 percent, at 6,151.76. The consumer discretionary index rose 0.72 percent and led the gainers among the major sectors. With the Federal Reserve keen on further raising the interest rates this year despite inflation remaining below their 2 percent target, investors have been keeping an eye on economic data for clues on the state of the economy. Earlier in the day, data showed U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May while inflation cooled. Even so, another set of data showed the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at its lowest since November.  In the next four to six weeks we'll get another set of economic data that will tell us if the Fed is justified in raising rates again this year,  said Sandven. Towards the end of the second quarter, the market witnessed a few volatile days with the S&P; 500 and the Dow recording their worst daily percentage drop in about six weeks on Thursday. Oil prices climbed for the seventh straight session on Friday in their longest bull run since April, but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter filed a lawsuit in Cleveland County District Court against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan Plc and units of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Hunter accused the drug manufacturers of working with third parties to promote, market and sell opioids in the state while engaging in a  fraudulent, decades long marketing campaign to market from the suffering of thousands of Oklahomans.  Purdue had no immediate comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Balkan country ran a budget surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in the first five months of the year, putting it in line with government projections that the country is likely to end the year with a smaller deficit than the targeted 1.4 percent. Bulgaria ended 2016 with a surplus of 1.6 percent after initially targeting a deficit of 2.0 percent, mainly due to delays in administering EU-backed projects, which reduced capital spending, while economic growth exceeded forecasts.

Over the past three years, the 20-year-old has achieved many life-time goals, such as winning the junior title at Wimbledon in 2014 and catching the sporting world by surprise when she hoisted the French Open trophy earlier this month while ranked 47th in the world. There is one burning ambition she has yet to fulfill, though -- facing the most successful professional-era tennis champion across the net. Williams, the holder of 23 grand slam singles titles, will be unable to defend her All England Club title over the next fortnight as she awaits the birth of her first baby.  While other rivals might be looking to capitalize on the 35-year-old champion's absence, Ostapenko thinks otherwise.  It's also nice when she was playing as she's a great champion and she is always inspiring a lot of players,  the fast-talking Latvian told Reuters in an interview in the run-up to the grasscourt major.  She was always my idol when I was growing up as I would always watch her matches and really love the way she plays. She’s the greatest player and maybe our styles of play is quite similar. I hope I can still play her one day.  Ostapenko was just two when Williams began her grand slam winning spree at the 1999 U.S. Open, and over the last two decades the American is the only woman to have achieved a feat the Latvian is now targeting - the French Open-Wimbledon double in the same year. To do that, she has been fine-tuning her game that usually relies on three things - power, speed and even more speed.  On grass you have to serve a little bit better than on clay, that’s more important. And the return. So I have worked on my serve and return these past two weeks,  said the Riga-born player who is determined to improve on her 2016 first round exit at Wimbledon. Much was made of her tactics at the French Open, where she belted the yellow ball out of shape - each and every time she made contact. That ploy not only left a string of opponents gasping, it also earned her almost as many unforced errors (271) as cleanly hit winners (299) over the course of seven matches in Paris. With most of the damage done by her firecracker forehand, where her average speed clocked faster than men's world number one Andy Murray, it is little wonder that when asked if she admired another player's shot she was quick to share her thoughts.  I’m pretty happy with what I’ve got, but I really love the forehand of (Juan Martin) del Potro. It’s very fast and very hard,  said Ostapenko, who is also known as an accomplished ballroom dancer in her homeland.  Should she triumph on Centre Court on July 15, will she be eager to show off her quickstep moves on the dance floor at the glitzy Champions' Ball held at the end of the tournament?   No, I think it would be a slow waltz. For the Wimbledon  ball it fits the best. All the players turn up in long dresses so the waltz will go well with the outfits,  she giggled. Any preference about whom she would like to share that dance with?  If I win one day, any men’s champion will do!

The inland city of around 400,000 in Argentina’s Pampas region also aims to cut violent crime, boost social inclusion and kick-start projects including a new airport, as it tries to create jobs and become better connected, said Santa Fe’s chief resilience officer, Andrea Valsagna.  Like many Latin American cities, as Santa Fe has expanded, new residents have settled in low-lying areas, she noted.  “The challenge is to organize the growth of the city in a way that reduces the risk of floods,” said Valsagna by telephone from Santa Fe in northeast Argentina.  The new resilience strategy will help position the city to “deal with the problems climate change is generating in the region”, she said, adding that heavy rains and flooding are likely to increase.  Santa Fe lies near the junction of two major waterways - the Paraná and Salado rivers - and suffered serious floods in 2003 and 2007, which forced mass evacuations.  The city now has early warning systems in place, and relies on costly infrastructure made up of 40 miles (64 km) of defenses and pumps that help minimize flood risk from the rivers. The new strategy - released under the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, a global network of cities working to tackle modern-day shocks and stresses - said Santa Fe had taken steps to reduce its vulnerability, but work was needed to bolster flood defenses, drainage systems and other critical infrastructure. Santa Fe is one of Argentina’s oldest cities, with over 70 percent of its territory made up of rivers, lakes and marshes. An effort to relocate nearly 4,000 people living in 1,500 homes situated in flood-prone areas and curb informal settlement must consider how to integrate communities, and provide education and job opportunities, said Valsagna. “The problem of families in low-lying or informal settlements is multi-dimensional, and you can’t just think about the housing problem,” she said of the city which suffers from a shortage of accommodation. “It’s very difficult to generate alternatives for many of these families - they have a history in these places... they have their links with work, schools, health,” she said. Crime and Waste  Major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed new airport for the regional capital and relocation of its river port, would broaden opportunities for economic growth and jobs, besides improving transport links, said Valsagna. Santa Fe is expected to funnel 10 percent of its municipal budget into ways of making the city more resilient. City authorities are also talking to regional development banks, the private sector and the national government about funding the port and the airport, she said. Reducing crime is another big challenge for Santa Fe, where homicides reached 22 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014. Young men from poor, under-served neighborhoods are most at risk, while police corruption and a weak justice system compound the issue.  Valsagna said a new observatory would analyze crime in the city, which is seeking ways to bring more jobs and services to inhabitants of its poorest areas. Other goals are to improve drainage and waste services in the city where over 600 families, including children, make a living out of informal rubbish collection and are exposed to health risks and poor sanitation, said the report.  Santa Fe wants to halve their number within the next five years by offering alternative sources of income.  Santa Fe Mayor José Manuel Corral noted in the report that cities around the world are facing complex challenges. “We believe that a resilience approach will allow us to tackle this complexity, putting the focus on the capacity of communities to face crises, prepare themselves for acute impacts but also to deal with and overcome chronic stresses,” he wrote.

Trump's recourse to a Cold War-era trade law would allow him to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defence. But invoking national defence is all but taboo at the WTO, the arbiter of international trade rules since 1995, because some trade experts think it could make it easy for countries to escape their international trade obligations. China and the EU both told the WTO's Goods Council that the  section 232  tariffs could not be justified on national security grounds, said a trade official who attended Friday's meeting, while others were concerned about a potential risk to the world trading system itself. The Trump administration is studying the case for the potential new tariffs but delayed publication of the eagerly awaited study until after the president has spoken with G20 leaders in Germany next week, an administration official said on Thursday. That did not stop a few pre-emptive strikes at the WTO, with the EU's representative at the meeting saying the bloc might bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs because Chinese exports are already largely subject to U.S. restrictions and Canada and Mexico are likely to be exempt. The EU would  be firm in taking all necessary actions  if its exports are restricted, the official said, adding that a proliferation of such tariffs would cause unacceptable systemic risks -- a concern echoed by other countries at the meeting. The trade diplomat from Russia, which called the debate on the issue, asked for details such as the timeframe and scope of potential tariffs, and also questioned the commercial justification for further U.S. limitations on imports of steel and aluminium. Australia warned that the United States could face retaliation, while Japan's representative said that Japan had an interest and was following the U.S. government's actions closely. The U.S. diplomat at the meeting responded by saying that if U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross found steel or aluminium was being imported  in such quantities or in such circumstances as to threaten to impair national security , he would recommend actions to be taken to  adjust the imports of steel and aluminium.

Responsibility for examining the environmental impact of projects on federally-regulated land is shared between three separate entities, a system the Liberal government says the public does not trust. Plans released on Thursday mean the much-criticized national energy regulator would lose its power to assess natural resource projects. Aboriginal and environmental protesters currently trying to block major pipelines complained the National Energy Board (NEB)is too close to the industry.  This is all about rebuilding public trust in how we make  decisions on major projects that are important to our economy,  said an official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. The official said Ottawa was currently thinking about giving overall responsibility for probes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. The government would retain final responsibility for deciding the fate of a project. Anna Johnston of the West Coast Environmental Law group said that while the plan had positive aspects, it meant the government retained too much power.  Cabinet gets to make behind closed doors some decision that basically pits short-term economic gains against environmental harms and the environment almost always loses,  she said by phone. Protests last year forced Ottawa to veto one pipeline from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific Coast and are dragging out study of another line to the Atlantic. Canada needs to get its landlocked crude to its east and west coasts to avoid pipeline bottlenecks that leave oil trading at a discount.         Under the plans, the new assessment body would pay more attention to the long-term implications of a project and the views of aboriginals as well as allowing public comments much earlier in the process. The proposals would have little immediate impact on the energy sector. Existing projects, such as TransCanada Corp's (TRP.TO) proposed Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast, will be assessed by the NEB under current rules. The government plans to introduce draft legislation later this year to implement the changes and hopes they will become law in 2018. NEB spokeswoman Rebecca Taylor said the board supported the government's work to modernize the approach to assessments. Reuters reported last year that the government would consider stripping the NEB of sole oversight for projects.

Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been vying for pipeline gas exports as it strives to grow globally. It has a memorandum with BP, which owns a 19.75 stake in the Russian company, to trade up to 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas annually in Europe. Rosneft Vice President Vlada Rusakova, a former Gazprom executive, said the company wants to conduct  an experiment  in supplying gas to new markets in coordination with Gazprom.  We are not counting on a total lifting of export restrictions. This would be harmful for Gazprom, especially against the background of a difficult financial and economic situation at the company,  she said in emailed comments. She said as part of the experiment, Rosneft could supply gas to markets where Gazprom is not present and where U.S. LNG could be imported. Rusakova did not identify any such European countries.  Of course, this should be done in close coordination with Gazprom, in order to avoid competition between Russian gas suppliers.  Gazprom is targeting $32 billion to $34 billion in revenue from exporting more than 180 bcm to Europe and Turkey this year. Rosneft produced almost 70 bcm of gas last year, earning 208 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) from gas sales at home. New Markets Rosneft, like Novatek, is winning some of Gazprom's clients at home thanks to a more flexible gas pricing policy. It is also eyeing Asian markets and plans to build an LNG plant in Russia's far east. The company wants to export gas to China, where Gazprom plans to start shipping gas in 2019-2021 via the Power of Siberia pipeline, currently under construction. It also wants access to China's domestic gas market and end-users via swap deals.  There are significant gas resources in Russia's east, while no infrastructure has been built. And that's why we are interested in gaining access to the future Power of Siberia pipeline,  Rusakova said. Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, however, said it had no plans to allow other companies to ship gas via the pipeline.  Gazprom is not involved in such talks. The conditions, which are stipulated in the contract signed as part of the intergovernmental agreement with China, are such that all the gas volumes in Power of Siberia belong to Gazprom,  he said at a news conference on Friday. But Miller also said Gazprom may allow a Russian company to enter the Baltic LNG project, due to be launched in 2023. Rosneft plans to produce 100 bcm of gas per year by 2020 and become the world's third-largest producer of natural gas sometime later, thanks to a number of international projects. Last year, Rosneft agreed to buy a stake of up to 35 percent in Egypt's Zohr offshore gas field from Italy's Eni. The Russian company also plans to expand in gas projects elsewhere, including Mozambique and Venezuela. Rusakova said Rosneft and Venezuelan state company PDVSA may consider building an LNG plant in Venezuela.

But this year they are set for their best first half since 2014.  The reason? Like much else, emerging equities have been transformed by technology. Just like the high performing U.S. tech shares -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google that were dubbed FANGs before Google's parent was renamed Alphabet -- the so-called BATs, comprising Chinese internet trio Baidoo, Alibaba and Tencent have changed an emerging equity landscape once heavy in energy and mining firms. But the BATs are just a small part of a whole  new economy  story in emerging markets, where the biggest companies by market capitalization are now high-tech conglomerates Samsung (005930.KS), Tencent (0700.HK), Taiwan Semiconductor (5425.TWO), Alibaba (BABA.N) and South Africa's Naspers (NPNJn.J), Alongside a host of smaller IT or information technology, firms, mainly Asia-based, they comprise over a quarter of the index cap, on a par with banks and significantly above the 7 percent weight of energy firms. (Graphics on 'Asset performances YTD and post-Brexit vote' - bit.ly/2urtY3r) A decade ago, the share of energy in the MSCI emerging market index was over 15 percent, while IT was under 12 percent, MSCI data shows.    You are now getting the index composition effect with the BATs - the huge internet companies which are the (Chinese) equivalent of the FANGs in the U.S,  said Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital.  One of the biggest myths of emerging markets is that they are commodity dependent and more specifically oil-dependent, when the reality is the four biggest markets, China, Korea, Taiwan and India are big importers of commodities,  Mayo added. That may explain why, when Brent crude has posted its worst first-half since 1998, MSCI's emerging share index has risen around 17 percent. Usually the index moves in lock-step with oil prices but since last year that correlation has been disrupted: Investors have been unfazed by oil's drop, having poured more than $40 billion into emerging equity funds year-to-date. Meanwhile, as the commodity supercycle has ebbed and crude prices have halved from early-2014 levels, the value of erstwhile giants Gazprom (GAZP.MM), PetroChina (601857.SS) and Petrobras (PETR4.SA) has taken a hit; Russia's Gazprom, the biggest MSCI EM stock in 2007, does not make the top 10 in 2017. Instead, a blistering U.S. tech sector rally, with gains of nearly 20 percent .SPLRCT has lifted emerging IT shares. FILE PHOTO: Dancers perform underneath the logo of Tencent at the Global Mobile Internet Conference in Beijing May 6, 2014.Kim Kyung-Hoon /File Photo IT is now bigger than materials and energy in the benchmark which is a relatively novel development in a historical context  said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management's emerging equities team. While IT is likely a  long-term structural story  in emerging markets, chances of the sector balance tilting back again toward oil hinges at least partly on whether the commodity super-cycle will make a comeback, she said. But with shale and renewable energy increasingly cost-effective, that looks unlikely in the near future.  Links Not Severed Emerging markets have not severed energy links and countries such as Russia, Colombia and Nigeria still rely on crude exports. Indeed, equity resilience showed signs of cracking earlier in June as oil prices headed toward $40, while commodity-heavy Russian stocks are this year's worst performers. Many investors draw parallels with U.S. junk-rated bonds, almost a fifth of which are energy firms but are also showing better resilience to the oil price dip than during the 2014 price collapse as their business models evolve. Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management, said a similar oil dip at the end of 2015 had fed through from the U.S. junk bonds to emerging markets.  If oil takes another leg lower and creates a credit event in U.S. high-yield, that can spread to EM,  he said. Others note the improved global backdrop since the last oil price reversal.  There are enough compensating factors to have a bit of decoupling. It doesn't mean the relationship is broken for ever but the level of oil price which starts to have a negative impact on emerging markets or U.S. shale is probably lower than before,  said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment strategist with NN Investment Partners. But there is another positive effect from the IT sector's greater weighting, namely IT firms' higher return on equity (ROE), a key measure for stockpickers as it reflects how well a company uses shareholders' capital to generate returns. Currently, the emerging IT sector's average ROE is almost twice that of energy firms and well above the index average.     A Morgan Stanley report on the subject noted the shift in the MSCI index  away from lower ROE, higher leverage, and excess capacity industries toward the higher ROE, lower leverage, non-capacity challenged New Economy industries.  It called IT's greater emerging markets weight  a structural positive that bodes well for the index's future performance.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index closed down 0.3 percent and euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E fell 0.9 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.5 percent.  The STOXX was down 2.7 percent in June, following four straight months of gains driven by an easing of political worries in the euro zone and brighter economic prospects.  But hawkish remarks from central bankers this week that boosted bond yields and the euro sparked a broad sell-off, with stocks that benefit from lower rates and export-oriented companies particularly under pressure. These jitters, along with concerns about high valuations in equities globally, led European equities to a modest quarterly loss of 0.5 percent, despite a market-friendly outcome to May's presidential elections in France that sparked a new wave of buying.  In absolute terms, European equity valuations look extended...,  said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at Credit Suisse.  To be more constructive on equities you would need a consolidation from these levels.   Sectoral moves were muted on Friday. While banks .SX7P, which benefit from higher rates, bucked their recent rally to fall 1 percent, tech stocks .SX8P rebounded, up 0.4 percent to lead gainers. In an otherwise thin day for big company news, Bayer (BAYGn.DE) was an exception. Its shares sank as much as 5.4 percent after the German drugmaker warned it would have to adjust its full-year outlook, citing excessively high inventory levels at crop protection customers in Brazil and a weaker-than-expected consumer health business. Its shares weighed on Europe's chemicals index .SX4P which fell 1.4 percent, leading sector losers. Construction and materials stocks .SXOP steadied after a sharp sell-off in the previous session. Bernstein analysts pointed to the sector still being a strong growth area.  After the recent derating the sector is no longer expensive relative to the market, trading in line with or below long-term history on a number of metrics,  they said. Adidas (ADSGn.DE) also ran ahead of the pack, up 2.1 percent and the top DAX gainer after its competitor Nike reported strong figures, but analysts said the German firm had better brand momentum. Unipol was another bright spot, up 3.8 percent after the Italian financial group said it would shift 3 billion euros of bad loans from its banking unit to a special vehicle as part of broader plans for an overhaul. Under the reorganisation, Unipol will sell stakes in insurance companies to its insurance arm Unipol SAI (US.MI).  We believe that the price of the sale of the insurance stakes to UnipolSai is fair. The other measures announced aim to create the conditions to finalize the merger between Unipol and UnipolSai,  Banca Akros analyst Enrico Esposti said. Unipolsai fell 3.6 percent, as analysts saw the insurance arm as bearing the cost of the clean-up. Among top fallers on the STOXX was British pub chain and brewer Greene King (GNK.L), down 3.7 percent following a downgrade to neutral from JP Morgan, while oilfield services firm Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) added 2 percent after an acquisition.

The clashes between armed Fulani herders and militia fighters in Zemio, about 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the capital Bangui, began on Wednesday. Heavy gunfire continued the following day and into Friday. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have fled their homes in a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. The trigger for this week's violence was not immediately clear. The Fulani herders involved in the fighting were believed to be associated with the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC), a group that belonged to the now disbanded Seleka coalition and which some experts say could be taking advantage of a security vacuum in the region.      Already on June 28 there were 22 dead, but things have evolved through yesterday and there are several other people burnt inside houses where it's not possible to have access,  lawmaker Dalou Wamboli told Reuters. Wamboli was speaking in Bangui but had remained in contact with constituents in Zemio during the violence until telephone connections were cut. He then reached residents who fled to neighboring towns with phone access.  Albert Stanislas Koumbobacko, a journalist from Zemio who was also in contact via phone with residents who fled, confirmed the death toll of 22.   The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Friday that around 1,000 people had fled this week's violence.  Many are seeking refuge in a Catholic church in the town, while some 66 people have sought safety in the UNHCR compound – among them terrified women and children in fear of their lives,  it said in a statement. A spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA, confirmed the clashes and said it had sent additional troops to the area, but had no information on casualties. Thirteen of Central African Republic's 14 armed groups signed a peace deal this month calling for a ceasefire, but violence has continued. In addition to homegrown armed groups, the country has for decades held rebels from Chad, Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo. Ugandan troops, backed by U.S. special forces, were deployed to the southeast to track members of the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, a cult-like rebel group headed by Joseph Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court.  Those forces are withdrawing, however, which some observers fear will create a security vacuum. Ugandan troops pulled out of Zemio earlier this year.  We were concerned the withdrawal would embolden Seleka fighters to move into areas they once feared to tread,  Lewis Mudge, Africa researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  The conflict has arrived in Zemio and it very well could spread to towns that, until now, had been spared.

By singling out the cuts, termed  insurance  at the time, the central bank appears to be making the case that it can now remove that 50 basis points of accommodation even as progress toward meeting the inflation target that typically drives its policy remains elusive. Indeed, the bank's preferred measures of inflation are all well below the 2 percent target. Still, comments from the bank's top two officials this month are seen as signaling they would be comfortable cancelling the insurance policy soon. Canadian currency and money markets reflect increasing certainty that the first rate hike in nearly seven years is not far off. The Canadian dollar is up 4 percent against its U.S. counterpart in June, the biggest monthly gain in 15 months, while money market rates have shot up at their fastest since 2010, when the Bank of Canada last raised rates.  The low-hanging fruit is to take back the two cuts,  said Richard Gilhooly, head of rates strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.  The removal of insurance eases is not linked to any particular employment print; it is not linked to one month or two months data,  he said.   ... It has done its job, and I think that's why the market is reacting the way it is.  Data from the overnight index swaps market showed traders see a 57 percent chance of a rate hike next month, up from 50 percent before a Bank of Canada survey indicating companies were more optimistic about sales and exports. Chances of an increase were just 20 percent after last week's consumer price index report showed subdued inflation.  Whatever you believe the Bank of Canada was planning on doing, the miss on CPI is not going to dissuade them,  said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.  Nor is the move lower in oil prices that we've seen.  Oil has traded recently at 10-month lows. But the Bank of Canada has said the economy has largely adjusted. The move in rates from 0.50 percent to 1 percent will be a reaction to  observed growth  in the economy, Kelvin said. Canada's economy grew at an annualized 3.7 percent rate in the first quarter after a strong expansion in the second half of 2016. The central bank expects it to continue to run at a pace that will help drive inflation higher. Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins was clear in her recent speech  that what matters is the outlook for inflation, not so much what is going on now,  said Desjardins senior economist Jimmy Jean. Service sector inflation is already running in excess of 2 percent and is a better indicator of domestic inflation pressures, analysts said.  We think the 50 (basis points) is done,  CIBC's Gilhooly said, adding that the central bank might do more if inflation starts to move higher.

The accord disclosed on Thursday in filings with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan ends the 75-year-old McCartney's pre-emptive effort to ensure that the copyrights, once owned by Michael Jackson, would go to him starting in October 2018. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos signed an order dismissing the case, but agreed to revisit it if a dispute arose. The dismissal request had been made by Michael Jacobs, a lawyer for McCartney, on behalf of the singer and Sony/ATV. It is unclear how the accord affects McCartney's copyright claims. The singer's representatives could not immediately be reached on Friday for comment. McCartney had sued on Jan. 18 for a declaration that he could reclaim more than 260 copyrights, including for songs credited to him and John Lennon such as  I Want to Hold Your Hand,   Yesterday  and  Hey Jude.  The registrations at issue also covered  Maybe I'm Amazed  and several other songs McCartney recorded as a solo artist. They even covered such titles as  Scrambled Egg,  which is close to the working lyric  Scrambled Eggs  that McCartney once used for the song that became  Yesterday.  McCartney had been outbid by Jackson in 1985 for the Beatles' song rights, which were later rolled into Sony/ATV, a joint venture with Sony Corp. The pop star's estate sold its stake in that venture to Sony for $750 million last year. McCartney sued 1-1/2 months after a British court said the pop group Duran Duran could not reclaim rights to their songs, in its case against Sony/ATV's Gloucester Place Music unit. Changes made in 1976 to U.S. copyright law let authors like McCartney reclaim song rights after periods of time elapsed. In his lawsuit, McCartney said he could begin exercising his rights on Beatles songs, starting with  Love Me Do,  on Oct. 5, 2018.

Gazprom, the leading global gas producer, enjoys monopoly rights on gas pipeline exports from Russia. It has lost its exclusive rights to ship seaborne LNG overseas to Rosneft and Novatek, Russia's largest non-state gas producer. Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been vying for pipeline gas exports as it strives to grow globally. It has a memorandum with BP, which owns a 19.75 stake in the Russian company, to trade up to 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually in Europe. Rosneft Vice President Vlada Rusakova, a former Gazprom executive, said the company wants to conduct  an experiment  in supplying gas to new markets in coordination with Gazprom.  We are not counting on a total lifting of export restrictions. This would be harmful for Gazprom, especially against the background of a difficult financial and economic situation at the company,  she said in emailed comments. She said as part of the experiment, Rosneft could supply gas to markets where Gazprom is not present and where U.S. LNG could be imported. Rusakova did not identify any such European countries.   Of course, this should be done in close coordination with Gazprom, in order to avoid competition between Russian gas suppliers.  Gazprom is targeting $32 billion to $34 billion in revenue from exporting more than 180 bcm to Europe and Turkey this year. Rosneft produced almost 70 bcm of gas last year, earning 208 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) from gas sales at home.  New Markets  FILE PHOTO: A sign displaying the logo of Russia's Gazprom Neft oil company is seen at the company's office in the West Siberian city of Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, January 28, 2016.Sergei Karpukhin/File PhotoRosneft, like Novatek, is winning some of Gazprom's clients at home thanks to a more flexible gas pricing policy. It is also eyeing Asian markets and plans to build an LNG plant in Russia's far east.   The company wants to export gas to China, where Gazprom plans to start shipping gas in 2019-2021 via the Power of Siberia pipeline, currently under construction. It also wants access to China's domestic gas market and end-users via swap deals.   There are significant gas resources in Russia's east, while no infrastructure has been built. And that's why we are interested in gaining access to the future Power of Siberia pipeline,  Rusakova said. Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, however, said it had no plans to allow other companies to ship gas via the pipeline.  Gazprom is not involved in such talks. The conditions, which are stipulated in the contract signed as part of the intergovernmental agreement with China, are such that all the gas volumes in Power of Siberia belong to Gazprom,  he said at a news conference on Friday. But Miller also said Gazprom may allow a Russian company to enter the Baltic LNG project, due to be launched in 2023. Rosneft plans to produce 100 bcm of gas per year by 2020 and become the world's third-largest producer of natural gas sometime later, thanks to a number of international projects. Last year, Rosneft agreed to buy a stake of up to 35 percent in Egypt's Zohr offshore gas field from Italy's Eni. The Russian company also plans to expand in gas projects elsewhere, including Mozambique and Venezuela.  Rusakova said Rosneft and Venezuelan state company PDVSA may consider building an LNG plant in Venezuela.

Amazon's relentless growth and destruction of value among traditional retail rivals is forcing active fund managers to look for bets in areas they think Amazon can't or won't reach.  Emerging options include theme restaurant chains, recreational vehicle makers and sellers of stuff that's just too heavy to ship via Amazon's network. Meanwhile, some fund managers are increasingly convinced the only way to play consumer spending is to move away from brands and retailers and into logistics and supply chain companies, essentially betting e-commerce will render most consumer companies obsolete.  The challenge of investing in consumer companies comes a time when the category would typically shine.  Low unemployment and a solid housing market boost consumer stocks, yet companies in the category - excluding Amazon - are up just 5.2 percent for the year, or about 3 percentage points below the broad S&P; 500 as a whole, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Amazon shares, by comparison, are up about 30 percent.  (For graphic on Amazon overshadows its competition, click tmsnrt.rs/2sr0mlA) Bigger Disruption Than Wal-Mart's  Amazon now accounts for about 34 percent of all U.S. online sales and should see that number grow to about 50 percent by 2021, according to a Needham research note. Amazon's growing dominance is in some ways akin to the rise of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) in the early 2000s, when its rapid growth and move to branch out into groceries raised concerns it would put other retailers out of business. Yet Amazon's greater online reach and purchase of a top-shelf grocery store chain makes it far more formidable, said Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager at Federated Kaufmann funds.  I've been in this industry for twenty-five years and this is the biggest transformation we've seen in the consumer space,  she said.  While Wal-Mart put many small mom-and-pop stores out of business, Amazon is dragging down national competitors like Target and Macy's with its combination of low prices, broad range of inventory, and speed, she said.  At the same time, Amazon is expanding its e-commerce dominance when more shoppers are online, suggesting more pain ahead for competitors. E-commerce sales grew 14.7 percent in 2016, nearly triple the 5.1-percent growth rate of traditional retailers, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.  Bugs and Coffee: The Hunt for Survivors FILE PHOTO - A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. on June 16, 2017.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoFund managers say Amazon's growing dominance is forcing them to shift long-held strategies, by either putting less money into consumer stocks overall or by focusing on companies that can compete alongside Amazon or may be attractive buyout targets.  The company's outsized 15.4-percent weighting, more than double the next-largest stock in the S&P; 500 Consumer Discretionary index, is problematic for fund managers who typically will not hold any positions greater than 5 percent of their portfolio in order to manage risk.  Josh Cummings, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson funds, is avoiding shares of direct competitors of Amazon, such as Target Corp (TGT.N), Kroger Co (KR.N), and Wal-Mart, and instead focusing on companies with  idiosyncratic  attributes, he said. Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), for instance, offers an experience that Amazon would find hard to match, he said, while Servicemaster Global Holdings (SERV.N), parent company of pest control company Terminix, is largely immune from e-commerce competition.   Could Amazon decide they want to be in the business of spraying for bugs? It doesn't seem likely,  he said. Miller, the portfolio manager at the Federated Kaufmann funds, said she is moving away from stores that could be found in a mall, focusing instead on companies like Dave & Busters Entertainment Inc (PLAY.O) and Wingstop Inc (WING.O) that offer food-based experiences. She also owns shares of Camping World Holdings Inc (CWH.N), which sells a mix of goods and services ranging from roadside assistance to accessories to the growing recreational vehicle market.   This is a company with a strong membership base that has the sort of scale in its niche to rival Amazon,  she said. Jeff Rottinghaus, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core Equity fund, said he owns Home Depot Inc (HD.N) shares because its stores essentially function as warehouses and much of its merchandise is too heavy or bulky to profitably ship quickly online.  Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas, said he expects that portfolio holding Wal-Mart will become more aggressive in acquiring small, private companies to broaden its online reach.  The company announced a deal to buy men's wear company Bonobos for $310 million in mid-June, following purchases of outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw and online shoe store ShoeBuy. Wal-Mart acquired online retailer Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal last August.   They're going to do whatever it takes to compete with Amazon. They may be losing the battle at the moment but that doesn't mean that they will back down,  he said. Other investors are getting their consumer exposure by focusing on behind-the-scenes companies that power the growth of e-commerce.  Laird Bieger, a portfolio manager of the Baron Discovery Fund - the top-performing small-cap growth fund year-to-date - said he is focusing on companies like CommerceHub Inc (CHUBA.O), which works with companies such as J C Penney Co (JCP.N) and Best Buy Inc (BBY.N) to allow them to sell more products online and ship directly from manufacturers.  Craig Richard, a co-portfolio manager of the Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund, said he has been buying Kornit Digital Ltd (KRNT.O), which makes textile printers that can produce t-shirt and other apparel designs on demand, helping save inventory costs. Amazon is Kornit's largest customer and has warrants to buy up to 2.9 million Kornit shares, about 8 percent of the company, at $13.03 a share over the next five years. Shares of Kornit, up 57 percent this year, traded at $19.95 on Friday.

Firms expect sales growth to improve further after a pickup in the last 12 months, driven by strength in services and a bounceback in the commodity sector, the central bank said in its quarterly business outlook survey. Overall, the survey suggested a continued recovery in business sentiment after two years of weakness, and it fed into expectations that the Bank of Canada will begin raising interest rates, possibly as early as next month.  July is clearly on the table for policymakers, and if not July, then probably September or October,  said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. Chances of a rate hike next month jumped to 57 percent after the survey was released, data from the overnight index swaps market shows. They were just 20 percent after the consumer price index report last week showed that inflation was subdued. Canada's 2-year yield rose to its highest since October, 2014 at 1.108 percent. The 2-year yield has soared 35 basis points since before Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins’ speech on June 12 tipped the market to the central bank’s more hawkish stance. The survey showed an indicator of hiring intentions reached a record high, and some firms believe competition for labor is starting to feed into wages.  Respondents signaled that improving demand was the main factor pushing them closer to capacity, and labor-related constraints have become more prevalent,  the bank said. While some firms mentioned emerging price pressures from inputs and companies want to pass on higher costs to rebuild margins as demand recovers, competition continues to restrain their ability to raise prices and inflation expectations edged down, remaining at the lower end of the bank's 1 to 3 percent inflation control range. Many firms said sustained U.S. demand boosted expectations for export growth from the modest level recorded in the previous survey, though uncertainty about future trade negotiations and U.S. protectionism continues to cloud the outlook. The survey of about 100 firms showed capacity pressures and labor shortages are more intense compared with the last survey in April.

President Uhuru Kenyatta is seeking a second five-year term but his chief rival Raila Odinga has seized on inflation, which touched a five-year high last month, and shortages of the staple maize flour to criticise the government. Kenyans will vote for a president, parliamentarians and local representatives on Aug. 8. Kenyatta is touting his infrastructure push and an economic performance that far outshines the region. Kenya forecasts growth of 5.9 percent this year, compared with 5.8 percent in 2016. The World Bank predicts the economy will grow by 5.5 percent this year. The forecasts do not build in a large dose of economic activity due to the elections, indicating that many investors believe a repeat of the violence that followed disputed 2007 polls, when more than 1,200 people were killed, is unlikely. On Friday, the statistics office said growth slowed to 4.7 percent in the first quarter, down from 5.9 percent in the same period of 2016. It blamed the slowdown on drought and a major credit slowdown. Private sector credit growth dropped to 3.3 percent in March from 17 percent at the end of 2015, after the central bank tightened regulations and introduced an interest rate cap.  It is a very difficult environment for the incumbent in the election or whoever wins the election,  said Robert Shaw, a Nairobi-based economist.  We have got unfortunate events like the lack of rain and then you have got a situation where there is a fairly bearish sentiment.  Providing some relief, Kenya's inflation fell to 9.21 percent year-on-year in June, down from 11.70 percent a month earlier, the statistics office said. Agriculture, including exports of tea and coffee, accounts for more than a quarter of annual output in the region's largest economy. But farmers have been hurt by a regional drought that left 2.7 million people in need of food aid. The U.N. said on Thursday the number of people who will need food aid is expected to rise to 3.5 million by August. The drought has caused a national shortage of the staple maize flour used to make the popular dish ugali, causing a national outcry and sending the government scrambling to import corn in the face of critical headlines.

GDP, adjusted for inflation, shrank 0.5 percent year-on-year between January and March, its first fall since 2009. That was almost entirely because of a 2.3 percent contraction in the oil sector, as Saudi Arabia cut its crude output under a global deal among producing countries to prop up prices. The non-oil government sector of the economy shrank 0.1 percent, showing Riyadh continued to keep a tight rein on state spending as it tried to cut a big budget deficit caused by low oil prices. But the non-oil private sector grew 0.9 percent, accelerating from a revised 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. It was the fastest private sector expansion since the fourth quarter of 2015. Private businesses have been hit hard by government austerity measures, including higher domestic energy prices and delays in the government paying its debts to companies. Late last year, however, Riyadh began settling its debts more promptly, boosting the private sector. The outlook for growth in the rest of this year is murky. In recent weeks Riyadh has eased its austerity drive slightly, restoring financial allowances to public sector employees, and this should help consumption slightly. Also, the government plans to introduce a 5 percent value-added tax at the start of 2018, so there may be a consumption mini-boom in the preceding months as Saudis make big-ticket purchases to avoid the tax. But some austerity steps are going ahead this year, such as higher residence fees for expatriates, who make up about a third of the population. Also, the oil output deal extends through the end of 2017, so the oil sector will continue to drag on growth.

The accord disclosed on Thursday in filings with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan ends the 75-year-old McCartney's pre-emptive effort to ensure that the copyrights, once owned by Michael Jackson, would go to him starting in October 2018. U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos signed an order dismissing the case, but agreed to revisit it if a dispute arose. The dismissal request had been made by Michael Jacobs, a lawyer for McCartney, on behalf of the singer and Sony/ATV. It is unclear how the accord affects McCartney's copyright claims. The singer's representatives could not immediately be reached on Friday for comment. McCartney had sued on Jan. 18 for a declaration that he could reclaim more than 260 copyrights, including for songs credited to him and John Lennon such as  I Want to Hold Your Hand,   Yesterday  and  Hey Jude.  The registrations at issue also covered  Maybe I'm Amazed  and several other songs McCartney recorded as a solo artist.

McCartney had been outbid by Jackson in 1985 for the Beatles' song rights, which were later rolled into Sony/ATV, a joint venture with Sony Corp. The pop star's estate sold its stake in that venture to Sony for $750 million last year. McCartney sued 1-1/2 months after a British court said the pop group Duran Duran could not reclaim rights to their songs, in its case against Sony/ATV's Gloucester Place Music unit. Changes made in 1976 to U.S. copyright law let authors like McCartney reclaim song rights after periods of time elapsed. In his lawsuit, McCartney said he could begin exercising his rights on Beatles songs, starting with  Love Me Do,  on Oct. 5, 2018. The case is McCartney v Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-00363.

Carnegie Clean Energy was chosen by a team called the Unreasonable Group over at least 10 other firms, from countries including Brazil, the Netherlands and the United States, for its flexible approach using a mix of renewable energy.     The Unreasonable Group was set up by a Denver-based entrepreneur to tap businesses to speed up efforts to meet the United Nation's 17 global development goals, from eradicating hunger to building infrastructure, by 2030.      The group - set to host two weeks of brainstorming inWashington in July with the U.S. State Department, 17entrepreneurs, development banks, and some major corporations -has set an ambitious target for Carnegie, a $115 million firm.     We do expect that within the next five to ten years, Carnegie will deliver some of the largest micro-grids and utility scale batteries ever developed in Australia and replicate these types of projects throughout the South Pacific's island communities, rural mainland Asia, and even Africa, Unreasonable Group said in emailed comments.     Carnegie Chief Executive Michael Ottaviano, based in WesternAustralia, has yet to decide where to begin, and has more modest ambitions.      We don't want to try and deliver clean and affordable energy to the entire developing world. That's possibly a bit more than we could chew,  Ottaviano told Reuters in an interview. He pointed to Indonesia as a possible starting point.  We want to go into a developing region or country where we can deploy hundreds of these microgrid style systems. So we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of investment associated with that,  he said. Working with the Unreasonable Group gives Carnegie access to partnerships with development banks and major corporations that operate in developing countries that can help it overcome some of the challenges of trying to invest in poorer nations.     The main challenge is not technology, but navigating local regulations and issues like counter-party risk, Ottaviano said. Investment in so-called distributed energy systems, as opposed to big central power stations that also need transmission and distribution lines, would pay off for households and governments that have to subsidize expensive power.   It can save money immediately. So there's no challenge from an economic business case,  Ottaviano said.    Systems using solar power and batteries with diesel as back-up could work well in places with remote communities.      You could deliver hundreds and hundreds of these systems into the market and have a massive impact on people's lives there who are either under electrified or have no electricity.

The Republican-dominated court said the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, which made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, did not resolve issues such as payments of municipal employees' spousal benefits.  The Supreme Court held in Obergefell that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex marriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages,  the Texas court wrote in its opinion,  but it did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons.  In 2013, two Houston taxpayers, backed by Texas Republican leaders, sued the city after then-Mayor Annise Parker gave municipal spousal benefits to same-sex couples married in places where same-sex marriages were recognized. At the time, Texas had a constitutional amendment that barred same-sex marriage. That law was later struck down. The plaintiffs, Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks, a pastor and an accountant, argued that the top U.S. court's decision on same-sex marriage was poorly reasoned and that same-sex couples were not entitled to spousal employment benefits. Rights groups for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people contended the plaintiffs were trying to erode the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on an already settled matter. “This absurd contortion of the Obergefell ruling defies all logic and reason,  said Kenneth Upton, senior counsel in Lambda Legal’s South Central Regional Office in Dallas, an LGBT rights legal group.  We will take steps to protect these families.  LGBT rights groups have said they intended to appeal if the Texas court's decision went against them.

Dozens of civilians, mostly women and children, fled across the frontline toward the troops as bullets whizzed through the air. They were thirsty and tired, and some had been wounded. Commanders of Iraq's Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) cautioned that with the mostly non-Iraqi IS militants dug in among thousands of civilians and likely to fight to the death, the battle ahead remained challenging.  CTS Major General Maan al-Saadi told Reuters it could take at least four to five days of fighting to capture the last handful of neighborhoods along the banks of the Tigris River, defended by about 200 militants.  The advance continues to Midan neighborhood,  he said.  Controlling it means we have reached the Tigris River.  The IS militants themselves denied the setbacks. The group, whose leader declared a caliphate over parts of Iraq and Syria three years ago, still occupies an area the size of Belgium across the two neighboring countries, according to one estimate. The fall of Mosul would mark the effective end of the Iraqi half of the caliphate, although the group still controls territory west and south of the city, ruling over tens of thousands of people. Its stronghold in Syria, Raqqa, is also under siege. U.S.-backed forces encircled the city after closing the militants' last way out from the south, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Islamic State forces launched a counter-attack on Friday..  Desperate Civilians Related CoverageU.N. urges Iraq to halt forced evictions from MosulThe insurgent position in Mosul is several hundred meters wide and thousands of civilians are trapped there in harrowing conditions, with little food, water, medicine and no access to health services, according to those who managed to flee. Those who escaped on Friday streamed through alleyways near the Grand al-Nuri Mosque, which Islamic State fighters blew up a week ago. They scrambled over mounds of rubble in the street, carrying small children and helping the elderly across. A Reuters correspondent saw smoke billowing over the riverside districts amid artillery blasts and burst of gunfire. Western troops from the U.S.-led coalition were helping with aerial surveillance and mortar fire, he said.   Iraqi Prime Minister Hailer al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's caliphate -- which he called  a state of falsehoood  -- on Thursday after CTS units captured the ground of the ruined 850-year-old mosque. An armoured fighting vehicle of the Counter Terrorism Service is seen at the Grand al-Nuri Mosque at the Old City in Mosul, Iraq, June 30, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniIt was from the mosque's pulpit that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared his caliphate three years ago to the day. The insurgents chose to blow it up rather than see their black flag taken down from its al-Hadba, or Hunchback, leaning minaret where it had been flying since June 2014.  The suffering of tens of thousands whose lives have been wrecked for having lost relatives, their homes or their businesses dampened feelings of victory.   I hear victory speeches on the radio but I cannot help feeling sad when you see people without homes and others fleeing with their children under the blazing sun,  said Mahmoud, a taxi driver in the eastern side of Mosul which was taken back from the militants in the first 100 days of the campaign. Grinding Warfare Slideshow (15 Images)The symbolic victory of the Iraqi forces came after more than eight months of grinding urban warfare which has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands of civilians, according to aid organizations. Islamic State's weekly publication al-Nabaa, denying they were losing the battle for Mosul, said the Iraqi army had virtually collapsed and suffered 300 killed and wounded.  The epic battle of Mosul is one of the most important battles of Islam and its lessons will be applied in other confrontations, God willing,  read a headline. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the offensive, which army and federal police units are also taking part in, attacking from different directions.   Tight alleyways with booby traps, civilians and ISIS fighters around every corner make the Iraqi security force's advance extremely challenging,  coalition spokesman U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon said. Baghdadi's speech from the Grand al-Nuri Mosque on July 4, 2014 was the first and only time he has revealed himself to the world. He has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding on the Iraq-Syrian border, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The group has moved its remaining command and control structures to Mayadin, in eastern Syria, U.S. intelligence sources said last week, without indicating if Baghdadi was also hiding in the same area. The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded. Russia said on June 17 its forces might have killed him in an air strike in Syria. But Washington says it has no information to corroborate such reports and Iraqi officials have also been skeptical.

The pace of the yield rise, fuelled by comments by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England earlier this week, eased on Friday after data showed inflation in the bloc down slightly from the previous month. Yet the underlying tone remained bearish after days of heavy selling in the world's major debt markets. Comments from the ECB and the BOE have given rise to a perception that major central banks are at a turning point - stepping back from the stimulus that has helped pin down borrowing costs for so long. While the ECB tried to calm market reaction to remarks made by its chief Mario Draghi on Tuesday, investors appear convinced that the central bank will have to unwind its asset-purchase programme sooner rather than later, given a brighter economic backdrop and a scarcity of eligible bonds for the scheme.  It certainty feels like a sentiment change out there. The trigger may have been Draghi's comments, but the fact is that even after clarification, yields have continued to rise and that suggests there is more at play,  Nordea chief strategist Jan von Gerich said.  People are starting to come to the view that tapering will happen soon and they have to position for that.  In Germany, 10-year Bund yields rose nearly 3 basis points (bps) to 0.48 percent, its highest in more than three months. Bund yields are 22 bps higher on the week, the biggest jump since December 2015. Other euro zone bond yields were 1-2 bps higher on the day, with some having risen as much as 10 bps in recent sessions. French yields recorded their biggest weekly rise since November, up 22 bps. Italian yields set their biggest weekly jump since March. Analysts said the sharp reaction to central bankers' comments this week stems from the fact that many investors had positioned for bond yields to stay at low levels and were caught off guard. Money markets price in around a 90 percent chance that the ECB will hike rates over the next year. That is up from just 20 percent earlier this month.

In response, Britain said the declaration remained in force and was a legally valid treaty to which it was committed to upholding.  The stark announcement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, that is sure to raise questions over Beijing's commitment to Hong Kong's core freedoms, came the same day Chinese President Xi Jinping said in Hong Kong the  one country, two systems  formula was recognized  by the whole world . It was not immediately clear if Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang was attacking just the idea of continued British involvement in Hong Kong, which marks the 20th anniversary of Chinese rule on Saturday, or the principles in the document. The Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984 by then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, laid out how Britain would end its century-and-a-half long rule over Hong Kong. It also guarantees the city's rights and freedoms under the  two systems  formula. Under Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, Hong Kong was guaranteed its freedoms for  at least 50 years  after 1997. Lu told reporters during a regular briefing on Friday that the document no longer binds China.  Now Hong Kong has returned to the motherland's embrace for 20 years, the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as a historical document, no longer has any practical significance, and it is not at all binding for the central government's management over Hong Kong. The UK has no sovereignty, no power to rule and no power to supervise Hong Kong after the handover,  Lu said. Britain said it had a legal responsibility to ensure China abided by its obligations under the declaration.  The Sino-British Joint Declaration remains as valid today as it did when it was signed over 30 years ago,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said.  It is a legally binding treaty, registered with the U.N. and continues to be in force. As a co-signatory, the UK government is committed to monitoring its implementation closely.    On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain hoped that Hong Kong would make more progress toward democracy.     Britain’s commitment to Hong Kong – enshrined in the Joint Declaration with China – is just as strong today as it was 20 years ago,  Johnson said.  I’ve no doubt that Hong Kong’s future success will depend on the rights and freedoms protected by that treaty.

Xi's visit comes amid heightened tension between China and the former British colony, where many are concerned at increasing interference by Beijing in the city's affairs, despite the promise of wide-ranging autonomy under the  two systems  agreement. The battle for full democracy, vividly illustrated by 79 days of  Occupy  street protests in 2014, has been a defining issue for the city of 7.3 million. It has sown distrust, polarized politics and hampered governance.    In the 20 years since Hong Kong was returned to the motherland, the success of 'one country, two systems' is recognized by the whole world,  Xi said in a speech.  Of course, during the implementation, we've met some new situations, new issues and new challenges. On these issues, they need to be regarded correctly and analyzed rationally... Issues are not scary. The key is to think of ways to solve these issues.  Without giving specifics, Xi said these needed to be corrected and not handled with an  emotional attitude . But in a stark and surprising announcement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, which laid the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997, no longer had any practical significance. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Thursday had said Britain's commitment to Hong Kong, enshrined in the  treaty , was  just as strong today  as it was 20 years ago.

Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects troops at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison as part of events marking the 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China June 30, 2017.Damir Sagolj It is a really grave matter for the Chinese to now say the effect of the Joint Declaration was spent. So the carpet, so to speak, has been pulled from under Hong Kongers' feet,  said barrister and former democratic lawmaker Alan Leong. Xi earlier inspected more than 3,000 People's Liberation Army troops on the second day of his first trip as president to the financial hub ahead of Saturday's anniversary. The PLA said it was the largest military parade in the city since the 1997 handover, though it was similar in style and tone to the one given by his predecessor, Hu Jintao, in 2012. Low-Key Presence of Pla   Xi praised the Hong Kong government under Beijing-backed leader Leung Chun-ying, saying it had  effectively tackled Hong Kong independence forces and maintained social stability . Slideshow (24 Images)The presence of the PLA in the city has long been one of the most sensitive parts of the city's reversion to Chinese rule, but the garrison, thought to number between 8,000 and 10,000, has kept a noticeably low-key presence. Security has been tight ahead of the July 1 anniversary, with some 9,000 police reportedly deployed to maintain order. Protesters have been kept well away from Xi and his entourage, his hotel, and the venue for Saturday's ceremony. Banners critical of China have been largely absent from the streets, though a rally on Saturday could draw tens of thousands of people in an annual demand for full democracy.  Few expect anywhere near the scale of protest seen during the 2014 Occupy movement during Xi's visit, but activists and civil society groups are planning a number of demonstrations.  Hundreds of protesters demanded the release of Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo and justice for victims of the Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing in 1989. But the organizers of a pro-independence rally claiming that Hong Kong had now in effect become a repressed Chinese colony called off their plans at the last minute because of what they said was heavy police pressure. Hong Kong authorities released 26 pro-democracy protesters on Friday who were arrested before Xi's arrival.  Democracy Now! Now!  they shouted on being released, including young Occupy protest leader Joshua Wong.

The bond sale is a further advance in financial technology for the country which pioneered mobile money with M-Pesa in 2007.  Kenya has borrowed intensively in the past four years to fund an ambitious development programme, including new roads and a coast-capital railway, and the government wants to raise more cash.  However, few ordinary Kenyans bought government bonds, scared off by the minimum investment of 50,000 shillings and the need for a commercial bank account.  M-Akiba allows a single investor to put in a minimum of 3,000 shillings and a maximum 1 million shillings, earning tax-free interest of 10 percent. They will be able to trade them on the secondary market.  The bond was initially available on telecom companies' money transfer services, but has since also been opened to a similar operation run by commercial banks, known as Pesalink.  The bond will be on sale from June 30-July 21 and will be tradable on the stock exchange on July 25.  Rotich said that in future all infrastructure bonds offered by the government will have a portion of them dedicated for sale via mobile phone.

Carnegie Clean Energy was chosen by a team called the Unreasonable Group over at least 10 other firms, from countries including Brazil, the Netherlands and the United States, for its flexible approach using a mix of renewable energy.     The Unreasonable Group was set up by a Denver-based entrepreneur to tap businesses to speed up efforts to meet the United Nation's 17 global development goals, from eradicating hunger to building infrastructure, by 2030.      The group - set to host two weeks of brainstorming inWashington in July with the U.S. State Department, 17entrepreneurs, development banks, and some major corporations -has set an ambitious target for Carnegie, a $115 million firm.     We do expect that within the next five to ten years, Carnegie will deliver some of the largest micro-grids and utility scale batteries ever developed in Australia and replicate these types of projects throughout the South Pacific's island communities, rural mainland Asia, and even Africa, Unreasonable Group said in emailed comments.     Carnegie Chief Executive Michael Ottaviano, based in WesternAustralia, has yet to decide where to begin, and has more modest ambitions.      We don't want to try and deliver clean and affordable energy to the entire developing world. That's possibly a bit more than we could chew,  Ottaviano told Reuters in an interview. He pointed to Indonesia as a possible starting point.  We want to go into a developing region or country where we can deploy hundreds of these microgrid style systems. So we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of investment associated with that,  he said. Working with the Unreasonable Group gives Carnegie access to partnerships with development banks and major corporations that operate in developing countries that can help it overcome some of the challenges of trying to invest in poorer nations.     The main challenge is not technology, but navigating local regulations and issues like counter-party risk, Ottaviano said. Investment in so-called distributed energy systems, as opposed to big central power stations that also need transmission and distribution lines, would pay off for households and governments that have to subsidize expensive power.   It can save money immediately. So there's no challenge from an economic business case,  Ottaviano said.    Systems using solar power and batteries with diesel as back-up could work well in places with remote communities.      You could deliver hundreds and hundreds of these systems into the market and have a massive impact on people's lives there who are either under electrified or have no electricity.

Reports that the federal government had indications that the administration of President Donald Trump could terminate cooperation in the fight against tax havens and tax dumping and withdraw from the agreements on better regulation and control of financial markets are not correct,  a government spokeswoman said in a statement. The German magazine Der Spiegel reported, without citing its sources, that the U.S. administration had signalled it could discontinue multilateral cooperation on financial market regulation and tax havens. The magazine also said that Washington was threatening to slap tariffs on dozens of European products if Europe did not open its market to U.S. hormone-fed meat. G20 countries began coordinating on financial regulation and tax matters after the global financial crisis of 2008/9. Separately, officials confirmed to Reuters that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had sent her top economic adviser Lars-Hendrik Roeller to Washington for talks on Friday with U.S. officials. The trip amounts to a last-ditch bid to overcome differences on trade and climate change ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg, which will be held on July 7-8. Merkel acknowledged in a speech in the German lower house of parliament that there were stubborn differences with the Trump administration on trade and climate. Trump announced earlier this month that he would pull the United States out of a landmark international agreement to fight climate change. His administration is also threatening punitive trade measures on steel ahead of the G20 summit. In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman said regarding the dispute about U.S. hormone-fed meat and possible U.S. tariffs on European products that this was an ongoing internal U.S. review that U.S. authorities were formally obliged to carry out after receiving a request from the industry.  We take the issue very seriously and are committed to find an acceptable solution,  the spokesman said, adding Brussels was in contact with the U.S. administration on the issue.  The U.S. industry for its part has made clear it does not favour sanctions but a negotiated outcome,  he added.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/g20-germany-usa-idUSL1N1JR11Q"},

A drop among oil stocks, miners and by United Utilities kept the UK's top share index in negative territory on Friday after a choppy day. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.5 percent at 7,312.72 points, underperforming a European market which was also lacklustre. Mid-caps, which are more domestically exposed, felt the brunt of investors turning against the UK economy and suffered their worst month since the Brexit vote. The FTSE 100's heavy weighting towards the resources sectors has hindered its progress over the past month as the price of oil slid to a 7-month low. Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP were down 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, while miner Glencore also dropped 1.1 percent. Retailers Marks & Spencer and Next were also prominent fallers, down 2.1 and 3 percent after a survey showed British consumer confidence hit its lowest since last July, immediately after the country voted to leave the European Union. Worries over central banks hinting that a tightening of monetary policy could be on the horizon have also been a key focus this week, hitting shares in defensive, dividend-paying stocks such as utilities and pharmaceutical firms, whose dividends become less attractive when bond yields rise.  The market has decided that we are entering an environment where borrowing costs are going to start to rise,  said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index.  That has a lot of implications for debt-dependent, capital-intensive industries, for industries which tend to run a weak or negative cash profile,  Odeluga said, adding that, as many of the UK blue chips tend to be low-growth, high-yielding, value stocks, the recent rotation could be beneficial for the FTSE. United Utilities was the biggest blue chip faller, down 3.5 percent following a downgrade to  underperform  from Credit Suisse.  We think bond yields are equally likely to rise over the coming five-year period. This would exacerbate the valuation impact of the cut to returns,  analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note, referring to the broader water utilities sector.  Financing risk is borne by companies, and while this has led to windfall profits over the past two regulatory cycles, the dynamic could very well reverse.  British utilities had been under particular pressure this month in the run-up to the UK general election, with proposed policies around price caps weighing on the shares. Severn Trent, National Grid and United Utilities were among the worst-performing stocks in June, all losing more than 12 percent this month. The last three months have also been lacklustre for the FTSE, which ended the second quarter with a narrow 0.1 percent loss following four quarters of robust gains as sterling's post-Brexit vote plunge boosted dollar-earning blue chips. Major British stocks could no longer lean on the weak sterling this quarter, though, with the currency posting its best quarter in two years thanks to a weaker dollar and rising expectations of tighter monetary policy. Mid-caps suffered their worst month since the Brexit vote, hit by eroding investor confidence in stocks more exposed to a turbulent and uncertain domestic economy. They were down 3.2 percent on the month, but held on to their fourth consecutive quarter of gains, with 1.9 percent. Among mid-caps which ended the day steady, shares in Greene King were among the biggest fallers. They  dropped more than 4 percent after JPMorgan downgraded its rating on the pub operator to  neutral , and several other brokers cut their price targets for the stock, following Greene King's full year update in the previous session.

The seven-member board unanimously authorized a bankruptcy filing at a public meeting in San Juan, granting a request by Governor Ricardo Rossello. But the board's executive director, Natalie Jaresko, stressed the panel would continue talks with creditors in hopes of reaching a deal with bankruptcy.    “That may affect the timing” of an actual bankruptcy filing, Jaresko said.     The board, created under the 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law, known as PROMESA, is in charge of managing the U.S. territory’s finances and helping it emerge from a crisis marked by $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate on the island and insolvent public pensions.      PROMESA gave Puerto Rico and its agencies access to a workout process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, known as Title III. Some public entities, including Puerto Rico's central government itself, have already filed Title III cases.     Friday’s vote on PREPA comes after nearly three years of restructuring talks between the utility and its creditors, and the unraveling of two separate deals.      The most recent one, under which creditors would have accepted repayment cuts of 15 percent in exchange for new bonds backed by a charge on customer utility bills, was vetoed by the oversight board on Tuesday. The board said it wants to forge a new deal that would cap the charges on the bills.     The decision rankled creditors and some U.S. lawmakers who believe PROMESA does not give the board authority to reject a deal negotiated outside the statute.     Rep. Rob Bishop, who chairs the House committee in charge of U.S. territory issues, warned on Wednesday the board's rejection  poses more questions as to (Puerto Rico's) economic future and Congress will want answers to those questions.”     Rossello requested a Title III process for PREPA on Friday morning, saying in a statement he wanted “to guarantee that PREPA’s services don’t see interruptions.”       Hopefully we're going to find some stability on a path to resolving, whether there is deal, no deal, Title III or what have you,  Rossello said on Thursday.

Commentators, including a former leader of the ruling Conservative Party, Iain Duncan Smith, have called for London authorities to raze towers across the city after a fire at the 24-storey social housing block killed at least 80 people. In the past decade, the UK capital has seen an explosion in the number of luxury apartment towers while more than 100 social housing blocks, many built in the 1970s to house Londoners on lower incomes, have faced demolition or privatisation. Four days after the blaze, London Mayor Sadiq Khan wrote in The Observer newspaper:  It may well be the defining outcome of this tragedy that the worst mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s are systematically torn down.  But architects and urban planning scholars condemned leaders' statements as opportunistic. After a meeting this week of architects, urban planning academics, and housing campaigners, Paul Watt, senior lecturer at London's Birkbeck College, said the large-scale demolition of towers cannot be justified by design failings. For early investigations into the fire show that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was a new addition to the building during a 2016 refurbishment. The addition aimed to improve insulation and improve the tower's appearance.  When you look at Grenfell Tower today, the only thing left standing is the 1970s structure,  said Geraldine Dening, co-founder of campaign group Architects for Social Housing.  The problems in Grenfell Tower were not the original building, and I think now is time for (social housing) residents to stand up and refuse to accept those statements.  Police have said they will consider manslaughter charges as part of a range of possible criminal offences committed by those responsible for the renovation at Grenfell.  Jumping to Conclusions  Members of the London Assembly - which works with London councils and the government on issues - passed a motion on Wednesday condemning the mayor for failing to attend meetings at City Hall since the fire. Sian Berry, chair of the London Assembly Housing Committee, said there needed to be an official response to the growing evidence that it was the refurbishment that caused the fire.  Jumping straight to that conclusion betrays an agenda of trying to demolish lots of council homes and push 'regeneration' that is, in the main, led by developers,  Berry said. London has historically remained a mostly low-rise city, but burgeoning demand for new housing and a loosening of regulations in recent years has seen plans for more than 300 new tall towers of over 20 stories in height, according to the Estates Gazette. Prior to construction of these new upmarket towers, most of the city's residential towers were low-cost housing. A 2015 London Assembly report showed local government demolition of social housing estates over the last decade has cut the number of homes rented a below market rates by more than 8,000. Due to the major upheaval to lives, the report advised demolition be a last resort if refurbishment was not possible. University College London, the parent institution of the capital's renowned Bartlett School of architecture, sent a letter to the mayor on Monday cautioning against premature demands for demolition of tower blocks.  The stigmatisation of social housing blocks has played a very negative role within the current housing crisis,  said the statement. Fire safety checks on towers across Britain, triggered by concerns over combustible cladding, have revealed wide-ranging fire safety failures on local government housing. This has prompted Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to establish an independent advisory group to examine tower safety across Britain. A city hall spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the mayor still supports the demolition of 1970s buildings where fire risks are found.  Everyone should be suitably protected from fire in their own home. If this is not possible in some blocks then they will need to be demolished and rebuilt,  the spokesman said.

While Macron likes to spend time talking about France as a  start-up nation , his government is using a time-honoured recipe of taxpayer cash and leaning on big companies it owns stakes in to rescue car parts supplier GM&S.; After weeks of seeking a buyer for GM&S;, the secretary of state for economic affairs, Benjamin Griveaux, is hopeful one has been found. But the deal involves the state stumping up 5 million euros ($5.7 million) to finance investments, with a further 5 million euros each from the buyer and carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, Griveaux said on Friday. Against that backdrop, Macron's government is left trying to appear neither impotent nor heavy-handed.  It's not up to the state to do everything, as that would be a bad handling of the case,  Griveaux told RTL radio.  It's also not up to the state to stump up the totality of the funds in this case. Its role is to get everyone involved and around the table.  Though Macron's economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has been instrumental in the efforts to save GM&S; from going under and preserve the 277 jobs on the line in the country's rural heartland, where work is scarce, the self-professed free-marketeer couldn't help but let out some irritation at a round table of business leaders last week.  It's typical of the French system. A company was set up in the 1970s in middle of the boondocks to bring activity to a region,  he said.  There is no industrial network around, there's only a few big clients for a small company. It's just not solid.  Originally a children's scooter maker, GM&S; soon adapted to supply mainly Renault and PSA with car parts but gradually became uncompetitive, leaving it clinging to any orders the two carmakers throw its way. The government, which holds sizeable stakes in both Renault and PSA, has also been convincing the carmakers to keep millions of euros of orders flowing to GM&S.; Even then, only 120 jobs are expected to be saved under the deal, which looks decidedly old-school, with the state playing a central role in corporate fortunes.  GM&S; was originally a corporate issue, but it has become a political issue. It's clear that the new government does not want to have to deal with corporate failure in the first weeks of its mandate,  said a source who knows the sector well. The French have for centuries looked to the state to help to shape key industries ranging from textiles in the 1700s to high-speed trains in the 1960s. But the failure of Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande to prevent the shutdown of the Florange steel mill in the eastern rustbelt and a PSA factory in a rundown Paris suburb proved to be an albatross around his neck throughout his presidency. As Hollande's economy minister, Macron had not hesitated to meddle in the running of some state-controlled companies, Renault and Peugeot in particular, while adopting a more laissez-faire attitude in other cases, such as Alcatel's takeover by Nokia.

Reports that the federal government had indications that the administration of President Donald Trump could terminate cooperation in the fight against tax havens and tax dumping and withdraw from the agreements on better regulation and control of financial markets are not correct,  a government spokeswoman said in a statement. The German magazine Der Spiegel reported, without citing its sources, that the U.S. administration had signalled it could discontinue multilateral cooperation on financial market regulation and tax havens. The magazine also said that Washington was threatening to slap tariffs on dozens of European products if Europe did not open its market to U.S. hormone-fed meat. G20 countries began coordinating on financial regulation and tax matters after the global financial crisis of 2008/9. Separately, officials confirmed to Reuters that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had sent her top economic adviser Lars-Hendrik Roeller to Washington for talks on Friday with U.S. officials. The trip amounts to a last-ditch bid to overcome differences on trade and climate change ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg, which will be held on July 7-8. Merkel acknowledged in a speech in the German lower house of parliament that there were stubborn differences with the Trump administration on trade and climate. Trump announced earlier this month that he would pull the United States out of a landmark international agreement to fight climate change. His administration is also threatening punitive trade measures on steel ahead of the G20 summit. In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman said regarding the dispute about U.S. hormone-fed meat and possible U.S. tariffs on European products that this was an ongoing internal U.S. review that U.S. authorities were formally obliged to carry out after receiving a request from the industry.  We take the issue very seriously and are committed to find an acceptable solution,  the spokesman said, adding Brussels was in contact with the U.S. administration on the issue.  The U.S. industry for its part has made clear it does not favour sanctions but a negotiated outcome,  he added.

Stocks closed slightly higher with rand hedged companies benefiting from the weaker currency. By 1515 GMT the rand had weakened 0.5 percent to 13.0800 per dollar, bring losses for the week to nearly 2 percent as simmering political and policy uncertainty made worse poor liquidity levels, that have in turn made holding the rand an even riskier bet. The rand tumbled to a session low of 13.1425, its weakest since May 31, as the greenback turned positive following a modest rise in consumer spending that hardened investor bets of more rate hikes before the end of the year. The local currency was wobbled by Finance Minister Malusi  Gigaba's comment that the country may require outside financial help, possibly from multilateral lenders like the IMF, to fund a widening budget shortfall and economic growth barely testing 1 percent. The combination of weak growth, a swelling debt burden, credit downgrades and a fraught political atmosphere since President Jacob Zuma's shock axing of Pravin Gordhan in March, have overshadowed the rand's high-yield carry trade potential.                       Trade volumes in the rand in June have been amongst the lowest in emerging market currencies, heightening the risk of sharp losses. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index rose 0.46 percent to 45,421 points, while the broader All-share index added 0.5 percent to 51,611 points.

From July, the globe-trotting sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jetliner market with Boeing, will report directly to Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, bypassing commercial aircraft president Fabrice Bregier, the people said. A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment. The surprise move, announced at a management dinner on Thursday, is part of a wider effort to streamline the company by uniting the headquarters with its dominant civil planemaking business, giving substance to a recent internal merger. But it is likely to raise questions about the coherence of the commercial planemaking operations and could revive speculation over the future of Frenchman Bregier, who has run the world's second-largest civil planemaker since 2012. The issue is not one of differing strategies, but the way responsibility is divided inside a company straining to keep a lid on tensions amid recent industrial and regulatory problems. Absorbing commercial sales, the powerful driver of Airbus's growth in past decades, will strengthen German-born Enders' grip on civil operations, which provide 74 percent of revenue. Bregier and Enders have long been rivals but had reached what was widely seen as a peace deal over the internal merger.  Bregier stepped aside from his role as chief executive of the Airbus civil business as Airbus combined with Airbus Group. But he remained in charge of the planemaking business as its president, while also becoming Enders' official no. 2 and chief operating officer of the overall group, now renamed Airbus. The decision to shift sales from Bregier's direct control raises uncertainty over the stability of the management deal and steers him toward a purely industrial role, a position the 56-year-old former missiles CEO is unlikely to relish indefinitely. Bregier could not be reached for comment. Sources caution it is too early to talk about a repeat of Franco-German tensions that rocked the group over a decade ago. FILE PHOTO: Fabrice Bregier (L), Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Enders (R), Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Group, at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse April 11, 2015.Adrien Helou/File PhotoBut any instability among top management would come at a sensitive time for Airbus as the company wrestles with supplier delays, growing concerns over A350 quality problems and an aggressive new marketing stance at rival Boeing. A senior company source said the shake-up was driven by  heavy operational challenges  and would  better balance the internal burden sharing  as Airbus becomes a normal company after ridding itself of complex internal structures this year. Inertia The shake-up comes as John Leahy, who propelled Airbus to equal status with Boeing, prepares to retire after 23 years running sales. He is expected to hand over to his designated internal successor, Kiran Rao, later this year. Whispers of a shake-up partly explain a sense of inertia as Airbus lost on orders to Boeing at last week's Paris Airshow. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders (R) speaks during a news conference on the aerospace group's annual results, in London, Britain February 24, 2016.Hannah McKayAlthough it won more orders than expected, many delegates said Airbus failed to display its usual self-confidence and agility as Boeing executed a polished new airplane launch.  Everybody feels lost (at Airbus),  one delegate said. The company has also been thrown off balance by British and French investigations into the use of middlemen in plane sales and a widening Austrian probe into a fighter sale. The chief executive of an aircraft buyer said Airbus was slower to react than before due to new internal processes. The challenge under the new structure will be to recapture  momentum while separating sales from core industrial operations, which have emerged as a key priority to fulfill record orders. By contrast, the sales teams for helicopters and defense will continue to report to the heads of those units. Bregier has taken an increasingly high-profile role in sales campaigns, forging relationships in Japan and elsewhere. He has been credited with improving Airbus's industrial performance, but has recently been distracted by delays at key suppliers. Enders overhauled Airbus's strategy after a failed defense merger in 2012 and has become a leading advocate for exploiting 'Big Data' to reshape the industry. But industry sources say he is less well known for a 'hands-on' approach to operations.  Speaking to media earlier this month, he praised  much flatter  management structures and said  old-style command and control  was ill-suited to the pace of change in a digital era.

The seven-member board unanimously authorized a bankruptcy filing at a public meeting in San Juan, granting a request by Governor Ricardo Rossello. But the board's executive director, Natalie Jaresko, stressed the panel would continue talks with creditors in hopes of reaching a deal with bankruptcy. “That may affect the timing” of an actual bankruptcy filing, Jaresko said. The board, created under the 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law, known as PROMESA, is in charge of managing the U.S. territory’s finances and helping it emerge from a crisis marked by $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate on the island and insolvent public pensions. PROMESA gave Puerto Rico and its agencies access to a workout process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, known as Title III. Some public entities, including Puerto Rico's central government itself, have already filed Title III cases. Friday’s vote on PREPA comes after nearly three years of restructuring talks between the utility and its creditors, and the unraveling of two separate deals. The most recent one, under which creditors would have accepted repayment cuts of 15 percent in exchange for new bonds backed by a charge on customer utility bills, was vetoed by the oversight board on Tuesday. The board said it wants to forge a new deal that would cap the charges on the bills. The decision rankled creditors and some U.S. lawmakers who believe PROMESA does not give the board authority to reject a deal negotiated outside the statute. Rep. Rob Bishop, who chairs the House committee in charge of U.S. territory issues, warned on Wednesday the board's rejection  poses more questions as to (Puerto Rico's) economic future and Congress will want answers to those questions.” Rossello requested a Title III process for PREPA on Friday morning, saying in a statement he wanted “to guarantee that PREPA’s services don’t see interruptions.”  Hopefully we're going to find some stability on a path to resolving, whether there is deal, no deal, Title III or what have you,  Rossello said on Thursday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSL1N1JR111"},

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said the group had managed to regain control over most of Raqqa's industrial district, but the SDF said fighting was limited to the edges of that area and the attack was repelled.  West of Raqqa, the Syrian army advanced on Friday, driving the group from its last territory in Aleppo province in a move that relieves pressure on an important government supply route, a Syrian military source said.  The SDF, a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab groups, took the industrial district this month in its biggest gain so far in Islamic State's de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa.  It said on Friday heavy clashes had taken place since late Thursday in east Raqqa, where the industrial district is located, in the areas of al-Rawdha, al-Nahdha and al-Daraiyah.  Related CoverageIslamic State withdraws from last area of Aleppo province: war monitorHowever, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State had regained control over most of the industrial area in fierce fighting.  The SDF, on its social media feed, acknowledged there had been intense clashes but said the whole industrial district was still in its hands and the attack had been thwarted.  Army Advance A Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter cries as medics treat his comrades injured by sniper fired by Islamic State militants in a field hospital in Raqqa, Syria June 28, 2017.Goran TomasevicThe army took the last stretch of the Ithriya-Rasafa road, part of the highway from Hama to Raqqa, forcing Islamic State to withdraw from a salient it held to the north, the military source and the Observatory said.  Islamic State had used that salient, an area containing a range of hills and a dozen villages, to mount frequent attacks on a different road linking Ithriya to Khanaser, part of the government's only available land route to Aleppo.  Slideshow (2 Images)The capture of the Ithriya-Rasafa road also shortens the Syrian army's route to its battlefront with Islamic State south of Tabqa, a possible route for its multi-pronged offensive to relieve the government's enclave in Deir al-Zor.  Although Islamic State has withdrawn from the salient east of Khanaser, the army has not yet combed the entire area, the Syrian military source said.      On Thursday, the Observatory said the SDF had managed to take the last stretch of the Euphrates' south bank opposite Raqqa, completely encircling Islamic State inside the city.  Since all Raqqa's bridges were already destroyed, and the U.S.-led coalition was striking boats crossing the river, the city had already been effectively isolated since May.  Naser Haj Mansour, a senior SDF official, told Reuters on Thursday he thought it could be  maybe more than a month or a month and a half  before the group took the city. Previous SDF timescales for its war on Islamic State have proven optimistic.  Beyond Raqqa, Islamic State still retains most of the 200km (130 mile) stretch of the Euphrates valley flowing to the border with Iraq. The Syrian army still holds a big enclave in Deir al-Zor, the area's largest city, on which it is slowly advancing from the direction of Palmyra.

Stocks closed slightly higher with rand hedged companies benefiting from the weaker currency. By 1515 GMT the rand had weakened 0.5 percent to 13.0800 per dollar, bring losses for the week to nearly 2 percent as simmering political and policy uncertainty made worse poor liquidity levels, that have in turn made holding the rand an even riskier bet. The rand tumbled to a session low of 13.1425, its weakest since May 31, as the greenback turned positive following a modest rise in consumer spending that hardened investor bets of more rate hikes before the end of the year. The local currency was wobbled by Finance Minister Malusi  Gigaba's comment that the country may require outside financial help, possibly from multilateral lenders like the IMF, to fund a widening budget shortfall and economic growth barely testing 1 percent. The combination of weak growth, a swelling debt burden, credit downgrades and a fraught political atmosphere since President Jacob Zuma's shock axing of Pravin Gordhan in March, have overshadowed the rand's high-yield carry trade potential.                       Trade volumes in the rand in June have been amongst the lowest in emerging market currencies, heightening the risk of sharp losses. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index rose 0.46 percent to 45,421 points, while the broader All-share index added 0.5 percent to 51,611 points. Shares of companies with operations abroad that make the bulk of their revenue outside South Africa ,and tend to benefit from a weaker rand, helped to lift the bourse.       The rand being weaker is helping the rand-hedged stocks,  said Sanlam Private Wealth director Greg Katzenellenbogen. Britain-based property company Capital & Counties rose 1.26 percent to 49.90 rand, luxury goods maker Richemont gained 1.49 percent to 108.17 rand, while British American Tobacco picked up 0.78 percent to 893.45 rand.

The plans include placing new shares expected to raise a minimum of $300 million at 32 pence per share, as well as a $220 million convertible bond offering, Hurricane said on Thursday. Hurricane, listed on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM), has seen its shares rise sharply since 2016 after it revised upwards resource estimates for its flagship field in the West Shetlands region, which it thinks could be Britain's largest undeveloped oil find. Hurricane shares were up 8 percent at the close of trading. The funds will go towards financing an early production system (EPS) to test the Lancaster field ahead of a full field development decision. The EPS is expected to produce 17,000 barrels of oil per day, Hurricane said. Production from Lancaster is expected to start in the first half of 2019. In April, Hurricane upgraded its recoverable resource estimate for the Lancaster field to 593 million barrels from 200 million in a 2013 assessment. Hurricane specialises in recovering oil from hard and brittle rock such as granite that was fractured through earthquakes, allowing oil to accumulate in what is known as fractured basement reservoirs. The Lancaster field development could be one of few major new projects in the UK North Sea which has seen production steadily decline since the late 1990s despite a revival in recent years. Hurricane's largest shareholder, private equity fund Kerogen Capital, has indicated it intends to subscribe in the placing in an amount of $35 million, Hurricane said. Cenkos Securities is acting as adviser and joint bookrunner to the company for the placing, along with Stifel Nicolaus. The company will hold a general meeting on July 21 to vote on the proposed placing and bond offering.

The seven-member board unanimously authorized a bankruptcy filing at a public meeting in San Juan, granting a request by Governor Ricardo Rossello. But the board's executive director, Natalie Jaresko, stressed the panel would continue talks with creditors in hopes of reaching a deal with bankruptcy.    “That may affect the timing” of an actual bankruptcy filing, Jaresko said.     The board, created under the 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law, known as PROMESA, is in charge of managing the U.S. territory’s finances and helping it emerge from a crisis marked by $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate on the island and insolvent public pensions.      PROMESA gave Puerto Rico and its agencies access to a workout process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, known as Title III. Some public entities, including Puerto Rico's central government itself, have already filed Title III cases.     Friday’s vote on PREPA comes after nearly three years of restructuring talks between the utility and its creditors, and the unraveling of two separate deals.      The most recent one, under which creditors would have accepted repayment cuts of 15 percent in exchange for new bonds backed by a charge on customer utility bills, was vetoed by the oversight board on Tuesday. The board said it wants to forge a new deal that would cap the charges on the bills.     The decision rankled creditors and some U.S. lawmakers who believe PROMESA does not give the board authority to reject a deal negotiated outside the statute.     Rep. Rob Bishop, who chairs the House committee in charge of U.S. territory issues, warned on Wednesday the board's rejection  poses more questions as to (Puerto Rico's) economic future and Congress will want answers to those questions.”     Rossello requested a Title III process for PREPA on Friday morning, saying in a statement he wanted “to guarantee that PREPA’s services don’t see interruptions.”       Hopefully we're going to find some stability on a path to resolving, whether there is deal, no deal, Title III or what have you,  Rossello said on Thursday.

The dollar was headed for its worst quarter in seven years against a basket of currencies. Expectations for stronger economic data in Europe and rate tightening at central banks around the globe has knocked the greenback from its perch, pushing it 4.7 percent lower for the April-June quarter, the worst performance since the third quarter of 2010. Against the euro, the dollar has sunk more than 7 percent for the quarter and is on pace to drop more than 2 percent this week. The euro shot to one-year highs after Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations that a reduction in stimulus measures would be signaled as soon as September. The dollar has fallen because of “doubts in the Fed raising rates again this year, the uncertain fate of Trump’s agenda, and number three has been how the global economy has been playing catch up to the U.S.,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were higher in late morning trading, while the Nasdaq was little changed as a recovery in tech stocks sputtered. Nike rose by as much as 8 percent after the world's largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com. U.S. consumer spending data for May also showed steady economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.54 points, or 0.29 percent, to 21,348.57, the S&P; 500 gained 4.76 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,424.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,150.23. U.S. Treasury yields rose after U.S. inflation data was largely in line with expectations and seen as unlikely to delay the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate hike path. “It’s not enough to make you optimistic about either delaying the Fed or about the potential for actual inflation,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes touched their highest since May 17 in earlier trading. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to its highest since mid-March and was set for its biggest weekly gain since 2015, backed by increased expectations for tighter monetary policy from the ECB. Money markets are pricing in around an 80-percent chance that the ECB will hike rates over the next year. That's up from just 20 percent earlier this month. The spectre of reduced stimulus from central bank policy makers also has weighed on European stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent on Friday and is headed for its biggest monthly loss in a year. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent, after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. It is up 5.3 percent for the quarter and has risen 18.3 percent this year. In commodities, U.S. crude added 0.75 percent to $45.28 a barrel in its seventh straight session of gains, bringing its weekly increase to over 5 percent. Global benchmark Brent crude gained 0.45 percent to $47.63 a barrel, poised for a nearly 10 percent rise this quarter.

LendUp said it had secured a strategic investment from the payments company on Wednesday. It did not disclose terms of the deal. PayPal confirmed in a statement that it had made an investment. LendUp also said that Carrie Dolan, the former chief financial officer of online lender LendingClub and treasurer of Charles Schwab Corp, has been appointed as an adviser to its board of directors.  Founded in 2012, LendUp is among the cohort of young tech-savvy companies that automate parts of the lending process to make it cheaper and faster to provide loans to consumers and small businesses online. Related CoverageFACTBOX - Fintech 'lingo' explainedIt seeks to differentiate itself by offering products that it believes can help consumers with low credit scores and volatile incomes achieve financial health. LendUp's chief executive, Sasha Orloff, said in an interview that the company was planning to use new injection of cash to expand its customer base and was also exploring ways it could work with PayPal. A PayPal employee demonstrates one of the company's options to pay with a mobile device at store within a PayPal office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014.Beck Diefenbach Dan Schulman has been very vocal about supporting the underserved,  Orloff said, referring to PayPal's chief executive. PayPal has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. LendUp describes its first product, LendUp Ladder, as an alternative to traditional payday loans. It carries a flat fee and allows users to borrow more if they earn points by paying back their loans on time or watching financial education videos. It also offers a credit card that does not require a security deposit.    The company, however, has been the subject of regulatory actions over its business practices. Last September the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered LendUp to pay $3.6 million in fines and refunds to customers over lending practices that took place from 2012 to 2014. The same month, the company agreed to pay $2.7 million in a settlement with the California Department of Business Oversight over allegations of illegal fees and violations of payday and installment lending laws. Orloff said that in its early days the company did not have the  team in place to understand the complexities of the financial services space,  but has since built up its legal and compliance team.

{"news_time":"2017-06-30 11:45:00","news_title":"Fintech lingo explained","keywords":"US,USA,FINTECH,EXPLAINER","sector":"","content":"The world of financial technology - also known as fintech –involves lots of buzzwords, jargon and often obscure terminology.  Here's a list of some of the industry's main lingo.  FINTECH: Or financial technology is the industry known for championing software and technology in the financial sector. A very broad term, it includes anything from a bank ATM, to software used to help spot manipulation of securities markets.  CRYPTOCURRENCY: A digital currency that relies on cryptography to validate and secure transactions. There are different types of cryptocurrencies - bitcoin and Ether are among the best known.  BITCOIN: A digital - or crypto - currency that enables payment in a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network not governed by any central authority or middleman.  BLOCKCHAIN: Software that first emerged as the system underpinning bitcoin. Also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), it is a shared record of information that is maintained and updated by a network of computers rather than a central authority. It is protected and secured by advanced cryptography.  ETHEREUM: A type of blockchain network. The bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains differ primarily in purpose and capability. While the bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of the digital currency bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain can be used to build decentralized applications. The virtual currency associated with Ethereum is called Ether.  P2P LENDING: Also known as social lending, peer-to-peer lenders run websites where borrowers can secure money directly from lenders bypassing banks.  SMART CONTRACTS: Software that runs on blockchain technology and can automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. A “smart bond”, for example would automatically make interest payments to investors.    ROBO-ADVICE: Financial advice given through the use of computer algorithms. Robo-advisors, also known as online investment managers, typically invest their clients’ money in portfolios made up of low cost exchange-traded funds.  INSURTECH: Inspired by the term fintech, insurtech champions the use of technology to modernize and improve the insurance business.  REGTECH: Or regulatory technology. The term refers to software and other technology aimed at helping financial services businesses comply with regulations efficiently and inexpensively, or regulators enforce rules.  OPEN BANKING: A term used to refer to the use of open APIs by banks to enable third party software developers to create applications and software using the bank’s data. APIs are application programming interfaces, a set of instructions and tools that enable software developers to create applications that can interact with another company’s systems. For example, by connecting to a bank’s API, a fintech startup could develop a mobile phone app that moves money in an out from the accounts of a bank’s customers, or simply lets them check their balance.  UNDERBANKED/UNBANKED: People or businesses that have little or no access to mainstream financial services. The World Bank estimates that there are 2 billion adults worldwide without access to formal financial services.  FINANCIAL INCLUSION: Term used to refer to financial products and services aimed at providing more affordable and mainstream options to the underbanked. In fintech, this often involves taking advantage of technology, such as mobile phones, to offer cheaper services to those who have been traditionally overlooked by banks and other financial firms.  ICO: Initial Coin Offering, or a token sale. The process or event in which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture and contributors receive tokens in return.  EQUITY-CROWDFUNDING: When people invest through a website in a company not yet listed on a stock exchange and receive back shares in the firm.  More generic terminology often heard in fintech spheres:  KYC: Or know your client/customer. A process to ensure businesses identify and verify the identity of their clients, for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes.  ENCRYPTION: The process of encoding messages. Once something has been encrypted, a key is required to turn that code back into useful data.  OMNI CHANNEL: A retail model that integrates different purchasing methods for customers such as online, by phone or in store. Omnichannel banking, for example, means offering banking across those three methods.  ACCELERATORS AND INCUBATORS: Organizations that select entrepreneurs or startups and offer them coaching, mentoring as well as exposure to potential clients and investors - often in exchange for an equity stake.

Speaking on behalf of all three countries, Bahrain's representative told the WTO's Goods Council the measures were  in accordance with Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which allows the usual rules to be broken for national security reasons, the official said. Reuters could not immediately find any precedent in the WTO's 22-year history of a country explicitly and formally citing the  national security exemption  to pre-empt a potential trade dispute. Some trade experts say that using national security as a defence risks weakening the WTO by removing the taboo and enabling countries to escape international trade obligations. On Thursday the head of Qatar's WTO office told Reuters that his country was exploring all legal avenues to challenge the  blockade , including a complaint to the WTO. He said that a national security defence could be challenged on the grounds of necessity and proportionality. The feud erupted this month when Qatar's three Gulf neighbours, together with Egypt, severed diplomatic and travel links with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the accusations. Qatar, which had asked for the issue to be discussed at the Council on Trade in Goods, following a similar debate at the Council on Trade in Services earlier this month, said the restrictions affected commercially important sectors such as aluminium. The UAE's representative said there were treaties against the funding of activities that threaten other countries' national security, and warned against the WTO intervening in the matter, the official who attended the meeting said. Egypt's representative also said the measures fell under  exceptional circumstances  and were therefore consistent with WTO rules. A U.S. trade diplomat said that all parties should remain open to negotiations, the trade official said, and that the United States would not get ahead of current diplomatic discussions and would continue to support the mediation efforts of the Emir of Kuwait. Turkey's representative at the meeting said Turkey hoped for a quick resolution, emphasising  hundreds years of fraternal and strong ties  among the countries involved.

It is unclear how Trump's withdrawal will affect U.S. targets to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions, she said. But it may create a major gap in funding to help poor countries protect themselves from the worst impacts of climate change, Robinson said in an interview Thursday. Many of these countries - especially in southern and eastern Africa - have been badly affected by severe drought, linked to the 2015/2016 El Nino weather pattern, that left millions of people in need of food aid. In some cases drought was followed by flooding.  Scientists now are warning that El Nino could return again this year. The United States, under former President Barack Obama's administration, promised to give $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, designed to help the poorest countries adapt to climate change and adopt clean energy systems. Of that, $1 billion was delivered before Obama left office. One June 1, Trump said he was halting U.S. contributions to the $10 billion fund, established as part of an international drive to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries, from public and private sources, by 2020. That decision  impacts hugely because it's all about support for building resilience , Robinson said - including resilience to  slow-onset  disasters such as longer and more frequent droughts. She said the Trump administration also has indicated it  will be reducing significantly  funding for government aid agency USAID and the State Department, both of which provide help to developing countries in building resilience to climate change shocks and pressures, she said. Fragile States The impacts of increasingly frequent and severe El Nino and La Nina weather patterns on countries already vulnerable to drought or rising sea levels can be  devastating , she said. In some cases, they could push countries  to the point of creating fragile states  said Robinson, who is president of a foundation seeking justice for people hit by climate impacts despite having contributed little to the problem.  The really worrying thing is a possible El Nino again this year, and so there is a real urgency at a time when there is also a sense of donor fatigue,  she said.     Efforts to deal with a flood of migrants to Europe also mean a lot of European funding that might otherwise have been focused on supporting developing countries is being diverted, she said.  Some of the migration, though, is driven in part by climate change impacts, which together with conflict make it harder for families to remain at home, she added.  When you have very severe drought people have to move ... and they move to cities or they move increasingly to places where they believe it will be possible to have a better life,  she said. At next week's G20 summit of major economies, which Trump will attend, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has prioritized three areas for discussion: climate change, free trade and mass migration.    They are of course linked,  said Robinson, who last year was a U.N. special envoy on El Nino and climate change, along with Macharia Kamau of Kenya.  One way to deal with migration pressures  would be to build (African countries') resilience to cope with climate change,  she said. Cutting funding to help vulnerable countries deal with climate change also will affect small island states that may need to resettle whole communities impacted by rising sea levels.  Fiji, for example, needs to move 100 villages - but the process is very difficult because people have to leave the place where they grew up and buried their families, Robinson said.  It goes further than that with indigenous peoples,  she said.  They have to leave the land of the bones of their ancestors.   There is still time to help communities find ways to move and carry their culture with them, including through virtual and digital means. But  that needs support , Robinson said.      u.s. Emissions Targets?                How Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement to combat climate change will impact U.S. targets to cut emissions remains unclear, Robinson said.         But  what President Trump has done is put climate on the American agenda in a way that it was never there before, and provoked a dynamic response from communities, business, civil society, philanthropy , she said.  That may mean that the emissions cuts that the Obama administration had committed the United States to may in fact be met,  she said. This level of response needs to happen in every country, she said.   Every city ... community, university, business needs to take responsibility for its share in how we implement the Paris Agreement,  she urged.

An acquisition offers a chance for bidders to grab control of Asia's biggest warehouse operator, which counts Amazon (AMZN.O) among its clients and is benefiting from rising demand for modern logistics facilities, driven by a boom in e-commerce business. Friday marked the deadline for parties to submit binding offers for GLP. Reuters was not able to confirm if more than two bids were submitted. At current valuations, a successful transaction will rank as the largest Asian buyout by private equity groups, which are  increasingly targeting bigger takeovers after raising record funds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Singapore-listed GLP was thrust into the spotlight late last year after sovereign wealth fund GIC, which owns a 37 percent stake, nudged it to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to the highest in more than three years. After months of negotiations with a special committee of GLP's independent directors, the race has narrowed to between a group led by Chinese private equity firms Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group, with the support of GLP CEO Ming Mei, and a rival consortium headed by Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood, the sources said. GLP, GIC, Warburg Pincus, Hopu, Hillhouse and a spokeswoman for the consortium declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the deal. Hopu's founder Fang Fenglei, one of China's best known dealmakers, is a GLP board member, and Hopu, partly owns GLP's China business. The Chinese consortium has also brought in co-investors such as property developer China Vanke (000002.SZ) and Ping An Insurance Group of China (2318.HK) for a bid for GLP, sources have said.     The management group and Warburg Pincus are the most serious bidders. Some other parties are keen on picking up specific assets and not the entire company,  said one source.    Concerns over the transparency of the sale process and business ties of the management-backed consortium have forced some potential bidders to re-evaluate their interest and sparked complaints to GIC, sources said.    Last week, GLP said it was in discussions with shortlisted bidders and had taken measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest following a Financial Times report that almost all the potential bidders were dropping out due to concerns an insider bid will make other submissions pointless.    Some of the potential bidders such as Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Asian buyout firm RRJ Capital were unlikely to submit individual bids, sources said. Blackstone declined to comment. RRJ did not respond to an emailed request for comment.    GLP owns and operates a $41 billion portfolio of industrial assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States. It gets two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has a dominant market position.    Around 20 lenders are working with three consortia in the hope of securing a role on the deal, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported last week.

Curious British children sometimes ask their parents the meaning of this statement, printed on every 20 pound note. Befuddled elders can find the answer in the excellent “Making Money: Coin, Currency and the Coming of Capitalism” by Christine Desan. The 2014 book covers English monetary history from Anglo-Saxon days to the beginning of modern times, with a conclusion that takes in some current issues. It turns out that the words on the bank note are the last remnants of a longstanding lie about paper money. The untruth is that currency is only worth as much as the gold or silver that it can buy. “Making Money” traces the history of the actual relationship between these valuable commodities, the coins used, and monetary accounts kept in England. British paper money started as a claim on the loan account from the Bank of England to the government. The shareholders of the BoE, which was a privately owned institution until 1946, worried that people would not accept the notes unless the government promised that they could be cashed in for gold coin. So like the father in the story of Rumpelstiltskin, who said his daughter could spin straw into gold, the BoE promised to turn paper money into precious metal. But there was no little man to perform miracles on Threadneedle Street. There was just a polite fiction. The store of gold was always far too small to match the issue of notes. In 1797, when too many people actually asked for gold, the BoE arranged for parliament to free it from the commitment to convertibility. The fiction of gold backing was restored in 1821, in what came to be known as the gold standard. The always-false promise of gold repayment was finally abandoned a little more than century later, leaving only the printed words to confuse attentive children. The presence or absence of gold pseudo-backing has no effect on the value of notes. That’s because the value of money does not come from any tangible commodity. It is always created and protected by some public authority, because the money system is deeply embedded in society. In other words, money is always and everywhere what Desan calls a governance project or a constitutional undertaking. A professor of law at Harvard University, she cites evidence from her own field and also from history and philosophy, with a bit of anthropology and sociology thrown in. Governance comes with governments. While private banks create most of the money supply these days, the ultimate political authority still provides the ultimate guarantee of monetary value. No other person or organisation can persuade people to accept a token which “must deliver value immediately… for strangers as well as friends, for those without trust or further contact as well as those who can reciprocate at a later time”.  Desan shows how the English system gradually changed. For centuries, people paid the government some quantity of gold or silver to turn the rest of their specie into state-approved coins. By the beginning of the 18th century it was the government which paid interest on debts that were converted into paper money, and which allowed bank accounts to be denominated in the same currency. Unlike coins of precious metal, the supply of the new gold-free money expanded along with England’s commercial and industrial economy. The journey from coins to accounts was marked by scandals, crises and depressions. Sometimes the government ignored or even abetted monetary excesses; sometimes it put disastrous limits on the supply of money. The path might have been smoother if more people had understood earlier that money was essentially man-made. Then again, public trust in what was actually fiat money may have been enhanced by Bank of England’s sincere belief in the untruth that this backing existed. Desan calls the gap between the belief and the reality “deeply ironic”. Though “Making Money” is a history, the past sheds light on some current questions: First, ridicule is the right response to suggestions that government-backed money could give way to gold or some private system using an electronic token. Money and states are too intimately entwined ever to be separated. Second, the control of money is political rather than technical. A central bank’s monetary policy requires essentially political judgments between debtors who welcome unexpected inflation and creditors who gain from stable prices. And there are no technocratic answers to the question of who should suffer when the monetary system goes wrong. Third, there is nothing natural or inevitable about letting profit-seeking private banks control the money supply. They only acquired this role through a historical accident, and they are excessively prone to economically damaging mood swings. Besides, financiers are probably the wrong group of people to entrust with a responsibility so central to the common good.  Finally, here’s some advice for BoE Governor Mark Carney. The next time you approve a new design for a banknote, get rid of the “promise to pay”.

Investors have ramped-up expectations for tighter monetary policy from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada after hints from officials this week. This has made the greenback less attractive, in addition to doubts that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year and that U.S. President Donald Trump could enact his pro-growth agenda. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was set to decline about 4.6 percent for the second quarter to mark its steepest quarterly percentage drop since the third quarter of 2010. The euro was set to gain more than 7 percent against the greenback for its biggest quarterly percentage gain since the third quarter of 2010. The euro has racked up about 2 percent of its gains and the dollar index has posted 1.6 percent of its losses this week alone.  What really gave the hawkish central banks extra punch was how it seemed to be a coordinated effort to signal a shift away from low-rate policies,  said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. He said improving economic growth in Europe and Canada opened the door for those comments and was  a reality check how the U.S. isn’t standing head and shoulders above everyone else.  The dollar index was last up 0.1 percent at 95.727, while the euro was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1412. The euro touched its strongest in nearly 14 months on Thursday of $1.1445, while the dollar index touched a roughly nine-month low of 95.470 early Friday. Analysts said Friday's bounce for the dollar came as some traders likely took profits on gains in the euro as well as the sterling. The dollar fell against the Canadian dollar, however, and was last at C$1.2985 after touching a nearly 10-month low of C$1.2948 earlier.  It appears as though the euro and the pound could be testing some resistance levels, and that could also contribute to...the profit-taking,  said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.

Nike shares rose as much as 9.4 percent to a three-month high after the world's largest footwear maker said it would launch a pilot program with Amazon.com to sell a limited product assortment on its website. The S&P; technology index was up 0.18 percent but was still on track to post its biggest weekly loss in six months as worries about the sector's valuation prompted investors to buy defensive stocks.  Tech has gone too far too fast and was due for a correction,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.  The sector's valuation is elevated but hasn't reached a point of extreme concern because it is still a 'buy-the-dip' sector and is expected to grow further.  A fall in bank shares also limited gains, with the financial sector down 0.1 percent. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were the biggest drags on the S&P; and the Dow. All three indexes are on track to post weekly losses. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1506 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 63.42 points, or 0.3 percent, at 21,350.45, the S&P; 500 was up 4.79 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,424.49. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.96 points, or 0.08 percent, at 6,149.31. With the Federal Reserve keen on further raising the interest rates this year despite inflation remaining below their 2 percent target, investors have been keeping an eye on economic data for clues on the state of the economy. Earlier in the day, data showed U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May while inflation cooled. Even so, another set of data showed the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at its lowest since November.  In the next four to six weeks we'll get another set of economic data that will tell us if the Fed is justified in raising rates again this year,  said Sandven. Towards the end of the second quarter, the market witnessed a few volatile days with the S&P; 500 and the Dow recording their worst daily percentage drop in about six weeks on Thursday. Oil prices climbed for the seventh straight session on Friday in their longest bull run since April, but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998.

Trump drew a barrage of criticism on Thursday, including from his fellow Republicans, after he called Mika Brzezinski, a co-host of the MSNBC  Morning Joe  program,  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and said she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited his Mar-A-Lago estate around New Year's Eve. He referred to her co-host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican U.S. congressman, as  Psycho Joe.  The two television anchors, who were on friendly terms with Trump early in the 2016 presidential campaign but have been critical of him since he took office, responded with a column in The Washington Post on Friday.  This year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas,  they wrote. Scarborough added on the  Morning Joe  show on Friday that he received calls from three top administration officials asking the co-hosts to call Trump and apologize for their coverage of his administration. They told him that if he called and apologized, Trump would get the story killed, Scarborough said.  The calls kept coming, and kept coming. And they were like 'Call, you need to call. Please call. Come on, Joe. Just pick up the phone and call him,'  Scarborough said.  That's blackmail,  said MSNBC panelist Donny Deutsch. In a Twitter message on Friday, Trump effectively denied the allegation, giving a different version of what transpired around the National Enquirer piece.  Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time. FAKE NEWS. He called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no! Bad show,  he wrote. There was no immediate comment from the National Enquirer. The tabloid specializes in scandalous stories about celebrities and has been supportive of Trump. In the Post column, Brzezinski and Scarborough lambasted Trump as mentally unstable, saying he had an  unhealthy obsession  with their television program, and cited what they called his continued mistreatment of women. On the  Morning Joe  show, Brzezinski, a daughter of former White House national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, said her main concern was how such behavior affects the country.  I am very concerned as to what this once again reveals about the president of the United States,  said Brzezinski, who is engaged to be married to Scarborough. Trump uses Twitter prolifically and often as a vehicle to attack critics, including the  Morning Joe  hosts, but Thursday's tweets were seen by many as offensive. Brzezinski and Scarborough dismissed as lies Trump's claims, made in the Thursday Twitter messages, that he refused to have dinner with them or that Brzezinski had had a face lift. They also said they had seen a change in the president over the last few years.  President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. America’s leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president,  they wrote in the Post column.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel defended the move given serious differences between the two allies over a range of issues, including the jailing of a German-Turkish journalist, but said Germany remained committed to mending ties with Turkey. He also said he believed Germany should have responded with more  emotional  solidarity to last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey, a point repeatedly made by Turkish leaders.  I think we made a mistake,  he said.  There are big differences that aren't easy to overcome, but I want to say this expressly, we are looking forward to President Erdogan's visit to the G20 summit,  Gabriel said. Turkey lashed out on Thursday at German politicians for opposing Erdogan's planned public appearances in Germany.  It is regrettable that some politicians in Germany are making unacceptable comments with domestic political calculations,  Turkey's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Huseyin Muftuoglu, said in a statement.

Turkey is frustrated about Germany's refusal to extradite military officers and others who have sought asylum in Germany.

He said Germany's decision to ban political speeches by politicians from all non-European Union member states for three months before elections in those countries mirrored similar restrictions in place for German politicians at home.  We have no interest in escalation, but we also have to be sure that our peaceful coexistence isn't threatened,  he said.

Brazil's consolidated public sector, which includes federal and local governments and state-owned companies, posted a primary budget deficit of 30.736 billion reais ($9.30 billion) last month, the largest-ever for May in the series dating back to 2001, the central bank said. The deficit was larger than market forecasts for a gap of 21.05 billion reais and followed a budget surplus of 12.9 billion reais in April. The deficit in the 12 months through May reached 157.7 billion reais, equivalent to 2.47 percent of gross domestic product and above the official target for a deficit of 143.1 billion reais for this year. Treasury Secretary Ana Paula Vescovi on Thursday told journalists the deficit widened mainly due to a decision to service judicial debts ahead of schedule, a move she said would help save between 600 million and 700 million reais this year.

They are held in locations that are easily shielded from demonstrators. And policy differences are papered over by envoys behind closed doors well ahead of time. But the G20 meeting in Hamburg next week will be different. Host German Chancellor Angela Merkel has taken a high-risk gamble by choosing to hold the summit in the center of the northern port city, partly to show the world that big protests are tolerated in a healthy democracy. This has created a huge challenge for police. On the policy front, she is determined not to surrender too much ground to U.S. President Donald Trump on climate change, trade and migration, possibly setting the scene for an unusual public clash.         Quite honestly, it is hard to know what will happen in Hamburg,  said a senior German official who has been involved in the preparations and who declined to be identified.  It will not be a summit of great unity, that's for sure.    The biggest concern is security,  the official said.  If we have another Genoa, it will be a failure,  the official added, referring to the 2001 G8 summit in which protesters engaged in violent clashes with police. One person was shot dead and hundreds were injured. The stakes are high at the July 7-8 summit for Merkel, who is in the midst of a federal election campaign and can ill afford images of chaos and disharmony. Her relations with three of the most high-profile participants, Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, are strained. Trump and Putin will be meeting face-to-face for the first time, an encounter which will be intensely scrutinized and could overshadow the entire summit. Merkel chose Hamburg, the city where she was born before her father moved the family to communist East Germany, to send a message of openness. It was the nightclubs of Hamburg, which traces its history back to mediaeval times and was badly bombed in World War Two, that helped to launch the Beatles. The city is one of the biggest trading hubs in Europe. It is home to some of Germany's biggest media groups and perhaps its most potent symbol of left-wing dissent, the Rote Flora, a former theater in the city's Sternschanze district that has been occupied by anti-capitalist squatters for nearly three decades. An additional incentive for Merkel, an avid opera fan, was the opportunity to show off Hamburg's new architectural marvel, the Elbphilharmonie concert hall, where G20 leaders will gather for dinner on the first evening of the summit.  Welcome to Hell  Ahead of the summit, the German government has played up the fact that protesters will be allowed to voice their opposition to the event. The message to leaders like Trump, Putin and Erdogan is clear: tolerance for public dissent is a cornerstone of a confident, open democracy.  We are a country where people have a right to demonstrate,  said Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert.  Every citizen has a right to protest. And that counts for the G20 too.  That message has put huge pressure on German police. If they cannot keep the peace, Hamburg officials have acknowledged, it will amount to a defeat for Merkel in her own backyard. Some 20,000 police, with dogs, horses and helicopters and 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles) of steel barriers will be deployed. Police forces guard the fair ground, where the upcoming G20 summit will take place, in Hamburg, Germany, June 28, 2017.Fabian BimmerPolice will be facing off against tens of thousands of protesters who plan to encircle the convention center in the heart of the city where leaders will meet - a far cry from Schloss Elmau, the idyllic, isolated retreat in the Bavarian Alps where Germany held a G7 summit two years ago. Security officials say that up to 8,000 of the demonstrators will be anarchists and left-wing radicals whose main goal is to disrupt the summit. They are planning a protest on the eve of the G20 that they have dubbed  Welcome to Hell .  The policies of the G20 have created hellish conditions in many countries around the world,  Andreas Blechschmidt, one of the organizers of the July 6 protest, told Reuters in front of the Rote Flora, which stands just a few hundred meters from the site where the leaders will meet.   We want to show them that we can turn up the heat too,  he said. Behind him, a large banner reading  Capitalism will end anyway, you decide when  hung from the graffiti-covered squat. Other protests will be held on July 7 and 8. Police are also worried about clashes between supporters of the Kurdistan Wokers Party (PKK), the militant group engaged in an armed struggle against the Turkish state, and Turkish nationalists who support Erdogan.  More so than Trump, the presence of Erdogan is mobilizing people across Europe,  said Werner Raetz, a veteran German activist involved in the planning of the G20 protests. Climate, Trade, Migration  On policy however, the German government views Trump and his  America First  doctrine, as its biggest headache. At previous G20 summits, a broadly united West led by the United States and Europe would push countries like Russia, China, India and Brazil to follow its lead. But since Trump entered the White House, the Western consensus has broken down. Trump ignored pleas from his Western allies at a G7 summit in Sicily last month and announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord. His administration has been threatening countries like Germany and China with punitive trade measures on steel in the run-up to the G20. Washington even appears to be backtracking on language pledging to  fight all forms of protectionism  that Trump approved at the G7, say German officials, who list migration as another source of contention. On both climate and trade, Merkel's best ally in Hamburg may prove to be Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet her in Berlin before the summit.  Everything is open,  said Ulrich Speck, senior research fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute think-tank in Brussels.  There is not a clear Western position. It's a big change in the international landscape.  A decade ago, at a G8 summit in Heiligendamm on Germany's Baltic coast, Merkel managed to coax President George W. Bush - who like Trump had pulled out of a global climate pact shortly after taking office - into supporting a new climate deal with substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. In the aftermath, German media anointed her  Gipfelkoenigin , or queen of summits, for her ability to forge sensitive compromises between leaders with disparate views. But in a speech to the Bundestag lower house of parliament on Thursday, Merkel acknowledged that no such compromises were likely in Hamburg.  These will not be easy talks,  she said.  The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they aren't there. I simply won't do this.

Trump and a small group of his advisers made clear at a meeting of top officials at the White House on Monday that they want to impose tariffs on steel and likely other imports, according to a report from news website Axios that cites anonymous sources. The report cautioned that no decision has been made. Steel coils at the ThyssenKrupp Steel USA factory are pictured in Calvert, Alabama November 22, 2013.

U.S. Steel Corp and Nucor Corp rose about 1 percent each, while AK Steel Holding edged up 0.2 percent. The report comes as the Trump administration said on Thursday that the president would use a national security review of the domestic steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global market.

Trump's election initially boosted steel stocks, with the S&P; 1500 steel index surging 36 percent in the month after the Nov. 8 vote.

The deal, which came four days later than originally planned, became the year's highest yielding junk bond in euros from a Single B borrower when it priced on Thursday. The bond came with a 9% coupon but at a two-point discount to par, giving a yield of 9.519%. Manutencoop had to widen pricing substantially during the execution process. Investors on Tuesday said the transaction would come with a 9% yield, already the wide end of the 8.75%-9% range heard on June 23 - the date the deal was originally slated to price. The only official guidance put out by leads was the final yield. That yield was a good 150bp more than the previous highest this year from a Single-B name: a five non-call three senior secured from Travelex in late April. As with that Travelex trade, Manutencoop - a facilities management outfit - also had to sweeten the terms of its deal in favour of investors, who pushed back on the original structure given the Italian company's involvement in three lawsuits. The five-year senior secured notes were cut to €360m from the initial €420m proposed when the deal was mandated on June 21, and call protection was extended to three years from two. The deal's covenants were also amended, with a 10% call at 103 and portability clauses removed from the documents. Other leverage-dependent covenants were amended to cut the level of debt the company will be allowed to take on. Challenges A banker at one of the leads said the main challenges were investor concerns around the lawsuits. Certainly, many investors told IFR that they were avoiding it due to these legal risks.  How can you be sure that it isn't the tip of the iceberg? It's endemic,  one said, while a second investor recalled that the company has had major contracts pulled in the past. The company is involved in two investigations for alleged antitrust violations and bribery. Manutencoop also said last month that it had been formally excluded by Italian procurement agency Consip from cleaning tenders for barracks and public hospitals. It is appealing a third antitrust violation decision, having been fined €14.7m following an Italian competition authority decision in 2015. Misread Sentiment The deal was announced following an investor meeting to provide clarification on the lawsuits. But sources said the leads had misread investor sentiment in bringing the deal.  Maybe the banks had a bit too much confidence in the market,  said a third investor. Sources also found it odd that the company proceeded with the deal despite ending up with a higher coupon than the bond that is being refinanced.  Given their bonds have a 2020 maturity, why would you replace it with a higher coupon today?  asked the first investor. The refinanced deal - a €300m 2020 senior secured issue - carries an 8.5% coupon. However, the lead said such criticisms were misleading due to the additional leverage being added by the transaction, which is extending the issuer's curve. As well refinancing the 2020s, proceeds will be used to buy back minority shares held by private equity sponsors, which the lead said was important to the company in order to pursue its long-term plans. Pricing Power The deal is a further sign that pricing power in the high-yield market on both sides of the Atlantic is slowly turning around. Companies have been able to dictate terms in recent months as a general lack of supply has left investors as price-takers. And while that generally remains the case, examples such as Manutencoop and Travelex in Europe, and Norwegian oil company Aker and cable operator Charter Communications in the US show that investors are fighting back in certain circumstances. Aker downsized a proposed US$500m deal to US$400m this week, while Charter Communications pulled a US$1.5bn deal last week, returning instead through a split-rated entity. JP Morgan (B&D;) and UniCredit were joint books.

A cap would be aimed at bridging the gulf between Europe's wealthiest clubs and the rest of the field, as well as preventing the top teams from stockpiling players on their payrolls.  The wealthiest clubs are only getting richer and the gap between them and the rest is getting bigger,  UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin told Mladina, a weekly magazine based in Ljubljana.  In future, we will have to take into serious consideration the possibility of limiting clubs' budgets for players' wages,  he added, without specifying a timeframe. On the issue of bloated squads, he said many leading clubs bought players they don't need  and who end up playing nowhere .   The introduction of a salary cap would force clubs to be more rational. It will be a big battle and winning it would in my opinion represent an historic change.  UEFA introduced Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, designed to prevent clubs from spending more than their generated revenue, in 2012.     But it softened the rules three years later to try to encourage new and sustainable investment in European club soccer. Ceferin, who succeed Michel Platini as UEFA president in September after the former France international was banned from all football-related activities for ethics violations, also said the organization had no plans yet to introduce video assistance in matches. The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system is currently being trialled at the Confederations Cup in Russia as a dry run for next year's World Cup.  VAR will require a lot of testing to convince me,  the 49-year old Slovenian said.  We do not reject technology but UEFA has no plans yet to introduce the Video Assistant Referee. Granted, the goalline technology has panned out nicely despite its many critics.  However, we must not destroy the game's flow by letting the action get held up for several minutes every 10 minutes.  VAR has been used frequently at the Confederations Cup, where world champions Germany and South American champions Chile meet in Sunday's final in St Petersburg. The system has helped referees make the correct decision in most cases but has also been criticized as disruptive by some fans and pundits.

United Launch Alliance, which previously had a monopoly on launches, has not won a competition with SpaceX since the company won a contract for an Air Force launch business with a contract award in 2016.

The data, released by the Commerce Department on Friday, bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter, although a separate report showed a gauge of consumer confidence fell in June to its lowest level since November. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.1 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 1.4 percent on a yearly basis, compared to a 1.5 percent gain in April. Yields on U.S. government debt rose and U.S. stock prices rose after the spending data was published. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies. Some Fed policymakers are worried that inflation may fall further below the central bank's 2 percent target, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen said earlier this month that inflation would likely be soft in the coming months due to temporary factors.  Solid consumer spending is supporting the outlook for faster inflation and continued economic growth. The slower spending growth in May followed two monthly increases of 0.4 percent, which suggests economic growth is on track to accelerate in the second quarter after a meager expansion in the first three months of the year.  It still looks like real consumption picked up lately,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent in May from April, dragged lower by drops in prices for consumer goods and energy. When food and energy were excluded, the index was up 0.1 percent. The 12-month reading for the so-called core inflation has been slowing since March. The slowdown in inflation has boosted consumer spending power. After-tax personal income adjusted for inflation rose 0.6 percent in May, the largest gain since April 2015. Even so, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 95.1 this month, its lowest since November, according to a final reading for the gauge published on Friday. The index has been rising more or less steadily since 2008 and in November it hit its highest level since before the 2007-09 recession.

The removal of the restriction allows foreigners to take part in the IPO of Vodacom Tanzania Plc, a subsidiary of South Africa's Vodacom Group.  The restrictions on participation of non-Tanzanian investors in the initial public offers of telecommunication companies have been removed,  the Capital Markets and Securities Authority said in a statement sent to Reuters. The issuer is expected to announce soon how it will conduct the IPO and provide information on the listing date, it said. The Vodacom IPO was launched in March and initially only open to local investors, but take-up was slow. Vodacom Tanzania extended the offer period for its IPO in April by three weeks amid concerns about adequate liquidity in the local market. The delayed results of the IPO have not been announced but Friday's announcement could mean the initial share sale was undersubscribed although more than 40,000 local retail investors bought shares. Tanzania's telecom operators are required by law to have 25 percent local ownership via IPOs at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). The government hopes the listings will bring more transparency and offer the public a share in the industry's profits. Two other major telecoms operators, Millicom subsidiary Tigo and a local unit of India's Bharti Airtel , have also submitted prospectuses to the regulator and are awaiting approval for their IPOs. Tanzania posted a 0.9 percent annual increase in the number of mobile phone subscribers in 2016 to 40.17 million. As in other African countries, mobile phone use has surged over the past decade, helped by the launch of cheaper smartphones. Foreign-owned mining companies are also required to list a 30 percent stake on the local stock exchange by Aug. 23. However, investors may be wary of a set of new laws expected to be passed by Tanzania's parliament next week that let the government tear up and renegotiate natural resources contracts. The introduction of the draft laws on Thursday follow months of wrangling between President John Magufuli and mining companies, which produce 3.5 percent of Tanzania's gross domestic product.

Rite Aid said on Thursday it would sell nearly half its U.S. stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) after the drugstore operators agreed to scrap a whole-sale merger. Wall Street showed its displeasure at the new deal, pushing Rite Aid's shares down 30 percent to a near four-year low after the announcement. The stock added to its losses, falling 7 percent on Friday. Rite Aid has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business, which sells prescription drugs, as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressure for generics has intensified.  I think Rite Aid is going to struggle to remain relevant in the pharmacy industry,  said Adam Fein, president at Pembroke Consulting, which tracks the drug distribution industry.  The pharmacy industry has become hyper competitive and it favors either large teams or nimble independents, and Rite Aid is buck in the middle and doesn't have geographic scale anywhere, except in the North East and the West Coast.  But it's not all bad news for the company. Under the new deal, Rite Aid will gain access to Walgreen's centralized sourcing system, allowing it to procure generic drugs at low costs for 10 years and giving its pharmacy margins a much-needed boost. Walgreens, the No. 1 drugstore chain in the country, has a sourcing contract with AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), the second-largest U.S. drug distributor, giving the alliance  bargaining clout against drugmakers. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walgreens is seen at their Times Square store in New York December 17, 2012.Andrew Kelly/File Photo We estimate more favorable generic procuring costs could provide 3-5 percent of saving on RAD's total generic spend,  Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. Leaner and Meaner? Still, being left with only half its stores will be punishing on economies of scale for Rite Aid, which is already struggling to turn a profit, said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Rite Aid on Thursday posted a much bigger quarterly loss, mainly because of a drop in same-store sales due to low reimbursement rates. This was the company's third loss in the past five quarters. EBITDA margins for the company fell to an average of 3.4 percent in fiscal 2017 ended March 31, from 4.8 percent in 2013. In contrast, Walgreens' EBITDA margins have averaged 7.3 percent on average for first three quarters of fiscal 2017, which ends in August, from 6.9 percent for the whole of 2013. Rite Aid, however, said the deal would make it a smaller but stronger company, helping it address pharmacy margin challenges and significantly cut its debt - over $7 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Selling roughly half its stores will leave Rite Aid more reliant on its pharmacy benefit management business, which maintains formularies, or preferred drugs lists, negotiates rebates with drugmakers, and processes prescription drug claims.  We think this will benefit RAD from a valuation perspective as we estimate that PBMs trade at a premium to drug retailers, by about a couple of turns in our view,  Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. The smaller company could also be an attractive buyout target for a private equity firm or a rival such as Fred's Inc (FRED.O), which was to buy some assets that would have been divested under the previously planned Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, analysts said.

Despite a rapid post-war revival, the withdrawal comes as rights groups warn a failure to tackle impunity and reform its fractured, mutiny-prone army threatens the long-term stability of French-speaking West Africa's largest economy.  The Secretary-General congratulates the people and government of (Ivory Coast) for their determination and efforts in turning the page of crisis and conflict,  a spokesman for U.N. chief Antonio Guterres said.   The mission, known as UNOCI, was established in 2004, two years after a failed coup attempt set off Ivory Coast's first civil war, which split the country between northern rebels and troops loyal to then President Laurent Gbagbo.  It was tasked with guiding the country, the world's top cocoa grower, to a presidential election, which, following several postponements, took place in late 2010 with around 9,000 U.N. troops in place. Gbagbo attempted to void results in the north and negate the run-off victory of his opponent Alassane Ouattara, who had been held up as a symbol of northern political and social exclusion.  UNOCI head Choi Young-jin, who had been mandated to validate the poll results, declared Ouattara the winner, and the majority of the international community recognized him as president.  When Gbagbo refused to step down, U.N. peacekeepers and French soldiers backed pro-Ouattara rebel fighters. The headquarters of the United Nations Operation in Ivory Coast, which shut down on June 30, is seen at the Sebroko District, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast June 30, 2017.Thierry GouegnonAround 3,000 people died in the ensuing civil war before Gbagbo was captured in April 2011. He is now on trial at the International Criminal Court accused of crimes against humanity. Uncertain Future Under the leadership of Ouattara, who won a second five-year term in 2015, Ivory Coast has emerged as Africa's fastest-growing economy, attracting interest from international investors.  However, UNOCI's closure, which comes amid a U.S.-driven push to slash the U.N. peacekeeping budget, follows a wave of army mutinies that have exposed the government's tenuous grip on its military, cobbled together in the wake of the war. Analysts and diplomats fear further unrest as Ivory Coast heads towards another presidential election in 2020 to choose a successor to Ouattara, who will have reached his two-term limit.  The peace dividends the (U.N.) has contributed to could be reversed unless the Ivorian government addresses pervasive immunity and the army's lack of discipline,  said Drissa Traore, vice-president of the International Federation for Human Rights.  Amnesty International said at least 10 people were killed and dozens wounded in mutinies that erupted in January when 8,400 former rebels now serving in the army rose up demanding bonus payments.  They twice forced the government to capitulate, in January and again in March, after violence spread to towns and cities across the country. In total, it eventually paid the soldiers 12 million CFA francs ($20,681) each.  Inadequate progress in addressing a longstanding culture of impunity, reforming the security forces, and strengthening rule of law institutions threaten the country's long-term prospects for peace and development,  Human Rights Watch said.

The raids were part of a major security sweep by the army in an area that has been a flashpoint for violent spillover from the Syria crisis, and several Islamic State officials were among some 350 people detained, a security source said.  The defense minister was quoted as saying the incident showed the importance of tackling the refugee crisis - Lebanon is hosting over 1 million refugees - and vindicated a policy of  pre-emptive strikes  against militant sleeper cells.  Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad in his fight against insurgents, said the raids complemented its own fighters' campaign to stop militants entering Lebanon from Syria. Related CoverageHezbollah says army manhunt in Syrian refugee camps protects border security What is needed today is to unify efforts more and more to fill all the gaps that terrorists can infiltrate from to protect Lebanon and its people from the big dangers that target it,  the Hezbollah statement said.  There has been frequent fighting between the army and militants dug into the hills around Arsal in a large pocket of territory straddling the border. A Lebanese army statement said one suicide bomber had detonated his explosive laden belt in front of an army patrol during a manhunt for suspected militants in a refugee camp in the northeastern border town. Three soldiers were wounded.

During the raids an explosive device blew up while four other explosive devices were defused, it said. The U.N. refugee agency says Lebanon hosts more than 1 million registered Syrian refugees - constituting a quarter of its population.  The government puts the number at 1.5 million. They are scattered across the country in informal tented settlements where many face the risk of arrest due to lack of legal residency that they struggle to obtain.  The Lebanese army has in recent months stepped up raids in the makeshift camps built on the edge of Arsal, where refugees live in squalid conditions. The manhunt inside the sprawling camps on the border area came after intelligence reports that militants were preparing to stage a series of attacks inside Lebanon.  The camps around the town have long been a haven for militants coming from Syria who have clashed with Lebanese forces conducting security raids searching for suspects hiding among the refugees.  The militants briefly overran the town in 2014 in a battle that killed dozens and marked one of the more serious spillovers of the Syrian conflict in Lebanon.     A number of attacks in Lebanon in recent years have been linked to the war in Syria.

The data, released by the Commerce Department on Friday, bolstered the view that the U.S. economy is rebounding in the second quarter, although a separate report showed a gauge of consumer confidence fell in June to its lowest level since November. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.1 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 1.4 percent on a yearly basis, compared to a 1.5 percent gain in April. Yields on U.S. government debt rose and U.S. stock prices rose after the spending data was published. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies. Some Fed policymakers are worried that inflation may fall further below the central bank's 2 percent target, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen said earlier this month that inflation would likely be soft in the coming months due to temporary factors.  Solid consumer spending is supporting the outlook for faster inflation and continued economic growth. The slower spending growth in May followed two monthly increases of 0.4 percent, which suggests economic growth is on track to accelerate in the second quarter after a meager expansion in the first three months of the year.  It still looks like real consumption picked up lately,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent in May from April, dragged lower by drops in prices for consumer goods and energy. When food and energy were excluded, the index was up 0.1 percent. The 12-month reading for the so-called core inflation has been slowing since March. The slowdown in inflation has boosted consumer spending power. After-tax personal income adjusted for inflation rose 0.6 percent in May, the largest gain since April 2015. Even so, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 95.1 this month, its lowest since November, according to a final reading for the gauge published on Friday. The index has been rising more or less steadily since 2008 and in November it hit its highest level since before the 2007-09 recession.

Novomatic, which makes slot machines and other gambling equipment and technology and also runs gambling halls, may officially announce its listing plans in autumn and could be valued at up to 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) in a stock market listing, they said. The company is keen to take advantage of currently buoyant equity markets, but also wants to see how new gambling rules in Germany -- one of its most important markets -- play out. Novomatic is preparing for the changes in the market, among other things by raising money in the IPO to fund investments and acquisitions. From July 1, gambling halls will need to be 100-500 meters apart from each other, depending on individual regulation in the German regional states. Separately, each hall will no longer be able to get multiple licences, but only one licence to host up to 12 gambling machines. Dirk Uwer, gambling regulation expert at law firm Hengeler Mueller, said disputes over whether gambling halls must close as a result of the new rules could take years to solve in court.  For suppliers of gambling technology this means they will likely be able to sell fewer machines in Germany in the future,  he said. The bulk of the shares to be sold in the IPO, which will see Frankfurt as the primary and Vienna as the secondary listing location, will be newly issued ones, people close to the matter said. Novomatic is working with Bank of America and Credit Suisse as global coordinators on the IPO with the help of UBS, UniCredit, Commerzbank as bookrunners. Skadden is acting as legal advisor and Macquarie as independent IPO advisor. Novomatic, owned by the family of its billionaire founder Johann Graf, also operates casinos and a network of sport betting shops. There are no directly-comparable listed peers, with companies such as Aristocrat, IGT and Scientific Games specialising in gambling equipment and others such as William Hill and 888 focused on handling bets. Novomatic is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than 600 million euros this year, the sources said. A valuation of roughly 6 billion euros would make it one of the biggest ever IPOs of an Austrian company. Novomatic was not immediately available for comment.

The US$732.2bn of leveraged loans issued in the first half, a 92% spike above the US$380.7bn during the same time a year ago, boosted overall syndicated volume to US$1.22trln, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Total volume leaped almost 20% from the prior half, 27% from the year-ago half, and 14% from the previous six-month high set in the first half of 2014. Leveraged loans to companies cutting expenses and improving terms far overshadowed lending to support mergers and acquisitions. Bankers say M&A; activity will ramp up as the legislative logjams around US healthcare, tax and trade policies are broken. “The second half should be more of the same in terms of volume, but the composition could change to a lower percentage of refinancing and more M&A;, assuming things normalize a bit,” said Art de Pena, managing director and head of distribution, trading and agency at MUFG’s syndications group. “That will be a function of, hopefully, political stability, that will help to spur M&A; and economic growth,” he said. In the meantime, issuance has been skewed by borrowers that often returned to the leveraged loan market repeatedly within months to get more favorable pricing with limited investor push-back until recent weeks. Less than 30% of the leveraged loans issued in the first half of the year represented new financing. Up the Amazon A reluctance of corporations to pull the trigger on big M&A; deals without more clarity on tax, trade and other legislation has also pressured lending to investment-grade companies.  The likely M&A; catalyst in investment grade would be policy certainty -- lower corporate tax rates, repatriation etc -- coupled with a continuation of the current environment of slow revenue growth, high equity markets, low volatility and low interest rates,  said Matthew Daly, head of credit research at investment management firm Conning. “Certainly the debt markets are very accommodative right now for financing.” Companies that did announce mergers were less likely to face antitrust rulings that scuttled several major US insurance company tie-ups earlier this year. A push for growth in a slow growing economy was the incentive to acquire a rival or a company with a complimentary line of business. The US$371.8bn of investment-grade loans issued in the first half was about 18% lower than the US$451.9bln in the first half of last year. Lending volume kicked up a notch after US drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc in April announced a deal to buy Medtronic Plc’s medical supplies unit for US$6.1bn, agreeing to a US$4.5bn bridge loan before locking in longer-term debt. “Most of the deals have been tack-ons or tuck-ins, which reflects the fact that equity values are at all time highs and companies are skittish about entering into a merger agreement with the legislative uncertainty,” a senior banker said. Now, lenders are assessing whether Amazon.com’s late June deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Markets for US$13.7bn, to be supported by a bridge loan of up to the same amount not yet included in the issuance tally, can light a fire under other dealmakers later this year. “A lot of people are taking a fresh look at A + B = C, meaning what can you combine with a tech company to have a leg up and a marketing advantage,” the banker said. “I would suggest that’s not just limited to supermarkets, it could be any number of different products.” Leveraging Up With demand surpassing supply, arrangers are boosting debt taken to back large leveraged buyouts to levels last seen in the final quarter of 2014, according to LPC. Expectations that the Trump administration could loosen leveraged lending guidelines, updated by regulators in 2013 to thwart potential systemic risk, are also enabling leverage levels to creep higher. Total leverage on broadly syndicated large buyouts averaged 6.39 times total debt to Ebitda in the second quarter. That tops the 6 times level that draws regulatory scrutiny, though remains below the post-crisis peak almost three years ago of about 7 times. Investor demand, for now, remains unrelenting. Collateralized Loan Obligation funds, the largest buyers of leveraged loans, have issued almost US$50bn so far this year, 90% more than the same period last year.

But this year they are set for their best first half since 2014.  The reason? Like much else, emerging equities have been transformed by technology. Just like the high performing U.S. tech shares -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google that were dubbed FANGs before Google's parent was renamed Alphabet -- the so-called BATs, comprising Chinese internet trio Baidoo, Alibaba and Tencent have changed an emerging equity landscape once heavy in energy and mining firms. But the BATs are just a small part of a whole  new economy  story in emerging markets, where the biggest companies by market capitalization are now high-tech conglomerates Samsung (005930.KS), Tencent (0700.HK), Taiwan Semiconductor (5425.TWO), Alibaba (BABA.N) and South Africa's Naspers (NPNJn.J), Alongside a host of smaller IT or information technology, firms, mainly Asia-based, they comprise over a quarter of the index cap, on a par with banks and significantly above the 7 percent weight of energy firms. (Graphics on 'Asset performances YTD and post-Brexit vote' - bit.ly/2urtY3r) A decade ago, the share of energy in the MSCI emerging market index was over 15 percent, while IT was under 12 percent, MSCI data shows.    You are now getting the index composition effect with the BATs - the huge internet companies which are the (Chinese) equivalent of the FANGs in the U.S,  said Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital.  One of the biggest myths of emerging markets is that they are commodity dependent and more specifically oil-dependent, when the reality is the four biggest markets, China, Korea, Taiwan and India are big importers of commodities,  Mayo added. That may explain why, when Brent crude has posted its worst first-half since 1998, MSCI's emerging share index has risen around 17 percent. Usually the index moves in lock-step with oil prices but since last year that correlation has been disrupted: Investors have been unfazed by oil's drop, having poured more than $40 billion into emerging equity funds year-to-date. Meanwhile, as the commodity supercycle has ebbed and crude prices have halved from early-2014 levels, the value of erstwhile giants Gazprom (GAZP.MM), PetroChina (601857.SS) and Petrobras (PETR4.SA) has taken a hit; Russia's Gazprom, the biggest MSCI EM stock in 2007, does not make the top 10 in 2017. Instead, a blistering U.S. tech sector rally, with gains of nearly 20 percent .SPLRCT has lifted emerging IT shares. FILE PHOTO: Dancers perform underneath the logo of Tencent at the Global Mobile Internet Conference in Beijing May 6, 2014.Kim Kyung-Hoon /File Photo IT is now bigger than materials and energy in the benchmark which is a relatively novel development in a historical context  said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, senior product specialist in Pictet Asset Management's emerging equities team. While IT is likely a  long-term structural story  in emerging markets, chances of the sector balance tilting back again toward oil hinges at least partly on whether the commodity super-cycle will make a comeback, she said. But with shale and renewable energy increasingly cost-effective, that looks unlikely in the near future.  Links Not Severed Emerging markets have not severed energy links and countries such as Russia, Colombia and Nigeria still rely on crude exports. Indeed, equity resilience showed signs of cracking earlier in June as oil prices headed toward $40, while commodity-heavy Russian stocks are this year's worst performers. Many investors draw parallels with U.S. junk-rated bonds, almost a fifth of which are energy firms but are also showing better resilience to the oil price dip than during the 2014 price collapse as their business models evolve. Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management, said a similar oil dip at the end of 2015 had fed through from the U.S. junk bonds to emerging markets.  If oil takes another leg lower and creates a credit event in U.S. high-yield, that can spread to EM,  he said. Others note the improved global backdrop since the last oil price reversal.  There are enough compensating factors to have a bit of decoupling. It doesn't mean the relationship is broken for ever but the level of oil price which starts to have a negative impact on emerging markets or U.S. shale is probably lower than before,  said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment strategist with NN Investment Partners. But there is another positive effect from the IT sector's greater weighting, namely IT firms' higher return on equity (ROE), a key measure for stockpickers as it reflects how well a company uses shareholders' capital to generate returns. Currently, the emerging IT sector's average ROE is almost twice that of energy firms and well above the index average.     A Morgan Stanley report on the subject noted the shift in the MSCI index  away from lower ROE, higher leverage, and excess capacity industries toward the higher ROE, lower leverage, non-capacity challenged New Economy industries.  It called IT's greater emerging markets weight  a structural positive that bodes well for the index's future performance.

Rite Aid said on Thursday it would sell nearly half its U.S. stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) after the drugstore operators agreed to scrap a whole-sale merger. Wall Street showed its displeasure at the new deal, pushing Rite Aid's shares down 30 percent to a near four-year low after the announcement. The stock added to its losses, falling 7 percent on Friday. Rite Aid has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business, which sells prescription drugs, as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressure for generics has intensified.  I think Rite Aid is going to struggle to remain relevant in the pharmacy industry,  said Adam Fein, president at Pembroke Consulting, which tracks the drug distribution industry.  The pharmacy industry has become hyper competitive and it favors either large teams or nimble independents, and Rite Aid is buck in the middle and doesn't have geographic scale anywhere, except in the North East and the West Coast.  But it's not all bad news for the company. Under the new deal, Rite Aid will gain access to Walgreen's centralized sourcing system, allowing it to procure generic drugs at low costs for 10 years and giving its pharmacy margins a much-needed boost. Walgreens, the No. 1 drugstore chain in the country, has a sourcing contract with AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), the second-largest U.S. drug distributor, giving the alliance  bargaining clout against drugmakers. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walgreens is seen at their Times Square store in New York December 17, 2012.Andrew Kelly/File Photo We estimate more favorable generic procuring costs could provide 3-5 percent of saving on RAD's total generic spend,  Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. Leaner and Meaner? Still, being left with only half its stores will be punishing on economies of scale for Rite Aid, which is already struggling to turn a profit, said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Rite Aid on Thursday posted a much bigger quarterly loss, mainly because of a drop in same-store sales due to low reimbursement rates. This was the company's third loss in the past five quarters. EBITDA margins for the company fell to an average of 3.4 percent in fiscal 2017 ended March 31, from 4.8 percent in 2013. In contrast, Walgreens' EBITDA margins have averaged 7.3 percent on average for first three quarters of fiscal 2017, which ends in August, from 6.9 percent for the whole of 2013. Rite Aid, however, said the deal would make it a smaller but stronger company, helping it address pharmacy margin challenges and significantly cut its debt - over $7 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Selling roughly half its stores will leave Rite Aid more reliant on its pharmacy benefit management business, which maintains formularies, or preferred drugs lists, negotiates rebates with drugmakers, and processes prescription drug claims.  We think this will benefit RAD from a valuation perspective as we estimate that PBMs trade at a premium to drug retailers, by about a couple of turns in our view,  Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note. The smaller company could also be an attractive buyout target for a private equity firm or a rival such as Fred's Inc (FRED.O), which was to buy some assets that would have been divested under the previously planned Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, analysts said.

The U.S. had offered a $5 million reward for the capture of Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, known universally as  Robow , once the spokesman and deputy leader of al Shabaab, an Islamist insurgency that wants to overthrow Somalia's weak U.N.-backed government.  Robow fell out of favor with the insurgency in 2013 yet remained outwardly loyal. Earlier this month, the U.S. quietly removed him from their list of sponsors of terror after five years.   There was and is, negotiation going on between Mukhtar Robow and the Somali federal government but still there is no guarantee that he will defect,  Colonel Aden Ahmed, an officer in the national military, told Reuters on Friday from southwestern Hudur town, near Robow's stronghold. A split would further weaken al Shabaab following years where the insurgency has steadily lost ground. It withdrew from the capital in 2011 and has lost control of most of the major towns in south-central Somalia since.  It still maintains a significant presence in the countryside and the Juba region near the border with Kenya and is mounting increasingly large and deadly bombings in the capital.  If Robow defects, it would give pro-government forces more freedom to operate in the regions of Bay and Bakool, slicing al Shabaab's operational territory in two. Robow is from the large Rahanweyn clan, which dominates many of Somalia's most fertile areas.   We understand al Shabaab fighters plan to attack and capture Robow but this will not be easy for he has well-trained and well-armed...fighters who will die for him. Yesterday, we prepared about 300 military soldiers with military cars to defend Robow,  Ahmed said.   Those troops are now in the outskirts of the town. We cannot send them directly for many reasons. Al Shabaab may ambush us, Robow himself may ambush our forces. We shall give reinforcement to Robow only after we confirm that fighting between al Shabaab and Robow breaks out.  Residents said Robow was holed up in a village with about 400 fighters about 18 km (11 miles) from Hudur, the capital of Bakool region in southern Somalia.  Two residents said they saw two helicopters and a drone but it was unclear to them if the aircraft were connected to Robow.   We understand al Shabaab decided to disarm Robow after they heard he was removed from U.S. wanted list,  local elder Mohamed Nur said. Al Shabaab and Robow could not be reached for comment.  Mohamed Abdi, governor of Bakool, told Reuters that al Shabaab fighters were advancing towards Robow.   We have prepared many troops to reinforce Robow in case they begin fighting him. Your enemy’s enemy is your friend,  he said. Additional reporting by Abdi Sheikh; editing by Ralph Boulton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-security-idUSKBN19L255"},

Protests were smaller than in a nationwide strike two months ago. Subway and bus services shut down in Brasilia, and small street demonstrations blocking roads snarled drivers in traffic in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The strike had limited impact at oil refineries but did not effect exploration and production, refining and logistics activities at state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA, executives said. Temer, whose year-long administration has an approval rating in the single digits, has resisted repeated calls to resign after executives of the world's biggest meatpacker, JBS SA , accused him of taking millions in bribes. The president was charged this week with corruption. Unions fiercely oppose Temer's labor reform bill as it reduces their power over workplaces by cutting mandatory dues and allowing companies and employees to negotiate contract terms more freely. The bill has already been approved by the lower house of Congress and looks set to pass the Senate within a few weeks. Unions also criticize Temer's pension overhaul proposal as it would make Brazilians work more years before retiring. Economists and investors see pension reform as the only way for Brazil to shore up its finances in the long run without resorting to massive tax hikes. Previous protests triggered violent clashes between demonstrators and police earlier this year. In May, Temer deployed the army to protect federal buildings after protesters set fire to a ministry building in Brasilia.

The debate has been going on in Brussels for at least four years, but this month's deadly fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment block in London has highlighted a lack of fire safety regulations across the 28-member bloc. Officials at the European Commission, the European Union's executive, were already studying the draft version of a report on whether new smoke regulations for construction materials are needed before the June 14 blaze that killed at least 80 people. The draft, dated May, was based on around 50 interviews with regulators, industry groups and fire services, led by BRE, a British-based organisation that carries out research and testing in the building sector. It found that there  would be limited benefits from regulating for the toxicity of smoke from construction products  and that member states should continue to decide individually whether specific rules are necessary. It also concluded that  regulation would increase barriers to trade, increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market . A final version should be ready by July 17, the draft said, although the Commission said it could not confirm that date. The Commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry.  Member States are free to set their own requirements for building design and safety,  a Commission spokeswoman said, when asked about the report and the possibility of new regulation. Trade body Plastics Europe says there is no evidence new rules on the toxicity of smoke from building materials would save lives. But firefighters and other safety campaigners say labelling products according to their toxicity when burned is one simple way to address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders in the EU. EU officials, fire safety and industry representatives debated the draft report in Brussels on May 16. Among those present was Richard Hull, a professor of fire science at the University of Central Lancashire in England.  If I go to my laboratory and I develop a new insulation material which is excellent in many respects but is lethally toxic when it burns, there's no restriction on me selling that as a building product,  he said. Plastics Europe, which represents companies such as ExxonMobil, Total and BASF, said new regulations would not be useful because there are multiple factors to consider when assessing the safety of a building.  A smoke toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire,  Plastics Europe said. Presently, the EU only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although EU sources said the Commission had decided long before the Grenfell fire to draw up new rules to harmonise fire-safety tests for building facades. Police investigating the cause of London's most deadly fire since World War Two have said it started in a faulty fridge and spread rapidly because of external cladding on the 24-storey building. The cladding used has since failed safety checks and prompted a review of the materials used on British buildings ranging from hospitals to hotels to apartment blocks. Hull said the use of more synthetic materials in construction has made smoke more toxic, with insulation products such as polyisocyanurate (PIR) producing high yields of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned. Pressure group Fire Safe Europe says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke. The body brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including Danish-listed Rockwool and Germany's Knauf Insulation.  Smoke is playing a crucial role in modern fire behaviour. said Brussels firefighter Pieter Maes, who attended the May meeting.  We need to take it into account in our testing of materials, to understand how smoke production from a certain material can influence how fire spreads.  Czech Member of the European Parliament Pavel Poc told Reuters his Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group would push the Commission for specific rules on smoke.  Testing and labelling could give the consumers the chance to choose between more or less toxic materials,  he said.

The Institute for International Finance estimates that total inflows in June were down slightly from $20.2 billion in May, with about $13 billion flowing into debt and $5 billion to equity markets, respectively.  We remain cautiously optimistic on the overall outlook for EM capital flows given the very shallow pace of Fed tightening expected by markets — well below the Fed dots — but cognizant of potential headwinds,  IIF said in a statement. Regionally, emerging markets in Asia were responsible for the lion's share of all inflows in June, drawing $15.8 billion in combined equity and debt, with debt inflows to India playing a large role. Asia was followed by EM Europe, with $2.0 billion, while a modest bump in Latin American of $0.6 billion offset a similar drop in Africa and the Middle East of $-0.5 billion. May marked the strongest pace of emerging markets net capital inflows, excluding China, since the U.S. election, rising to $16.5 billion. That was up from $2.5 billion in April. IIF reported that the strong upswing was mainly driven by robust inflows to Turkey, at $9.2 billion, India with $9 billion, and Mexico, at $2.3 billion. In contrast, net capital flows to Brazil turned negative in May, IIF said, hurt by a sharp contraction in non-resident capital inflows. On May 17, secret recordings of Brazilian President Michel Temer were released that alleged Temer was discussing a bribery plot with Joesley Batista, chairman of the country’s largest meat-packing firm JBS, to pay a monthly allowance to former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock exchange, real currency and government bonds all sold off following the news.

The sales would send a very wrong message to  Taiwan independence  forces, China's embassy in Washington said in a statement. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said on Thursday the administration had told Congress of seven proposed sales to Taiwan, the first under the Trump administration..  The Chinese government and Chinese people have every right to be outraged,  the embassy said. China regards self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. China's Nationalists fled to the island after losing the civil war with China's Communists in 1949. The United States is the sole arms supplier to Taiwan.  The wrong move of the U.S. side runs counter to the consensus reached by the two presidents in and the positive development momentum of the China-U.S. relationship,  the embassy said. China's Defense Ministry said Taiwan was the  most important, most sensitive core issue in Sino-U.S. ties , warning the United States to end such sales to avoid further damaging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Trump was critical of China during his successful 2016 presidential campaign but his meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with Xi raised hopes for warmer relations. Trump later played up his personal relationship with Xi, calling him a  good man , and stressed the need for China's help in reining in a defiant North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles. China's anger over the U.S. plan to supply Taiwan with weapons risks undermining Trump's attempts to press China to help on North Korea. The proposed U.S. package for Taiwan includes technical support for early warning radar, high speed anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and missile components. Beijing's relationship with Taiwan has been frosty since President Tsai Ing-wen took power in Taipei last year. Tsai leads an independence-leaning party that refuses to recognized Beijing's  one China  policy. Tsai's office said on Friday the planned sales increased Taiwan's confidence and ability to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Asked about the sales at an event on Thursday evening in Washington, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai said the United States was  incorrigible  when it came to Taiwan, the official Chinese Communist Party People's Daily newspaper reported on its website.  But we should still continue to instruct (them) and continue advancing on the right track of China-U.S. relations because this is what truly fits for both countries' long term interests,  the paper quoted Cui as saying. The sales, which require congressional approval, would be the first since a $1.83 billion sale that former President Barack Obama announced in December 2015, also to China's dismay. The previous package included two navy frigates in addition to anti-tank missiles and amphibious attack vehicles.

U.S. officials have said President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inability to restrain North Korea's arms and missile programs.  This week, the United States imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's weapons programs, announced a $1.4 billion arms sale for Taiwan, and said it would like sick Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo to be treated  elsewhere . It has also placed China on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor and senior U.S. officials have told Reuters that Washington is considering trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on steel imports. Trump met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at the White House and made a point of noting that the United States, India and Japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the Indian Ocean, a point that seemed aimed at China. It's a long way from the  bromance  that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to have at their first summit in April. Trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties in the meeting at his Florida residence and subsequently called Xi a  good man . While China said it was  outraged  at the arms sales for Taiwan, and upset with the North Korea-related sanctions, it did not make specific threats of retaliation. In 2010, Beijing threatened to sanction U.S. firms that sell weapons to Taiwan after Washington announced a much bigger $6.4 billion arms package. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he hoped the United States can correct its mistakes and get ties back on track  so as to avoid cooperation in important areas being impacted . He did not elaborate. Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University and who has advised the government on foreign policy, cautioned against interpreting recent events as indicating a shift in China-U.S. relations, saying it was still too early to tell.  We had a good first summit and a good beginning but the relationship in the long run is characterized by not just cooperation but also conflict,  Jia said.  Arms sales to Taiwan, the South China Sea and East China Sea, and other problems in the relationship will appear. It's a question of how much the two countries will be able to manage these conflicts, whether they can manage them better than the previous administration.  Ties Back to Normal Trump and Xi are expected to meet next week on the sidelines of a G20 summit in the Germany city of Hamburg. China has long been cautious about Trump, China-based diplomatic sources say, believing he is unpredictable and needs to be handled with care.  How does the Chinese government view Trump? We're still discovering who he is. He often does things we can't predict. We're not clever enough to predict what he'll do,  said Shen Dingli, a professor at Shanghai's elite Fudan University. Trump upset China even before taking office, taking a call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, overturning decades of precedent of no high-level official contacts between the United States and an island China considers to be a wayward province.  While China has worked hard to get Trump to understand the importance of Taiwan to the China-U.S. relationship, it has never seriously expected Washington to stop selling it weapons, provision for which is explicitly made in U.S. law.  The U.S. selling weapons to Taiwan is routine,  said Shen.  They're selling much less than before, and that's much better. So I don't think there's anything too terrible about that.  Still, the risks around Taiwan are profound.  China's Defense Ministry, responding to the U.S. weapons sales, said Taiwan was the  most important, most sensitive core issue  between the United States and China. The arms sale came hot on the heels of a U.S. Senate committee approving a bill calling for the resumption of port visits to Taiwan by the U.S. Navy for the first time since Washington ditched Taipei and established ties with Beijing in 1979. While China's Defense Ministry registered its opposition to the bill on Thursday, spokesman Wu Qian pointed out that as long as they respect each other's core concerns, the Chinese and U.S. militaries can be an  engine of stability  for the two countries. Shi Yinhong, who heads the Center for American Studies at Beijing's Renmin University and has advised the government on diplomacy, said it was important people are realistic about the challenges China and the United States face.  Perhaps people appraised too highly the Xi-Trump meeting. Although the atmosphere was very good, there were still real problems there,  Shi said, referring to the Florida summit.  Maybe you can say that China-U.S. relations have gone back to being normal,  Shi added.  Trump has no patience, and nobody can be surprised that he's pushed certain issues to the fore.

Orban's language, embracing notions of  ethnic homogeneity , appears fashioned to occupy territory on the far right abandoned by the radical nationalist opposition party Jobbik, which has moderated its message, analysts and critics said. Orban has locked horns with European Union partners over respect for liberal democratic conventions and reluctance to take in refugees. In a speech last week Orban recalled the rule of interwar Governor Miklos Horthy, a divisive figure who led the country for 24 years until 1944, signing several landmark laws against Jews and eventually surrendering mor ethan 500,000 to the Nazi Holocaust.  That history did not bury us (after World War One) is down to a few exceptional statesmen (like) Governor Miklos Horthy,  he said.  That fact cannot be negated by Hungary's mournful role in World War Two.  The Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary and the World Jewish Congress said in a joint statement they were  concerned  about the tone of such electioneering. Israel's ambassador to Budapest requested a clarification of Orban's words, which Jerusalem found  troubling . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to pay a visit to Budapest in mid-July, the first by a sitting Israeli prime minister. Some analysts said Orban's new hardened tone signaled a change in his politics and could define his upcoming election campaign as he seeks reelection for a third consecutive term.  Orban's Fidesz is a runaway favorite to win the 2018 elections, commanding about a third of the electorate with Jobbik and the Socialists at about 10 percent each. Jobbik received about a million votes in 2014, but risks big chunks of that electorate with its new, more moderate line.  Jobbik's move towards the center has upended the power base in the center and created a vacuum on the far right,  Zoltan Novak, analyst at the Center for Fair Political Analysis said.  Harder Line Finds Followers One indicator of that move is Orban's harder line on immigration. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have entered Hungary via its southern frontier since 2015, though most have moved on westward to more prosperous parts of the EU. Budapest has erected a border fence along its southern frontier.  It is very important to preserve our ethnic homogeneity,  Orban told a business forum on February 28, repeating the phrase several times. Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko sees Fidesz and Jobbik  actually trading places, with Orban now on the far right.  For Orban to speak about 'ethnic homogeneity' in eastern Europe, less than 75 years after the Holocaust or 25 years after the Balkan wars, is a complete disregard of civilized norms,  Kreko told Reuters.  This week he used a national tour rallying against European Union plans for migrant resettlement quotas to criticize Muslim migrants.  They don't respect our culture,  he said.  They seek space for their own (culture), then suppress ours, then replace it. This is a matter of identity.  Orban's  ethnic homogeneity  idea has struck a nerve with a new militant right-wing political alliance, which will launch at a rally next week and may also enter the 2018 election race.  Within decades the continent can implode demographically,  alliance leader Balazs Laszlo told the pro-Orban daily Magyar Idok.  Our ethnic homogeneity can come wholly undone... We recognize differences and defend our own race.  A leader of the movement, Mihaly Orosz denied any cooperation with Fidesz.  If they sense they can use our movement politically they might try but there is no intentional collusion on our part,  he said, adding their goal was to pass the 5 percent vote threshold to get into Parliament in 2018. Kreko, the analyst, says the parallels clearly indicate a strategic squeeze: harvesting voters left behind by Jobbik from both the center of the political spectrum and the extreme right. Fidesz also denied any cooperation.  Fidesz rejects all kinds of anti-Semitism, and does not cooperate with these politicians,  the party said in an emailed statement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban-farright-analysis-idUSKBN19L244"},

That universal appeal is what organizers of the Long Drive World Series are trying to tap into as they head to England for a razzle-dazzle competition that might have traditionalists wondering what ever happened to the old game. British Long Drive champion Lucas Dornan and 2016 world champion Joe Miller will be among the competitors at the July 8 event at the Berkshire Polo Club in Windsor.  While the purse of 60,000 pounds ($77,928.00) pales beside the millions offered each week on golf's traditional circuits, Dornan is bullish about the event's future. As the staid professional tours continue mostly to embrace tradition, expecting funereal silence and statue-like stillness from spectators while a player executes a shot, the Long Drive World Series embraces quite the opposite. It is the golfing equivalent of Twenty20 cricket compared with test cricket, a Usain Bolt-like show of power rather than an all-round decathlon-like test of every facet of golf. Dornan attended the European Tour's PGA Championship at Wentworth last month, and was so bored he left after a few minutes.  (Traditional) golf is dying a death, whether they want to admit it or not,” Dornan said.  I think the only reason a lot of people came to Wentworth was to see the nice houses (on the property).  Most spectators sit next to a green and all they see is putting. Everyone has to be so quiet. I lasted five minutes.  That said, Dornan, 31, describes himself as a  golf nut  who enjoys watching the top pros, at least on television. Lucas Dornan, United Kingdom's Long Drive Champion, who will be competing in the United Kingdom's first ever Long Drive World Series event at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club in Windsor, is shown in this undated handout photo provided June 8, 2017.

D.J.'s such a wet blanket personality-wise, you can't root for him,” said Dornan. No 'Quiet Please' Signs Londoner Dornan is a natural salesman for the Long Drive World Series, where nary a 'quiet please' sign can be found as golfers compete head-to-head and the action is complemented with music and celebrity DJs during commercial breaks. With a clubhead speed that can reach 150 miles per hour (241 km per hour) -- long-hitting Johnson's average on the PGA Tour this year is 121 mph -- it took Dornan a while to find a driver that fit his swing. Bur once he was properly measured for a driver that suited his specifications, he was off to the races, and he is now the British champion with an officially-measured career long drive of 427 yards. Naturally enough, most every amateur Dornan encounters wants a tip on how to drive the ball further. His advice to anyone who asks is to imagine trying to hit a highly teed-up ball over a person standing six feet away and ensuring the clubhead is on an upward trajectory at the moment of impact. Dornan, a four-handicapper, said that contrary to popular belief most long drive specialists are pretty handy all-round golfers, if not necessarily good enough to play the pro tours.  The biggest problem is when we’re slightly off(line), we’re out-of-bounds,” he said modestly.

Concerns about the U.S. military's THAAD missile defense system and China's role in the region also are likely to come up in talks between Trump and Moon at the White House. Moon, making his first trip to the United States since becoming his country's president in May, joined Trump and his wife, Melania, for dinner in the White House State Dining Room on Thursday evening ahead of further talks on Friday.  I know you've been discussing with our people some of the complexities of North Korea and trade and other things, and we’ll be discussing them all as we progress, and it could be very well late into the evening,  Trump told Moon.  I’d like to also congratulate you upon your election victory. It was a great victory, and you did a fantastic job. A lot of people didn't expect that, and I did expect it. I thought that was going to happen.  Both men have an interest in building a strong relationship but tensions could puncture that effort.  Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances with South Korea and threatened to tear up a trade agreement with the country. Moon has taken a wary stance on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that the United States deployed in South Korea in March.  I think they’ll have a friendly and frank discussion about the trade relationship,  a White House official told reporters on Wednesday, noting concerns about barriers to U.S. auto sales and surplus Chinese steel that arrives in the United States via South Korea. After the dinner, Trump tweeted that he had a  very good meeting  with Moon and that  many subjects (were) discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!  The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the KORUS pact took effect in 2012, from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2016. It was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year but they were $3 billion lower in 2016 than in 2011. In an interview with Reuters in April, Trump called the 5-year-old trade deal  horrible  and said he would either renegotiate or terminate it. During remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Moon said unfair trade practices would be eradicated and factors that limited competition, such as market entry barriers and price regulations, would be re-evaluated under his administration. Trump has made challenging trade agreements a hallmark of his administration since taking office in January. South Korean President Moon attends a dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Carlos BarriaNorth Korea Focus Despite tensions over that issue, his meetings with Moon are likely to focus largely on North Korea. Moon has said he wants to form a friendship with the former New York businessman and find common ground on how to resolve the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.  Trump wants to build ties with an important new leader in the region as he grows frustrated that his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping has not resulted in stronger action by Beijing to rein in Pyongyang. Slideshow (7 Images)The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The Trump administration also announced it plans to sell Taiwan about $1.42 billion in arms. Moon told Reuters in an interview last week he wanted to discuss a two-phased approach to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, starting with a freeze on North Korea’s nuclear and missile development followed by complete dismantlement. “I am planning to have frank and open discussions with President Trump on the step-by-step approach,” he said. The THAAD defense system could be a sticking point.  Moon, who has advocated a more moderate approach toward Pyongyang, expressed shock late last month upon learning that four more launchers for the controversial system had been brought into the country. He ordered an investigation after his Defense Ministry failed to inform him of the move. The system, whose installation irritated China, is meant to counter the threat from North Korea's missile program. The White House said it did not expect THAAD to be a major point of conversation and Moon is expected to assure Washington that his recent decision to postpone full THAAD deployment to conduct an environmental review was a measure to follow domestic law. Despite potential areas of disagreement, the two leaders are expected to express common resolve over threats from North Korea.  The similarities in our approaches are already evident,  the White House official said, noting that both men had expressed willingness to engage with Pyongyang under the right conditions.  Even once the conditions may present themselves, to enter into dialogue we must maintain and actually increase pressure on North Korea.

To investigate the effect of prolonged breastfeeding on children’s teeth, Karen Glazer Peres of the University of Adelaide in Australia and colleagues analyzed data on 1,129 children born in 2004 in Pelotas, Brazil, a community with a public fluoridated water supply.   Breastfeeding information was collected at birth and when children were 3 months, 1 year and 2 years old. Sugar consumption data was collected at ages 2, 4 and 5. By age 5, nearly 24 percent of children had severe early childhood caries, which researchers defined as six or more decayed, missing or filled tooth surfaces, according to the report in the journal Pediatrics. Close to half of children had at least one tooth surface affected. Children who had breastfed for at least two years, which was close to one-quarter of the group, had a higher number of teeth that were decayed, missing or had a filling. Their risk of having severe early childhood caries was also 2.4 times higher compared with those who were only breastfed up to 1 year of age. Breastfeeding for 13 months to 23 months had no effect on dental caries. To collect data on sugar consumption, the team used a list of food items or food groups consumed the day prior to a clinic visit. At age 2, groups were categorized as “low sugar consumption,” meaning zero or less than twice daily, and “high sugar consumption,” meaning two or more times daily.  But sugar consumption was only associated with a greater risk of having severe early childhood dental caries when children who consumed the highest amount were compared with children who consumed the least.  Subsequent analyses of prolonged breastfeeding, taking into account the pattern of sugar consumption throughout the child’s life course, showed that prolonged breastfeeding was an independent risk for severe caries and decayed, missing or filled teeth, the authors note. “Breastfeeding is the unquestioned optimal source of infant nutrition. Dental care providers should encourage mothers to breastfeed and, likewise, advise them on the risk,” Glazer Peres told Reuters Health by email. “General recommendations such as drinking fluoridated water as well as cleaning a child’s teeth with fluoridated toothpaste before going to bed may help to prevent dental caries,” she said. “These approaches are in line with most of the guidelines for practice and policy recommendations worldwide.” “There is no question that babies who breastfeed for a longer time than recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry or the American Academy of Pediatrics have an increased cavity rate,” noted Dr. Robert Morgan, chief of dentistry at Children's Health in Dallas, Texas, who was not involved in the study.   “The issue is not entirely related to breast feeding. Babies who sleep with a bottle of milk or take a sippy cup of milk throughout the day or night also have an increased incidence of caries,” he said by email.  “The real correlation of breastfeeding is perhaps the number of exposures to food and drink that a child has during the day and night due to the ease of access to mom,” he explained.  “We know that after a baby eats or drinks there is a rise in bacteria and a rise in decay potential for approximately 20 minutes, (after which) bacterial growth and concurrent acid production decreases, as does the decay potential. Therefore, we recommend toddlers eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with perhaps a mid-morning snack and a mid-afternoon snack. If a parent brushes (the child’s teeth) after breakfast and dinner there are only three exposures to increased decay rate times,” Morgan said.  “In my practice, for the mothers who would like to breastfeed for a longer period, we advise them to follow the recommended feeding schedule regardless of the feeding methods, whether breast, bottle or cup - feed and drink a non-water drink no more than five times a day and never at night - and we encourage the brushing schedule (after breakfast and dinner feeding),” he said.

GIC has valued the whole group, a former unit of The Financial Times Group, at about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion), the sources said, adding the deal will probably be signed on Friday. BC Partners bought the subscription-based news service from Pearson in a roughly 380 million pound deal in 2013. That was before the troubled education firm decided to part ways with the Financial Times in 2015 to focus solely on its core education business. Selling a stake to GIC will help BC reduce its exposure to the group while raising cash to fund London-based Mergermarket's ongoing expansion. Under BC Partners' ownership Mergermarket, known as an M&A; news specialist, has embarked on a number of add-on acquisitions to expand its portfolio in adjacent areas, buying private equity-focused publications AVCJ and Unquote from Incisive Media among other deals. BC Partners also held talks with Chinese media group Caixin about a possible sale of Mergermarket, another source said, but Caixin dropped out after a few weeks as it didn't believe it could secure enough financing for the deal. BC Partners and GIC declined to comment while representatives at Caixin were not available outside regular business hours. The deal with GIC, which was first reported by Sky News, follows the recent sale of oil price reporting agency Argus Media to U.S. investment firm General Atlantic for nearly 1 billion pounds in 2016.

She was 89 years old. A Jewish survivor of the Nazi death camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen with the prisoner number 78651 tattooed on her arm, she was a fervent European and fighter for civil liberties, becoming the first elected president of the European Parliament in 1979. Although out of the national limelight since 2007 when she quit her seat at France's top constitutional court, she commanded wide respect across the political spectrum and remained among the most popular politicians in opinion polls. Tributes honoring her courage and determination to advance women's rights were paid from within France and beyond.   May her example inspire our fellow countrymen, who will find in her the best of France,  French President Emmanuel Macron said in a message to the family.   Veil's concentration camp experience turned her into a passionate advocate of European unification but she was best known in France for legalizing abortion when she was health minister in 1974 under then President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.  Virtually unknown when she joined the cabinet, she fought doggedly against a hostile parliament and divided public opinion to push through a bill that became known as  the Veil Law , making France the first mainly Roman Catholic country to legalize abortion.

Veil was born Simone Jacob in Nice, on the French Riviera, on July 13, 1927, and from a young age experienced the spread of anti-Semitism in Europe.   Your mother is a Jew, you will burn in hell,  a classmate once told her.

Her father, mother and brother died in concentration camps, though a sister who was active in the French Resistance survived imprisonment in the Ravensbruck camp.  After the war, she studied law at Sciences Po in Paris and became a magistrate, winning honorary degrees from the U.S. Princeton university and Israel's Weizman Institute. She was married to Antoine Veil, a prominent businessman who led several leading companies and died in 2013. They had three sons.  She embodied for an entire generation the struggle of women for the freedom to decide on motherhood,  said Jean Louis Debre, former president of the Constitutional Court.

While it is still up 8 percent in the first half, gold has stalled in the second quarter after a strong start to the year, and is little changed from where it ended March.      Spot gold        was down 0.1 percent at $1,244.40 an ounce at 1415 GMT, while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery were $1.70 an ounce lower at $1,244.10.      Spot prices have fallen nearly 2 percent so far in June, and are down 0.4 percent in the second quarter.      Comments from the euro zone, British and Canadian central banks this week indicated that quantitative easing programmes in place since the financial crisis may be being wound up, leading to a gradual normalisation of interest rates.                   That comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to hike U.S. interest rates at its June meeting, and its indication that it will press ahead with plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings.                   The most important thing for the gold market is that we have monetary policy tightening in the United States, and so with a further interest rate hike the gold price has gone down,  LBBW analyst Thorsten Proettel said.      While the European Central Bank remains cautious on tightening monetary policy, the trend is turning more towards the hawkish side, he said.  From that perspective, it's bad for gold.      Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield was heading for its biggest weekly jump since late 2015, topping a week in which yields across the euro zone have soared as investors brace for an end to the era of ultra-easy monetary policy.               On the other side of the Atlantic, U.S. Treasury yields rose for a fourth straight day as inflation data was not seen as weak enough to delay the Fed's expected path on interest rate hikes.           Rising yields helped offset the positive impact of a weaker dollar on gold. The U.S. currency was on course for its worst quarter in seven years.

Security Council has extended sanctions on illegal oil exports from Libya to cover refined petroleum products as well, in a bid to stem rampant smuggling of subsidized fuel by sea.  Imported fuel that is priced lower for the domestic market is commonly smuggled by ship from western Libya to Malta, Italy and Turkey, and by land to Tunisia, according to U.N. investigators who earlier this month recommended an extension of the sanctions. Entrenched and powerful smuggling networks have been trading fuel for years, and it is unclear to what extent the resolution can be enforced. The new resolution, approved late on Thursday, is designed to make explicit that fuel smuggling is illegal, so that smuggling vessels  can be identified, blacklisted, and prevented from disembarking their cargo,  said a senior Western diplomat. It expands on a 2014 resolution banning illicit crude oil exports from Libya, authorizing the inspection of suspect ships, and calling on member states to take necessary measures to block attempted exports. Those measures  shall apply with respect to vessels loading, transporting, or discharging petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, illicitly exported or attempted to be exported from Libya,  the new resolution states. Libya is a major oil producer and exporter, but it has limited refining capacity. Imported refined products are heavily subsidized, with fuel subsidies estimated to represent more than 10 percent of Libya's gross domestic product (GDP). Smugglers can make vast profits by re-exporting oil products. Fuel smuggling is concentrated around the western towns of Zawiya and Zuwara, and across Libya's western land border with Tunisia. Both the Zawiya branch of Libya's Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) and the local coastguard have been accused of involvement in fuel smuggling, which according to the U.N. investigators overlaps with lucrative smuggling of migrants from Libya to Italy. In a report to the Security Council earlier this month, the investigators said they continued to observe  vessels showing suspicious navigational patterns  off Zuwara. They also cited an attempt to illicitly export 11,500 metric tons of heavy fuel oil from eastern Libya to Malta in February. U.N. resolutions recognized the National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Tripoli as the sole legitimate exporter of oil. They have been used to block attempts by factions in eastern Libya to export crude through a parallel National Oil Corporation based in Benghazi. The Western diplomat said that Thursday's resolution was not expected to halt smuggling and that its application would depend on how the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, which requested the reference to refined products, chose to use it.  The only thing that will stop smuggling is the removal of the subsidies,  he said. Editing by Hugh Lawson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-fuel-idUSKBN19L22Q"},

Williams, who confirmed in April that she was expecting a baby, is on maternity leave for the remainder of 2017, while 2004 Wimbledon champion Sharapova has pulled out of the grass court season with a thigh injury. Asked whether it would be a different championship without the two former champions, Muguruza said:  Not really, I think Serena is going to make a bigger impact because, you know, she has been in the final for I don't know how many years.   But there are a lot of players who are taking that spot and it is going to be just another tough tournament, even though maybe the major names are not here this year.  Ahead of her return to SW19, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has said it is only the beginning of her  second career  after recovering from injuries to her playing hand sustained during a knife attack in her home last December.  I am calling this a second career,  the 27-year-old Czech said at the WTA players' party in London.   And I do see things differently, not only tennis, but moments in the life when I realized it is much more nicer than I saw it before. So I am really grateful that I am still here and to live the moment.  Kvitova is the 11th seed at Wimbledon which starts on Monday.

After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, a fact- finding mission (FFM) of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that  a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance.  The conclusions of this report are indisputable,  the foreign ministry said in a statement.  The OPCW and its members must assume their responsibilities and condemn, in the strongest terms, this intolerable violation of the non-proliferation regime.  The attack on April 4, when dozens of people were killed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province, was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation, known as the JIM, can now look at the incident to determine who is to blame. Western intelligence agencies have accused the government of Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict.  Russia, Assad's key backer, said on Friday the OPCW's findings were based on doubtful evidence. France, under President Emmanuel Macron, has been pushing for closer cooperation with Moscow, especially over Syria, and has said dialogue with Russia on enforcing a 2013 Security Council resolution to prevent the use of chemical weapons in Syria was one of its priorities. The Khan Sheikhoun attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. France has said any new attacks would be a  red line  that could see unilateral French air strikes.   Those who carried out the Khan Sheikhoun atrocities and other chemical weapons attacks must face justice for the crimes,  the ministry said.

The JIM has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the government of Bashar al-Assad for the April chemical attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict. The mission was unable to visit the site itself due to security concerns and will not attempt to get there, the head of the OPCW was said to have decided. Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-U.S. agreement, averting military intervention under then U.S. President Barack Obama.  The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack. Russia, the Syrian government's main backer in the civil war, warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack.

Microsoft officials in India have  in principle agreed  to the request, Gulshan Rai, India's cyber security coordinator, told Reuters over the phone on Friday.  A spokeswoman for Microsoft in India declined to comment on the matter. Officials at the company's headquarters in the United States and regional headquarters in Asia also declined to comment. If Microsoft agreed to such a discount, it could open up the global software giant to similar requests from around the world. Rai said the government was in talks with Microsoft management in India. It is not immediately clear whether any other countries were seeking similar deals.  Rai said India began talks with Microsoft after the WannaCry ransomware attack last month, noting that both WannaCry and this week's attack, dubbed by some cyberexperts  NotPetya , exploited vulnerabilities in older iterations of the Windows OS.  The quantum of the price cut, we expect some detail on in a couple of days,  Rai said, adding the Indian government expected the company to offer the software at  throw-away prices.   It will be a one-time upgrade offer to Windows 10 and it will be a discounted price for the entire country,  said Rai, who was hand-picked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the country's first cyber security chief. Rai declined to be more specific, but said he was confident that it would be  less than a quarter of the current price.    Rai, who has over two decades of experience in different IT areas including cyber security, said his team began coordinating with government agencies and regulators to push for OS upgrades soon after the WannaCry attack began on May 12. The government's quick action helped minimize the impact of the NotPetya attack, which affected two of India's container port terminals, he said. The government has also worked with banks to ensure that some 200,000 of the more than 240,000 ATMs in the country, most of which run on older Windows XP systems, have been upgraded with security patches released by Microsoft following the WannaCry attack, Rai said.  This is just an interim solution, however, said Rai, because although the patches fix vulnerabilities in older OS versions, they retain the limitations of those versions.   New OS versions have different architecture, much improved architecture and much more resiliency,  said Rai. Price-Sensitive Windows 10 Home currently retails for 7,999 rupees ($124) in India, while the Pro version of the software typically used by large companies and institutions costs 14,999 rupees ($232). Roughly 96 percent of an estimated 57 million computers in India currently run on Windows, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple- and Linux-based systems account for the rest. Given that only a small minority of Windows users in India already have Windows 10, Microsoft could be forgoing several billion dollars of potential revenue if they agreed to sell just the more widely used Home version of Windows 10 at a quarter of its current Indian retail price.  In the price-sensitive Indian market, people using computers in households or small businesses often do not upgrade their OS given the steep costs. The wide use of pirated Windows OS versions, which would not automatically receive security patches, exacerbate the vulnerabilities.  In light of the attacks, Rai said, the government  wants to incentivise the common man to upgrade their systems . The WannaCry attack in May affected a state-run power firm in western India, while the NotPetya attack this week crippled operations at two port terminals in India operated by shipping giant AP Moller Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which was affected globally.

{"news_time":"2017-06-30 10:18:00","news_title":"IMPACT ANALYSIS: FCAC declines to set precedent in first Code of Conduct disciplinary decision","keywords":"BC,FINREG,FCAC,DISCIPLINARY,DECISION","sector":"Subjects","content":"TORONTO/NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A recent disciplinary decision issued by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) against an unnamed payment card network operator concerning incorrect disclosures made by third party payment processors offers little insight into how the regulator will handle similar enforcement actions in the future. The resulting uncertainty poses a challenge for compliance officers in managing third-party risk in compliance with consumer protection regulations.  Decision #126: Key Points On May 15, 2017, the FCAC published its first decision regarding non-compliance with the Code of Conduct for the Debit Card and Credit Card Industry(here).  The Code of Conduct is a voluntary guideline that applies to credit and debit card network operators as well as third parties such as card issuers. Participating firms commit to a number of transparency requirements regarding disclosures and communications with merchants. The FCAC oversees the financial industry's compliance with the Code of Conduct, along with other voluntary Codes of Conduct(here). Decision #126(here) is the first disciplinary action by the FCAC against a firm for non-compliance with the Code of Conduct for the Debit Card and Credit Card Industry. This Code of Conduct was first published in 2010 and has been amended in recent years; changes include increased disclosure obligations(here) relating to the sales and business practices of payment card network operators. The disciplinary action stems from a notice of non-compliance issued by the FCAC to the unnamed firm in March 2016. The FCAC alleged that the firm had made incorrect disclosures to merchants in monthly statements issued by third-party payment processors. While the firm admitted that the disclosures failed to comply with the guidelines outlined in the Code of Conduct, the firm had adequate internal controls in place and had taken remedial measures to correct the information. As a result, it should not be held accountable for actions of third parties.  The FCAC decided to review the matter and the resulting Decision #126 is meant to outline the scope of the firm's compliance obligations with respect to disclosures issued by third-party payment processors to merchants. As mentioned, the Code of Conduct applies to credit and debit card networks, as well as third parties. As a part of their commitment to compliance, firms voluntarily agree to implement internal controls to comply with the provisions of the Code of Conduct. Of note, the FCAC then referred to a firm's regulatory obligations under the Section 7 of the Payment Card Networks Act (PCNA) to take reasonable measures to enforce regulatory obligations against third parties. The notable part of this expectation is that Section 7 of the PCNA has not been implemented yet.  Yet, the FCAC referenced Section 7 of the PCNA, in combination with a firm's obligations under the Code of Conduct, and concluded that firms must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable measures to ensure the compliance of third parties with financial consumer regulation and voluntary Codes of Conduct. As for a definition of what constitutions reasonable measures, the FCAC stated that the standard will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The FCAC refrained from applying sanctions to the unnamed firm, saying that since this is the first disciplinary action involving the Code of Conduct, leeway should be given. The regulator further stated that Decision #126 should not be interpreted as precedent for what may or may not constitute reasonable measures to manage third party compliance with the Code of Conduct or other FCAC rules.  The Fcac's Supervision Framework  The lack of concrete guidance in Decision #126 is not only puzzling for compliance personnel at payment card network operators, it also seems to be at odds with the FCAC's regulatory goals under its recently published supervision framework.  In April 2017, the FCAC published the final version of its much anticipated Supervision Framework (PDF). The document outlines the FCAC's institutional goals and is meant to be read as a blueprint for how the regulator will supervise firms, enforce financial consumer regulations and sanction non-compliant firms.  The FCAC's regulatory approach rests on 4 guiding principles under the Supervision Framework: transparency, proactivity, proportionality and accountability. These principles, in theory, should be observed by the FCAC in all of its enforcement efforts as well as in its communications with the financial institutions it regulates. Decision #126 seems to miss the mark on some of the guiding principles outlined in the FCAC's Supervision Framework. With respect to transparency, the FCAC provided details on the nature of the regulatory violation and cited specific rules and regulations that had been breached. However, the FCAC, for undisclosed reasons, withheld the name of the payment card network operator, in contrast to its commitment to supervisory transparency. The regulator's reluctance to provide a firm answer on what the proper scope of a firm's compliance obligations are with respect to disclosures issued by third-party payment processors to merchants adds an additional layer of opacity to this enforcement action.  Proportionality is another guiding principle that Decision #126 arguably falls short on. Under the Supervision Framework, the FCAC has given itself a mandate to undertake enforcement action that is proportionate to the regulatory violation in question. Again, the FCAC's decision not to apply sanctions or provide clarity on the identity of the firm and scale of the regulatory violation hinders its ability to demonstrate that it is administering its supervisory powers in a proportionate manner.  Caution Advised for Compliance  Despite the FCAC's decision not to set a precedent or offer concrete guidance to firms on third-party liability issues, Decision #126 is still very noteworthy to compliance officers at any firm that serves Canadian financial consumers and is subject to oversight by the FCAC. While the Code of Conduct is technically considered a voluntary commitment, Decision #126 signifies that the FCAC not only endorses this Code of Conduct, and presumably other Codes of Conduct it oversees, it actively monitors firms' compliance with these voluntary rules. The publication of voluntary rules on the FCAC's website is further indication that the regulator will expect firms to comply with the obligations set out in these rules. Firms that fail to do so could be on the receiving end of a notice of non-compliance, followed by further disciplinary action.  Moreover, the FCAC's decision to reference a provision of the PCNA that has not been implemented yet further adds to regulatory compliance uncertainties. Firms that serve financial consumers should routinely monitor regulatory developments from the FCAC; new regulations, even if they have not yet been officially implemented, should be treated as a compliance obligation.  The lack of concrete guidance from the FCAC on the scope of potential third party liability presents a level of uncertainty for Canadian financial firms. While firms are now aware that they have an obligation to take reasonable measures to ensure that third parties comply with FCAC regulations and Codes of Conduct, the degree of diligence that they must exercise is distinctly unclear. --Payment Card Networks Act (PCNA):here --FCAC Supervision Framework:here (Helen Chan is a regulatory intelligence and e-learning expert in the Enterprise Risk Management division of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

High compliance by Gulf producers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait helped keep OPEC's adherence with its supply curbs at a historically high 92 percent in June, compared with 95 percent in May, the survey found. But extra oil from Nigeria and Libya, exempted from the cut because conflict curbed their output, means supply by the 13 OPEC members originally part of the deal has risen far above their implied production target. The recovery adds to the challenge the OPEC-led effort to support the market is facing from a persistent inventory glut. If the recovery lasts, calls could grow within OPEC for the exempt countries to be brought into the production deal.  The rise in OPEC production will further delay the point at which balance is restored on the oil market,  said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. As part of a deal with Russia and other non-members, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries originally pledged to reduce output by about 1.2 million bpd for six months from Jan. 1. Oil prices have gained some ground but high stocks and rising U.S. output kept them in check. To provide additional support for prices, the producers decided in May to prolong the deal until March 2018.  June's biggest rise came from Nigeria, where output extended a recovery after being curtailed by militant attacks on oil installations. The second-biggest was from Libya. Nigerian output is expected to rise further in coming weeks. Planned exports in August are scheduled to reach at least 2 million bpd, a 17-month high. In Libya, output was on average higher despite fluctuation and has now exceeded 1 million bpd, a four-year high. Production remains some way short of the 1.6 million bpd Libya pumped before the 2011 civil war. Saudi Arabia pumped 40,000 bpd more, the survey found,  although its compliance remained above 100 percent. Even with June's increase, the curb achieved by OPEC's top producer is 564,000 bpd, well above the target cut of 486,000 bpd. Aside from a rise in Angolan exports, no other significant change in output occurred elsewhere in OPEC.  OPEC announced a production target of 32.5 million bpd last year, which was based on low figures for Libya and Nigeria. The target includes Indonesia, which has since left, and does not include Equatorial Guinea, the latest country to join OPEC.  The Libyan and Nigerian increases mean OPEC output in June averaged 32.57 million bpd, about 820,000 bpd above its supply target, adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.  Equatorial Guinea, which became an OPEC member in late May, has now been added to the Reuters survey. The country's crude production is estimated at 150,000 bpd, which brings total OPEC production in June to 32.72 million bpd. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, a fact- finding mission (FFM) of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that  a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance.  The conclusions of this report are indisputable,  the foreign ministry said in a statement.  The OPCW and its members must assume their responsibilities and condemn, in the strongest terms, this intolerable violation of the non-proliferation regime.  The attack on April 4, when dozens of people were killed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province, was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation, known as the JIM, can now look at the incident to determine who is to blame. Western intelligence agencies have accused the government of Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict. Russia, Assad's key backer, said on Friday the OPCW's findings were based on doubtful evidence. France, under President Emmanuel Macron, has been pushing for closer cooperation with Moscow, especially over Syria, and has said dialogue with Russia on enforcing a 2013 Security Council resolution to prevent the use of chemical weapons in Syria was one of its priorities. The Khan Sheikhoun attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. France has said any new attacks would be a  red line  that could see unilateral French air strikes.  Those who carried out the Khan Sheikhoun atrocities and other chemical weapons attacks must face justice for the crimes,  the ministry said.

A warning letter was delivered on Wednesday to Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), a joint venture between Carlyle Group and Energy Transfer Partners of the 335,000-barrel-per-day refinery on the south side of Philadelphia. The local USW chapter has scheduled emergency meetings for next week, and a strike authorization vote could come in the next two weeks, the sources said. The refinery is a key gasoline and diesel suppliers for the Mid-Atlantic, one of the busiest parts of the country in terms of refined product demand. PES forced employees to contribute more to their health plans and suspended pension contributions last September as the fat refining margins from the Bakken rail boom disappeared. The local union contested the cuts, and the issue is in arbitration. The USW did not immediately respond to requests for comment and PES declined to comment on Friday. A refinery strike unrelated to new contract negotiations would be highly unusual since all union contracts typically include no-strike clauses. Several refineries were hit by strikes in 2015 after contract negotiations stalled, forcing some to temporarily close. Carlyle helped rescue the refinery from closure in 2012. The move paid big dividends early as the refinery leveraged cheap crude shipped by rail from North Dakota's Bakken oil fields to amass large profits. However, the Bakken discount has disappeared, and so have the trains, sapping profits. PES and other East Coast refiners have been forced to return to refining West African crudes.

Waberer's said it would raise about 14 billion forints (45.34 million euros) in net proceeds, which will be used partly to finance a planned acquisition of Polish rival Link. The Hungarian company, which has a fleet of 3,500-plus vehicles, has said it expects Link to cost about 32 million euros. The IPO pricing makes shares in what is one of Europe's biggest haulage businesses look cheap compared with European rivals, said Balint Kovacs, equities analyst at local brokerage Equilor. However, the sector carries risks, including changing European regulation as well as the outcome of talks on Britain's planned departure from the European Union, he added.  Given that the shares were sold at the bottom of the proposed 5,100-6,300 forint target range and the number of shares sold is also well below expectations, the stock will feature a smaller free float and lower liquidity,  Kovacs said in a note. Waberer's, which launched the IPO on June 19, said that 82 percent of the total offering was bought by institutional investors, with retail investors taking just below 18 percent. The free float was planned to account for about 27 percent of the company's share capital and the stock is expected to start trading in Budapest on July 6, joining a market dominated by only four blue-chips companies that account for the brunt of turnover.

The assessment, contained in the Reserve Bank of India's semi-annual Financial Stability Report, comes as India's banking system struggles to deal with about $150 billion in soured loans, which is seen as choking the credit needed to boost economic growth. The RBI said gross non-performing advances (GNPAs) ratio of banks -- a measure of soured loans in the system -- rose to 9.6 per cent in March 2017 from 9.2 per cent in September 2016. The central bank added its stress tests indicated that under the baseline scenario, the GNPAs ratio could rise to 10.2 per cent by March 2018, potentially sending two banks below the minimum mandated capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of 9 percent. The RBI warned, however, that under a severe macro test scenario, six banks could record CRAR below 9 per cent, dragging the banking sector's ratio to 11.2 percent by March 2018 from 13.3 percent a year earlier.  A severe credit shock is likely to impact capital adequacy and profitability of a significant number of banks,  the report said. The RBI does not identify which banks would be impacted under its stress tests. The latest financial stability report comes as the central bank, under additional powers granted to it by the government this year, has ordered banks to start bankruptcy proceedings against 12 of the country's largest defaulters in a bid to start reducing the amount of soured loans in the country.

The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. shale firms are drilling themselves into a deep hole despite warnings from industry leaders about the risk of flooding the market with too much crude. Drilling and production are rising. Prices are declining. Companies are barely breaking even or losing money. Costs are starting to rise. And share prices are sliding. Current oil prices are not sustainable according to Harold Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources, said in an interview on June 28. Prices need to be above $50 per barrel to be sustainable and below $40 would force producers to idle rigs, Hamm said ( Harold Hamm warns oil prices below $40 will idle U.S. drilling , CNBC, June 28).  While this period of adjustment is going on, drillers don't want to drill themselves into oblivion. Back up, and be prudent and use some discipline,  he urged rival chief executives. Many of Continental's leases are in North Dakota's Bakken and Oklahoma, where wells are typically more expensive to drill and yield less oil than some other shale plays. The resurgence in shale drilling over the last year has been concentrated in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where costs are much lower and yields higher. There are now almost 370 rigs drilling for oil in the Permian compared with 50 in the Bakken, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes. The number of rigs drilling in the Permian has almost tripled since the end of April 2016, and the Permian now accounts for almost half of the rigs drilling for oil in the United States. But even in the Permian, shale firms have struggled to make money with oil prices stuck below $50, raising questions about the sustainability of the drilling boom. Many shale drillers claim they can drill wells profitability even with benchmark WTI prices below $50 as a result of significant cost reductions and improvements in efficiency. But most shale firms were still losing money or at best breaking even in the first quarter of 2017, even before the renewed slump in prices. Pioneer Resources says it has the largest acreage in the prolific Spraberry/Wolfcamp section of the Permian and low average royalty and acreage costs. Pioneer has been praised by equity analysts for its active hedging programme that aims to protect cash flow from short-term volatility in oil prices. But the company reported losses (negative net income) of $273 million in 2015 and $556 million in 2016. Pioneer reported a further loss of $42 million in the first quarter of 2017, despite the substantial rise in oil prices compared the same period a year earlier. Continental lost $354 million in 2015 and $400 million in 2016 before just about breaking even with net income of less than $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. EOG Resources, another prominent producer, reported a loss of $4.5 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2016 before turning a small profit of $29 million in first quarter 2017. Since the first quarter, WTI prices have fallen by more than $3.50 per barrel, or 7 percent, from an average of $51.78 in January-March to just $48.14 in April-June, intensifying pressure on shale producers even further. Many shale firms have hedging programmes that should protect them from the decline in prices in the short term, but most have hedged only a small proportion of next year's production. The current calendar strip allows producers to lock in WTI prices at just $50 for 2018, so most are waiting for a renewed rise in forward prices. But every week they wait, their hedging cover declines by around 2 percent, assuming they have an average hedge maturity of 12 months. In the meantime, producers are braced for cost inflation, with the major oilfield services firms pressing for price increases by the end of the year and into 2018. Since WTI prices peaked in late February, shale producers have added more than 150 extra rigs drilling for oil. The rig count is up by 430 over the last 12 months even though WTI prices are now $3 per barrel lower. But share prices for all the major producers are sliding. Pioneer's share price is down almost 15 percent since the start of the year. Continental is down 39 percent. EOG has fallen 13 percent. Many shale producers seem to be relying on OPEC to bail them out by cutting its own output further to drive WTI prices back above $50 per barrel. But it not be rational for OPEC to cut output if the only consequence was to encourage continued growth in U.S. shale. Key OPEC producers appear unenthusiastic about further cuts. If something cannot go on forever, it will stop. The slide in oil prices over the last four months is sending a signal to shale firms about the need to moderate drilling and production programmes. Either the drilling boom moderates very soon, or WTI prices are likely to fall below $40 per barrel to make it stop.

Berkshire will take a roughly 7 percent ownership stake, worth about $17 billion based on Bank of America's closing price of $24.32 on Thursday. The transaction will make Bank of America one of Berkshire's largest equity investments, joining Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the nation's third-largest bank. It was made possible by Bank of America's June 28 decision to boost its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 7.5 cents, after passing the Federal Reserve's latest  stress test  of its capacity to weather difficult markets. Shares of Bank of America were up 16 cents at $24.48 in early trading on Friday. Berkshire will exercise warrants to acquire the 700 million common shares when Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America increases its dividend, expected in the third quarter. It will swap the $5 billion of Bank of America preferred shares it bought in August 2011 for the common stock, in a cash-free exchange. Warren Buffett, chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, speaks at a National Auto Dealers Association event in New York March 31, 2015.

Berkshire is also the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, which sends Buffett close to $800 million of annual dividends.

Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, accepted Buffett's investment when many investors worried whether the lender would have enough capital. The bank was only about midway through a multi-year process to clean up its balance sheet, litigation and regulatory probes, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co. That process cost more than $70 billion. Buffett has often praised Moynihan's leadership, telling CNBC in September 2015 that Moynihan resuscitated a bank that had been a  terrible mess.

The strategy worked: the franchise quickly became known as a hot place to hang out, drink signature Slurpees and use free wifi. What failed was a plan to attract repeat customers willing to spend money. Eight years after the chain's first Jakarta store opened, PT Modern Internasional Tbk, the owner of the 7-Eleven master franchise in Indonesia, is closing all its domestic outlets, which totaled 161 at the end of 2016. The company last week cited  limited resources  as a reason for the closure. Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd, the ultimate parent of the global 7-Eleven chain, said it would  search for someone to take on the franchise and hope to restart business soon.   Indonesia is an important country for us. This is not the end for 7-Eleven's business,  a spokesman said by phone, adding the closure had  almost no impact  on its results. In addition to thrifty Indonesian consumers, industry participants also blame intense competition and a 2015 nationwide ban on alcohol sales at minimarkets for the franchise's struggles. A view inside an empty 7-Eleven convenience store is seen in Jakarta, Indonesia June 27, 2017.Agoes Rudianto The concept is interesting, but is it profitable?  said Tutum Rahanta, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Retailers Association.  The crowd is created by people who just hang out, but those who want to shop and who can really generate profits don't go there.  Consumers also tend to associate 7-Eleven's competitors such as Indomaret and Alfamart with daily necessities, which serve as a buffer against the alcohol sales ban, Rahanta said, adding 7-Eleven's reach was limited to Jakarta. Last year, Indomaret and Alfamart accounted for 51.2 percent and 38.5 percent of the retail value for Indonesian convenience stores, respectively, according to research firm Euromonitor International. 7-Eleven had a 0.7 percent share. Modern reported a nearly 24 percent fall in its net sales for 7-Eleven to 675.3 billion rupiah ($50.7 million) in 2016 from a year earlier. Modern also has other businesses in medical image and photocopy equipments. Modern's attempt to sell the 7-Eleven franchise and other assets to a unit of PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Tbk for 1 trillion rupiah also failed last week.  While 7-Eleven's local demise is a product of commercial realities, its closure has still come as a shock to fans.  It was always full of people,  said Amanda Viega, a 20-year-old university student who would frequently catch up with friends at 7-Eleven and is now looking for alternative venues.

Narendra Modi's visit to Israel will only strengthen its occupation of Palestine,  said Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of India's federal parliament from a regional group that promotes Muslim rights. Burgeoning Relationship In previous decades, under the left-leaning Congress Party, former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was a regular visitor to New Delhi, pictured hugging then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when the two were championing the Non-Alignment Movement.

High compliance by Gulf producers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait helped keep OPEC's adherence with its supply curbs at a historically high 92 percent in June, compared with 95 percent in May, the survey found. But extra oil from Nigeria and Libya, exempted from the cut because conflict curbed their output, means supply by the 13 OPEC members originally part of the deal has risen far above their implied production target. The recovery adds to the challenge the OPEC-led effort to support the market is facing from a persistent inventory glut. If the recovery lasts, calls could grow within OPEC for the exempt countries to be brought into the production deal.  The rise in OPEC production will further delay the point at which balance is restored on the oil market,  said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. As part of a deal with Russia and other non-members, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries originally pledged to reduce output by about 1.2 million bpd for six months from Jan. 1. Oil prices have gained some ground but high stocks and rising U.S. output kept them in check. To provide additional support for prices, the producers decided in May to prolong the deal until March 2018.  June's biggest rise came from Nigeria, where output extended a recovery after being curtailed by militant attacks on oil installations. The second-biggest was from Libya. Nigerian output is expected to rise further in coming weeks. Planned exports in August are scheduled to reach at least 2 million bpd, a 17-month high. In Libya, output was on average higher despite fluctuation and has now exceeded 1 million bpd, a four-year high. Production remains some way short of the 1.6 million bpd Libya pumped before the 2011 civil war. Saudi Arabia pumped 40,000 bpd more, the survey found,  although its compliance remained above 100 percent. Even with June's increase, the curb achieved by OPEC's top producer is 564,000 bpd, well above the target cut of 486,000 bpd. Aside from a rise in Angolan exports, no other significant change in output occurred elsewhere in OPEC.  OPEC announced a production target of 32.5 million bpd last year, which was based on low figures for Libya and Nigeria. The target includes Indonesia, which has since left, and does not include Equatorial Guinea, the latest country to join OPEC.  The Libyan and Nigerian increases mean OPEC output in June averaged 32.57 million bpd, about 820,000 bpd above its supply target, adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.  Equatorial Guinea, which became an OPEC member in late May, has now been added to the Reuters survey. The country's crude production is estimated at 150,000 bpd, which brings total OPEC production in June to 32.72 million bpd. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion that could still lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by the end of the year. The S&P; 500 and the Dow recorded their worst daily percentage drop in about six weeks on Thursday as a recent decline in technology shares deepened and outweighed strength in bank shares.

We have what appears to be some sector rotation going on, and its occurring at the end of the quarter and its adding to the volatility.  Towards the end of the second quarter, the market witnessed a few volatile days. On Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its best day since Nov. 7. Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's 8-percent gain this year, pulled back recently as some investors questioned the sector's high valuations.

The remainder of 2017 looks likely to bring more of the same, said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.  More growth, more market appreciation and more normalization across the board. After the turmoil in recent months and years, this is not a bad place to be.  Oil prices climbed for the seventh straight session on Friday in their longest bull run since April, but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998.

The European Commission penalized U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009 because it tried to squeeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The fine was a record for an individual company for an antitrust violation and was only eclipsed this week by Google's 2.4-billion-euro penalty. Intel challenged the it in court. Judges at the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ) will announce their verdict on Sept. 6, a court spokeswoman said, ending a saga that has stretched back more than a decade. Intel won backing from ECJ court adviser Nils Wahl last year who doubted if the company's actions had really harmed competition. The top court follows such non-binding recommendations in four out of five cases. In 2014, a lower court however backed the Commission.  Google, penalized on Tuesday by the EU competition authority for unfairly promoting its shopping service at the expense of rivals, will be keenly watching the verdict for pointers on how to fight its legal battle.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and travel links with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional foe Iran, in allegations that have ignited a regional crisis between the U.S. allies. Offshore trade of the riyal has become increasingly volatile and illiquid as a result, raising risks for banks. A spokeswoman for Britain's Lloyds Banking Group said a  third-party supplier  which handles its foreign exchange service had ceased trading in Qatar's riyal as of June 21.  This currency is no longer available for sale or buy-back across our high street banks including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Halifax,  she said. Tesco Bank said it had halted dealings in the riyal, while Barclays stopped trading riyals for retail customers but continued the service for corporate customers, a source said. Royal Bank of Scotland said it had stopped trading riyals for retail customers. Banks from the four Arab states that have cut ties with Qatar reduced or halted riyal transactions earlier this month, as have some other countries. Some big international banks have continued riyal business, however; a spokeswoman for HSBC said on Friday that the bank was still providing riyals for high street customers. This week the riyal traded between offshore banks as low as 3.81 to the U.S. dollar, its lowest level this decade and more than 4 percent below its peg of 3.64 to the dollar. Most bankers in the Gulf do not think the peg will break; onshore, the Qatari central bank has continued to provide ample supplies of dollars near 3.6415 under its peg mechanism. The world's biggest liquefied natural gas exporter has huge reserves with which it could defend its currency. The Arab states opposing Qatar have set a deadline of around Monday next week - officials have not publicly specified the exact time - for Doha to agree to demands such as shutting television channel Al Jazeera and reducing ties to Iran. Publicly, Doha has shown little sign of complying, and the four states have said they could impose fresh sanctions if their demands are not met. This threat pushed the cost of insuring Qatari sovereign debt against default to a 16-month high on Friday. In an effort to reassure markets that the riyal was still widely traded overseas, the Qatari central bank declared in the early hours of Friday that it would guarantee all dealings for customers inside and outside Qatar.  Qatari riyal's exchange rate is absolutely stable against the U.S. dollar, and its exchangeability inside and outside Qatar is guaranteed at any time at the official price,  the central bank said, calling reports that some exchange companies had stopped buying the riyal  baseless . So far, however, the central bank has not taken the step which bankers say may be necessary to stabilise the offshore currency market: massive dollar-selling intervention. Some Gulf bankers believe the central bank thinks such radical action is unnecessary; Qatar gets most of its dollar supplies from oil and gas exports, which are controlled by the government, so it does not need to fear offshore trade will suck dollars away from onshore companies which need them. A source at an investment manager in London, however, said intervention to drive the offshore riyal rate back to 3.64 could be dangerously expensive for the central bank.  In a month, two months' time, we would start to see the reserves numbers going down massively, and that could start a panic on the currency.  The alternative to intervention is  the currency grinds down weaker and weaker from here,  he added. Exchange company Travelex said on Thursday it had resumed purchasing the Qatari riyal globally after a brief suspension  due to business challenges . But some exchange houses are demanding increasingly punitive rates because of the risks. Two exchange houses in Dubai told Reuters this week they would buy 1,000 Qatari riyals for only 710 or 720 UAE dirhams – far below the 970 dirhams which they offered before the crisis.

Umbrellas, a symbol of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were also banned but purple alternatives were provided.  The roughly 1,500 guests were told to pull down their souvenir umbrellas, even as temperatures sweltered above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), when Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived to inspect a military parade. Security personnel also confiscated a pen, taxi receipts, a 4G dongle, water, mints and pain relief tablets and other medication from Reuters reporters. Several correspondents had their notebooks searched. A list of prohibited items provided to reporters ahead of the visit also included heroin, marijuana, psychotropic substances, sunscreen, cosmetics, microwave transmission equipment, animals and plants.

Canada's economy expanded by 0.2 percent in April after a 0.5 percent increase in March, Statistics Canada said. The gain matched analysts' estimates. It leaves the economy on track to grow at a 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter, which is  more than enough to justify the recent change in tone from the Bank of Canada,  Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets said in a research note. Hawkish comments earlier this week from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz have raised expectations for an interest rate hike as early as next month. Chances of a Bank of Canada rate hike in July have increased to one-in-two from just 20 percent after subdued inflation data last week, data from the overnight index swaps market shows. Oil prices climbed for a seventh straight session in their longest bull run since April but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998. U.S. crude prices were up 0.87 percent at $45.32 a barrel. At 9:14 a.m. ET (1314 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2991 to the greenback, or 76.98 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent. The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3011, while it touched its strongest since Sept. 9 at C$1.2947. Investors will digest the Bank of Canada's business outlook report, due for release at 10:30 a.m. ET (1430 GMT). An improvement in business investment or sales expectations would underscore the central bank's recent shift to a more hawkish stance. Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve. Global bond markets have been pressured this week by the likelihood that central banks will become less accommodative. The two-year price dipped 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 1.083 percent and the 10-year declined 26 Canadian cents to yield 1.737 percent.

Bond sales from corporate and sovereign issuers across developing nations have risen to just over $355 billion in the first six months of 2017 -- the strongest half year performance in at least 10 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. All global regions saw an increase in both the volume and amount of deals, the data showed, with issuers in the Asia-Pacific region making up nearly 50 percent of all debt sales.  It's an alliance of convenience,  said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.  Emerging markets want to borrow and on the other side are people who want the yield.  Fund managers, faced with low interest rates across much of the developed world, have been ploughing money into emerging markets for months, at levels similar to those seen during the so-called commodity super cycle. Yet the prospect of policymakers in the developed world hiking interest rates or withdrawing stimulus has also prompted issuance, said Patrick Esteruelas at Emso Asset Management.  It makes sense to lock in long-term funding at favourable rates,  said Esteruelas, adding the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump's reflationary policies had contributed to the mix.  If all those policies had actually materialised, emerging markets would have been on a different planet, so there was a lot of front loading before the new Trump term got going.  Issuance from emerging market governments, which account for around a third of debt sales, is expected to continue at a fast pace, said JPMorgan in its emerging market outlook sent to clients earlier in the month. A number of governments joined the latest issuance wave. Egypt sold $3 billion in May -- twice as much as expected -- following a five-year hiatus after the Arab Spring uprising. Argentina surprised markets with a 100-year issue in June, of which it sold $2.75 billion just over a year after emerging from its latest default. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely-used emerging debt indexes, expects total sovereign debt issuance from developing countries to amount to $143 billion in 2017, compared to just under $130 billion last year. It estimated corporate debt issuance across emerging markets would amount to $380 billion in 2017, with just over $208 billion already issued by early June.

The bond was originally sold in 2014 for $3.25 billion with a 8.75 percent coupon. In 2014 the country was locked out of the international capital markets due to a debt default that was resolved last year, soon after Macri came to power in late 2015. He promised to bring Argentina back into the global financial system after eight years of heavy intervention in the economy under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, a free-spending populist who had an antagonistic relationship with international investors. Argentina offered $2.75 billion of a 100-year bond this month that sold out quickly, and the Macri administration increased its overall 2017 foreign currency bond issuance target to $12.75 billion. But the promised wave of bricks-and-mortar investment has been slow to come and the economy remains sluggish, weighed down by inflation that, while slowing, remains above 20 percent. Macri has increased welfare and public works spending ahead of the mid-term elections four months from now. That outcome will determine the power he has to get a more market-friendly reform program through Congress during the second half of his term. The success of that program will influence his chances of being re-elected in 2019.

U.S. crude prices were up 0.87 percent at $45.32 a barrel. At 9:14 a.m. ET (1314 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2991 to the greenback, or 76.98 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent. The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3011, while it touched its strongest since Sept. 9 at C$1.2947. Investors will digest the Bank of Canada's business outlook report, due for release at 10:30 a.m. ET (1430 GMT). An improvement in business investment or sales expectations would underscore the central bank's recent shift to a more hawkish stance. Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve. Global bond markets have been pressured this week by the likelihood that central banks will become less accommodative. The two-year price dipped 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 1.083 percent and the 10-year declined 26 Canadian cents to yield 1.737 percent. The gap between the 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 1 basis point to a spread of -28.3 basis points, its narrowest since Nov. 10, as Canadian bonds underperformed.

In a statement, Vanke confirmed the acquisition first reported by state media on Thursday. The companies involved were subsidiaries of Guangdong International Trust & Investment which in 1999 became China's first non-bank financial institution to enter bankruptcy. The auction was the first to use an exchange platform to dispose of property as part of a legal procedure, Xinhua news agency reported, citing Guangdong Assets and Equity Exchange Group. Vanke said on Friday the principal assets involve 16 land parcels in prime districts of Guangzhou, a top-tier city in southern China, with an expected total gross floor area of 2.1 million square metres. The company said it plans to develop the land into residential property, commercial property, hotels and offices.  In view of the location of the properties and the potential value of the projects, the Board believes it is a valuable opportunity for the Company to enhance its land bank in Guangzhou.  China's second-largest property developer by sales bid 23 percent over the assets' listed price, beating bids from eight peers, Xinhua reported.  Developers in China are increasing resorting to mergers-and-acquisitions to build land banks as city governments impose restrictions on land auctions.

They are his pride and joy, nurtured and pampered to perfection. Yet if the coming fortnight passes off with barely a mention of the greensward, he will be a happy man.  I would hate it if we got to a men's or women's final, match point and the court was involved in that winning point because that's not what it's there for,  Stubley told Reuters as his staff liberally watered Court One on a sweltering day, 10 days before the start of the world's premier tennis tournament.  For us, if the courts are not mentioned for two weeks - job done. We provide the stage, the players provide the stories.  The process of preparing the courts began almost as soon as the final ball was struck at last year's championships. The surfaces are shaved, re-levelled and re-seeded, then Mother Nature takes over for a while.  It's a case of managing the courts as and when they come back all the way through winter and spring,  Stubley, working at his 23rd Wimbledon and sixth as head groundsman since the green-fingered Eddie Seward signed off in 2012.  Now we are in the most critical period when the courts are 99 percent ready.  The biggest challenge is posed by the British climate. Record-breaking June temperatures were replaced by a deluge of rain the week before the tournament's start - keeping Stubley and his 17 full-time groundstaff on their toes.  It's like a rollercoaster ride,  he said.  You need to dry the courts out and keep the plant just on the point of wilting. Happy Medium The grass surface of Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club during the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Britain July 3, 2016.Stefan Wermuth It's about finding the happy medium to make the court is tournament ready so this week and next is our biggest challenge.  I'm a born worrier. I'll wake in the night thinking about the weather forecast. We don't want too much rain and we don't want it too hot - although warmer weather is better because we can control the irrigation overnight.  For anyone battling to maintain their back garden lawn, the magnitude of the challenge facing Stubley and his crew is mind-boggling - although with 600 tournaments' worth of experience between them, there appears little that can throw them. The scientific attention to detail is impressive. While players fret about rackets strings, diet, footwear and biometric data, Stubley is armed with moisture readers and instruments to test court hardness - and of course the latest weather bulletin from the Met Office. Contrary to popular belief, the playing characteristics of Wimbledon's courts don't come from the top few centimeters of grass - but rather the clay-based loam beneath.  It's something akin to a cricket wicket,  Stubley said.  It's rolled very compact to get a nice hard surface. The grass part on top is the aesthetic look and holds it together but the characteristics are coming from the soil.  Unlike the other grand slams that are played on cement or clay, Wimbledon's courts are alive. Making each court play the same is the key to player satisfaction, said Stubley.  The biggest challenge is consistency. That also means the practice courts.  One topic that crops up more regularly than most is a perceived  slowing down  of Wimbledon's lawns since a new perennial rye grass blend was introduced in 2002 - producing a less skiddy surface. Stubley rejects the claim made by the likes of former British number one Tim Henman, among others, that the grass has lost its zip to the detriment of the serve and volleyers.  The speed is more or less the same. It's more about the bounce now. We have a firmer, harder surface now with less of the energy of the ball being absorbed into the grass. It should suit everybody,  he said. And a word for those envious gardeners attending the fortnight?  Cut little and often, and a well-balanced diet.

(PPC) , Greece's dominant power utility, sees core profit of around 700 million euros ($799 million) this year, down from about 1 billion euros in 2016, its chairman said on Friday. The drop in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) this year is driven by the spin-off of the company's power grid operator this month, Manolis Panagiotakis told a parliamentary committee. PPC, which is 51 percent-owned by the state, posted on Tuesday a first-quarter net loss of 67.5 million euros but said it expected to return to profit in coming quarters. The utility currently has an 87 percent share of the country's retail market and aims to reduce it to below 50 percent by the end of 2019 under the terms of Greece's third international bailout. Another bailout commitment stipulates that PPC will sell about 40 percent of its coal-fired generation capacity by June 2018. Greece has said PPC and the European Commission are expected to specify the plants that will sold by next month. Panagiotakis said PPC's plan with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to build a new coal-fired plant in northern Greece would go ahead, even if the plant is among those to be divested.

Carige, the country's ninth-biggest bank, has been told by the European Central Bank it needs to raise capital and shed bad loans, but its restructuring has been delayed by a governance spat that led to the appointment of a new chief executive in June. It holds a board meeting to discuss its plans on Monday. With assets of 26 billion euros ($29.7 billion) and a capital gap of 600 million euros, Carige is much less of a headache than the two Veneto-based banks Italy put into liquidation on Sunday in a controversial deal largely funded with taxpayer money. As part of that deal, the government is paying 5.2 billion euros to Intesa Sanpaolo to take on Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca and giving it guarantees for up to 12 billion euros to shield it from any unexpected loss. Rome says the final bill for the state of the Veneto wind-down will be much smaller than feared and it could even end up making a profit over time. But coupled with a 6.6 billion euros state bailout for Monte dei Paschi, which should be finalised in the next month, the funds earmarked for the Veneto banks mean Italy has already potentially used up all of the 20 billion euros it set aside in December to deal with its weakest lenders. Bankers say Italy has finally dealt with its three biggest banking flashpoints, removing a systemic threat that has hung over the whole industry for years.  Things seem to be looking up at last,  the chief executive of a leading Italian bank said, echoing widespread relief within the industry.  Of course there is still a mountain of bad loans, but that is being gradually whittled down. Carige is a problem but it's a lot more manageable than the Veneto banks.  New Boss Heavily exposed to the economy of Italy's north-western Liguria region, Carige has lost nearly 2 billion euros in the past four years because of big loan writedowns and slumping revenues. It appointed former UniCredit's executive Paolo Fiorentino as its new boss on June 21 after the bank's top investor, a local businessman, pushed out his predecessor after just over a year in the job due to a row over how to fix the bank's problems. Three board members have resigned since in disagreement. The upheaval is likely to delay a capital increase that former CEO Guido Bastianini had been pencilled in for this summer - the bank's third cash call since 2014. Carige had a core capital ratio of 10.9 percent at the end of March, below the 11.25 percent minimum threshold set by the ECB. The bank has also been asked by the regulator to halve its gross doubtful loans to 3.7 billion euros by the end of 2019. However unlike the two Veneto lenders, Carige has no immediate liquidity needs. Its liquidity coverage ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to face cash outflows, stood at 119 percent at end-March, above the ECB threshold of 90 percent. Carige announced earlier in June the transfer of 938 million euro of 'sofferenze', the worst kind of bad loans, to a special vehicle that will sell them on repackaged as securities with a state guarantee on the senior tranche. It is not clear whether the bank will proceed with the spin-off of a further 2.4 billion euros in bad loans that Bastianini had been working on.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent in May from April and, when food and energy were excluded, was up 0.1 percent.     The 12-month reading for the so-called core inflation has been slowing since February, although Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier this month said the dip was likely temporary.                  “It’s not enough to make you optimistic about either delaying the Fed or about the potential for actual inflation,” said Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     Fed officials have indicated another rate hike this year is likely, while the U.S. central bank is also likely to begin slowly reducing its bond holdings.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last down 4/32 in price to yield 2.28 percent, up from 2.27 percent late on Thursday.     The yields have risen from 2.13 percent on Tuesday on concerns that European central banks would also be less accommodative at the same time as the Fed continues its tightening path.     European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday the ECB might tweak its stimulus so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers. Sources on Wednesday, however, said he had not intended to signal imminent tightening.                               Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity.                  Next Friday’s U.S. employment report for June will be the next major economic release to give guidance on the Fed’s next rate hike.

The subway operator's control over China's second largest property developer was affirmed this month after it raised its stake to 29.38 percent, ending a bitter struggle for boardroom control by surpassing financial conglomerate Baoneng Group that had sought to oust Vanke's management. Some current and former employees have said that Vanke, since it started talks with Shenzhen Metro last year, has gradually been adopting some practices that pointed to it becoming more like a state firm.  We will carry out our role as a cornerstone investor,  Shenzhen Metro Chairman Lin Maode said at a Vanke shareholder meeting in Shenzen on Friday.  We'll be a long-term strategic investor and safeguard Vanke's interest.  Lin and two other senior executives from Shenzhen Metro were approved as Vanke's non-executive directors at the meeting. Vanke said it did not receive any director nomination from Baoneng, which still has a 25 percent stake. Vanke's founder Wang Shi, 66, announced last week he would step down from the board as chairman after the years-long corporate power struggle came to end. Vanke said in a statement on the Shenzhen stock exchange late on Friday that the company board had elected President Yu Liang, a 28-year Vanke veteran, as chairman and CEO, while Wang will become emeritus chairman. The property developer will work more closely with Shenzhen Metro in the future, Yu said at the shareholders meeting. Vanke has been stepping up efforts to implement a 'railway plus property' strategy in China's Tier 1-2 cities, which involves building properties around railway networks. Yu said he expects Vanke's 2017 sales to be higher than a year ago, which were at 228.9 billion yuan. Home prices levelled off in China's biggest cities in May but continued to climb nationwide, indicating demand remains resilient despite a series of government measures to keep the market from overheating. On Thursday, Vanke won an auction to buy the equity interests and creditors' rights of companies holding assets including 16 land parcels in the southern city of Guangzhou for 55.1 billion yuan ($8.13 billion).

New U.S. sanctions put in place by former President Barack Obama last December - part of a broad suite of actions taken in response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election - had made it a crime for American companies to have any business relationship with the FSB, or Federal Security Service. U.S. authorities had accused the FSB, along with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, of orchestrating cyber attacks on the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a charge Moscow denies. But the sanctions also threatened to imperil the Russian sales operations of Western tech companies. Under a little-understood arrangement, the FSB doubles as a regulator charged with approving the import to Russia of almost all technology that contains encryption, which is used in both sophisticated hardware as well as products like cellphones and laptops. Worried about the sales impact, business industry groups, including the U.S.-Russia Business Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, contacted U.S. officials at the American embassy in Moscow and the Treasury, State and Commerce departments, according to five people with direct knowledge of the lobbying effort. The campaign, which began in January and proved successful in a matter of weeks, has not been previously reported. In recent years, Western technology companies have acceded to increasing demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets, including source code, Reuters reported last week. Russia's information technology market is expected to reach $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation. The sanctions would have meant the Russian market was  dead for U.S. electronics” said Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, who argued against the new restrictions. “Every second Russian has an iPhone, iPad, so they would all switch to Samsungs,  he said. A spokesman for the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. A State Department official said Washington considered a range of factors before amending the FSB sanction and regularly works with U.S. companies to assess the impact of such policies. The lobbyists argued the sanction could have stopped the sale of cars, medical devices and heavy equipment, all of which also often contain encrypted software, according to a person involved in the lobbying effort. The goal of the sanctions was to sever U.S. business dealings with the FSB - not end American technology exports to Russia entirely, the industry groups argued. “The sanction was against a government agency that has many functions, only one of them being hacking the U.S. elections,” said Rodzianko. The lobbyists assembled representatives from the tech, automotive and manufacturing sectors to make the case to the U.S. Treasury Department, said the person involved in the lobbying effort. The industry groups did not argue against the intent of the sanction but asked for a narrow exception that would allow them to continue to seek regulatory approvals from the FSB while still keeping in place the broader ban on doing business with the spy agency.  Punishment for Very Bad Acts  The industry groups represent a number of technology firms with a large presence in Russia, including Cisco and Microsoft. Reuters was unable to determine which companies were directly involved in the lobbying. Microsoft said it did not ask for changes to the sanctions. In a statement, Cisco said it also did not seek any changes to the sanction but had asked the Treasury Department for clarification on how it applied. In order to get encrypted technology into Russia, companies need to obtain the blessing of the FSB, a process that can sometimes take months or even years of negotiation. Before granting that approval, the agency can demand sensitive security data about the product, including source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment. The United States has accused Russia of a growing number of cyber attacks against the West. U.S. officials say they are concerned that Moscow’s reviews of product secrets could be used to find vulnerabilities to hack into the products. Some U.S. government officials rejected the industry groups' arguments. They openly embraced the prospect of any ripple effect that cut further trade with Russia. Kevin Wolf was assistant secretary at the Commerce Department and oversaw export control policy when the FSB sanction was put in place. Wolf said within days of the sanction taking effect, Commerce received numerous calls from industry groups and companies warning of the unintended consequences. But for Wolf, who was  furious  with Moscow over the alleged cyber attacks, any additional curbs on trade with Russia was a bonus rather than an unintended downside.  I said, 'Great, terrific, fuck 'em ... The whole point is to interfere with trade',  recounted Wolf. “The sanction was meant to impose pain (on Russia) and send a signal as punishment for very bad acts.  Wolf left the Commerce Department when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. Other officials felt that the impact on legitimate trade was too great. “The intention of the sanction was not to cut off tech trade with Russia,” said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the process. The lobbyists had also argued that since the sanctions only applied to U.S. technology makers, it would put them at a disadvantage to European and Asian companies who would still be able to interact with the FSB and sell products in Russia.  We were asking for a narrow technical fix that would give a fair deal for American companies,  Dan Russell, CEO of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, said in an interview. The advocacy worked. State and Treasury officials began working to tweak the sanction in January before Obama left office, according to people involved in the process. On Feb. 2, the Treasury Department created an exception to the sanction, about two weeks after Trump took office, to allow tech companies to continue to obtain approvals from the FSB.

The southern African nation, which dumped its currency for the U.S. dollar in 2009, is grappling with shortages of cash, while dollars have largely disappeared from circulation. President Robert Mugabe's government last November introduced a surrogate currency known as the  bond note  at par with the dollar but that has not ended shortages. More than $140 million in bond notes have been circulated to date. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange's (ZSE) industrial index closed Friday's trade at 195.97 points, up from 144.5 points at the start of the year, figures from the exchange showed. This is the highest level the index has reached since August 2014. The ZSE's market capitalisation ended the half year at $5.77 billion, up from $4 billion at the start of 2017. Traders said the ZSE's rally, which started in March, had been helped by low money market rates, between 2 and 5 percent, forcing investors to seek better returns from stocks. Gains in heavyweight stocks like brewer Delta Corporation , manufacturer Innscor Africa and telecoms firm Econet Wireless helped propel the main index. Investors are also looking for above-inflation returns as prices rise. Analysts said dual pricing by most businesses, which charge more for bond notes and plastic and mobile money payments and less for U.S. dollars, was stoking inflation. The World Bank has forecast Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation will reach 3.2 percent by December and accelerate to 9.6 percent next year.

A district court in September found the five players from the Cuban national team guilty of aggravated rape of a woman, while they were in Finland in July 2016 for a World League tournament prior to the Rio Olympics.  In the earlier hearing, the four others were sentenced to five years in prison, and Sosa Sierra to three and a half years. All the men denied the charges, either disputing any sexual intercourse with the woman, or by saying it had happened by mutual consent, and appealed the verdict. On Friday, the court of appeals rejected the charge against Sosa Sierra for an absence of evidence, and acquitted him. Two of the players, Osmany Santiago Uriarte Mestre and Ricardo Norberto Calvo Manzano, were found guilty of aggravated rape, but their sentences were lowered to four and to three and a half years in prison. The court also cut the prison terms of the two other men, Abraham Alfonso Gavilan and Rolando Cepeda Abreu, finding Gavilan guilty of a coerced sexual act and Abreu of rape.  Gavilan's sentence was cut to one year and three months, and Abreu's to two and a half years.

It also highlights the risks. Taught by her brother to fire an AK-47 at 15 and encouraged by her mother to fight for Syrian Kurdish autonomy, she says she has killed 50 people since she took up arms in Syria's six-year-old civil war, fighting first al Qaeda, then crossing into Iraq to help Kurds there against Islamic State. Now 26, she leads a 15-woman unit hunting down the hardline group in its global headquarters Raqqa, speeding through streets once controlled by the militants in a pick-up truck as fellow fighters comb through ruined buildings for booby traps. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), spearheaded by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, have taken several parts of the northern Syrian town since their assault began this month. This week U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Washington may arm the SDF for future battles against Islamic State while taking back weapons it no longer needs. The plan is the  headline  of a still-unfinished stabilization plan for Syria by the Trump administration, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The risk is that it causes new instability in a war in which outside powers are playing ever larger roles. The U.S.-YPG relationship has infuriated Syria's northern neighbor Turkey, a NATO ally which says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, designated terrorist by both Ankara and Washington for its insurgency against the Turkish state. Turkey has sent troops into Syria, partly to attack Islamic State, but also to keep the YPG, which controls Kurdish-populated areas of northern Syria, from moving into an Arab and Turkmen area that would give it control of the whole frontier. On Wednesday Ankara said its artillery had destroyed YPG targets after local Turkish-backed forces came under attack. Turkey has recently sent reinforcements into Syria, according to the rebel groups it backs, prompting SDF concern it plans to attack Kurdish YPG forces. The SDF warned on Thursday of a  big possibility of open, fierce confrontation .  We'll Do What We Can  Syrian Kurdish leaders say they want autonomy in Syria, like that enjoyed by Kurds in Iraq, rather than independence or to interfere in neighboring states. They say Turkish warnings that YPG weapons could end up in PKK hands are unjustified. “We were the victims of the nation state model and we have no desire to reproduce this model,  said Khaled Eissa, European representative of the PYD, the YPG's political affiliate. Sheen Ibrahim, Kurdish fighter from the People's Protection Units (YPG) looks for drones operated by Islamic State militants in Raqqa, Syria June 21, 2017.Goran TomasevicIbrahim and other fighters interviewed by Reuters said they were not terrorists but would “stand up” to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. “Turkey is fighting us,  Ibrahim said.  Anyone who fights us, we will fight.  Washington is working to calm tensions over its relationship with the YPG, which is also backed by Russia.  There is absolute transparency between Turkey and the United States on that subject,  said Major General Rupert Jones, the British deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State. But disarmament will not be easy, judging by the comments of YPG fighters on the ground.  We will not give up our weapons,  said a sniper aiming at Islamic State positions, who only gave her first name, Barkaneurin.  We need them to defend ourselves.  Fellow fighter Maryam Mohamed agreed.  Erdogan is our biggest enemy, we cannot hand over our weapons,  she said. One of the U.S. officials said Washington did not know exactly how many weapons the YPG has because some Arabs had joined its ranks, taking U.S.-supplied weapons with them, when their groups suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Slideshow (6 Images)“Loyalties are as variable as the battle lines and sometimes follow them,  the official said. Asked about weapons recovery, Mattis, in his first public remarks on the issue, said:  We'll do what we can,  while YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud emphasized the target was Islamic State.  We are fighting a global terrorist group,  he said. Battlefield victory is tantalizingly close. U.S.-backed forces in neighboring Iraq announced on Thursday they had retaken Mosul, Islamic State's largest stronghold and the twin capital, with Raqqa, of the  caliphate  it declared in 2014. But the U.S. official and two others who also declined to be named, noted other huge obstacles to stabilizing Syria they said the administration was papering over. Rebuilding Raqqa will need billions of dollars and an unprecedented level of compromise among groups long hostile to each other, all three officials said. One said Iranian forces backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were poised to exploit any setbacks. Kurds are spearheading the attack on Raqqa, but a mainly Arab force is planned to maintain security in the overwhelmingly Arab town thereafter. While Kurds and Arabs fight side by side against Islamic State, with the militants' self-proclaimed caliphate shrinking, competition for territory will intensify. “We are getting ourselves into the middle of another potential mess we don’t understand,” one of the U.S. officials said.

The report, seen by Reuters on Thursday, was circulated to members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but was not made public. The attack on April 4, when dozens of people were killed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province, was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. It prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.  Unfortunately, after a first reading of this document we are forced to note that its conclusions are based on extremely doubtful evidence,  TASS news agency quoted Russia's Foreign Ministry as saying.  The contents of the report compiled by a special commission of the OPCW, are largely biased, which makes us think that the activities of this structure serve a political order,  TASS quoted the ministry as saying. Russia and its allies in the administration of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deny that his forces deployed chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun. Moscow has said the attack was carried out by Assad's opponents, who, Russian officials alleged, made it look as though it was the work of government forces.

The parliament voted by 393 votes in favour of same-sex marriage to 226 against. The measure will likely be signed into law by the president some time after July 7. Many other European countries, including France, Britain and Spain, have already legalised same-sex marriage. The newly-elected Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat has also pledged to legalise gay marriage in the country. Here are the facts about same-sex marriage around the world: * Aside from Germany, same-sex marriage is legal in 22 countries : Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Greenland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay, United States. * In some of these countries, such as Mexico and Britain, marriage is only open to same-sex couples in some regions. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where same-sex marriage is not allowed. * The first country to legalise same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001. * In Africa, where homosexuality is a crime in many countries and can lead to imprisonment or the death penalty, South Africa alone has granted the same access to gay couples. Same-sex marriage legislation came into force there in 2006. * There are no countries in Asia that allow same-sex couples to marry, or enter civil unions of any kind. In May, Taiwan's constitutional court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, the first such ruling in Asia. * Almost one in three adults globally believe people of the same sex should be allowed to marry, a survey of almost 100,000 people in 65 countries showed in 2016.

U.S. consumer spending rose modestly in May and inflation cooled, pointing to a slow-but-steady economic expansion that could still lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by the end of the year. The S&P; 500 and the Dow recorded their worst daily percentage drop in about six weeks on Thursday as a recent decline in technology shares deepened and outweighed strength in bank shares.

Towards the end of the second quarter, the market witnessed a few volatile days. On Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its best day since Nov. 7.

Crude oil futures on Friday were on track for their biggest weekly gain since mid-May, ending five weeks of losses with prices underpinned by a decline in U.S. output.

Bayer, which is bracing for the EU Commission to go into an in-depth antitrust assessment of the merger, said in a statement on Friday it would work closely with the authorities, reaffirming its goal to wrap up the transaction by the end of 2017.  We can confirm receipt of the notification. The provisional deadline for the Commission to take a decision is 7 August,  an EU Commission spokeswoman said. Bayer, whose request for U.S. approval is pending, last month pledged to make major asset sales to see the deal through, putting the Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses on the auction block. BASF said it was hoping for a bargain among antitrust-related selloffs and might overcome its traditional reluctance to expand into the seeds industry, while Switzerland's Syngenta is keen to bolster its sub-scale seeds operations. Bayer warned on Friday it would have to adjust its full-year outlook, citing high inventory levels at crop protection customers in Brazil and a weaker-than-expected consumer health business.

Yes, we expect parliament to pass the three bills next week,  Tanzania's Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister, Palamagamba Kabudi, told Reuters. The three draft laws, introduced on Thursday and pored over by parliamentarians in closed-door sessions on Friday, will be used against the multi-billion dollar mining sector first, analysts said. They follow 18 months of wrangling between mining companies and President John Magufuli that have delighted Tanzanian voters but alarmed foreign investors. Magufuli took office in 2015 vowing to stamp out corruption. He has fired ministers, the heads of the port and the revenue authorities, and 10,000 civil servants. He repeatedly accuses multinational companies of tax evasion, something they deny. The most high-profile target of his campaign has been Acacia Mining, majority-owned by Barrick Gold. Acacia has most of its productive assets in Tanzania. Acacia has been forbidden to export ore since March. The company says the ban costs a million dollars a day as shipping containers pile up.  It's quite clear from what the president has  done, they are trying to centralize all decision making ... at the State House,  said Ahmed Salim of global advisory firm Teneo Intelligence.  Since March, after the export ban, the government has made it clear they want to renegotiate terms and contracts with the (mining) sector in general.  They have used Acacia as an example to the detriment of the economy.  The company's share price has nearly halved since the ban and the CEO says Acacia's existence is threatened. The government has conducted two audits in the last two months of the stockpiled ore, and accused Acacia of only declaring a tenth of the gold it is exporting and not declaring other minerals. But the audits counted traces of minerals not commercially viable to extract and misunderstood metals pricing, according to an analysis by Maya Forstater of the Center for Global Development, and London-based mining consultant Alexandra Readhead. The amount of iridium auditors say they found is three times the global consumption of the element, they noted. But stoking outrage against Acacia may be a canny strategy to force the renegotiating of contracts under the new laws, they said.  The findings of the committees seem implausible, but building public outrage towards Acacia strengthens President Magufuli’s hand in renegotiating,  Readhead said.  Tanzania could gain from a new deal with Acacia, but in the process it risks undermining confidence in the investment environment, including for the developing oil and gas industry.  Tanzania has extensive gas fields, and a $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal is planned with BG Group, part of Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Statoil and Ophir Energy.

Heta is the bad bank set up by the government to wind down collapsed lender Hypo Alpe Adria.  Roughly 5.8 billion euros are expected to be paid in the second half of July ...to creditors holding qualifying bonds,  Heta said in a statement, referring to senior bondholders. Austria's Financial Market Authority (FMA), which is overseeing the wind-down, had expected an initial payout of 4 billion euros. The FMA said in a statement it was optimistic that the amount that will be earned by the end of the wind-down in 2023 would be more than the 8.6 billion euros it predicted in April. Heta said on Friday its cash reserves had reached 8.5 billion euros by the end of May. The collapse of Hypo Alpe Adria left the province of Carinthia liable for 11 billion euros in guarantees it had made on the face value of Hypo's bonds. The federal government loaned Carinthia money last year to acquire virtually all of Heta's bonds, saving the province from possible bankruptcy. Creditors holding 99.6 percent of Heta's senior bonds sold them back to Carinthia at a discount.

Thirteen of 22 analysts in a Reuters survey published last week predicted a reduction of 25 basis points to 6 percent, while nine expected the trim to be 50 basis points. The board meeting begins at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). Bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria indicated this month the rate could come down to as low as 5.25 percent by year end, but the seven-member board has not been unanimous since late last year.  The debate will focus on the balance of risks between inflation and economic growth below potential,  said Carolina Monzon, an analyst at Itau in Colombia. A cut would mark the sixth reduction in an easing cycle intended to bolster Latin America's fourth-largest economy, hit hard by the global fall in prices for crude oil as it struggled with high inflation. While the policy board is aware of the need to lower the cost of money to encourage consumer spending, it must ensure the decision does not end up stimulating inflation, which remains above the target range of 2 percent to 4 percent. The bank expects the economy to expand about 1.8 percent in 2017.  It's the bank's last opportunity to cut the rate because in the second half we'll see an increase in inflation as a result of the base effect of 2016, not counting possible inflationary pressures resulting from the increase in the rate of exchange, said Eduardo Bolanos, an economist at insurer Positiva. Inflation expectations for the close of this year were up to 4.30 percent in the Reuters poll. Annual inflation in May reached 4.37 percent.

In the 20 years since Hong Kong was returned to the motherland, the success of 'one country, two systems' is recognized by the whole world,  Xi said in a speech.  Of course, during the implementation, we've met some new situations, new issues and new challenges. On these issues, they need to be regarded correctly and analyzed rationally... Issues are not scary. The key is to think of ways to solve these issues.  Without giving specifics, Xi said these needed to be corrected and not handled with an  emotional attitude . But in a stark and surprising announcement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, which laid the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997, no longer had any practical significance. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Thursday had said Britain's commitment to Hong Kong, enshrined in the  treaty , was  just as strong today  as it was 20 years ago.

The UK has no sovereignty, no power to rule and no power to supervise Hong Kong after the handover.  It wasn't immediately clear if Lu was attacking just the idea of continued British involvement in Hong Kong, or the principles in the document itself. Some lawyers said China's disregard for the bilateral treaty was worrying. Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects troops at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison as part of events marking the 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China June 30, 2017.Damir Sagolj It is a really grave matter for the Chinese to now say the effect of the Joint Declaration was spent. So the carpet, so to speak, has been pulled from under Hong Kongers' feet,  said barrister and former democratic lawmaker Alan Leong. Xi earlier inspected more than 3,000 People's Liberation Army troops on the second day of his first trip as president to the financial hub ahead of Saturday's anniversary. The PLA said it was the largest military parade in the city since the 1997 handover, though it was similar in style and tone to the one given by his predecessor, Hu Jintao, in 2012. Low-Key Presence of Pla   Xi praised the Hong Kong government under Beijing-backed leader Leung Chun-ying, saying it had  effectively tackled Hong Kong independence forces and maintained social stability . Slideshow (24 Images)The presence of the PLA in the city has long been one of the most sensitive parts of the city's reversion to Chinese rule, but the garrison, thought to number between 8,000 and 10,000, has kept a noticeably low-key presence. Security has been tight ahead of the July 1 anniversary, with some 9,000 police reportedly deployed to maintain order. Protesters have been kept well away from Xi and his entourage, his hotel, and the venue for Saturday's ceremony. Banners critical of China have been largely absent from the streets, though a rally on Saturday could draw tens of thousands of people in an annual demand for full democracy.  Few expect anywhere near the scale of protest seen during the 2014 Occupy movement during Xi's visit, but activists and civil society groups are planning a number of demonstrations.  Hundreds of protesters demanded the release of Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo and justice for victims of the Tiananmen crackdown in Beijing in 1989. But the organizers of a pro-independence rally claiming that Hong Kong had now in effect become a repressed Chinese colony called off their plans at the last minute because of what they said was heavy police pressure. Hong Kong authorities released 26 pro-democracy protesters on Friday who were arrested before Xi's arrival.  Democracy Now! Now!  they shouted on being released, including young Occupy protest leader Joshua Wong.

The plans are part of wider reforms proposed by Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune as his government looks to secure new funding sources and reduce reliance on oil and gas, which account for 60 percent of the state budget. The OPEC member has already cut spending, approved higher prices for some subsidised products and set import restrictions in an effort to ward off the financial impact of lower oil prices and try to improve its poor domestic production. But its economy is still emerging from the one-party socialist planning that followed the country's 1962 independence from France. It remains mostly state-controlled and has little non-oil industry development. Tebboune, appointed last month after legislative elections in May, has said his plans include setting up a framework for participatory funding, one of the tools of Islamic financing. Islamic finance is seen as a way to draw investment from more religiously conservative Algerians and attract money from the informal market, one of the main goals behind the sharia-compliant funding options after previous attempts failed.  Collecting money from the parallel market will help fill a gap for two or three years. The monetary mass in this market is huge,  Tebboune told parliament late on Thursday. Pressure More steps will be taken to reform the banking system, which, analysts say, has been a hurdle for local and foreign investors because of outdated systems and bureaucracy. Algeria has failed in the past to implement reforms aimed at diversifying its economy but a prolonged period of weak oil prices has increased pressure on the government to act. The new government will also launch consultations with parliament and social and economic partners over reforming Algeria's subsidy policy.  We need a consensus because we are speaking about a policy that we have been implenting for more than four decades,  Tebboune said. Subsidy reform is a sensitive issue in Algeria because the government spends about $30 billion a year to subsidise almost everything from basic foodstuffs and fuel to medicine, housing and education. That system has helped keep the social peace in the past, but the government is looking to rationalise spending. Last year Algeria approved new prices for subsidised products including electricity, gas, gasoline and diesel for the first time in years. That measure coincided with import restrictions that caused some shortages, pushing up prices for some products, in addition to higher and new taxes.  New taxes will be implemented for luxury products,  Tebboune said, without providing details. Algeria's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to $108 billion from $114.1 billion in 2016 and $144.1 billion the previous year. Foreign debt is now lower than $4 billion.  Algeria is not a paradise,  Tebboune said.  But it is very far from being a hell .

Kiev trumpeted President Petro Poroshenko's June 20 visit as an important sign of Washington's backing for Ukraine under the Donald Trump administration, especially since Trump has yet to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in office. Two defence agreements announced, but not spelled out, during Poroshenko's trip will facilitate sales of military equipment and promote joint research and development, a top official in Ukraine's state defence industry told Reuters. Two framework agreements were in the works and were  expected to be signed soon, said Denys Gurak, deputy head of foreign economic activity at Ukroboronprom, a conglomerate of Ukrainian defence companies.  Ukraine needs equipment ranging from radar systems, drones and secure communications as it battles a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in the Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people and sent relations with Moscow into freefall. The first agreement aims to free up Ukraine's access to the U.S. defence market, for example by speeding up the process by which Ukraine can purchase equipment such as drones or radar.  It will make it easier for Ukraine to sell its own defence equipment to the U.S. The United States has so far not acceded to Ukrainian requests for Washington to supply lethal weapons to Kiev, and Poroshenko, speaking to reporters after meeting Trump, sidestepped a direct question on the issue. Denys Gurak, Deputy Director General for foreign economic activity at Ukroboronprom state company, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine June 29, 2017.Valentyn OgirenkoThe two agreements do not cover the issue of lethal weapons.  A second agreement to be signed is for joint research and development in defence. Ukraine anticipates receiving U.S. funding to develop new military technologies.  This agreement would also pave the way for some U.S. army equipment to be partly manufactured in Ukraine, Gurak said.  Slideshow (2 Images)The agreements  will show that we are a strategic partner for America in the defence complex,  Gurak told Reuters in an interview.   We are asking for help, but we are also ready to be America's partner and we have something to offer - namely, production capacity, outsourcing production, cheaper production of components for them and production of units and components of military equipment that the U.S. army may need.  Speaking late on Thursday, Gurak said he had had negotiations with U.S. companies about setting up manufacturing facilities in Ukraine. Under negotiation was, for example, the production of radio and communications gear. Poroshenko earlier said that U.S. Secretary of Defence James Mattis was expected to visit Ukraine in the coming months to sign the defence agreements.   These are absolutely clear and concrete agreements, unprecedented ones. Ukraine has never had such agreements in its relations with the United States,  Poroshenko was quoted as saying by his press service.

With mySugr's app, diabetes sufferers who use glucose meters to analyze their blood sugar levels can automatically upload data via a Bluetooth connection to their smartphones. From there, the information can be shared usually via email with doctors. Following the deal, MySugr's apps will still be accessible for other manufacturers' devices, Roche said.  But those who download the app in markets including Germany can get Roche's Accu-Chek-brand glucose meters for free, as the Swiss company seeks to capture more customers for its glucose test strips that diabetics must purchase indefinitely.

[reut.rs/1S8CEFu]  We will be able to offer seamlessly accessible patient solutions within an open platform to better respond to the unmet needs of people with diabetes,  said Roland Diggelmann, Roche's diagnostics head.  Free Meters MySugr has more than a million users, co-founder Frank Westermann said. The company, with U.S. offices in San Diego, has 47 employees. Its app is available in 52 countries.  With Roche's diabetes expertise and global network, mySugr will become an indispensable companion,  Westermann said. The companies cite one study showing high-risk Type 1 diabetes patients -- whose bodies do not produce insulin -- who use a mobile health app reduced their average blood glucose by nearly 20 percent. With mySugr's app, diabetes sufferers who use glucose meters to analyze their blood sugar levels can automatically upload data via a Bluetooth connection to their smartphones. From there, the information can be shared usually via email with doctors. Following the deal, MySugr's apps will still be accessible for other manufacturers' devices, Roche said.  But those who download the app in markets including Germany can get Roche's Accu-Chek-brand glucose meters for free, as the Swiss company seeks to capture more customers for its glucose test strips that diabetics must purchase indefinitely.

The S&P; 500 Bank sector index .SPXBK rose as much as 3 percent to its highest point since March 17 and was last up 1.3 percent. Regions Financial (RF.N) was the biggest percentage gainer of the 34 banks involved in the stress tests with a 3 percent jump. A total shareholder payout estimate of $132 billion compared with expectations for $120 billion from Barclays analyst Jonathan Goldberg including the 22 banks his firm covers. RBC analysts estimated a total payout of $137 billion for the 25 banks it covers compared with its expectation of $126 billion. Regions' $1.8 billion payout plan topped RBC's $1.2 billion estimate.   Generally speaking there were high expectations and they came in above that,  said Barclay's Goldberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) buyback alone is around the same amount as the gross domestic product of Iceland or the entire market value of KeyCorp (KEY.N), Goldberg noted. Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) was one of nine companies whose shares fell on Thursday after the Fed said it must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though it can go ahead with its capital plan in the meantime. Its shares were down 2.9 percent. The stress test showed that many of the banks involved have not only built up adequate capital buffers but also improved risk management, the Fed said late on Wednesday. The approval was a victory for the industry, which has worked to regain its stature since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and marked the first time since the crisis that banks could pay out as much as they report in annual profits.  Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares were up 2.2 percent, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) 2 percent, Fifth Third (FITB.O) 2 percent and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O) 1.7 percent. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was up 1.2 percent while JPMorgan added 0.9 percent, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) rose 0.54 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) shares were up 0.3 percent. UBS analyst Saul Martinez noted that Citigroup's plan for dividends and buybacks of $18.9 billion topped its $15 billion to $18 billion target range.  Except Goldman Sachs, all big U.S. banks announced share buyback programs and raised dividends. Both RBC and Barclays included their estimates for Goldman payouts in their tallies.

Their projection of sluggish growth, subdued inflation and rock-bottom interest rates proved a reliable guide for most of the next eight years. Now markets are taking fright over a hint that that period is coming to an end. It has been clear for a while that the world economy is doing a bit better. The International Monetary Fund expects global GDP growth to hit 3.5 percent this year. Fears that a financial crisis could trigger a slump in China have receded for now. Economic sentiment in the euro zone, as measured by the European Commission, is at its highest level in almost a decade. Yet the prospect of central banks responding to that improvement has still taken money managers by surprise. Euro zone bond yields jumped this week after investors interpreted comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi as slightly more hawkish. The prospect of money becoming more expensive has also weighed on equities: the pan-European STOXX index is down 2 percent this month. The notion that stronger growth can lead to lower share prices is a reminder of how distorted markets are. Loose money has not only pushed down government bond yields, but also reduced borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Low interest rates may also have made investors more willing to pay up for stocks that promise future earnings growth, or pay out generous dividends. It’s too early to declare the “new normal” era over. After all, the ECB is still spending 60 billion euros a month buying bonds. And though the yield on 10-year German government bonds has jumped from 0.24 percent to 0.46 percent in less than a week, it remains lower than at the beginning of 2016. Signs of a revival could also prove false. Hopes that President Donald Trump’s election last November would lead to growth-boosting tax cuts and spending on infrastructure have largely faded. Central banks know tightening monetary policy too quickly could knock markets, and in turn the confidence of consumers and companies. Nevertheless, the touchstones of the post-crisis era are wobbling. Investors will need to get used to the view from under the bed.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Expectations that Trump's election would bring a thaw in icy relations between Moscow and Washington have been put on hold, with the White House embroiled in a domestic row over Trump associates' Russia ties.  The U.S. and Russian leaders are to have their first face-to-face encounter next week at a G20 summit in Hamburg. At a previous moment of heightened tension between Moscow and Washington, in the 1960s, Kissinger acted as a back-channel intermediary, passing messages to the leadership of the Soviet Union on behalf of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The Kremlin on Friday denied that Kissinger, who is visiting Moscow and met Putin behind closed doors on Thursday, was acting as a go-between this time. Speaking at an international affairs conference in Moscow, Kissinger said of the planned Trump-Putin meeting:  I believe that at this moment our two countries have a responsibility, and an opportunity, to make significant progress not just by improving relations, but by improving situations around the world through cooperative efforts.   Tensions between Russia and the United States ... have happened often before and they have been overcome often before,  Kissinger, 94, said. He did not take questions from reporters at the event. Asked if Kissinger was providing a back-channel between the Kremlin and the White House, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said:  He didn't try. That did not happen.  He said the Kissinger-Putin meeting was strictly private and declined to disclose what the two men talked about. In May, Trump granted a White House audience to Kissinger. The U.S. leader said he and Kissinger would talk about Russia, among other issues. Speaking at the same Moscow event as Kissinger on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the significance of the planned Putin-Trump Hamburg meeting was that  the abnormal period in our relations when the leaders only speak by telephone will be overcome.   Judging by their telephone conversations, they have a desire to get beyond this abnormality and start seeking agreement on specific issues.

Over a year since Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy came to power, Myanmar reporters say charges filed by the military this week against journalists reporting on an insurgent group threatened to reverse gains in press freedom. Suu Kyi has not commented on the reporters, and her spokesman only said journalists must follow the law. Journalists gathered in the downtown of Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, despite pouring rain on Friday afternoon, holding banners saying  stop killing press  and calling for authorities to free the four men immediately. “Now they are pressuring the media. It's not at the stage of threatening anymore but at the stage of pressuring,” said A Hla Lay Thuzar, co-founder of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists. Democratic Voice of Burma reporters Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing, and Lawi Weng of the Irrawaddy magazine, have been jailed since Monday. The military accused the three men of breaching a colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act after they covered an event organized by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, a group seeking autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic minority that regularly clashes with government troops. The journalists are due to appear in a court in Shan State in the north of Myanmar on July 11. They face up to three years in prison. Reporters protest as they call on Myanmar government and military authorities to release reporters who were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar June 30, 2017.Soe Zeya TunAnother journalist, editor Kyaw Min Swe of the Voice newspaper, is awaiting trial under a Telecommunications Act charge of defamation over a satirical article that made fun of the military. The law's controversial and broadly phrased section 66(d) has been applied to social media users and reporters alike, leading to fears of a chilling effect on free speech. Reporters protest as they call on Myanmar government and military authorities to release reporters who were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar June 30, 2017.Soe Zeya TunAside from the arrests, journalists complain that their access to Kyaw Min Swe's court hearings has been curtailed. The NLD has a majority in parliament - and many of its lawmakers are former political prisoners - but the party has not prioritized repealing laws that previous governments used to quash dissent.  Aung San Suu Kyi’s statements about free speech need to be more than just empty promises,” said Paris-based Reporters Without Borders in a statement late on Thursday, calling for  the three reporters charged this week to be released. Human Rights Watch also urged the Myanmar authorities to drop the charges, calling the arrests  a serious blow to media freedom . At Friday's demonstration, Aung Myo Min, chairman of non-governmental organization Equality Myanmar, said the recent arrests were a  warning sign for the entire media  in Myanmar. “I think this is threatening and alarming for all journalists as it shows they can arrest them whenever they want,  he said.

Roughly 5.8 billion euros are expected to be paid in the second half of July ...to creditors holding qualifying bonds,  Heta said in a statement, referring to senior bondholders.

Creditors holding 99.6 percent of Heta's senior bonds sold them back to Carinthia at a discount.

The greenback gained around 0.3 percent against the euro in morning trade in Europe, but was still down more than 8 percent on the quarter and 2 percent this week alone. Compared with Thursday's U.S. close against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength it was steady. But it fell 0.2 percent against the yen as the Japanese currency recovered from its own losses this week. The shift this week to price in rate rises in the months ahead by a number of central banks outside of the U.S. Federal Reserve has left both the dollar and the yen exposed, but a number of analysts wonder if the move has been overdone.  There has been a concerted effort to show there is two-way risk over the next six months, but that is it: two-way,  said ING strategist Viraj Patel.  FX volatility was pretty low going into this so any small change in the language has an amplified effect and there is an argument that things have overshot.  Data and several policy meetings over the next fortnight will be crucial, with Canadian releases a focus on Friday. Helped by a recovery in oil, the Canadian dollar has pulled back to less than C$1.30 to its U.S. counterpart for the first time since January as investors priced in a 70 percent chance of a rise in rates on July 12.  Odds for a 2017 BoC hike have ramped up considerably in recent days and this has been a major prop for the Loonie,  said LMAX Exchange analyst Joel Kruger.  This week’s healthy recovery in (oil) has provided another excuse to pile into Canadian Dollar longs. There is every reason to expect another active session today.  As well as GDP data on Friday, Canadian banks including RBC pointed to the need for the Bank of Canada's Business Survey to support the positive rhetoric of officials in the past fortnight if the Canadian dollar was to hold onto its gains. Sterling has also breached $1.30 this week with a hike in interest rates by December now 70 percent priced in. It was pushed back below that level by a quarterly rise in Britain's huge current account deficit on Friday. While the deficit was lower than consensus forecasts, it pointed to the risk that sterling will have to stay low, or go lower, to rebalance the economy as it heads into the uncertainty generated by the decision to leave the European Union.  This data release adds extra impetus to the debate between the structural sterling bears and the cyclical sterling bulls,  HSBC analysts said in a note to clients.  A wide current account deficit reinforces the argument that further GBP weakness is needed on a structural basis. We believe GBP is structural and that the fall in GBP is necessary.

This week prices were around 68-69 crowns as expected, slightly down from the previous week.   Prices are down 3-4 crowns and we expect around 65 crowns in Oslo next week. It's quiet and probably volumes are rising,  said one exporter, who declined to be named. One producer, also unnamed, said it was difficult to predict prices due to very limited trading.  It seems prices are dropping a bit. A lot of fixed business is done but not that much in the spot market. Prices could be down 3-5 crowns,  the exporter said. Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since rallied before easing again. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints are expected to support prices in the first half of 2017 before an expected increase in volumes later in the year.

Speaking before the draw, former world number one Mats Wilander said Federer, who won his 18th grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, had to watch out for some of the younger guns. “I think Federer’s the favorite but there are a lot of young guys that are very fearless of the older guys these days,” he said. “They don’t really have that intimidation factor with Kyrgios and Raonic and Zverev, they don’t really care about the best players, they just play their game, and if it works, it works.” FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Match for Africa 3 - Federer vs Murray - Zurich, Switzerland - 10/04/2017 -  Switzerland's Roger Federer returns the ball during the Match for Africa 3 benefit tennis match against Andy Murray of Britain.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoMurray looked to be walking with a limp after practice at Wimbledon on Friday, having missed two days of preparation because of the sore hip. Beaten in the first round at Queen’s Club last week, the two-time champion will be thankful to be avoiding Raonic, Dimitrov, Zverev, Juan Martin Del Potro, Dominic Thiem and Feliciano Lopez, the Spaniard who won the Aegon Championships at London’s Queen’s Club last weekend. The Scot will open his title defense against a qualifier on Monday and could play Dustin Brown of Germany in round two, with the big-hitting Nick Kyrgios a potential fourth-round opponent.

Nadal, the winner in 2008 and 2010, has not been past the fourth round at Wimbledon since 2011 but will fancy his chances. The Spaniard plays Australia’s John Millman, ranked 137, in the first round, with young Russian Karen Khachanov (30) his first seeded opponent in round three and seventh seed Marin Cilic a potential quarter-final foe. Djokovic, the champion in 2011, 2014 and 2015 and looking to get back to his best after a loss of form, plays world number 44 Martin Klizan in round one. The Serb could play Del Potro in the third round, Gael Monfils in round four and eighth seed Thiem, who ended Djokovic's French Open title defense this month in the quarter-finals, again in the last eight.

He is one of the first reporters to be charged under the electronic crime law, which was introduced in August to the objections of media freedom and human rights activists. Achakzai's father, Naimatullah Achakzai, said his son was detained on Sunday by officers from the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force in overall charge of security in Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is the capital.

The son posted a comment on Facebook after a suicide bombing killed 13 in Quetta this month, in which he questioned why the Frontier Corps had responsibility for policing the city. Reuters was unable to reach officials at the Frontier Corps for comment. The FIA official, who declined to be identified, confirmed that the journalist had been arrested by the Frontier Corps, and then handed over to the FIA on Wednesday. The Pakistani media watchdog Freedom Network said it was concerned about what it saw as  the authorities' zero-tolerance for critics on social media .  The arrest of journalist Zafarullah Achakzai is a grim reminder that more arrests will follow for the same reason in the near future,  the group said. Authorities began cracking down on social media in May, with security officials saying that more than 200 accounts were under investigation.

Some 1.2 million crocodiles are kept on more than 1,000 farms in Thailand, according to figures from the Thai department of fisheries. Some are equipped with slaughterhouses and tanneries to produce luxury products. Sri Ayuthaya Crocodile Farm is one of Thailand's biggest and has been operating for 35 years.  We're an all-in-one farm, creating jobs for the people, creating income for the country,  said Wichian Rueangnet, the owner of Sri Ayuthaya, which has an estimated 150,000 crocodiles.

Over a year since Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy came to power, Myanmar reporters say charges filed by the military this week against journalists reporting on an insurgent group threatened to reverse gains in press freedom. Suu Kyi has not commented on the reporters, and her spokesman only said journalists must follow the law. Journalists gathered in the downtown of Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, despite pouring rain on Friday afternoon, holding banners saying  stop killing press  and calling for authorities to free the four men immediately. “Now they are pressuring the media. It's not at the stage of threatening anymore but at the stage of pressuring,” said A Hla Lay Thuzar, co-founder of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists. Democratic Voice of Burma reporters Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing, and Lawi Weng of the Irrawaddy magazine, have been jailed since Monday. The military accused the three men of breaching a colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act after they covered an event organized by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, a group seeking autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic minority that regularly clashes with government troops. The journalists are due to appear in a court in Shan State in the north of Myanmar on July 11. They face up to three years in prison.

Reporters protest as they call on Myanmar government and military authorities to release reporters who were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar June 30, 2017.Soe Zeya TunAside from the arrests, journalists complain that their access to Kyaw Min Swe's court hearings has been curtailed. The NLD has a majority in parliament - and many of its lawmakers are former political prisoners - but the party has not prioritized repealing laws that previous governments used to quash dissent.  Aung San Suu Kyi’s statements about free speech need to be more than just empty promises,” said Paris-based Reporters Without Borders in a statement late on Thursday, calling for  the three reporters charged this week to be released. Human Rights Watch also urged the Myanmar authorities to drop the charges, calling the arrests  a serious blow to media freedom . At Friday's demonstration, Aung Myo Min, chairman of non-governmental organization Equality Myanmar, said the recent arrests were a  warning sign for the entire media  in Myanmar. “I think this is threatening and alarming for all journalists as it shows they can arrest them whenever they want,  he said.

Illinois, which has gone a record-setting two straight years without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democratic legislature, is poised to start fiscal 2018 on Saturday budget-less again. The consequences would be dire for the nation's fifth-largest state, which has a $15 billion backlog of unpaid bills. S&P; has warned that starting a new fiscal year without a budget that reduces a chronic structural deficit could trigger a downgrade to BB-plus. That would put Illinois on the same financial footing as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Portugal.  The lack of a budget makes all the difference here,  said S&P; analyst Gabriel Petek, who voiced concerns about the state's ability to control its finances and cash flow. Even the agency that oversees elections is not immune. A top Illinois State Board of Elections official told Reuters the agency faces the loss of certain cyber security protections beginning in September because of an unpaid $9,000 bill. The board is among 21 state election authorities the U.S. Homeland Security Department confirmed were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. An immediate casualty is the state lottery. For the first time, Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets and announced a delay in payments after Saturday on any prizes exceeding $25,000. The lack of a state budget threatens serious disruption to schools during the next six weeks. Out of Illinois’ 401 public school systems, 144 expect to have less than 90 days of operating cash at fiscal year-end, said Robert Wolfe, chief financial officer for the Illinois State Board of Education. “If there is no budget, it is doubtful we can open our doors on August 15th,” said Ralph Grimm, school superintendent in Galesburg, Illinois. Public universities, which have suffered a steep drop in state funding, now fear further erosion in student enrollment, the loss of accreditation, and bruising spending cuts. Budget Crisis, Human Face Lindsay Perez, a suburban Chicago mother, and her 9-year-old daughter Elena, who survives on a Medicaid-funded ventilator, described for reporters on Thursday the horrific situation of losing some of her medical supplies because of the budget crisis. The girl, who was born without a lung, urged politicians to pass a budget. “If you could try hard enough, you could do it,” she said. Meanwhile, Illinois risks intervention from federal judges overseeing consent decrees requiring the state to fund medical and other services for the disadvantaged. A U.S. judge is weighing how much more Illinois must allocate to pay down $3.1 billion in Medicaid bills to ensure continued medical care for 3 million poor and disabled residents. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the state's bills, has pledged to fully cover debt service on bonds, but essential payments for pensions and payroll could face reductions if the judge orders a higher priority for Medicaid. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan offered reporters a murky response on Thursday when asked if a resolution to the fiscal mess could be struck with Governor Bruce Rauner by the midnight Friday deadline. “Oh sure, if everybody is reasonable,” Madigan said of a potential breakthrough. “It could’ve been done two years ago.” The long odds that Madigan and Rauner, who posted a Twitter photo of himself at his desk waiting for a “balanced budget,” could strike a deal appeared to worsen with Thursday's abrupt resignation of Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, respected by both parties as an expert negotiator.  I really tried hard. It’s time for someone else to take the reins,” she told reporters.

Britain's biggest mortgage lender will miss a self-imposed end-of-June deadline for making payments to most victims of the fraud and it said it is  disappointed  that the process is taking so long. Lloyds announced the deadline for its 100 million- pound ($130 million) compensation scheme in April after six men were jailed in February for a scam that involved siphoning money from struggling businesses. Two former bankers with Lloyds' unit HBOS in the town of Reading were among those jailed for their involvement in the scam, which affected 67 people including Noel Edmonds, a TV presenter and former disc jockey. Lloyds said on Friday it was close to making offers to eight more clients.  We are disappointed that getting to offers is taking longer than we had hoped, but we are committed to doing everything we can to support those affected as we continue with the review,  said Adrian White, Lloyds' chief operating officer for commercial Banking. Victims of the fraud have accused the bank of dragging out the compensation process and underestimating the final amount it will have to pay. The jailed bankers pushed struggling business owners to employ a costly turnaround consultancy as a condition for receiving loans and, in some cases, hand over ownership. One of the bankers received designer watches, exotic holidays and sex with prostitutes from the consultancy in return for referring clients to the firm, evidence presented in the trial showed. Lloyds said part of the reason for the delay in making compensation offers was it is still waiting for information from victims that would allow it to decide on payouts. The bank said on Friday it is making a one-off payment of 35,000 pounds to all customers impacted by the fraud to help cover expenses.

Illinois, which has gone a record-setting two straight years without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democratic legislature, is poised to start fiscal 2018 on Saturday budget-less again. The consequences would be dire for the nation's fifth-largest state, which has a $15 billion backlog of unpaid bills. S&P; has warned that starting a new fiscal year without a budget that reduces a chronic structural deficit could trigger a downgrade to BB-plus. That would put Illinois on the same financial footing as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Portugal.  The lack of a budget makes all the difference here,  said S&P; analyst Gabriel Petek, who voiced concerns about the state's ability to control its finances and cash flow. Even the agency that oversees elections is not immune. A top Illinois State Board of Elections official told Reuters the agency faces the loss of certain cyber security protections beginning in September because of an unpaid $9,000 bill. The board is among 21 state election authorities the U.S. Homeland Security Department confirmed were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. An immediate casualty is the state lottery. For the first time, Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets and announced a delay in payments after Saturday on any prizes exceeding $25,000. The lack of a state budget threatens serious disruption to schools during the next six weeks. Out of Illinois’ 401 public school systems, 144 expect to have less than 90 days of operating cash at fiscal year-end, said Robert Wolfe, chief financial officer for the Illinois State Board of Education. “If there is no budget, it is doubtful we can open our doors on August 15th,” said Ralph Grimm, school superintendent in Galesburg, Illinois. Public universities, which have suffered a steep drop in state funding, now fear further erosion in student enrollment, the loss of accreditation, and bruising spending cuts. Budget Crisis, Human Face Lindsay Perez, a suburban Chicago mother, and her 9-year-old daughter Elena, who survives on a Medicaid-funded ventilator, described for reporters on Thursday the horrific situation of losing some of her medical supplies because of the budget crisis. The girl, who was born without a lung, urged politicians to pass a budget. “If you could try hard enough, you could do it,” she said. Meanwhile, Illinois risks intervention from federal judges overseeing consent decrees requiring the state to fund medical and other services for the disadvantaged. A U.S. judge is weighing how much more Illinois must allocate to pay down $3.1 billion in Medicaid bills to ensure continued medical care for 3 million poor and disabled residents. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the state's bills, has pledged to fully cover debt service on bonds, but essential payments for pensions and payroll could face reductions if the judge orders a higher priority for Medicaid. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan offered reporters a murky response on Thursday when asked if a resolution to the fiscal mess could be struck with Governor Bruce Rauner by the midnight Friday deadline. “Oh sure, if everybody is reasonable,” Madigan said of a potential breakthrough. “It could’ve been done two years ago.” The long odds that Madigan and Rauner, who posted a Twitter photo of himself at his desk waiting for a “balanced budget,” could strike a deal appeared to worsen with Thursday's abrupt resignation of Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, respected by both parties as an expert negotiator.  I really tried hard. It’s time for someone else to take the reins,” she told reporters.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the actions were designed to cut off funds that North Korea uses to build its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council and unilateral sanctions.  We will follow the money and cut off the money,  he told a news conference. A Treasury statement identified the bank as the Bank of Dandong and the firm as Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co Ltd. It identified the two individuals as Sun Wei and Li Hong Ri. The sanctions imposed on the two Chinese citizens and the shipping company blacklists them from doing business with U.S.-tied companies and people. Bank of Dandong did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A staff member at Dalian Global Unity would not comment on the sanctions and subsequent calls to the firm's office in Dalian went unanswered. Mnuchin said U.S. officials were continuing to look at other companies that may be helping North Korea and may roll out additional sanctions. Related CoverageBlacklisted China bank cited as a North Korea conduit to global financeChina says always opposes non-U.N. sanctions after U.S. targets companyU.S. foreign policy experts say Chinese companies have long had a key role in financing Pyongyang. However, Mnuchin said the action was not being taken to send China a message.  This wasn't aimed at China. We continue to work with them,  he said. Asked about the U.S. sanctions on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said that China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions imposed outside the U.N. framework.  We strongly urge the United States to immediately correct its relevant wrong moves to avoid affecting bilateral cooperation on the relevant issue,  he said, without elaborating. China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said China opposed the United States using domestic laws to impose  long-arm jurisdiction  on Chinese companies or individuals, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. The flag of North Korea is seen in Geneva, Switzerland, June 20, 2017.Pierre Albouy If a Chinese company or individual has acted in a way that violates United Nations Security Council resolutions, then China will investigate and handle the issue in accordance with Chinese law,  he told an event in Washington on Thursday evening. Growing Frustration U.S. officials told Reuters this week that President Donald Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, and was now considering possible trade actions against Beijing. A senior White House official told reporters on Wednesday China was  falling far short of what it could bring to bear on North Korea in terms of pressure.  U.S.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announces measures taken to maximize pressure on North Korea to abandon its weapons programs during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe U.S. move came as Trump was due to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on Thursday to discuss steps to push North Korea to abandon its weapons programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. It also came after the United States sanctioned a Chinese industrial machinery wholesaler, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co, in September for its ties to North Korea's nuclear program, the first time Washington had taken such a step against a Chinese firm. China's Foreign Ministry said in the same month Hongxiang was under investigation for  illegal behavior  and  economic crimes  following the provisions of U.N. resolution 2270, which imposed tighter sanctions on North Korea in March.     Mnuchin said the United States would discuss efforts to choke off funding for North Korea's nuclear and missile programs with China and other countries at next week's Group of 20 summit in Germany. The U.S. Treasury Department said in an online notice published on Thursday the Bank of Dandong had served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. financial system. Authorities said 17 percent of Dandong's customer transactions in the bank's U.S. accounts had ties to North Korea.  Anthony Ruggiero, a former senior Treasury official in the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said the action against Bank of Dandong was the first time U.S. authorities had sought to punish a Chinese bank accused of helping North Korea. It would immediately cause Western firms to cut off any transactions with Bank of Dandong, he said. It may also cause financial institutions in Western Europe and the United States to further scrutinize whether their Chinese business could have links to North Korea.  The designation will make reputable Western banks ask questions about larger financial institutions in China,  said Ruggiero, who is now a senior fellow at the non-profit Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

The U.S. Treasury on Thursday accused the bank of facilitating millions of dollars in transactions for companies tied to North Korea's weapons development, as Washington ratchets up pressure on Beijing to rein-in its isolated neighbor and ally.  Bank of Dandong will in effect be shunned by the U.S. banks that may in the past have been used to clear its transactions,  said William Newcomb, a former member of the United Nations Panel of Experts on North Korea.  Most international banks will also cease dealing with Bank of Dandong because of reputational risk.    Similarly, other Chinese banks could damage their own ability to clear transactions should they try to act on Bank of Dandong's behalf and be found out,  he said, calling the move  an overdue step.  Based in the northeastern border city of Dandong, through which the bulk of North Korea's trade with China flows, Bank of Dandong is small, with five branches, 1,570 staff, and assets of 72.3 billion yuan ($10.66 billion). But according to the U.S. Treasury, Pyongyang has used it as a key conduit to the U.S. financial system.  As of mid-February 2016, North Korea was using bank accounts under false names and conducting financial transactions through banks located in China, Hong Kong, and various southeast Asian countries,  it said.  The primary bank in China was Bank of Dandong.   North Korea is subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The U.S. Treasury on Thursday also sanctioned China's Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co Ltd, as well as two Chinese citizens. Bank of Dandong and the China Banking Regulatory Commission did not respond to faxes seeking comment. China's foreign ministry said it opposes sanctions outside the U.N. framework. Missile Technology In early 2016, accounts at Bank of Dandong were used to facilitate millions of dollars of transactions on behalf of companies involved in the procurement of ballistic missile technology, the Treasury department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said in a filing on Thursday. In particular, Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC) and a front company for Korea Mining Development Trading Corp (KOMID) maintained multiple bank accounts with Bank of Dandong, the filing said. The U.N. describes KOMID, which it has sanctioned, as North Korea's principal arms dealer.   I think major state-owned banks and shipping companies have strictly implemented the sanctions, but the smaller ones still seek opportunities to make money wherever they can,  said Zhao Tong, a fellow at the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. Bank of Dandong processed more than $2.5 billion in U.S. dollar transactions between May 2012 and May 2015 through its U.S. correspondent accounts, including at least $786 million in customer transactions for businesses and individuals, FinCEN said.  The exposure of U.S. financial institutions to North Korea's illicit financial activity via Bank of Dandong outweighs concerns for any legitimate business activity at the bank,  FinCEN said in the filing. Last September, a minority shareholder in the bank, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co, and four of that firm's executives, were sanctioned by the United States under U.S. regulations targeting proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. At the time, U.S. authorities sought to seize Hongxiang funds in accounts at a handful of state-owned Chinese lenders, including Bank of Dandong as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, which are among the world's largest banks. Based on FinCEN's analysis, Bank of Dandong processed approximately $56 million through U.S. banks for Hongxiang between October 2012 and December 2014, according to Thursday's filing. Hongxiang is no longer a shareholder in the bank.

In a with-profits policy, the insurers' costs are deducted from the investment profits of the fund and the remainder is returned to investors. The policies typically have guarantees and are no longer offered widely by insurers. The Financial Conduct Authority said the last full review that focused on with-profits business was in 2010.  The forthcoming review into the fair treatment of with-profits customers will allow us to understand further the range of practices that are now being adopted by firms,  the FCA said in a statement on Friday. One practice in particular that is likely to be a focus is so-called  smoothing , which aims to even out the ups and downs of markets. The inclusion of guarantees will also be looked at. The announcement of a review may raise expectations that potential enforcement action or changes in practices will follow.  We do not have pre-determined views about whether any particular practices are unfair or are leading to unfair outcomes and have not drawn any conclusions about whether with-profits customers are being unfairly treated.  The 2010 review found that the majority of firms  did not satisfactorily demonstrate  that their practices were consistent with well-run with-profits businesses in one or more areas assessed.

Germany has some of the world's toughest laws covering defamation, public incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. But few online cases are prosecuted. The law gives social media networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case. Failure to comply could see a company fined up to 50 million euros, and the company's chief representative in Germany fined up to 5 million euros. The Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, hailed the law as  the logical next step for effectively tackling hate speech since all voluntary agreements with the platform providers have been virtually unsuccessful.  German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the measure to  end the internet law of the jungle  was long overdue and dismissed suggestions that it would infringe freedom of speech. The issue has taken on more urgency amid concerns in Germany that proliferating fake news and racist content, particularly targeting migrants, could sway public opinion in the run-up to a national election due on Sept. 24. Concerns But organizations representing digital companies, consumers and journalists have accused the government of rushing a law through parliament that could damage free speech. Facebook, which has 29 million active users in Germany - more than a third of the total population - has said it is working hard to remove illegal content, deleting 3,500 posts per week in Germany in the past two months.  This law as it stands now will not improve efforts to tackle this important societal problem,  a spokesman said, adding Facebook did not think it had been consulted enough. Facebook noted that in May it had announced plans to add an extra 3,000 workers around the world over the next year to monitor reports of inappropriate material, in addition to 4,500 people already reviewing posts. In Berlin, Facebook's partner Arvato will employ up to 700 staff for  content moderation  by the end of the year. A German government survey has shown that Facebook deleted just 39 percent of content deemed criminal and Twitter only 1 percent, even though they had signed a code of conduct including a pledge to delete hate speech within 24 hours. However, Facebook says it has significantly improved its processes since then and is now removing 87 percent of posts reported by German non-governmental organizations. Twitter has also made a number of changes, including adding new filtering options, putting limits on accounts it had identified as engaging in abusive behavior and stopping those users from creating new accounts. In response to criticism of the draft law, the government softened the legislation by excluding email and messenger providers and opening up the option of creating joint monitoring facilities to make decisions about what content to remove. It also made clear that a fine would not necessarily be imposed after just one infraction, but only after a company systematically refused to act or does not set up a proper complaint management system.

The metal is highly sensitive to rising yields, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing bullion.      Spot gold        was down 0.2 percent at $1,243.40 an ounce at 1145 GMT, while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery were $2.40 an ounce lower at $1,243.40.      Spot prices have fallen nearly 2 percent so far in June, and are down 0.4 percent on a quarterly basis. After a strong performance in the first quarter, they are still set to end the first half of the year up 8 percent.      Comments from the euro zone, British and Canadian central banks this week indicated that quantitative easing programmes put in place in the wake of the financial crisis may be being wound up, leading to a gradual normalisation of interest rates.                   That comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to hike U.S. interest rates at its June meeting, and its indication that it will press ahead with plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings.                   We still have two rate hikes factored in for the Fed in the second half of the year, and we expect some reduction of the balance sheet,  Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini said.      At the same time, in the UK and Europe, although policy will remain loose for some time, it will start to turn the other way,  she added.  So all in all, it doesn't bode so well for gold prices.       Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield was heading for its biggest weekly jump since late 2015, topping a week in which yields across the euro zone have soared as investors brace for an end to the era of ultra-easy monetary policy.               On the other side of the Atlantic, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit six-week highs on Thursday.           Rising yields helped offset the positive impact of a weaker dollar on gold. The U.S. currency was on course for its worst quarter in seven years, recovering only marginally against major peers after a week of hawkish central bank rhetoric.             The U.S. dollar has softened, though this does not appear to have had the positive effect on price as we might have hoped,  MKS said in a note.      Among other precious metals, silver        was down 0.5 percent at $16.55 an ounce. Silver has seen the biggest fall among major precious metals this quarter, down 9 percent, while palladium        is the best performer, up 5.6 percent.      Palladium was down 0.6 percent at $842.23 an ounce on Friday, while platinum        was up 0.3 percent at $922.90.

Police found hundreds of notebooks containing Islamic State propaganda in Indonesia during the raid in connection with the stabbing death of a policeman in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province on June 25.  At the top of every page of the books read the inscription:  You are all obliged to go to war . Authorities believe Islamic State has thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia and are increasingly worried about the group trying to get a foothold in Southeast Asia as it loses territory in the Middle East.  We're still investigating who funded the printing of these books,  police spokesman Rikwanto told a news conference.  The material was displayed at the national police headquarters, alongside an air gun and other items. The front covers of the notebooks had a picture of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and quotes attributed to him as made at Friday prayer,  Tell all the apostates in the Muslim countries, these are their last days. And tell every infidel, we're not playing anymore,  a quote attributed to Baghdadi read. Russia has said it believes it might have killed the Islamic State leader in an air strike in Syria on June 17.  Indonesia has the world's largest population of Muslims but is officially a secular country. Most Muslims practice a moderate form of the religion. Children's handwriting was found in some of the books, including notes about the solar system, which police said could mean the books had been used by children to take notes in school. Police shot dead one suspect and arrested another man after the attack in Medan. The wife of the arrested man told police her husband had spent six months in Syria in 2013, authorities said previously. Police believe the men were part of Jemaah Ansharut Daulah, an umbrella organization on a U.S. State Department  terrorist  list which supports Islamic State and has hundreds of Indonesian followers. Islamic State sympathizers have carried out a series of mostly low-level attacks in Indonesia over the past few years, and there are fears about the return of hundreds of battle-hardened Indonesians who have gone to Syria to support the group.

The U.S. Treasury on Thursday accused the bank of facilitating millions of dollars in transactions for companies tied to North Korea's weapons development, as Washington ratchets up pressure on Beijing to rein-in its isolated neighbour and ally.  Bank of Dandong will in effect be shunned by the U.S. banks that may in the past have been used to clear its transactions,  said William Newcomb, a former member of the United Nations Panel of Experts on North Korea.  Most international banks will also cease dealing with Bank of Dandong because of reputational risk.   Similarly, other Chinese banks could damage their own ability to clear transactions should they try to act on Bank of Dandong's behalf and be found out,  he said, calling the move  an overdue step.  Based in the northeastern border city of Dandong, through which the bulk of North Korea's trade with China flows, Bank of Dandong is small, with five branches, 1,570 staff, and assets of 72.3 billion yuan ($10.66 billion). But according to the U.S. Treasury, Pyongyang has used it as a key conduit to the U.S. financial system.  As of mid-February 2016, North Korea was using bank accounts under false names and conducting financial transactions through banks located in China, Hong Kong, and various southeast Asian countries,  it said.  The primary bank in China was Bank of Dandong.  North Korea is subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The U.S. Treasury on Thursday also sanctioned China's Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co Ltd, as well as two Chinese citizens. Bank of Dandong and the China Banking Regulatory Commission did not respond to faxes seeking comment. China's foreign ministry said it opposes sanctions outside the U.N. framework. Missile Technology In early 2016, accounts at Bank of Dandong were used to facilitate millions of dollars of transactions on behalf of companies involved in the procurement of ballistic missile technology, the Treasury department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said in a filing on Thursday. In particular, Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC) and a front company for Korea Mining Development Trading Corp (KOMID) maintained multiple bank accounts with Bank of Dandong, the filing said. The U.N. describes KOMID, which it has sanctioned, as North Korea's principal arms dealer.  I think major state-owned banks and shipping companies have strictly implemented the sanctions, but the smaller ones still seek opportunities to make money wherever they can,  said Zhao Tong, a fellow at the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing. Bank of Dandong processed more than $2.5 billion in U.S. dollar transactions between May 2012 and May 2015 through its U.S. correspondent accounts, including at least $786 million in customer transactions for businesses and individuals, FinCEN said.  The exposure of U.S. financial institutions to North Korea's illicit financial activity via Bank of Dandong outweighs concerns for any legitimate business activity at the bank,  FinCEN said in the filing. Last September, a minority shareholder in the bank, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co, and four of that firm's executives, were sanctioned by the United States under U.S. regulations targeting proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. At the time, U.S. authorities sought to seize Hongxiang funds in accounts at a handful of state-owned Chinese lenders, including Bank of Dandong as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, which are among the world's largest banks. Based on FinCEN's analysis, Bank of Dandong processed approximately $56 million through U.S. banks for Hongxiang between October 2012 and December 2014, according to Thursday's filing. Hongxiang is no longer a shareholder in the bank. $1 = 6.7797 Chinese yuan renminbi Additional reporting by Matthew Miller and Josephine Mason; Editingby Bill Tarrant","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-northkorea-china-sanctions-dandong-idUSL3N1JR1IP"},

Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.  Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It's just at what pace they all get there,  said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday's document published by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force's document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account.  The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,  said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. High Benchmark Sweden's largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil (XON.N) has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as  frivolous . Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale (VALE5.SA). In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.  We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,  said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan's Secom, a leading security firm.  If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,  he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option.  Glacial Pace  To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway's $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway's and New Zealand's have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier.  It's ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,  said Phil Edwards, Mercer's Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more  urgency  to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD's framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain's Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI's guidelines.  We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,  said Faith Ward, the scheme's chief responsible investment officer.

The U.S. State Department concluded  upon further review, fiancés would now be included as close family members,  said a State Department official who requested anonymity. The Trump administration had previously decided, on the basis of its interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, that grandparents, grandchildren and fiancés traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The 90-day ban took effect at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT Friday), along with a 120-day ban on all refugees. On Monday, the Supreme Court revived parts of Trump's travel ban on people from the six Muslim-majority countries, narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a March 6 executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, who also requested anonymity, said it would be updating its guidance to state that fiancés would not be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The Supreme Court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the United States. As an example, the court said those with a  close familial relationship  with someone in the United States would be covered. The state of Hawaii asked a federal judge in Honolulu on Thursday evening to determine whether the Trump administration had interpreted the court's decision too narrowly. Hawaii said in a court filing that the U.S. government intended to violate the Supreme Court's instructions by improperly excluding from the United States people who actually have a close family relationship to U.S. persons, echoing criticism from immigrant and refugee groups. Hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship  a plain violation of the Supreme Court's command.  Hawaii's Attorney General Doug Chin asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who blocked Trump's travel ban in March, to issue an order  as soon as possible  clarifying how the Supreme Court's ruling should be interpreted. Watson ordered the Justice Department to respond to Hawaii's request by Monday, and said he would allow Hawaii to reply by July 6. 'Keep Fighting' A senior U.S. official did not answer directly when asked how barring grandparents or grandchildren would make the United States safer, but instead pointed to Trump's guidance to pause  certain travel while we review our security posture.  The U.S. government expected  things to run smoothly  and  business as usual  at U.S. ports of entry, another senior U.S. official told reporters. A handful of immigration lawyers gathered at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Thursday in case of any problems.  We're going to keep fighting this ban, even if it applies very narrowly,  said Sirine Shebaya, a senior staff attorney at Muslim Advocates.  It's still a Muslim ban, and its still trying to send a message to a whole community that they're not welcome here.  The administration said refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the United States would not be exempted from the ban, likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months. Hawaii said in its court filing it was  preposterous  not to consider a formal link with a resettlement agency a qualifying relationship. Refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would-be refugees would qualify as  bona fide.  The administration's decision likely means that few refugees beyond a 50,000-cap set by Trump would be allowed into the country this year. A U.S. official said that, as of Wednesday evening, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year. The State Department said refugees scheduled to arrive through July 6 could still enter. Trump first announced a temporary travel ban on Jan. 27, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop better security vetting. The order caused chaos at airports, as officials scrambled to enforce it before it was blocked by courts. Opponents argued that the measure discriminated against Muslims and that there was no security rationale for it. A revised version of the ban was also halted by courts. The State Department guidance, distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday evening and seen by Reuters, fleshed out the Supreme Court's ruling about people who have a  bona fide  relationship with an individual or entity in the United States. It defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations. A department cable said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés,  and any other 'extended' family members  were not considered close family. The guidelines also said workers with offers of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer addressing U.S. audiences would be exempt from the ban, but that arrangements such as a hotel reservation would not be considered bona fide relationships.

In what he called a policy of  energy dominance,  Trump re-branded efforts to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to markets in Eastern Europe and Asia that had been set in motion during the previous presidential administration. The United States also will offer to export coal to Ukraine, where energy consumers often have suffered from cuts in natural gas supply by Russia.  We are here today to unleash a new American energy policy,  Trump said at an event at the Department of Energy attended by oil and coal executives and union members who build pipelines.  We will export American energy all around the world.  Trump plans to promote U.S. LNG exports at a meeting next week in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe, a region heavily reliant on Russian supplies. Trump then will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Germany, in the first meeting between the two leaders, coming amid rising tensions over interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  After decades of being a major importer of natural gas, the United States is set to become a net exporter of gas later this year or in 2018 thanks to the boom in fracking in states such as Texas and Pennsylvania.  There is currently one operating U.S. LNG exporting facility in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, with four others currently under construction that are expected to become operational between 2018 and 2020. As the United States aims to boost LNG exports, it will  compete for markets with Australia, Qatar and Russia, other major gas producers. U.S. crude oil exports have also risen after former president Barack Obama signed a law in 2015 allowing the shipments. 'Hell of a Lot More Friends' U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during an 'Unleashing American Energy' event at the Department of Energy in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Carlos BarriaWhile many of Trump's opponents have said his plan to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate has the potential to harm the country's relations around the world,  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at the event that energy exports will strengthen ties with allies.  The United States is in a position  to be able to clearly create a hell of a lot more friends by being able to deliver to them energy and not being held hostage by some countries, Russia in particular,  Perry said. Whether it is sending LNG to Poland or Ukraine,  the entirety of the EU totally get it that if we can lay in American LNG ... we can be able to have an alternative to Russia,  for natural gas sales to Europe, Perry said. Slideshow (2 Images)Earlier this month, Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A) delivered the first U.S. cargoes of LNG to Poland and the Netherlands. The Energy Department on Thursday approved additional LNG exports from the Lake Charles project in Louisiana, which is under development. Trump announced plans to offer coal exports to Ukraine, as well as lift restrictions on U.S. lending for coal projects overseas.  Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons (of coal),  he said.  Right now, there are many other places that need it too and we want to sell it to them and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.  The Trump administration will launch a review of the ailing nuclear power industry, which has experienced a slew of closures due to stagnant electricity demand and low natural gas prices. Trump's 2018 budget included $120 million for addressing nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and other projects, but most of the state's politicians oppose that project. In addition, the State Department issued a permit for a NuStar Logistics LP for its New Burgos Pipeline oil product pipeline from the United States to Mexico with a capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day.  In 2016, the United States exported about 879,000 barrels of petroleum products daily to Mexico, more than any other country, according to the Energy Department. For the year, the United States exported 4.7 million barrels a day of products – including gasoline, diesel and other refined products – around the world, making it the world’s largest exporter of refined petroleum products.

U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, in San Diego, issued a preliminary injunction halting the law while he takes up the underlying complaint filed last month by five California residents backed by the California Rifle & Pistol Association, a lobby group.  If this injunction does not issue, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens will have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess one's self of lawfully acquired property,  Benitez wrote in his 66-page order. California has some of the nation's most complex gun laws. Battles over guns in California are part of a fierce debate over gun-control measures in the wake of deadly mass shootings across the United States, including the 2015 rampage at a holiday party in San Bernardino. Since 2000, California has prohibited buying, selling, or importing  large-capacity  magazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds, according to the complaint. There are some exceptions, including for active and retired law enforcement officers and for movie actors using a large magazine as a prop. Voters expanded the law last year under Proposition 63 to prohibit the possession of such magazines and impose penalties on violators that can include up to one year in jail and a fine of $100 per magazine, the complaint said. The plaintiffs argue the law violates their rights under the U.S Constitution to bear arms and receive due process, and against the government seizing their property without just compensation, the complaint said. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, tasked with defending the law, argued in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction that the magazines are not protected by the Second Amendment and are featured prominently in some of the most serious crimes, including mass shootings.  Restricting large-capacity magazines and preventing them from ending up in the wrong hands is critical for the well-being of our communities,  Becerra said in a statement following the order. It was unclear whether Becerra would appeal the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The order was cheered by the California Rifle & Pistol Association, which is associated with the National Rifle Association, and the San Diego County residents who either own, or are seeking to buy, higher capacity magazines.  Law abiding gun owners have a right to choose to have these magazines to help them defend themselves and their families,  said Chuck Michel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Separately on Thursday, a federal judge in Sacramento denied a motion for a preliminary injunction in a similar lawsuit challenging Proposition 63, Becerra said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/california-court-guns-idUSL1N1JR0BY"},

Germany has some of the world's toughest laws covering defamation, public incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. But few online cases are prosecuted. The law gives social media networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case. Failure to comply could see a company fined up to 50 million euros, and the company's chief representative in Germany fined up to 5 million euros. The Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, hailed the law as  the logical next step for effectively tackling hate speech since all voluntary agreements with the platform providers have been virtually unsuccessful.  German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the measure to  end the internet law of the jungle  was long overdue and dismissed suggestions that it would infringe freedom of speech. The issue has taken on more urgency amid concerns in Germany that proliferating fake news and racist content, particularly targeting migrants, could sway public opinion in the run-up to a national election due on Sept. 24. Concerns But organizations representing digital companies, consumers and journalists have accused the government of rushing a law through parliament that could damage free speech. Facebook, which has 29 million active users in Germany - more than a third of the total population - has said it is working hard to remove illegal content, deleting 3,500 posts per week in Germany in the past two months.  This law as it stands now will not improve efforts to tackle this important societal problem,  a spokesman said, adding Facebook did not think it had been consulted enough. Facebook noted that in May it had announced plans to add an extra 3,000 workers around the world over the next year to monitor reports of inappropriate material, in addition to 4,500 people already reviewing posts. In Berlin, Facebook's partner Arvato will employ up to 700 staff for  content moderation  by the end of the year. A German government survey has shown that Facebook deleted just 39 percent of content deemed criminal and Twitter only 1 percent, even though they had signed a code of conduct including a pledge to delete hate speech within 24 hours. However, Facebook says it has significantly improved its processes since then and is now removing 87 percent of posts reported by German non-governmental organizations. Twitter has also made a number of changes, including adding new filtering options, putting limits on accounts it had identified as engaging in abusive behavior and stopping those users from creating new accounts. In response to criticism of the draft law, the government softened the legislation by excluding email and messenger providers and opening up the option of creating joint monitoring facilities to make decisions about what content to remove. It also made clear that a fine would not necessarily be imposed after just one infraction, but only after a company systematically refused to act or does not set up a proper complaint management system.

The strategy worked: the franchise quickly became known as a hot place to hang out, drink signature Slurpees and use free wifi. What failed was a plan to attract repeat customers willing to spend money. Eight years after the chain's first Jakarta store opened, PT Modern Internasional Tbk, the owner of the 7-Eleven master franchise in Indonesia, is closing all its domestic outlets, which totaled 161 at the end of 2016. The company last week cited  limited resources  as a reason for the closure. Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd, the ultimate parent of the global 7-Eleven chain, said it would  search for someone to take on the franchise and hope to restart business soon.   Indonesia is an important country for us. This is not the end for 7-Eleven's business,  a spokesman said by phone, adding the closure had  almost no impact  on its results. In addition to thrifty Indonesian consumers, industry participants also blame intense competition and a 2015 nationwide ban on alcohol sales at minimarkets for the franchise's struggles. A view inside an empty 7-Eleven convenience store is seen in Jakarta, Indonesia June 27, 2017.Agoes Rudianto The concept is interesting, but is it profitable?  said Tutum Rahanta, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Retailers Association.  The crowd is created by people who just hang out, but those who want to shop and who can really generate profits don't go there.  Consumers also tend to associate 7-Eleven's competitors such as Indomaret and Alfamart with daily necessities, which serve as a buffer against the alcohol sales ban, Rahanta said, adding 7-Eleven's reach was limited to Jakarta. Last year, Indomaret and Alfamart accounted for 51.2 percent and 38.5 percent of the retail value for Indonesian convenience stores, respectively, according to research firm Euromonitor International. 7-Eleven had a 0.7 percent share. Modern reported a nearly 24 percent fall in its net sales for 7-Eleven to 675.3 billion rupiah ($50.7 million) in 2016 from a year earlier. Modern also has other businesses in medical image and photocopy equipments. Modern's attempt to sell the 7-Eleven franchise and other assets to a unit of PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia Tbk for 1 trillion rupiah also failed last week.  While 7-Eleven's local demise is a product of commercial realities, its closure has still come as a shock to fans.

The 27-year-old Orica-Scott rider has hardly raced professionally in France, but many are predicting he can challenge the likes of champion Chris Froome and fellow-Colombian Nairo Quintana.  This is not one normal season for me but I raced in the Dauphine and also in Australia,  he told a news conference in Duesseldorf, where the Tour begins on Saturday.  The Dauphine was a big shock. It was eight months since I raced in Europe, so everything was a bit of a shock but I am really happy to be back racing, especially in Europe.  Also, it was a shock because I've never done races in France, I never did Dauphine, I never did Paris-Nice, I never did Tour de France, so all of this is new for me.  Specialist climber Chaves shot to prominence last year when he finished second in the Giro and third in the Vuelta.  To begin my first Tour de France is like a dream,  he said.  I remember sitting on the couch back home in Bogota with my dad watching the Tour. That why I am in love with this sport.  To start in this Tour de France is one victory for me.

The service will be at Diana's resting place on the Althorp Estate, her family's ancestral home in central England, where the princes will be joined by William's wife Kate and members of Diana's family. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, will conduct the ceremony. Diana, first wife of William's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died aged 36 in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, after the limousine carrying her and lover Dodi al-Fayed crashed in a tunnel as it tried to escape paparazzi who were chasing them on motorbikes. She was buried on a leafy oval island in the grounds of Althorp amid an outpouring of grief across the world. With the 20th anniversary of her death approaching, both William, 35, and Harry, 32, have spoken publicly about the impact that losing their mother has had on lives.

My mother had just died, and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin, surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television,  he said.  I don't think any child should be asked to do that, under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today.  Both princes have become prominent mental health campaigners, encouraging people to speak openly rather than bottle up their emotions, and William said in April the shock of losing his mother still lingered.  You never get over it, it's such an unbelievably big moment in your life that it never leaves you. You just learn to deal with it,  he said. Meanwhile, Harry said he had come close to a  complete breakdown  on several occasions and had sought counseling in his late twenties to help deal with the grief of losing Diana.

Critics of Maduro have taken to the streets almost daily for three months to protest against what they call the creation of a dictatorship. The protests, which have left nearly 80 dead, frequently culminate in violent clashes with security forces. Ruling Socialist Party officials have launched a series of attacks against chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, from accusations of insanity to promoting violence, after her high-profile break with the government.  The decision by the Venezuelan Supreme Court on 28 June to begin removal proceedings against the Attorney General, freeze her assets and ban her from leaving the country is deeply worrying, as is the ongoing violence in the country,  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a Geneva briefing. The Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber has nullified Ortega's appointment of a deputy attorney general, naming someone else in violation of the law, he said. It also transferred some of her functions to the ombudsperson.  Since March, the Attorney General has taken important steps to defend human rights, documenting deaths during the wave of demonstrations, insisting on the need for due process and the importance of the separation of powers, and calling for people who have been arbitrarily detained to be immediately released,  Colville said.  The U.N. human rights office was concerned the Supreme Court's decision  appears to seek to strip her office of its mandate and responsibilities as enshrined in the Venezuelan Constitution, and undermine the office’s independence .  We urge all powers of the Venezuelan state to respect the constitution and the rule of law, and call on the government to ensure the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of opinion and expression are guaranteed,  Colville said. Maduro says the demonstrations are an attempt to overthrow him with the support of Washington. The United Nations has received increasing reports that security forces have  raided residential buildings, conducted searches without warrants and detained people, allegedly with the intention of deterring people from participating in the demonstrations and searching for opposition supporters,  Colville said.

Gazprom, the leading global gas producer, enjoys monopoly rights on gas pipeline exports. It has lost its exclusive rights to ship seaborne LNG overseas to Rosneft and Novatek, Russia's largest non-state gas producer. Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been vying for pipeline gas exports as it strives to grow globally. It now wants permission to export to the parts of Europe in which Gazprom does not operate. The Russian producer has a memorandum with BP, which owns a 19.75 stake in the Russian company, to trade up to 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas annually in Europe. Rosneft vice president Vlada Rusakova, a former Gazprom executive, said the company wants to conduct  an experiment  in supplying gas to new markets  in coordination  with Gazprom.  We are not counting on a total lifting of export restrictions. This would be harmful for Gazprom, especially against the background of a difficult financial and economic situation at the company,  she said in emailed comments. She added that as part of the  experiment , Rosneft could supply gas to markets where Gazprom is not present and into which U.S. LNG could be imported. Rusakova did not identify any such European countries.  Of course, this should be done in close coordination with Gazprom, in order to avoid competition between Russian gas suppliers.  Gazprom targets $32-34 billion in revenues from exporting more than 180 bcm to Europe and Turkey this year. Rosneft produced almost 70 bcm of gas last year, earning 208 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) in revenues from gas sales at home. New Markets Rosneft, like Novatek, is winning some of Gazprom's clients at home thanks to a more flexible gas pricing policy. But unlike Novatek or Gazprom, Rosneft plans to have an LNG plant only in Russia, as it eyes Russia's far east and Asian markets. The company wants to export gas to China, where Gazprom plans to start shipping gas in 2019-2021 via the Power of Siberia pipeline, currently under construction. It also wants access to China's domestic gas market and end-users via swap deals.  There are significant gas resources in Russia's east, while no infrastructure has been built. And that's why we are interested in gaining access to the future Power of Siberia pipeline,  Rusakova said. Rosneft plans to produce 100 bcm of gas per year by 2020 and become the world's third-largest producer of natural gas sometime later, thanks to a number of international projects. Last year, Rosneft agreed to buy a stake of up to 35 percent in Egypt's Zohr offshore gas field from Italy's Eni. The Russian company also plans to expand in gas projects elsewhere, including Mozambique and Venezuela. Rusakova said Rosneft and Venezuelan state company PDVSA may consider building an LNG plant in Venezuela.

Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March 2019, forcing banks to restructure in some cases so they can be sure of continuing to serve cross border customers to and from London.  As you know, we asked the banks we directly supervise to share their Brexit strategies with us. Having analysed these strategies, I think it is fair to say that most banks are not where they should be,  Daniele Nouy told a Brexit workshop in Frankfurt on Friday. The BoE meanwhile, has given domestic and foreign banks in Britain a July 14 deadline to spell out how they would cope if there is no trading deal with Europe after the UK leaves the EU.  My job is to ensure that banks are prepared and have emergency plans, which we'll review, then ask banks to improve,  Carney told German financial daily Handelsblatt.  We have been reviewing these plans since the referendum and in about ten days, banks have to give us an update. Our job is to worry about the worst case scenario, which would be no deal. But we think it’s possible to have an agreement in the end,  Carney said. Banks have told the ECB that it was too early to plan for Brexit, but Nouy said it made no sense to adopt a  wait-and-see  attitude as the queue for new licences might be long. Some euro zone bank branches in London may have to obtain a new licence to become a subsidiary, she said.  And you should not count on transition periods that have not yet been agreed,  she said. Big trading banks that decide to open new subsidiaries in the EU are trying to work out whether they could still book trades at their hubs in London after Brexit to save on costs.  The policy we choose with regard to booking models is likely to affect euro area banks' activities in the UK and elsewhere,  Nouy said.  Because this issue is relevant on a global scale, we need some time to develop our position. We want to get it right. Still, we are aware that you would like us to clearly articulate our policy stance sooner rather than later.  More Clarity Kieran Donoghue, head of International Financial Services at Ireland's Investment and Development Agency, said he expects more information about how much activity and staff banks will shift from London, from July 14.  There will be much more clarity on what the groups intend to do. For the large and most complex, they will have to be Day One ready before April 2019,  Donoghue told Reuters. Donoghue said the increased scrutiny by regulators means that unlike in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, financial firms can no longer think about shifting the absolute minimum to maintain customer links. Financial centres in Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg are already pitching for a slice of Britain's financial services market. Ireland has received over 80 enquiries from banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain, with more than a handful expected to set up new operations or expand existing ones. Some big firms may shift operations from London to several sites in the EU, Donoghue said, echoing the views of Christian Noyer, the former French central bank governor who is drumming up Brexit business for Paris. But Donoghue also said:  Regulators are pragmatic. You can't cut off London.

A large part of Syria's agricultural heartland in the north has been under the control of Islamic State since 2014, when the ultra-hardline jihadist group swept through the area and established a de facto capital in Raqqa.  Many farmers have fled their land, with some saying they have not harvested crops for three years. While Islamic State has been slowly driven back from their territory by U.S.-backed forces in recent weeks, the retreating militants have laid waste to agricultural infrastructure in the area, which produces the bulk of Syria's main staple wheat.   The Syrian agriculture ministry's wheat production forecast puts the 2017 crop at 2 million tonnes.  However officials in the Raqqa Civil Council (RCC), which is expected to govern the northern region if and when U.S.-backed forces defeat the militants, say the actual figure will be around half the government's forecast.  Production is weak. It won't be 2 million tonnes,  said Omar Aloush, a senior official in the council.  Production this year for all of Syria will be about 1 million tonnes.  This was corroborated by a government source, who said the actual figure for the wheat harvest, which began this month would be far removed from the ministry's projection.  The real figures will be obvious in another three weeks or so when the buying season is in full force, but I can say for sure it will be much lower than 2 million,  the person said. While President Bashar al-Assad has scored vital battlefield gains against rebels seeking to oust him - in a six-year-old civil war separate from the Islamic State battle - he is under pressure to ensure supplies of strategic commodities such as wheat keep flowing to supporters in areas under his control and avoid the risk of unrest.  His government needs about 1 to 1.5 million tonnes of wheat annually to feed those areas. The agriculture ministry could not be reached for comment. Syria used to produce 4 million tonnes in a good year and was able to export 1.5 million tonnes. The fall in output has put Assad's government under increasing pressure to import the strategic grain.  Syria's state wheat buyer, the General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob), struck a risky deal in October to buy 1 million tonnes of wheat from a little known Russian firm to feed government-held areas and prevent bread shortages after the sharp drop in national wheat production.  No wheat from that deal has arrived yet and traders have said it is in jeopardy.  'Not a Single Tractor' Reuters interviews with farmers and traders inside and outside Syria, as well as the RCC officials, suggest the country will be facing a food crisis for years to come and that there is little prospect in sight of wheat output returning to anywhere near the levels seen before the civil war.  Many farmers in the north abandoned their land in the face of Islamic State's advance while those who remained on their farms are struggling to make ends meet as, being in the jihadists' territory, they are unable to sell wheat to the state, which previously provided a steady source of income. Some hope to pick up the pieces once Islamic State are defeated, but others - like Hamada Moussa said - have given up hope of recovering their businesses. Moussa, who had made a decent living in the village of Djade al-Mughara outside Raqqa, said he and his family were lucky to survive when they abandoned their farm three years ago.  My son and I escaped before they tried to behead us,  he said.  I have nothing left. Islamic State stole my supplies from storage after I fled and took over.  We don't have a single tractor or water pump left.  Falous Moussa said his farming business in Djade al-Mughara was wiped out by the militants and that he and other farmers were struggling to feed themselves.   No one has given us a single grain of rice,  he said.  They even took our clothes, our shoes.  When U.S.-allied Kurdish and Arab forces began driving back Islamic State in the north, the militants inflicted as much damage as possible as they left, officials and farmers said. In villages such as Tel al-Semen, they blew up bridges and damaged irrigation canals, which are now dry. Electrical wires were ripped down from power stations vital to farming. Nearby, a building which once housed a bakery lies gutted and burned.     Empty Silos, Parched Land Syria's wheat harvest nearly halved to 1.3 million tonnes in 2016, the lowest level in 27 years, as fighting and poor rainfall further degraded the farming sector. The Hasaka area in the north is home to one of Syria’s biggest wheat silos, a vast complex that is now empty. Silo officials and employees spend much of their time chatting. Supplies, officials say, are limited to 12,000 tonnes a month that are shipped from the town of Qamishli to one section of the plant that produces small quantities of bread.   We are out of business,  said silo official Hajar Omar.  That is also true of silos across the north, towering over parched land. As a result, key wheat reserves are gone.  Farmers and officials in the RCC, which was established by allies of the U.S.-led coalition that began attacking Raqqa this month, accuse militants of stealing supplies and selling them to traders over the border with Turkey.  The silos are empty because the wheat was seized by Islamic State and armed groups,  said Aloush, the senior RCC official. Syrian wheat trader Ishak Dandal is also pessimistic and has diversified to selling automobiles to try and make a living.   Water is scarce and equipment has been destroyed. One dunam (0.1 hectares) used to yield 700 kg before the war,  he said.   Now it yields 150 because there is not enough water.

The financial hub was shaken on Tuesday, after a rout mainly in small-cap Hong Kong stocks wiped HK$24 billion ($3.08 billion) off the market. The precise cause of the sudden sell-off remains unclear. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said the stocks were all characterised by small public floats, concentrated shareholdings, thin turnover and cross-shareholdings that encourage volatility. The sell-off has raised questions over Hong Kong's ability to enforce its rules, as the territory's relationship with China - whose companies dominate the Hong Kong market but remain beyond its legal reach - comes under the spotlight.  The fundamental challenge you have, if you are sitting in Hong Kong, is managing accountability,  said Keith Pogson, EY financial services lead based in Hong Kong.  The company may have a chairman and board who are mainlanders and it's possible for them to run off to the mainland rather than stand here and be held accountable to global investors. For the Hong Kong exchange and the SFC, this remains a massive challenge.  Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula that allows Hong Kong to operate a separate, autonomous judicial system. Since the handover, Chinese company listings have helped boost the Hong Kong stock exchange nine-fold, transforming the small territory of just 7.3 million people into a $3.7 trillion global market. Around 60 percent of companies listed in Hong Kong originate from the mainland. Sloppier Standards Hong Kong scores relatively well for corporate governance compared with the rest of Asia, coming second out of 11 markets ranked by the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA) on their rules, culture, enforcement, audit regime, and political environment. But the dominance of Chinese firms means investors in the territory's stocks are exposed to much sloppier standards on the mainland, which the ACGA ranked ninth. China's overall scores have fallen since 2014 due to increased state interventions and it scores very low on general corporate governance culture. Chinese companies listing in Hong Kong must comply with its rules and disclosure requirements, but the mainland's weak corporate governance culture still seeps across the border. Of 15 main board companies whose shares were halted from trading by the SFC due to accounting irregularities or investigations since 2011, 13 are mainland Chinese, according to a Reuters analysis. They include two of the biggest scandals, China Huishan Dairy and Hanergy Thin Film. Other scandals involving companies that were de-listed, such as China Metal Recycling and Hontex International, were also mainland Chinese. Punishing such companies with deterrent force can be tough, according to legal experts and regulatory sources. The company's main assets, audit working papers, and management typically reside on the mainland and can only be accessed with cooperation from the Chinese authorities. In theory, Chinese courts should recognise rulings from Hong Kong courts on issues such as liquidations, but liquidators say it is difficult in practice to make them stick. Enforcing China Metal Recycling's liquidation order on the mainland has been a battle, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Once a Chinese company is listed, the enforcement environment is working against the Hong Kong regulators. Other than throwing them off the exchange, or hoping the management will come to the table in Hong Kong, it can be very difficult,  said Pogson, a member of the stock exchange's listing committee but who was speaking in a personal capacity. Greater Integration Hong Kong and Chinese markets are only growing more integrated, with the launch of projects to connect their stock and bond markets. The Hong Kong exchange has wants to lure Chinese companies to a new board that would allow  pre-profit  companies or start-ups to list. In a statement, the Hong Kong exchange said  in relation to the listing rules which we are seeking to enforce, and given the nature of the sanctions that we have, [cross-border enforcement] does not provide a particular challenge”. Regulatory sources said much closer cooperation between the SFC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) over the past two years had seen some successes. They include a landmark ruling this month forcing the former chairman and CEO of China's Greencool Technology to disgorge gains derived from overstating the company's profits. In April, SFC CEO Ashley Alder said in a speech that the SFC and CSRC were  especially focused on the opportunities but also the risks associated with far greater cross-boundary market connectivity . The regulatory sources said it was in the interests of the SFC and the CSRC to cooperate to protect Hong Kong.  In the case of Hong Kong we do depend on cooperation by the mainland regulators and their court system,  said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist who also called this week's small-cap rout.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and it doesn't mean we can't win.

Iraqi government forces attacked Islamic State's remaining redoubt in Mosul's Old City on Friday, a day after formally declaring the end of the insurgents' self-declared caliphate and the capture of the historic mosque which symbolized their power. Hundreds of families have received threatening letters laying down a deadline for leaving, which amount to  acts of vengeance , U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said.  We urge the Iraqi government to take action to halt such imminent evictions or any type of collective punishment, and to reinforce the formal justice system to bring perpetrators to justice,  he told a news briefing in Geneva. Any criminal liability of one family member cannot be transferred to another innocent person, he said. So-called  night letters  have been left at homes or distributed in neighborhoods including the towns of Shirqat in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad, Hit, east of the  capital, Qayyara, south of Mosul, and in Mosul itself.  These letters typically warn people to leave by a particular date or face forced expulsion. Many of these threats are the result of tribal agreements that explicitly demand that families of affiliated ISIL (Islamic State) members be excluded from the area,  he said. Forced evictions mean losing housing and access to food, education and health services, he said. The U.N. human rights office reminded all parties to the fighting, including the U.S.-led international coalition, that they must seek to protect civilians.  International humanitarian law requires abiding by the principles of humanity, precaution, proportionality and distinction between military and civilian infrastructure.

The 30-year-old British actress, who has had a leading role in the Emmy award-winning medieval fantasy series since it premiered in 2011, said she was often the only woman on set and would have fewer lines than her male co-stars.  I feel so naive for saying it, but it's like dealing with racism,  she said in an interview with Rolling Stones magazine.  You're aware of it, and you're aware of it, but one day, you go, 'Oh, my God, it's everywhere!' It took me a really long time to see that I do get treated differently. But I look around, and that's my daily life,  Clarke added. Last year, women and girls comprised just 29 percent of protagonists among the 100 top-grossing U.S. films, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, California. Clarke said it was important for strong women to be represented on screen, such as her character Daenerys Targaryen, a queen vying for the throne in the fictional series.  Anyone who seems to think that it's not needed need only look at the political environment we're all living in to be like, 'Oh, no, it's needed. It is needed,'   she said.

(Reuters) - Baidu, China's leading internet search company, is set to announce the first vehicle manufacturing partners for its self-driving software next week, including Chery Automobile, one of the country's biggest carmakers, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The partnerships may be announced in Beijing, but they are the result of work that is happening 6,000 miles away in Silicon Valley, where Baidu and more than 30 other Chinese companies are busy developing and funding software and hardware to power internet-connected, autonomous vehicles. The goal is to get those vehicles on the roads in China, the world's biggest auto market. The hope is that the same technology, embedded in exported Chinese vehicles, can then conquer the United States.  Baidu Inc, known as China's Google, is playing a central role in that effort. Like Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc, Baidu is using what it has learned in mapping and artificial intelligence to design the software and systems necessary to make self-driving cars a reality.  Its project, unveiled in April, is named Apollo after NASA's moon-landing program. The name indicates the scale of Baidu's ambition, but also the difficulty of the project.  It is by no means clear that it will succeed in one of the most competitive parts of the technology industry. Chief scientist Andrew Ng and self-driving unit manager Jing Wang left earlier this year to form their own startups.   The competition for talent is keen,  Jingao Wang, the new head of Baidu's Silicon Valley self-driving team, said in an interview at its technology center in the shadow of NASA's Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California.  There is never enough.  Baidu has at least one advantage over Waymo, based just five miles away at the sprawling Googleplex in Mountain View. It now has a presence in the United States, whereas Alphabet has no footprint in China, after Google shuttered its website there in 2010 rather than bow to the government's internet censorship. Silicon Valley Dragons In 2011, Baidu was one of the first of the new generation of Chinese companies to set up a base in Silicon Valley, in order to tap the world's deepest tech talent pool. Since then, it has made itself the center of a  China network  of almost three dozen firms there, through investments, acquisitions and partnerships.  For a graphic on the links between some of China's tech firms in Silicon Valley tech firms, click on tmsnrt.rs/2sW51iZ Over six years, Baidu has assembled a formidable 200-person tech team, recruiting from top U.S. universities and established leaders in the auto and tech industry, including Google, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp. It has expanded its technical capability through the acquisition of vision and robotics startup xPerception, a close partnership with chipmaker Nvidia Corp, and investments in other Silicon Valley firms such as Velodyne, an expert in lidar, the light-sensing technology key to letting self-driving cars  see  where they are going.  Baidu was followed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's largest internet company, which has bought its way into Silicon Valley, including a $1.8-billion investment earlier this year in Tesla Inc, the California electric car maker which is also working on self-driving technology. Baidu and Tencent have teamed up to bankroll Nio, a startup aiming to put autonomous electric vehicles on American and Chinese roads by 2020, which is now valued at $2.8 billion. Nio has its main offices in Shanghai and San Jose in Silicon Valley. Not far away, another Chinese-funded self-driving startup, Faraday Future, has a small team of engineers working from the U.S. office of sister company LeEco.  The money that Baidu and other Chinese investors have invested in Silicon Valley has driven up the value of mobility startups such as Zoox, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Palo Alto venture investor. Pivot to Ai  Chinese newcomers have now spread across the San Francisco Bay Area. Palo Alto, the birthplace of Silicon Valley, has emerged as a financial hub for China-connected venture capital firms such as GSR Ventures and ZhenFund. In neighboring Menlo Park, the center of U.S. venture capital, China's largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp has a tech center that houses the state-owned company's investment arm. China-backed Lucid Motors, a self-driving electric vehicle startup, also makes its home in Menlo Park.  It takes the whole industry to make self-driving become real, instead of one company,  said Amy Gu, managing partner of Hemi Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that invests in autonomous vehicle startups.  It is not only about spending money, but about being able to come up with real products for which customers will pay.  It is not clear how quickly - if at all - Baidu will get to the point of producing such a product.  The company is struggling with a decline in its core advertising business, hurt by government curbs on medical ads in China and some unsuccessful side ventures. It is now looking to shift its focus to artificial intelligence under the guidance of Qi Lu, a former Microsoft executive. Self-driving is a key application of that.  Baidu has not specified how it intends to make money from the open-source Apollo project, but it has said it will integrate cloud-based data services into the platform, much as Google has done with its ubiquitous Android smartphone operating system.  The company may fill in some details at a developer conference it has scheduled for July 5 in Beijing, when it releases some Apollo technology for cars driving on urban streets and will announce its first manufacturing partners.  That could be a turning point when the technology focus will begin to shift from California to China, according to Simoudis.   The dependence on Silicon Valley talent may not be eliminated, but it will continue to diminish as the Chinese build their own capabilities,  he said.

But even without being a techie I know that our future is digital,  the European Commission president insisted.   Digital is the DNA of your country and it needs to become part of the European DNA,  he told Ratas. A former Estonian premier runs the digital portfolio in Juncker's Commission in Brussels. The executive's program, backed by national governments, includes commitments to build a  digital single market  for Europe and favor tech investment.  President Juncker said that he expects the Estonian presidency to make substantial progress especially in digital themes,  Ratas said.

In January, the outgoing Obama administration gave Sudan 180 days to improve its record and resolve its political and military conflicts before Washington lifted some economic sanctions that had been stepped up in 2006 for what it said was complicity in violence in Sudan's Darfur region.  But with the deadline approaching, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said on its Facebook page it wants to see the Sudanese government make  stronger progress  towards these goals.      The United States remains very concerned about Sudan's human rights record, including the continued closing of political space, and restrictions on religious freedom, freedom of expression, including press freedom,  the statement said. The embassy said it was still monitoring the government's progress to determine if it had met the requirements for sanctions to be lifted in July.  In this process we have pressed to ensure Sudan has adhered to its unilateral cessation of hostilities in conflict areas and ceased all indiscriminate aerial bombardment, a key human rights concern,  it said.  The United Nations says up to 300,000 people have been killed and millions displaced during the Darfur conflict.  On Thursday the U.N. Security Council agreed to gradually reduce the number of peacekeepers in Darfur that could almost halve the number of troops over the next year if conditions are conducive and the government is cooperative.  Sudan is one of six countries whose citizen are subject to new restrictions on travel to the United States, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision this week to revive parts of President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban on nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  Sudan said on Tuesday it hoped the restrictions would not affect the planned lifting of sanctions.

The early months of 2017 were marked by the so-called Trump trades premised on U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges of multi-trillion dollar spending and by a change in Europe's political and growth outlook that has lured back investors. But arguably the most significant shift for investors came in the last week of the second quarter when, in what looked like a concerted move, central bank policymakers appeared to signal it would soon be time to wind back the monetary stimulus that has buoyed markets for much of this decade. As this graphic reut.rs/2sxO66c shows the dollar index, already down 4.5 percent for 2017 a week ago, was down 6.5 percent at Thursday's close and on track for its worst quarter in seven years and worst first half since 2003. This despite the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates twice this year. The euro, boosted by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinting on Wednesday at tweaks to the bank's ultra-loose monetary policy stance, is up more than 8 percent year-to-date and heading for its best quarter in seven. Dollar weakness has helped lift emerging equities, as measured by MSCI's main index almost 18 percent in dollar terms so far this year. World stocks have gained more than 10 percent in dollar terms, their best first half since 2003. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index gained 9.6 percent, just ahead of the S&P; 500 on 9.2 percent. Stuck at the bottom of the performance league table, down 16.5 percent in dollar terms year-to-date is Brent crude oil , hit by a perception that output cuts agreed by OPEC producers and others will not be enough to stem the glut of oil. It was on track for its worst first six months of any year since 1998. In Brexit-bound Britain, which has just been through a messy election, the pound has dropped 3 percent against the euro. The weaker currency has been a boost for exporters, lifting the country's main FTSE 100 stock index 8.2 percent. Emerging markets have shrugged off the U.S. rate rises and the oil and tech tumbles. Bonds in emerging market currencies have returned almost 10 percent in dollar terms, while hard currency sovereign debt is up 6 percent. But within emerging markets there are losers as well as winners: tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 Russian equities, heavily oil-reliant and a star of late 2016, have lost 17 percent but energy importer Turkey's stock index has risen 30 percent, despite inflation, domestic political risks and policy wobbles. The Mexican peso is the world's top performing currency, up 15 percent on the dollar, as faith wanes in Trump's ability to implement anti-trade and anti-immigration pledges. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh Perhaps the biggest surprise has been Poland's zloty which has surged 13 percent against the dollar. Brazil's real has been one of the worst-performing currencies, down 4 percent in 2017 due to fresh corruption scandals that have hit the country.

Official data published on Friday confirmed that the world's fifth-biggest economy went into a sharp slowdown in early 2017. While there was a hint of an improvement in the dominant services sector as the second quarter began, the picture was bleak for consumers who are Britain's main drivers of growth. They are facing the double hit of accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth. The Office for National Statistics said household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell for a third straight quarter. That was the worst run in 40 years and took the household savings ratio down to an all-time low. Consumers have suffered a sharp loss of confidence, according to the first GfK survey published since the inconclusive outcome of this month's national election. The weak data comes just as some policymakers at the BoE have started to signal that a first rate hike in a decade might be approaching in order to curb the sharp rise in inflation. An unexpectedly close 5-3 vote to keep rates on hold this month was followed up by comments from the central bank's chief economist that he might vote for a hike soon too, surprising investors who had been expecting no hike until 2019. Governor Mark Carney says he is watching to see how the economy copes with the launch of Brexit talks and whether investment can help compensate for the weakness among consumers, something that did not appear imminent in Friday's data. Mood Music The ONS said business investment grew by a quarterly 0.6 percent in the first three months of 2017, only partially offsetting a fall in the fourth quarter.  Given the dominance of consumer spending and the squeeze that we envisage, it would take a big surge in the likes of business investment to overturn the consumer squeeze to growth,  Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec, said. The ONS also said Britain's giant services sector grew by a monthly 0.2 percent in April, slightly slower than in March. But growth was up 0.2 percent in the three months to April, faster than 0.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Alan Clarke, an economist with Scotiabank, said that was consistent with the BoE's forecast of a pickup in overall economic growth in the second quarter and meant a rate hike at the BoE's next meeting in early August remained on the table.  To be clear, given our view of the outlook for the economy - not least the consumer, growth, wages, domestically generated inflation - we don't think that the Bank should hike, but given the mood music from recent speakers, there is a very good chance that they will,  he said. The ONS confirmed the economy grew by just 0.2 percent in the January-March period from the previous three months, down from growth of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sudden slowdown meant Britain went from being one of the fastest-growing economies among the Group of Seven rich nations to its weakest performer in the first quarter. The ONS said household spending grew more slowly than in late 2016 as real household disposable income fell by 1.4 percent in quarterly terms, the biggest drop since early 2013. An ONS official said the fall in the household savings rate to its record low probably in part reflected the timing of tax payments  but the underlying trend is for a continued fall .

The conditions for rising inflation are in place and growth is accelerating so policymakers should be ready to claw back unprecedented stimulus measures, Lautenschlaeger, a German considered one of the top hawks on the rate-setting Governing Council said in Berlin. ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tightening earlier this week, arguing that better growth conditions will naturally provide further accommodation, providing the ECB room to claw back its own stimulus.  Although inflation is not yet on a stable path towards our objective, all the conditions are in place,  Lautenschlaeger, often at odds with Draghi, said.  It is just a question of time and patience.   That is why monetary policy should already be making preparations for a return to a normal stance. And it should adapt its communication accordingly,  she added. The ECB is expected to decide in September whether to extend or wind down its 2.3 trillion euro asset purchase scheme from next year, having to reconcile an apparent contradiction between healthy growth and weak inflation. Inflation ticked down this month while all growth indicators suggest that the bloc is on its best economic run since before the global financial crisis.  Even if no stable trend is visible as yet, it is important to prepare for different times, for there is reason to be optimistic,  Lautenschlaeger said.  Against this backdrop, monetary policy has to adjust at the right time, which is as soon as inflation is on a stable path towards our objective,  she said.

The single currency dropped 0.35 percent to trade at $1.1402, but in the April-June quarter the euro has climbed over 7 percent, putting it on track for its biggest quarterly gain since January-March 2011. The euro shot to one-year highs after Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations that a reduction in stimulus measures would be signalled as soon as September. Though policymakers sought to play this down in the days that followed, investors appear convinced that economic strength will push them to end stimulus sooner rather than later.  This is partly a response to Draghi's comments and also on the back of a euro zone economy that is firing on all cylinders and outperforming the rest of the developed economies,  said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. Growth in the bloc outstripped that of the United States in the first quarter and set the stage for a strong 2017.  It's at a different stage in the cycle to the U.S. so I do expect some of that to cool in the second half of the year, but the growth momentum doesn't seem to be going anywhere,  said Clarke. Money markets are pricing in around an 80 percent chance that the ECB will hike rates over the next year. That's up from just 20 percent earlier this month. Underlying inflation in the euro zone ticked up this month, official data showed on Friday, welcome relief for the ECB as it braces for weak oil prices to drag consumer prices down in the coming months. Conversely, the dollar was on course for its worst quarter in seven years on Friday, recovering only marginally against major peers.  Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a rate hike was likely to be needed as the British economy came closer to running at full capacity. Sterling edged lower 0.3 percent on Friday to $1.2967, halving Thursday's 0.6 percent gain. Two top policymakers at the Bank of Canada also suggested they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July. The euro zone inflation data pushed European shares up 0.55 percent on Friday, but they were still set to end June with their biggest monthly loss in a year as worries over tightening monetary conditions soured the mood. U.S. stock futures also pointed towards a higher open in Wall Street. Earlier, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent, after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. It is up 5.3 percent for the quarter and has risen 18.3 percent this year. In commodities, oil prices continued their recovery this week on a decline in weekly U.S. crude production. U.S. crude added 0.9 percent to $45.35 a barrel in its seventh straight session of gains, bringing its weekly increase to over 5 percent. Global benchmark Brent gained 0.7 percent to $47.77 a barrel, poised for a nearly 10 percent rise for the quarter.

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.  More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record.     Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'     Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.  The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.  The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump's way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.  The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.  Poster Child and Whipping Boy  The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.  Few places highlight the gap between Trump's rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.  German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.  South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.   The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,  McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW's newest X3 sports utility vehicle.  Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.  But the poster child of South Carolina's success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW's plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump's ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was  very bad  on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.  FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014.Chris Keane/File PhotoAnd even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.  Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.  “We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,  Oliver Zipse, BMW's board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters.  We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.  “If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”  The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that  America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”  The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.  Slideshow (3 Images)Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.  Doomsday Scenario   Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don't tear it up,  Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory.  We're going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.   Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina's once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).  The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.  Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.  Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.  Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.  Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a  doomsday scenario  for the region.   This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don't understand the ramifications.   (1 euro = $1.1350)  Additional reporting by Edward Taylor in Munich.

Iraqi government forces attacked Islamic State's remaining redoubt in Mosul's Old City on Friday, a day after formally declaring the end of the insurgents' self-declared caliphate and the capture of the historic mosque which symbolized their power. Hundreds of families have received threatening letters laying down a deadline for leaving, which amount to  acts of vengeance , U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said.  We urge the Iraqi government to take action to halt such imminent evictions or any type of collective punishment, and to reinforce the formal justice system to bring perpetrators to justice,  he told a news briefing in Geneva. Any criminal liability of one family member cannot be transferred to another innocent person, he said. So-called  night letters  have been left at homes or distributed in neighbourhoods including the towns of Shirqat in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad, Hit, east of the capital, Qayyara, south of Mosul, and in Mosul itself.  These letters typically warn people to leave by a particular date or face forced expulsion. Many of these threats are the result of tribal agreements that explicitly demand that families of affiliated ISIL (Islamic State) members be excluded from the area,  he said. Forced evictions mean losing housing and access to food, education and health services, he said. The U.N. human rights office reminded all parties to the fighting, including the U.S.-led international coalition, that they must seek to protect civilians. International humanitarian law requires abiding by the principles of humanity, precaution, proportionality and distinction between military and civilian infrastructure.

Trading volumes of Argus Eurobob oxy gasoline barges totaled 449,000 tonnes in June, beating the previous record in March 2016 of 446,000 tonnes, Argus said. BP bought 313,000 tonnes of the volume in June, the oil company's largest purchase in a single month. It was unclear why London-based BP, one of the world's biggest oil traders, bought such a large volume.  Some traders attributed the move to delayed completion of maintenance at its 90,000 barrels per day Lingen refinery in northwest Germany. A number of refineries in Germany and Switzerland went down for maintenance in recent weeks, leading to the tightening of inland fuel supplies.  Low water levels along the Rhine and Danube rivers also limited barge traffic from the Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam refining and storage hub, furthers exacerbated inland shortages.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters the administration had told Congress of the seven proposed sales on Thursday.  It's now valued about $1.42 billion,  she said. The State Department said the package included technical support for early warning radar, high speed anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and missile components. Nauert said the sales showed U.S.  support for Taiwan's ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,  but there was no change to the United States' long-standing  one China  policy, which recognizes Beijing and not Taipei. The United States is the sole arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Beijing has given Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen the cold shoulder since she took power last year because she leads an independence-leaning ruling party and refuses to recognize the  one China  policy.  On Friday, Tsai's office said that her government will continue  to seek constructive dialogue with Beijing, and promote positive developments in cross-strait relations.   Related CoverageChina's U.S. envoy protests Taiwan arms sales, sanctions on companies (The arms sale) increases Taiwan's confidence and ability to maintain the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,  Tsai's office tweeted. Asked about the sale at an event on Thursday evening in Washington, China's Ambassador Cui Tiankai said the United States was  incorrigible  when it comes to Taiwan, the official party paper the People's Daily reported on its website.  But we should still continue to instruct (them) and continue advancing on the right track of China-U.S. relations because this is what truly fits with for both countries' long term interests,  the paper quoted Cui as saying. The sale, which requires congressional approval, would be the first to Taiwan under Trump and the first since a $1.83 billion sale that former President Barack Obama announced in December 2015, to China's dismay.  The previous package included two navy frigates in addition to anti-tank missiles and amphibious attack vehicles. A State Department official said the latest package primarily represented  upgrades to existing defense capabilities aimed at converting current legacy systems from analog to digital.  Taiwan's defense ministry said the items would enhance air and sea combat capability and early warning defenses. It said Taiwan and the United States would continue to consolidate their security partnership to contribute to long-term stability in the region. Strong Support In a strong sign of congressional support, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee welcomed what he called the  long-overdue  arms sale.  Sales of defensive weapons, based on Taiwan's needs, are a key provision of our commitments as laid out by the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances,  said Rep. Ed Royce, referring to legislation and informal guidelines that steer U.S. relations with Taiwan.    U.S. officials said in March the administration was crafting a big arms sale to Taiwan, but such talk died down as Trump sought to persuade Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, an increasing threat to the United States. Earlier on Thursday, China responded angrily and said it had protested to Washington after a U.S. Senate committee approved a bill calling for the resumption of port visits to Taiwan by the U.S. Navy for the first time since the United States adopted a one-China policy in 1979. The bill also directs the Pentagon to help Taiwan develop an indigenous undersea warfare program and recommends strengthened strategic cooperation with Taipei. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the bill was in violation of the principles of U.S.-China relations and called on Washington to halt military drills with and arms sales to Taiwan  to avoid further impairing broadly cooperative China-U.S. relations.  U.S. officials told Reuters this week that Trump - who alarmed Beijing after assuming office by breaking with decades of precedent and talking to Taiwan's president - was becoming increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and trade. According to the officials, Trump is now considering trade actions against Beijing, despite having heaped praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping after an April summit. Also on Thursday, Washington stepped up pressure on Beijing by imposing sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and accusing a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. Trump plans to meet Xi again on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany next week, U.S. National Security Adviser H.R.

Chicago’s injury-depleted lineup is loaded with young players as the Cubs begin a three-game road series against the last-place Cincinnati Reds on Friday. The Cubs are just one game above .500, but they’re also just one game behind Milwaukee in the National League Central and are coming off a rousing 5-4 win at Washington in which they scored three runs in the top of the ninth inning to split the four-game series. They did so with three starters on the shelf, as Jason Heyward and Ben Zobrist are on the disabled list and reigning NL MVP Kris Bryant is day-to-day with a sprained ankle. “It’s good to see the freshmen and sophomores coming through,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon told reporters. “The frosh had a good day. They have to know they can do that.” The Reds had won three of four following a stretch of 13 losses in 14 games before being routed 11-3 in the finale of their three-game set against visiting Milwaukee on Thursday.

The 27-year-old gave up three runs in the first inning of a loss Sunday at Miami before shutting out the Marlins for the next five frames and recording a season-high six strikeouts. Montgomery has made six relief appearances versus the Reds, including two this season, allowing three runs - all in his last appearance against them on May 17 - over 6 2/3 innings. Feldman has recorded quality starts in two straight outings and three of his last four, and he has been victorious in four of his last five decisions. The 34-year-old won at Washington on Sunday, limiting the NL’s best offense to two runs and seven hits over seven innings. Feldman faced the Cubs for the first time May 17 in Chicago and was dinged for seven runs (five earned) in 2 2/3 innings to take the loss. Walk-Offs 1. The Cubs have won 23 of the last 28 meetings and eight of the last nine series against the Reds, and they’ve homered in their last 15 games at Great American Ball Park. 2.

He really cranked it up (his fastball) pretty good a couple of times. And he's able to maintain his poise in rough waters,  manager Paul Molitor told reporters. The strong outing by the 34-year-old Dominican came on the heels of two sub-par performances, during which he surrendered four homers, 11 runs and 19 hits while splitting a pair of decisions.

It was unclear why London-based BP, one of the world's biggest oil traders, bought such a large volume.  Some traders attributed the move to delayed completion of maintenance at its 90,000 barrels per day Lingen refinery in northwest Germany. A number of refineries in Germany and Switzerland went down for maintenance in recent weeks, leading to the tightening of inland fuel supplies.  Low water levels along the Rhine and Danube rivers also limited barge traffic from the Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam refining and storage hub, furthers exacerbated inland shortages.

The Reuters monthly asset allocation survey of 47 fund managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out between June 15 and 28, a month in which U.S. tech stocks sold off heavily. The rout saw the combined market cap of the five biggest U.S. tech firms drop by $120 billion in less than a week and sparked  of a global equity market reversal. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to end June down 0.9 percent, bringing a seven-month winning streak to a close. It is still up 14 percent so far this year. Around three-quarters of poll respondents who answered a special question on tech stocks said they were not overvalued, but investors have reduced their U.S. equity holdings and rotated into euro zone stocks this month. U.S. stocks were trimmed to 39.7 percent of global equity portfolios, the lowest since November when Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Since then the S&P; 500 has rallied hard and is up 8 percent so far this year on expectations of tax cuts and increased spending. But investors have grown increasingly sceptical that Trump can deliver on his promises.  An unprecedented level of economic and fiscal policy uncertainty still surrounds the new U.S. administration,  said Mouhammed Choukeir, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros.  This could spill into financial market volatility.  He prefers Europe, where valuations are cheap and political noise has quietened since the French election in which centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron won an emphatic victory. Investors raised their euro zone equity holdings to 19.3 percent, a near two-year high, in June. They also showed a preference for euro zone debt over U.S. bonds, raising the former almost 1 percentage point to 27.2 percent of their global bond portfolios. In contrast, they cut their U.S. debt holdings by 2.2 percentage points to 37.9 percent, the lowest since March. Losing Momentum The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time this year in June and set out plans to start cutting its $4.5 billion portfolio. The move showed the Fed's willingness to look past a run of soft inflation data and signalled a determination to move ahead with policy tightening. That has driven the U.S. bond yield curve to its flattest in a decade. Although three-quarters of poll participants who answered a special question on the U.S. economy thought it was strong enough to withstand another Fed rate rise this year, a number expressed reservations. Jan Bopp, an asset allocation strategist at Bank J Safra Sarasin, was amongst those who thought the Fed could be making a mistake in hiking rates.  My concern is that the U.S. economy is losing momentum,  he said, citing car sales, lending surveys and manufacturing.  Despite all that the Fed seems to be very dedicated. If only to get rates high enough to have ammo for the next downturn.  The caution was also evident in broader positioning, with investors trimming their overall equity allocations to 46.5 percent, the lowest since March, and raising their bond holdings to 40.7 percent, the highest since December.  The upswing in global growth that started in 2015 is cooling off and inflation pressures are easing. This is good for bonds but stocks may be disappointed and we are only modestly overweight,  said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM). Brexit Conundrum Investors raised their exposure to UK assets after the June general election, lifting UK equities to 9.9 percent, while UK bond holdings jumped 1.5 percentage points to 10.4 percent, the highest since January. The election resulted in a hung parliament, weakening Prime Minister Theresa May's hand in Brexit negotiations. As a result, three-quarters of poll respondents who answered a question on the election outcome, said it made a softer Brexit more likely, rather than the hard Brexit that May had previously promised her supporters.  The prime minister failed to win backing for a tightly controlled Brexit process focused on cutting immigration and leaving the single market,  said RLAM's Greetham, adding that opponents of a hard Brexit within both the Conservative and Labour parties would argue the public mood is one of compromise. However, Raphael Gallardo, a strategist at Natixis Asset Management, thought it was hard to see how the supporters of a soft Brexit could unite to exert power, saying new elections would be needed for a soft Brexit majority to gain control.

(Reuters) - Baidu, China's leading internet search company, is set to announce the first vehicle manufacturing partners for its self-driving software next week, including Chery Automobile, one of the country's biggest carmakers, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The partnerships may be announced in Beijing, but they are the result of work that is happening 6,000 miles away in Silicon Valley, where Baidu and more than 30 other Chinese companies are busy developing and funding software and hardware to power internet-connected, autonomous vehicles. The goal is to get those vehicles on the roads in China, the world's biggest auto market. The hope is that the same technology, embedded in exported Chinese vehicles, can then conquer the United States.  Baidu Inc, known as China's Google, is playing a central role in that effort. Like Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc, Baidu is using what it has learned in mapping and artificial intelligence to design the software and systems necessary to make self-driving cars a reality.  Its project, unveiled in April, is named Apollo after NASA's moon-landing program. The name indicates the scale of Baidu's ambition, but also the difficulty of the project.  It is by no means clear that it will succeed in one of the most competitive parts of the technology industry. Chief scientist Andrew Ng and self-driving unit manager Jing Wang left earlier this year to form their own startups.   The competition for talent is keen,  Jingao Wang, the new head of Baidu's Silicon Valley self-driving team, said in an interview at its technology center in the shadow of NASA's Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California.  There is never enough.  Baidu has at least one advantage over Waymo, based just five miles away at the sprawling Googleplex in Mountain View. It now has a presence in the United States, whereas Alphabet has no footprint in China, after Google shuttered its website there in 2010 rather than bow to the government's internet censorship. Silicon Valley Dragons In 2011, Baidu was one of the first of the new generation of Chinese companies to set up a base in Silicon Valley, in order to tap the world's deepest tech talent pool. Since then, it has made itself the center of a  China network  of almost three dozen firms there, through investments, acquisitions and partnerships.  For a graphic on the links between some of China's tech firms in Silicon Valley tech firms, click on tmsnrt.rs/2sW51iZ Over six years, Baidu has assembled a formidable 200-person tech team, recruiting from top U.S. universities and established leaders in the auto and tech industry, including Google, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp. It has expanded its technical capability through the acquisition of vision and robotics startup xPerception, a close partnership with chipmaker Nvidia Corp, and investments in other Silicon Valley firms such as Velodyne, an expert in lidar, the light-sensing technology key to letting self-driving cars  see  where they are going.  Baidu was followed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's largest internet company, which has bought its way into Silicon Valley, including a $1.8-billion investment earlier this year in Tesla Inc, the California electric car maker which is also working on self-driving technology. Baidu and Tencent have teamed up to bankroll Nio, a startup aiming to put autonomous electric vehicles on American and Chinese roads by 2020, which is now valued at $2.8 billion. Nio has its main offices in Shanghai and San Jose in Silicon Valley. Not far away, another Chinese-funded self-driving startup, Faraday Future, has a small team of engineers working from the U.S. office of sister company LeEco.  The money that Baidu and other Chinese investors have invested in Silicon Valley has driven up the value of mobility startups such as Zoox, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Palo Alto venture investor. Pivot to Ai  Chinese newcomers have now spread across the San Francisco Bay Area. Palo Alto, the birthplace of Silicon Valley, has emerged as a financial hub for China-connected venture capital firms such as GSR Ventures and ZhenFund. In neighboring Menlo Park, the center of U.S. venture capital, China's largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp has a tech center that houses the state-owned company's investment arm. China-backed Lucid Motors, a self-driving electric vehicle startup, also makes its home in Menlo Park.  It takes the whole industry to make self-driving become real, instead of one company,  said Amy Gu, managing partner of Hemi Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that invests in autonomous vehicle startups.  It is not only about spending money, but about being able to come up with real products for which customers will pay.  It is not clear how quickly - if at all - Baidu will get to the point of producing such a product.  The company is struggling with a decline in its core advertising business, hurt by government curbs on medical ads in China and some unsuccessful side ventures. It is now looking to shift its focus to artificial intelligence under the guidance of Qi Lu, a former Microsoft executive. Self-driving is a key application of that.  Baidu has not specified how it intends to make money from the open-source Apollo project, but it has said it will integrate cloud-based data services into the platform, much as Google has done with its ubiquitous Android smartphone operating system.  The company may fill in some details at a developer conference it has scheduled for July 5 in Beijing, when it releases some Apollo technology for cars driving on urban streets and will announce its first manufacturing partners.  That could be a turning point when the technology focus will begin to shift from California to China, according to Simoudis.   The dependence on Silicon Valley talent may not be eliminated, but it will continue to diminish as the Chinese build their own capabilities,  he said.

The Outlook on DB London's Long-Term IDR is Negative. Fitch has also assigned DB London a Derivative Counterparty Rating of 'A(dcr)' and long-and short-term deposit ratings of 'A' and 'F1', respectively. The ratings of debt issued by DB London previously listed under Deutsche Bank AG will now be listed under DB London on Fitch's website. KEY RATING DRIVERS As a branch, DB London is a fully integrated part of Deutsche Bank AG and is not a separately incorporated legal entity. Its ratings mirror those of Deutsche Bank AG, given that there are no country risk constraints. DB London's Derivative Counterparty Rating and long-term deposit rating benefit from the same one-notch uplift above the IDR given to equivalent ratings at Deutsche Bank AG, as we believe that the insolvency hierarchy is most likely to follow the incorporation of the legal entity rather than where the branch is located. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT DB London's ratings are primarily sensitive to any changes to the equivalent ratings for Deutsche Bank AG. In addition, the ratings could be sensitive to any implications for the relationship between DB London and Deutsche Bank AG that could emerge from the UK's exit from the EU. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term IDR: assigned at 'A-'; Outlook Negative Short-Term IDR: assigned at 'F1'; Derivative Counterparty Rating: assigned at 'A(dcr)' Long-term deposit rating: assigned at 'A'; Short-term deposit rating: ' assigned at F1' Long-term senior non-preferred: assigned at 'A-' Long-term senior preferred: assigned at 'A' Short-term debt and CP: assigned at 'F1' Senior market-linked notes: assigned at 'Aemr' Subordinated market-linked notes: assigned at 'BBB+emr' Contact: Primary Analyst Bridget Gandy Managing Director +44 20 3530 1095 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Ioana Sima Associate Director +44 20 3530 1736 Committee Chairperson Gordon Scott Managing Director +44 20 3530 1075 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Denmark's gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent in the first quarter from the same quarter last year, up from a May reading of 2.2 percent, outpacing growth in the euro zone and in the United States. Economic growth in 2016 was also revised up to 1.7 percent from 1.3 percent, putting last year's growth almost in line with the two previous years. Businesses in the export-driven economy have seen an increase in orders, but about a quarter of companies surveyed by the Confederation of Danish Industry (DI) said they had lost sales or orders because they could not recruit enough employees.  This means focus should be on avoiding overheating the economy. That requires both a tight fiscal policy and reforms to extend the growth potential for the economy,  said chief economist Steen Bocian at The Confederation of Danish Enterprise (DE), another lobby group.  As reforms take time to implement, now is the time to react,  he said. More than every third company has unsuccessfully tried to recruit employees within the past year, the DI survey of 3,335 companies showed on Friday. Denmark's right-leaning government is seeking to entice people into work through pension reforms and tax cuts but it may prove difficult to persuade its powerful ally, the Danish People's Party (DF), to back its plans. The government holds only 53 seats in parliament and has to negotiate with other parties, most often the populist DF, to secure the 90 votes necessary to pass laws. The government said last month it expected growth this year to be around 1.7 percent, up from an earlier forecast of 1.5 percent, but said it wanted to implement reforms that could boost the rate to 2 percent per year. In November, a major revision of economic data painted a much brighter picture of Denmark's growth in recent years.

The CSRC’s decision comes more than 18 months after HSBC first announced the JV, which had prompted concerns the UK-headquartered bank may lose its advantage in the race to become the first to secure majority ownership of its onshore JV. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley agreed with its Chinese JV partner, Huaxin Securities, to raise its stake to 49% from 33.3% in a move widely interpreted as preempting plans from the Chinese regulators to allow foreign firms to take majority stakes in their securities JVs. UBS is also said to have entered talks with its partners to increase its stake to 49% from 25%. The CSCR's approval for HSBC is an important step for the bank, which has staked a lot of its growth plans on increasing revenue from the fast-growing Pearl River Delta region. HSBC owns 51% in the JV company, known as HSBC Qianhai Securities. Qianhai Financial Holdings owns the remaining 49% stake. The JV is located in Shenzhen’s Qianhai district. It is expected to start operations by the end of the year. HSBC tabled proposals to become the first foreign lender to establish a majority-owned securities JV in China in November 2015. In 2013, supplementary agreements to the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between China, Hong Kong and Macau had relaxed certain criteria for foreign firms operating in China’s domestic securities market. The CSRC followed up with guidance in August 2015, allowing foreign majority ownership in the securities sector for the first time, among other things. Since HSBC submitted its application for the JV, two other JV were granted approval under CEPA, according to research from consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. These were Huajing Securities, a JV between China Renaissance and two other mainland investors, and Shengang Securities, which is owned by 14 investors. In addition to allowing foreign banks to take up a majority stake in their JVs, the amendments to CEPA also allow for the JVs to carry out a wider range of services than other foreign rivals including providing A-share brokerage services. HSBC has been granted licences to provide a range of services including equity research and brokerage, equity and debt underwriting and cross-border M&A; advisory. The approval is also a boon for HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver, who has partly staked his reputation on growing the bank’s presence in the southern region of China. The bank previously announced that its investment in the Pearl River Delta would include hiring 4,000 staff. Bank of East Asia has also received approval from the CSRC for the establishment of its JV through CEPA, known as East Asia Qianhai Securities Company. BEA owns a 49% stake in the company, while Qianhai Financial Holdings and two other local corporate shareholders own the remainder. The JV will be incorporated in Qianhai with issued capital of Rmb1.5bn (US$221m) and has been granted securities brokerage, securities underwriting, asset management and proprietary trading licences.

Published in The Lancet Haematology journal, the research found that while the drug recombinant human erythropoietin - commonly known as EPO - improved high-intensity lab test scores, it barely affected endurance and road race performances, which were similar for cyclists given EPO and those given a placebo.  Doping, or the use of performance enhancing drugs, is a major problem in many competitive sports worldwide, and professional cycling has been plagued for decades by high-profile cases of cheating. Yet scientific evidence about what banned substances do or don't do is scarce, partly because it is impossible for scientists to conduct trials with professional cyclists, who are subject to anti-doping regulations.  For this study, researchers recruited 48 well-trained amateur male cyclists aged between 18 and 50 and, in a blinded trial, gave half of them weekly injections of EPO, and the other half placebo injections over a period of eight weeks.  The doses used were consistent with known practices in professional cycling, the researchers said. EPO promotes the production of red blood cells, and it is assumed it will lead to increased delivery of oxygen to the muscles and therefore improve performance.  The cyclists then underwent a series of tests to evaluate different types of performance parameters. The first was a high intensity ride in a laboratory involving a ramp test, where pedalling resistance was increased every five minutes until exhaustion. The second, similar to a time trial, was a 45-minute lab-based endurance test at the highest power output.  The third test, 12 days after the final injections, involved a 110-km (68-mile) ride followed by a 21.5-km road race up Mont Ventoux, which often features in the Tour de France.  We found that while (EPO) increased performance in a laboratory setting on high intensity tests, the differences largely disappeared in endurance tests, and were undetectable in a real-world cycling race,  said Jules Heuberger, who co-led the study at the Centre for Human Drug Research in the Netherlands.       He said the findings, which go against claims in some sports literature that EPO can have great effects, may reduce the incentive for athletes to consider blood doping.

The IPO, set to be Malaysia's biggest in five years, will likely be launched at 6.50 ringgit per share, raising 4.81 billion ringgit ($1.12 billion), the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the process is private. The offering was earlier expected to price in the 7.60-8 ringgit per share range, raising up to $1.4 billion. The IPO involves a planned sale of 740.4 million shares. Lotte Chemical Titan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One source said the IPO will be relaunched  to add more quality names to enhance the book.  Another source said concerns over the company's valuation also created some hurdles.  At 8 ringgit, the offering was seen as overvalued by the investment community,  the second source said. Earlier this month, Permodalan Nasional, Eastspring Investments, Great Eastern Life Assurance Malaysia, Maybank Asset Management and Maybank Islamic Asset Management had signed on as cornerstone investors for the IPO. The integrated petrochemical producer, which is targetting a July IPO on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange, is wholly owned by South Korea's Lotte Chemical Corp. The firm had originally planned the IPO for last year but held it off after South Korea began investigating its parent company Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Maybank, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan are joint global coordinators for the IPO. Bookrunners are Nomura, HSBC and CIMB. Lotte Chemical Titan is involved in the manufacturing and sales of petrochemical products. The IPO proceeds will be used to build a naphtha cracker in Indonesia and expand the cracker in Malaysia. Appetite for IPOs in Malaysia had shrunk on the back of a weak currency and volatile commodities markets, but the market saw a revival earlier this year with the listings of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd and Eco World International Bhd .

The White Sox right-hander came out for a 10 p.m. CDT first pitch and worked a season-high 6 1/3 innings in a 4-3 Chicago victory over the New York Yankees that concluded in the early hours of Friday.  It didn't really affect me too much,  Shields, who picked up his first victory since April 6, said of the delay.  I was ready to go. It wasn't the latest game I've ever started.  Shields (2-1) made his third start since returning from the disabled list on June 18. He allowed three runs (two earned) on five hits, walked three and struck out two.  I felt good for the most part,  he said.  I was a little inconsistent throughout the game, but I made pitches when I needed to. My outfield did a phenomenal job, the infield as well.  Chicago's bullpen worked 2 2/3 scoreless innings. Closer David Robertson allowed a single but worked a scoreless ninth, striking out slugger Aaron Judge to seal his 12th save. The victory gave Chicago (34-44) a split in the four-game series. The Yankees (42-35) fell one-game behind the first-place Boston Red Sox in the American League East. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at White SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchNew York starter right-hander Luis Cessa (0-3) gave up four runs (two earned) on five hits and three walks in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out one. For the Yankees, the loss was overshadowed by a season-ending injury to right fielder Dustin Fowler, called up from Triple-A earlier Thursday. Fowler was hurt with two outs in the bottom of the first. While chasing a liner down the first-base line, he hit his right knee on a low fence as the ball went foul. Fowler hopped away from the fence, and his leg gave out. He sustained an open rupture of his right patellar tendon and underwent surgery Thursday night at a local hospital.  I know what it takes to get here and how hard he worked,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  What's supposed to be an exciting day for him turns into a really bad day. I'm still in disbelief, I'm in tears for the kid. I know he'll fight to get back here.  Willy Garcia had two hits, including a tiebreaking two-run double in the fourth inning, and Jose Abreu added two hits for the White Sox. New York leadoff hitter Brett Gardner went 2-for-5. The Yankees scored an unearned run for a first-inning lead when Gardner reached on an infield single and Judge walked. Didi Gregorius grounded to first on a fielder's choice, and Gardner scored from second on a throwing error by White Sox first baseman Abreu. Chicago evened the score with a second-inning unearned run as Gary Sanchez, who reached on a fielder's choice, scored on Adam Engel's long fly to right with two outs that was misplayed by Rob Refsnyder, Fowler's replacement. White Sox catcher Omar Narvaez then singled home Engel for a 2-1 lead. New York third baseman Ronald Torreyes made it 2-2 in the fourth with a two-out single to left to score Jacoby Ellsbury from second. Torreyes was thrown out while trying to stretch the hit into a double. Garcia's two-out double to left drove in Sanchez and Engel for a 4-2 Chicago lead. White Sox left fielder Melky Cabrera robbed Judge of a homer in the fifth with a perfectly timed jump and catch at the fence. It would have been Judge's major-league-leading 28th long ball.  That ball was deep, with the power that he has you have to be deep in the outfield,  Cabrera said.  I jumped at the precise moment.  Cessa faced runners on first and second with one out in the fifth, but Gardner's diving catch for a second out prevented at least one run. Kevan Smith loaded the bases with a two-out infield single, and that spelled the end of Cessa's night. Left hander Chasen Shreve got Engel to pop out foul to end the threat. The Yankees climbed within 4-3 in the sixth thanks to Ellsbury's leadoff triple and Austin Romine's one-out fielder's choice grounder. NOTES: The Yankees announced a flurry of transactions prior to the game, calling up OF Dustin Fowler and 1B Chris Carter, moving INF Miguel Andujar to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, transferring 1B Greg Bird (right ankle bruise) to the 60-day disabled list and designating OF Mason Williams for assignment. ... Yankees RHP Michael Pineda (7-4, 4.12 ERA) is scheduled to pitch the series opener at AL West-leading Houston on Friday, facing Astros RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (7-1, 2.53 ERA). ... The White Sox remain home to open a three-game weekend series against Texas as they send RHP Mike Pelfrey (3-6, 3.73 ERA) against Rangers RHP Austin Bibens-Dirkx (3-0, 3.68 ERA). ... Chicago OF Avisail Garcia had an MRI on Thursday after sustaining a left knee injury late in Wednesday's 12-3 loss to the Yankees. Garcia said he hopes he is sidelined just a few days. ... The White Sox placed RHP Jake Petricka (right elbow strain) on the 10-day disabled list and called up RHP Juan Minaya from Triple-A Charlotte.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED6UCKJJ24"},

Published in The Lancet Haematology journal, the research found that while the drug recombinant human erythropoietin - commonly known as EPO - improved high-intensity lab test scores, it barely affected endurance and road race performances, which were similar for cyclists given EPO and those given a placebo.  Doping, or the use of performance enhancing drugs, is a major problem in many competitive sports worldwide, and professional cycling has been plagued for decades by high-profile cases of cheating. Yet scientific evidence about what banned substances do or don't do is scarce, partly because it is impossible for scientists to conduct trials with professional cyclists, who are subject to anti-doping regulations.  For this study, researchers recruited 48 well-trained amateur male cyclists aged between 18 and 50 and, in a blinded trial, gave half of them weekly injections of EPO, and the other half placebo injections over a period of eight weeks.  The doses used were consistent with known practices in professional cycling, the researchers said. EPO promotes the production of red blood cells, and it is assumed it will lead to increased delivery of oxygen to the muscles and therefore improve performance.  The cyclists then underwent a series of tests to evaluate different types of performance parameters. The first was a high intensity ride in a laboratory involving a ramp test, where pedalling resistance was increased every five minutes until exhaustion. The second, similar to a time trial, was a 45-minute lab-based endurance test at the highest power output.  The third test, 12 days after the final injections, involved a 110-km (68-mile) ride followed by a 21.5-km road race up Mont Ventoux, which often features in the Tour de France.  We found that while (EPO) increased performance in a laboratory setting on high intensity tests, the differences largely disappeared in endurance tests, and were undetectable in a real-world cycling race,  said Jules Heuberger, who co-led the study at the Centre for Human Drug Research in the Netherlands.       He said the findings, which go against claims in some sports literature that EPO can have great effects, may reduce the incentive for athletes to consider blood doping.

Recent regulatory changes mean fund boards will play an increasingly important role in the outcome for investors, and independent directors could help achieve better outcomes where there are potential conflicts between the interests of investors and the asset manager. The FCA's proposals, made as part of its wider review of the asset management sector, would require fund boards to appoint at least two independent directors and at least 25% of the total board membership to be independent. This would go beyond requirements in other major European jurisdictions for asset management. For example, the Irish Corporate Governance Code requires at least one independent director, while the ALFI code of conduct for Luxembourg investment funds recommends an independent director. Our recent analysis of 145 sub-funds found European UCITS funds had an average of 1.9 independent directors on each board, but almost a quarter had no independent directors at all. This trails far behind the US, where a minimum of 40% of directors must be independent, and in practice around 75% actually are independent. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/almost_a_quarter_of_sampled_funds_have_no_ independent_dire ctors?src=embed  title= Almost A Quarter of Sampled Funds Have No Independent Directors  width= 550  height= 666  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Fund boards are required to put the interests of investors above those of the asset manager and their responsibilities are growing. For example, under recently agreed European money market fund reforms, boards will play a key role in determining whether liquidity fees or redemption gates should be applied. Fund boards were also required to approve the decision by several UK commercial real estate funds to prevent or limit redemptions in the wake of the Brexit vote. These decisions involve balancing the needs of exiting and remaining investors. Having more independent directors should reduce the risk that the asset manager's interests, for example the desire to maintain assets under management, also become a factor in the decision. The FCA's proposals also include measures to increase transparency on fees and charges for retail and institutional investors, and further strengthen the rules around benchmarking and past performance disclosure. These measures are likely to increase the pressure on investment manager margins, and increase the flow of money from actively to passively managed funds and to alternative asset classes, where margins remain wider. But margins are strong (EBITDA margins averaged 40% in 2016 in our recent peer review of traditional investment managers) and flexible cost structures should help offset some of the pressure. Cash flow leverage across the sector is also modest and firms generally maintain cushions against the benchmark thresholds for their ratings. Therefore we do not expect leverage growth to affect ratings in the near term, although continued performance turbulence may result in a further increase in cash leverage metrics.

The Bank of Japan views with regret the fact that the remarks of one of its Board Members have become a source of misunderstanding, and will see to it that such incident will not repeat itself,  the central bank told Reuters on Friday. Harada, a member of the bank's nine-member board, told the seminar Western policymakers helped bring Hitler to power by being slow to apply John Maynard Keynes' proposals to fight the Great Depression. Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Harada said he had only been trying to express the importance of conducting appropriate economic policies at an early stage.  I had no intention at all to justify Hitler's economic policies,  the bank quoted Harada as saying.  Indeed, I have clearly pointed out in my remarks that tragedy did result from the policy steps Hitler had taken. That being said, I want to offer my sincere apologies for any misunderstanding my choice of words may have caused,  he said. Public figures in Japan, which was part of the World War Two Axis powers with Germany and Italy, have sometimes caused controversy with favorable comments about some aspects of the Nazi regime. At the same time, however, Holocaust-denial and neo-Nazi movements are essentially unknown in Japan. Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso drew criticism from a U.S.-based Jewish rights group over comments he made in 2013, but were later retracted, that were interpreted as praise for Germany's Nazi regime and Hitler's rise to power.

Since iQOS was launched in the UK in December, Philip Morris has found that about 70 percent of users are able to give up cigarettes, Peter Nixon, its UK and Ireland managing director, told BBC Radio. That compares with only about 15-20 percent of people who use e-cigarettes, he said.  It's unprecedented,  Nixon told the Today show.  We're very encouraged that products like iQOS are the absolute game changer.  Whereas e-cigarettes use nicotine-laced liquid, IQOS heats tobacco sticks, called Heets, to a high enough temperature to create a vapour but not smoke. Philip Morris, which has Marlboro cigarettes among its global brands, has applied to U.S. health regulators to have iQOS recognised as having  modified risk  compared with cigarettes. British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco are also selling tobacco-based  vaping  devices, but so far Philip Morris is in the lead. The company sells about 7 billion Heets a year, which is tiny compared with the 820 billion conventional cigarettes it sells. But Nixon told the BBC that the company hopes to produce 100 billion Heets next year, a huge jump from the less than 400 million it made in 2015.  We're absolutely serious. One day we want to stop selling cigarettes,  Nixon said on the programme.  We're moving very fast.  There are still 7.5 million smokers in Britain, Nixon said, and Philip Morris has hired  freelancers  to help to bring that number down. These freelancers act like quitting coaches and can earn 50 pounds ($64.95) from Philip Morris for every person they convert from cigarettes to iQOS.

The financial hub was shaken on Tuesday, after a rout mainly in small-cap Hong Kong stocks wiped HK$24 billion ($3.08 billion) off the market. The precise cause of the sudden sell-off remains unclear. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said the stocks were all characterized by small public floats, concentrated shareholdings, thin turnover and cross-shareholdings that encourage volatility. The sell-off has raised questions over Hong Kong's ability to enforce its rules, as the territory's relationship with China - whose companies dominate the Hong Kong market but remain beyond its legal reach - comes under the spotlight.       The fundamental challenge you have, if you are sitting in Hong Kong, is managing accountability,  said Keith Pogson, EY financial services lead based in Hong Kong.   The company may have a chairman and board who are mainlanders and it's possible for them to run off to the mainland rather than stand here and be held accountable to global investors. For the Hong Kong exchange and the SFC, this remains a massive challenge.  Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula that allows Hong Kong to operate a separate, autonomous judicial system. Since the handover, Chinese company listings have helped boost the Hong Kong stock exchange nine-fold, transforming the small territory of just 7.3 million people into a $3.7 trillion global market. Around 60 percent of companies listed in Hong Kong originate from the mainland. Sloppier Standards Hong Kong scores relatively well for corporate governance compared with the rest of Asia, coming second out of 11 markets ranked by the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA) on their rules, culture, enforcement, audit regime, and political environment.   But the dominance of Chinese firms means investors in the territory's stocks are exposed to much sloppier standards on the mainland, which the ACGA ranked ninth. China's overall scores have fallen since 2014 due to increased state interventions and it scores very low on general corporate governance culture. Chinese companies listing in Hong Kong must comply with its rules and disclosure requirements, but the mainland's weak corporate governance culture still seeps across the border.  Of 15 main board companies whose shares were halted from trading by the SFC due to accounting irregularities or investigations since 2011, 13 are mainland Chinese, according to a Reuters analysis. They include two of the biggest scandals, China Huishan Dairy (6863.HK) and Hanergy Thin Film (0566.HK). Other scandals involving companies that were de-listed, such as China Metal Recycling and Hontex International, were also mainland Chinese. Punishing such companies with deterrent force can be tough, according to legal experts and regulatory sources. The company's main assets, audit working papers, and management typically reside on the mainland and can only be accessed with cooperation from the Chinese authorities. In theory, Chinese courts should recognize rulings from Hong Kong courts on issues such as liquidations, but liquidators say it is difficult in practice to make them stick. Enforcing China Metal Recycling's liquidation order on the mainland has been a battle, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.   Once a Chinese company is listed, the enforcement environment is working against the Hong Kong regulators. Other than throwing them off the exchange, or hoping the management will come to the table in Hong Kong, it can be very difficult,  said Pogson, a member of the stock exchange's listing committee but who was speaking in a personal capacity. Greater Integration Hong Kong and Chinese markets are only growing more integrated, with the launch of projects to connect their stock and bond markets. The Hong Kong exchange has wants to lure Chinese companies to a new board that would allow  pre-profit  companies or start-ups to list. Regulatory sources said much closer cooperation between the SFC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) over the past two years had seen some successes. They include a landmark ruling this month forcing the former chairman and CEO of China's Greencool Technology to disgorge gains derived from overstating the company's profits. In April, SFC CEO Ashley Alder said in a speech that the SFC and CSRC were  especially focused on the opportunities but also the risks associated with far greater cross-boundary market connectivity . The regulatory sources said it was in the interests of the SFC and the CSRC to cooperate to protect Hong Kong.  In the case of Hong Kong we do depend on cooperation by the mainland regulators and their court system,  said David Webb, Hong Kong's leading investor activist who also called this week's small-cap rout.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and it doesn't mean we can't win.

Yutaka Harada, a member of the board of the Bank of Japan, told a seminar on Thursday Hitler's economic policies had been  appropriate  and  wonderful  but had enabled the Nazi dictator to do  horrible  things to the world.  The Bank of Japan views with regret the fact that the remarks of one of its Board Members have become a source of misunderstanding, and will see to it that such incident will not repeat itself,  the central bank told Reuters on Friday. Harada, a member of the bank's nine-member board, told the seminar Western policymakers helped bring Hitler to power by being slow to apply John Maynard Keynes' proposals to fight the Great Depression. Hitler became German chancellor in 1933. Harada said he had only been trying to express the importance of conducting appropriate economic policies at an early stage.  I had no intention at all to justify Hitler's economic policies,  the bank quoted Harada as saying.  Indeed, I have clearly pointed out in my remarks that tragedy did result from the policy steps Hitler had taken. That being said, I want to offer my sincere apologies for any misunderstanding my choice of words may have caused,  he said. Public figures in Japan, which was part of the World War Two Axis powers with Germany and Italy, have sometimes caused controversy with favorable comments about some aspects of the Nazi regime. At the same time, however, Holocaust-denial and neo-Nazi movements are essentially unknown in Japan. Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso drew criticism from a U.S.-based Jewish rights group over comments he made in 2013, but were later retracted, that were interpreted as praise for Germany's Nazi regime and Hitler's rise to power.

The government has tightened controls in recent years on new local government debt to help ward off risks following a borrowing binge since the global financial crisis.  Local government debt risks have been falling in recent years, but we cannot deny that there are illegal debt raising problems in some regions,  Wang Kebing, deputy director general of Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance, told reporters. Since 2015, the ministry has tightened rules on local debt, banning local governments from providing guarantees for debt issued by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), he said. Local governments can only issue bonds within the annual quota set by the parliament, he said. China capped the size of outstanding local government debt at 18.8 trillion yuan ($2.72 trillion) in 2017, up from 17.2 trillion in 2016, according to the annual budget. In 2015, local governments were allowed to swap 3.2 trillion yuan in higher-cost, maturing debt into lower-cost, longer term bonds, in a step to help ease their debt burdens. A total of 8.1 trillion yuan in local government debt was swapped in 2015 and 2016, and a further 4.7 trillion yuan will be refinanced, Wang said, adding that no cap on such debt swaps has been set this year. In May, Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years saying it expected the financial strength of the economy to erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. Some local governments are delaying debt issuance due to rising interest rates, but slow local government bond issuance will not affect local economic growth, Wang said. China's overall debt risks remained under control as the economy maintained steady momentum, Wei Qiang, spokesman for the National Audit Office, told reporters. A recent audit of selected cities and counties in 16 provinces showed their outstanding debt grew 87 percent from June 2013 to March this year, he said.

U.S. private equity partners Apollo Global Management and Xcoal Energy & Resources ended their joint pursuit of the 8-million-tonnes-per-year coking coal mine four weeks ago after failing to reach a deal on price, the sources said. Having expressed an interest in exiting the mining business, Wesfarmers hired UBS to explore a sale of Curragh and its 40 percent stake in the Bengalla thermal coal mine, following a coal price surge at the end of last year, the sources said. Wesfarmers had told Reuters on April 27 that a  reduced number  of proposals were being assessed and the company was prepared to keep the mines if it was unable to get its price.  This was a tough one from the start,  said one of the sources, who is part of a private equity group active in Australian mining acquisitions that did not bid for the mines.  Wesfarmers was always going to be holding out for its price and was only a seller if it made a lot of sense.  Wesfarmers, more known for its supermarket, hardware and retailing businesses, declined to comment. Apollo and Xcoal Energy & Resources were not immediately available to comment. The pair were bidding only for the Curragh mine and their offer was lower than $500 million, according to the sources. Wesfarmers wanted a total of roughly $1.5 billion for the two mines, the sources said. Apollo and Pennsylvania coal exporter Xcoal, founded by Ernie Thrasher, a billionaire entrepreneur often dubbed the King of Coal, turned their attention to Curragh after Anglo American pulled two coking coal mines off the market, rethinking its plans to exit the coal sector. The Curragh mine was running at a rolling production rate of 8.3 million tonnes of coking coal and 3.6 million tonnes of thermal coal, according to Wesfarmers' last quarterly production report. The Bengalla mine was yielding 3.3 million tonnes of thermal coal annually, it said.

Exchange company Travelex said on Thursday it has resumed purchasing the Qatari riyal globally after a brief suspension  due to business challenges . Economic sanctions and poor liquidity have created chaos in the foreign exchange market for Qatari riyals, with the currency trading far below its peg to the U.S. dollar. The riyal has been increasingly volatile in the spot market since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism. The Bank of England and British lenders including Barclays , HSBC, and Royal Bank of Scotland were not immediately available for comment.

At a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House this week, Trump said the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including new major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. The effort is part of Trump's policy of seeking to assert power abroad through a boost in natural gas, coal and petroleum exports. He said on Thursday that the  golden era  of the U.S. energy business was now underway.  But any new LNG agreements with India will depend on how GAIL (GAIL.NS) and Cheniere (LNG.A) of the United States deal with a long-term supply contract signed in 2011 for an estimated $22 billion. India's GAIL has deals to buy 5.8 million tonnes of U.S. LNG per annum for 20 years, mostly with Cheniere, but is now asking to re-negotiate the price. A commissioning cargo was sent last year, but supplies in earnest will only likely start in 2018. Two sources at state-run GAIL said they were trying to re-negotiate the contract.  At current U.S. prices, the landed cost of the LNG (in India) is not very attractive,  said one of the sources on condition of anonymity, as he was not cleared to speak to media. Neither source gave any details on what price GAIL was seeking.  We are trying a mix of options on pricing, and re-negotiating is one of them,  the source said.  My perception is that the talks with Cheniere in this regard are not very likely to succeed.  Officially, GAIL has declined comment on the row. Cheniere, currently the only U.S. company exporting LNG, said it was not open to a lower price.  Our customers expect us to deliver on our commitments, and we expect the same. This is a signed long-term contract that we believe will provide long-term value and we expect the contract to be adhered to,  said Eben Burnham-Snyder, a spokesman at Cheniere.  The contract price is calculated on a formula based on U.S. spot prices for natural gas, and currently costs India $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).  Traders said that Cheniere would struggle to send cargoes at a lower price. Gail Under Pressure Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS, which exclude all extra costs like shipping, have fallen by more than 40 percent this year to $5.40 per mmBtu amid ballooning oversupply as production from Australia and the United States rises. R.K. Garg, head of finance at Petronet LNG (PLNG.NS), India's biggest gas importer, told Reuters that at current oil prices, long-term gas contracts were being offered at $6-7 per mmBtu. Mangesh Patankar, head of business development at energy consultancy Galway Group, said that GAIL was trying for lower prices because the company was struggling to sell contracted U.S. LNG on to end-users in India, who are demanding cheaper gas from GAIL themselves.     A lot of the (LNG) buyers are doing that right now. With the ramp up in Australia and U.S. volumes, and demand being not that active in the end-user market, a lot of the buyers have had to do that,  he said. Other LNG buyers, including top importer Japan, are also pressing for better terms.  Washington has been using LNG as a diplomatic and political tool. Although sales are a commercial matter, Washington has been laying foundations for contracts with key buyers, including China.  Trump has made LNG exports a central part of his trade policy, aimed at reviving industry and creating jobs. Asian markets account for about 70 percent of global LNG shipments, and India is one of the fastest-growing importers. Trump will be visiting Poland next week and plans to promote U.S. LNG exports at a meeting in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe.

Crude prices slipped to the lowest in almost a year last week as concern grew about the persistence of a three-year old surplus of oil inventories.  Rig counts in the (U.S.) shale basins, the metric most widely observed to gauge drilling activity and investments, have more than doubled from last year's lows,  said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.    There is a time lag of up to six months between drilling and production and thus, the market has yet to experience the supply surge originating from the past months' rig count increases. Growth in U.S. oil production should keep prices below $50 per barrel,  Norbert added.         The survey of 36 economists and analysts predicted Brent crude LCOc1 would average $53.96 per barrel in 2017, down from the $55.57 per barrel forecast in the previous poll, continuing the trend of gradually lower forecasts each month this year.          U.S. light crude CLc1 was expected to average $51.92 a barrel this year, dipping from last month's forecast of $53.52. Analysts have cut their forecasts for 2017 every month since February this year. Forecasts for prices in 2018 were also lowered.  Rising U.S. production will delay the market rebalancing until the end of the year, but the OPEC production cuts should be enough to bring stocks back to their five-year average, even with an increase in U.S. output,  said Capital Economics analyst Thomas Pugh. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 19 cents at $44.93 a barrel on Thursday after hitting a two-week high of $45.45 in late-morning trading. In the week to June 23, U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a record 23rd week in a row, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015, according to Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this month boosted its forecast for U.S. crude oil production next year, saying it now expects output to top 10 million barrels per day, on track to reach its highest on record. Last month, OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers agreed to extend an existing supply curb of about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018.      The nine-month extension should be enough to bring the market more into balance, provided that the rate of U.S. production growth does begin to slow in early 2018 and compliance by both OPEC and non-OPEC participants remains strong,  said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.  However, this will only be enough to scratch the surface of ample global stocks. As a result, we expect the production-cut agreement to be tapered off slowly in the second half of 2018, as an abrupt return to previous OPEC production levels would flood the market once again, driving down prices.  Rising production in Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members that have been excluded from the supply deal, as well as the diplomatic tensions between Qatar and some of its neighbours including Saudi Arabia were among other factors that could determine the medium-term course of the oil price, analysts said.

The Bologna-based company said on Friday it would shift 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bad loans to a special vehicle to bolster Unipol Banca and get its banking unit ready to take part in the expected consolidation of Italy's banking system. At the same time, it will sell two insurance holdings to UnipolSai for 875 million euros to put all its insurance business in the hands of its main operating subsidiary. UnipolSai said the acquisitions would shave about 17 percentage points off its Solvency II ratio - a key industry measure - at the end of 2017. The move sent UnipolSai shares lower, but supported those of the holding conglomerate.  UnipolSai shareholders appear to be the marginal losers of the deal due to the high price paid for the two insurance assets and potentially the need to contribute to the investment in bank non-performing loans,  said Exane BNP Paribas analysts. Unipol, which said gains from the insurance disposals would offset the 780 million euros it expects to lose from the restructuring, will mark down its bank bad loans to 20 percent of their nominal value. The group's CEO, Carlo Cimbri, told a conference call the low market value was due to an excess of supply as lenders were under regulatory pressure to cut bad debts.  Our intention is to work on the portfolio with a dedicated structure to maximise recoveries,  he said. Italian banks are saddled with a mountain of bad debts that were accumulated during a harsh recession. Unipol's move comes days after Brussels gave the green light for Italy to inject up to 17 billion euros into two failing regional banks in the Veneto region, Rome is also scrambling to secure European approval to give state support for its third-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi . Cimbri, who said the reorganisation would have no impact on the group's dividend policy, ruled out any merger of Unipol and its insurance subsidiary for the time being. But analysts are convinced a merger is just a question of time.  Overall this gets the group much closer to a position where it can merge the two entities down the road and therefore unlock the holding discount,  Exane said. As part of the shakeup, UnipolSai also said it was ending its bancassurance joint venture with Banco BPM in a move that had been widely expected. Unipol has been building a stake in BPER, a regional lender headquartered close to the insurer. Cimbri dismissed as  groundless  press speculation that it could further raise the BPER stake. At 0931 GMT, UnipolSai shares were down 3.6 percent while the European insurance sector was up 0.4 percent. Shares in Unipol were up 2 percent. $1 = 0.8752 euros Reporting by Stephen Jewkes and Andrea Mandala; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/unipol-restructuring-idUSL8N1JR0SY"},

As Chicago struggles with a police suicide rate much higher than the national average and moves to shore up morale in a department investigated for its use of excessive force, it may not be helping its officers in the most effective way, mental health experts as well as current and former officers said.  Record keeping is important in order to provide quality services,  said Edrick Dorian, a Los Angeles-based police psychologist and author of a book on the subject.   To not keep records is to rely solely on memory and psychologists know that memory is faulty.   Like many who work in law enforcement nationwide, officers in Chicago do not want to seem weak and some worry about how seeking help might impact their careers, experts and current and former officers said.  The criticism of Chicago's policy highlights the delicate balance U.S. police departments must strike between providing adequate care and assuaging these fears.   Chicago's in-house counselors said more officers come forward for treatment because of their no-notes approach.  However, legal experts and mental health professionals said Chicago's approach was highly unusual and could jeopardize clinicians' ability to accurately monitor officers' mental health. The American Psychological Association, the largest U.S. psychology organization, says psychologists have a  professional and ethical responsibility to develop and maintain records.      The issue of mental health is particularly acute in Chicago where the department's suicide rate is 60 percent higher than the national average, according to a U.S. Department of Justice report published in January citing figures from the police union. The union does not dispute these figures, a spokesman said. [nL3N1HD3TX]  The city has also been thrust into the debate over the excessive use of force by officers against minority communities after several high-profile police shootings. [nL1N1BB1SE] 'Overwhelmed and Anxious'     Many of the 12,500 sworn officers in the city of 2.7 million are routinely exposed to violence. Last year, there were over 760 murders and more than 4,300 shooting victims in Chicago.   I guarantee you that right now, unfortunately, there is somebody sitting in a beat car, overwhelmed and anxious and through the roof with anxiety that doesn't know where to turn,  said Brian Warner, a former Chicago cop who runs a support group for others who have experienced trauma on the job.  The greatest thing about an in-house (program) is again, that there are no notes or no records,  said Robert Sobo, a psychologist and the director of professional counseling services at the Chicago Police Department, which launched in the mid-1990s.  It allows trust to be built between police and counselors, and officers who use the department's services are  actually safer  than those who seek help from an outside doctor because of the policy, Sobo told Reuters in an interview.  The program, which has three clinicians and is also available to the relatives of Chicago police officers, meets federal guidelines, the department said. But not keeping notes or records is  unusual,  according to Jeni McCutcheon, a veteran psychologist who has worked with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. She said it would make tracking a patient's progress, or decline, difficult. Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department and Miami-Dade Police Department, both of which have in-house counseling services similar to Chicago, said their counselors keep records. The New York Police Department declined to comment.  Scott Allen, a senior staff psychologist for Miami-Dade police, acknowledged that while a no-notes policy would increase officers' use of the program,  you can't ethically do that.

The Singapore government earlier this month described the terror threat as the highest in recent years.  The emergence of militants loyal to Islamic State in the Philippines, where security forces have been battling since late May to recapture Marawi City, showed the extent of the danger to Southeast Asia, Ng said.  It's endemic in our backyard, and the incident in Marawi is but another symptom to tell us that,  Ng told reporters, adding Singapore was prepared to deploy ships if asked to help patrol near the area.  Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have stepped up coordinated patrols in the Sulu Sea, separating the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, where Marawi is located, from Malaysian and Indonesian territory on Borneo island. Ng said it is premature to decide what kind of assistance - aircraft, ships, refueling facilities or medical staff - could be provided, but said it was in Singapore's interests to be involved. Ng's remarks were made earlier this week but had been embargoed until Friday to mark 50th anniversary of National Service.  An autonomous Unmanned Surface Vessel is seen during trials in Singapore, in this undated 2015 handout photo from Singapore's Ministry of Defence.  Singapore Ministry of Defence/Handout via REUTERSIn Singapore all males over the age of 18 are required to do two years national service, which involves basic military training for several months before being assigned to either the armed forces, civil defense force or the police force.  With a population of just 5.5 million, Singapore is dwarfed by its mostly Muslim neighbors, and all the countries of the region, including Singapore - which has a sizable Muslim minority of its own - are on guard against radicalisation that could draw people towards militant groups, like Islamic State. From July, Singapore plans to train 18,000 servicemen annually for homeland security operations. But its armed forces are expected to sink by one-third by 2030, due to the country's low birth rate. Ng said that the armed forces plan to increase the use of automation and technology to make up for the reduced manpower. Singapore's navy, for example, will have two fully autonomous unmanned surface vehicles in operation by 2020. It is already using artificial intelligence to monitor nearly a thousand vessels passing through Singapore waters daily in order to detect possible threats, according to the defense ministry.  Singapore has a defense partnership with the United States, which allows wider use of the city state's facilities by the U.S. military. It also has defense ties with Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.

FROB said it had cut its valuation of both lenders by 1.39 billion euros, with BMN accounting for more two-thirds of that.

That was below market expectations of between 0.45 to 0.6 times book value, according to Deutsche Bank and UBS analysts. As a result of the FROB's latest valuation, the state's 65 percent in BMN is worth around 536 million euros compared to the 1.6 billion euros originally injected, a potential 1 billion euro loss on its investment.

Swire, which started trading tea and silk in Shanghai more than 150 years ago, chose China. More than 80 percent of its staff are now in China, Hong Kong or Macau, along with its core businesses, from airlines to property, bakeries and Coca Cola bottling plants - even if Swire House is still in Westminster and the Hong Kong office overlooking Victoria Harbour owes more to British club chintz than new China.  If you look back at what was being said before the handover, most of the worst cases that people were fearing did not happen,  said John Slosar, chairman of Swire Pacific Ltd and Hong Kong veteran of almost four decades.  Hong Kong became the biggest (initial public offering) market in the world - bigger than New York and bigger than London. No one thought that would be the case, or that that would be the result of reunification with China - but it was.  It hasn't all been plain sailing: Swire Pacific reported an almost 70 percent drop in underlying profit in 2016, dented by its best-known brand Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, battered in turn by aggressive Chinese rivals. Swire has grown since 1997 - revenue and assets almost tripling from 1997 to 2016 - but by some measures other firms such as CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd have grown faster. Choosing China was not obvious, two or three decades ago. Swire's rival Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd moved its domicile to Bermuda in the 1980s and then angered Beijing again in the sensitive pre-handover years by shifting its primary stock exchange listing to London, and its Asian listing to Singapore. It later restored ties. Swire, on the other hand, tied its fate to the mainland. Most emblematically, it struck the ultimate Hong Kong-mainland venture - a cross shareholding deal with Air China Ltd . The Chinese flag carrier owns 29.99 percent of Cathay Pacific, which in turn holds roughly 18 percent of Air China. Swire also owns Dragonair, bought to access China's tightly regulated skies. Dragonair, now Cathay Dragon, became a wholly owned unit in 2006. Slosar, who is also Cathay Pacific's chairman and a former chief executive of the airline, said he visits Air China on most trips to Beijing.  As markets change, will we change how we work together and what we get out of it? Sure, probably,  he said of ties with Air China.  But it's a good relationship.  Certainly, it has been lucrative: Air China reported almost $1 billion in profit in 2016 - albeit almost flat on the year prior. Cathay, by contrast, posted its first annual loss since 2008 and only its third since the company was founded. Cathay is in the throes of a three-year turnaround plan, and last month announced it would cut 600 jobs, among management and head office staff. Pilots and crew, much tougher for Cathay to cut, have so far emerged unscathed.  We are trying to make ourselves more efficient, but we are still trying to grow the airline,  Slosar said.  You can never say never, but that (reducing pilot and crew headcount) hasn't been the focus of attention.  Taikoo Life In the 1970s, British trading houses dominated Hong Kong's business life, and their presence is still keenly felt. You can fly in on Cathay, stay at Jardine Matheson's Mandarin Oriental hotel, shop at CK Hutchison's Watson pharmacy chain and then have dim sum for lunch at Maxim's restaurant - again part of the Jardine empire. Some things have changed: The group, which argues it was always less colonial than it was perceived to be, is hiring more Mandarin and Cantonese speakers, Slosar said. Other things have not. For Swire - whose Chinese name is Taikoo, meaning great and ancient - property has long been and still is a mainstay, even if Hong Kong retail has suffered as spending by mainland tourists dipped, forcing a rethink of its malls to add in better cinemas or more restaurants. Swire has been less active in residential property, where Slosar said sky-high prices meant the group that helped transform entire blocks of Hong Kong was working through its existing portfolio, rather than investing in fresh plots.  It is hard to imagine how it works with some of the land prices being paid,  Slosar said. There are risks ahead, including China's leadership reshuffle during the upcoming 19th Communist Party Congress, and potential changes as China navigates uncharted economic waters. A peaceful transfer of power  seems very easy until you don't have it , Slosar said. But as befits a 'taipan', as trading house bosses were once known, he is also optimistic on the growth of an economy set to once again become the world's largest.

This is reflected in the updated forecasts for Russia in our most recent Global Economic Outlook, published on 19 June 2017. Recent data points to both consumption and investment rising in Russia in 2Q17, and we now forecast GDP growth of 1.6% this year, up from 1.4% when we affirmed Russia's 'BBB-'/Stable sovereign rating in March. An easier monetary stance, the rise in oil prices from their early-2016 lows, and greater confidence and policy certainty mean we see growth accelerating to 2.2% in 2018 (unchanged from March). Our 2019 forecast, published for the first time in our June Global Economic Outlook, is 2.0%. The CBR cut its key rate 25bp to 9% earlier this month - the third cut this year. High real rates have underpinned a fall in inflation to close to the 4% target this year, helped by rouble appreciation and lower food prices. The CBR said it  sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017  while maintaining a  moderately tight monetary policy  to keep inflation close to target and continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations. We now forecast year-end inflation at 4.5% in 2017-2019 (down from our previous forecasts of 5.5% in 2017 and 5.0% in 2018). We expect the CBR to continue lowering the policy rate, which we forecast to reach 7.0% at end-2019. The implementation of inflation targeting alongside exchange rate flexibility was one element in the Russian authorities' strong policy response to the oil price shock. While it has created space for monetary easing that supports the recovery, Russian real GDP growth will be around 1pp lower than the 'BBB' category median over our forecast period. The CBR said that growth is getting closer to potential, and while the authorities have developed a package of reforms to increase growth potential, we do not think these will be implemented before next year's presidential election. Russia's weaker growth potential relative to its rating category peers is a sovereign rating weakness. The bounce-back in demand growth in larger emerging markets like Russia is one reason for the strengthening recovery in global growth, which we forecast to rise to 2.9% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018 - an eight-year high.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Kyrgios is yet to win a title this year, losing out to Roger Federer in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells and the semi-finals at the Miami Open. He also failed to make an impact at the Madrid Open and French Open. The Australian has struggled with a recurring hip injury that forced him out of the Italian Open in May and the Queen's Club Championships earlier this month.  The world number 20 is, however, hopeful of winning his first ever grand slam event.  I honestly do think I can win it. Might need a bit of luck – and everything to fall into place – but I do believe I can win,  Kyrgios told reporters.  Some would say I'm probably not in the best shape this year... but I feel like if I'm serving well and I'm playing the right style of tennis, the sky's the limit at Wimbledon.  Kyrgios is set to play his final exhibition match on Friday and is the 20th-seed at the Wimbledon.

The stand-off on a plateau next to the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim, which borders China, has ratcheted up tension between the two neighboring giants, who share a 3,500 km (2175 miles) frontier, parts of which are disputed.  According to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into China's Donglang region early in June and obstructed work on a road on a plateau.  Troops from the two sides then confronted each other close to a strategic valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan and gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a thin strip of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions. Bhutan said on Thursday that the road was being built inside its territory. Indian media have reported that the dispute began when China removed an old Indian bunker.   India is deeply concerned at the recent Chinese actions and has conveyed to the Chinese Government that such construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India,  India's ministry of external affairs said in a statement.  It is essential that all parties concerned display utmost restraint and abide by their respective bilateral understandings not to change the status quo unilaterally,  the ministry said.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the road work was going on in an area that was on the Chinese not Bhutanese side. China and Bhutan have yet to reach a final agreement on demarking their border.

Romanian markets plunged on Thursday after the ruling Social Democrats announced an unexpected tax overhaul, which was not discussed with business figures beforehand, and the new finance minister said they were planning to dismantle a multi-billion private pension scheme.      Hungary and Poland had taken similar steps that had upset investors and weighed on local markets for years. The private pension system in Romania was introduced in 2008 to supplement ailing state pensions.     New Romanian Prime Minister Mihai Tudose and ruling Social Democrat Party leader Liviu Dragnea later denied such a plan to liquidate pension funds exists.     On Friday the leu was 0.1 percent firmer at 0849 GMT, while the Bucharest stock market index was 0.4 percent higher, after plunging almost 4 percent the day before.     However, investors were still wary of the unpredictable policies of the ruling Social Democrats and the fiscal impacts of the tax changes planned for 2018.     The Coalition for Romania's Development, which groups major investors' associations, said the mixed messages of decision makers over the private pension funds  has the consequence of raising distrust over the way these measures were grounded.      Romania's economy grew at the fastest rate in central Europe in the first quarter, but political turmoil and policy uncertainty have weighed on its markets in the past weeks.      The Czech crown was also a bit firmer on Friday, trading just around levels it touched on Thursday when the central bank signalled it may be heading towards its first interest rate hike in almost a decade in the third quarter.          The crown's path is still a big uncertainty.      Any significant firming trend would lessen the need for a rate hike, although the closing of positions in the crown - built up before the exit from the FX cap earlier this year - could weaken the currency.     Governor Jiri Rusnok said the crown exchange rate remained a significant source of uncertainty, after the central bank freed it in April from a currency cap that kept it weak.      Comments by Czech Central Bank governor Rusnok and the accompanying assumption of a key rate hike already in Q3 2017 gave the koruna additional short-term support,  Raiffeisen said in a note.      Still, we would not expect too much short-term stimulus for CZK on the news as additional strength could quickly be used by investors to reduce positions acquired during the FX regime.      The Czech central bank is getting hawkish in the region, unlike its peers in Poland and Hungary where monetary policy is expected to remain loose this year and next.       Poland's central bank is likely to keep interest rates at record lows until the end of next year because inflation is expected to stabilise, its governor said earlier this month. Poland will decide on rates next week.

The advent of organised retail and e-commerce began modernising warehouses in India a decade ago, but most firms still rely on musty, dilapidated  godowns , as storehouses are known colloquially. The unified tax system is expected to bring change on a far grander scale, removing distortions created by differential taxes and duty structures imposed across India's 29 states and 7 union territories.  When we moved from one state to the other, it felt like moving from one country to another,  said Ramesh Agarwal, chairman of New Delhi-based Agarwal Packers and Movers. From July 1, the new Goods and Services Tax, or GST, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, will  change all that, with the biggest tax reform seen since India won independence from British colonial rule 70 years ago. Companies that have previously based storage models on tax efficiency can move to the much more cost efficient, demand-based hub-and-spoke model used globally.  Anticipating the change, Agarwal's firm, for example, has carved India into five regions and is setting up one massive warehouse in each.       There's no tax arbitrage to be gained. So decisions on manufacturing, warehousing and selling will be purely driven by the real costs of manufacturing and going to market, that is the single biggest advantage of GST,  said R Subramanian, Managing Director at DHL Express in Mumbai. Subramanian still anticipates bureaucratic headaches, notably from GST's e-way bill system, requiring vehicle details from pickup to delivery, which he reckons would generate 90 million entries daily for the express delivery sector alone. But, the reform, along with the gradual shift in India’s service dominated economy toward more manufacturing, has paved the way for ultra-modern storage sites with automated conveyers, RFID-enabled tracking and IT-enabled warehousing management systems.    The potential growth, and investment needed for modernisation has spurred a slew of deals between Indian firms and major global private equity players and pension funds. In the last two years alone, as Modi made GST a priority, these investors have put $1.5 billion in the warehousing business.   GST is not only a tax reform, it is also a business reform as a whole, and a lot of businesses are now restructuring their supply chains,  said Rohit Jain, a partner with Economic Laws Practice in Mumbai.

Singapore-based urban and real estate developer Ascendas-Singbridge has just signed a $600 million deal with Firstspace Realty, based in the south Indian city of Bengaluru, to create 14 million square feet (1.3 million square meters) of industrial warehousing space across six major Indian cities.  Manufacturing, modern retail and the pharma sector were already driving change in Indian warehousing. GST has just fast-tracked the growth rate in logistics,  said Aloke Bhuniya, Chief Executive of Ascendas-Firstspace. He reckoned that GST has boosted the industry's annual growth rate from 12-15 percent to 20-22 percent, and saw plenty of room for a lot more modernisation. Out of the logistics industry's 980 million square feet (91 million square meters) of captive, agri-based and cold storage warehousing, Bhuniya estimated 85 percent were old godowns and traditional structures.  This represents a huge opportunity for modern warehousing to tap into,  he said.

Sibanye said 160 million rand ($12.24 million) in revenue had been lost at the Cooke operations after workers downed tools more than three weeks ago over resentment at the company's crackdown against illegal miners, which has included the arrest of employees for collusion and a ban on taking food underground. Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines. Sibanye has vowed to clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.  The additional losses incurred, due to this strike, further impact on the economic viability of these operations,  said Wayne Robinson, CEO of Sibanye’s gold division, in a statement The mine, west of Johannesburg, was closed as the company went through an appeals process for workers fired for taking part in a wildcat strike. The Cooke operations, which have been under strategic review, were impacted by the loss of around 300 kilograms of planned gold production, the company said.  These operations have failed to meet production targets for some time, with illegal mining and employee collusion likely to have played a meaningful role in this underperformance,  said Robinson. Sibanye has laid out 200 million rand to stop illegal mining, which is estimated to costs South Africa's government and industry more than 20 billion rand a year in lost sales, taxes and royalties.  The arrest of 472 illegal miners at the Cooke operations, which are not dormant, but active, operating mines, indicates the extent of the illegal mining activities and the risks that this growing criminal activity poses to our operations, employees and communities,  said Robinson. $1 = 13.0947 rand Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by MarkPotter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sibanye-gold-strike-cooke-mine-idUSL8N1JR1YG"},

Singapore-based urban and real estate developer Ascendas-Singbridge has just signed a $600 million deal with Firstspace Realty, based in the south Indian city of Bengaluru, to create 14 million square feet (1.3 million square meters) of industrial warehousing space across six major Indian cities.  Manufacturing, modern retail and the pharma sector were already driving change in Indian warehousing. GST has just fast-tracked the growth rate in logistics,  said Aloke Bhuniya, Chief Executive of Ascendas-Firstspace. He reckoned that GST has boosted the industry's annual growth rate from 12-15 percent to 20-22 percent, and saw plenty of room for a lot more modernisation. Out of the logistics industry's 980 million square feet (91 million square meters) of captive, agri-based and cold storage warehousing, Bhuniya estimated 85 percent were old godowns and traditional structures.  This represents a huge opportunity for modern warehousing to tap into,  he said.

The decision upheld the 2015 verdict of a lower court, which said the government acted within its rights when it lowered tariffs on offshore gas pipelines.  The state has won the case and has the right to have its costs covered (by the plaintiffs),  the Borgarting Court of Appeal said in its verdict. In the first round, the state won the case but did not win the right to have its costs paid. The latest verdict overturned that decision, awarding the government 42.2 million crowns from the plaintiffs. The verdict, delivered by three judges, was unanimous. The lawsuit was brought by Solveig Gas, Silex Gas, Njord Gas Infrastructure and Infragas, which hold a combined 44 percent stake in pipeline joint-venture Gassled. The firms are owned by Allianz, UBS, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, among other investors.  We have been acquitted in two instances,  the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy said in a statement. Silex Gas told Reuters ahead of the verdict it would consider an appeal to the Supreme Court if it lost this round, but would also be open to discussing a settlement with the state. After the verdict, Silex Gas CEO Kurt Georgsen declined to say whether the company would appeal or whether it would sell its stake in Gassled.  The court has emphasised that the ministry did not establish transparent systems. But the court has also said that there was a legal basis for the tariff reductions and that we have no basis for claims and damages,  he said. Another plaintiff, Solveig Gas, said it would consider  carefully  whether to appeal.   We will obviously continue as owners in Gassled. We will keep Gassled running. This case never impacted in our role in Gassled,  said Solveig Gas CEO Tryve Pedersen.  Another plaintiff, Infragas, declined to comment. If the plaintiffs do appeal to the Supreme Court, they must do so by September 16.   Tariff Row  The government owns 45.8 percent of Gassled via state-owned Petoro, while majority state-owned Statoil has 5 percent. Some of the companies involved have said the unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs had hurt the image of Norway as a country to invest in. The government cut tariffs shortly after the four firms bought their stakes in Gassled in 2011 and 2012 from ExxonMobil, Total, Statoil and Royal Dutch Shell for a total of 32 billion Norwegian crowns. The lowered tariffs took effect on gas transport agreements on October 1, 2016. The oil ministry said last September the move was in line with its longstanding policy of keeping a pretax return on capital investment in transportation infrastructure at around 7 percent.  The new tariffs will continue to generate a reasonable profit for Gassled,  the ministry said at the time.

Workers from Thailand's poor neighbors, in particular Myanmar and Cambodia, make up the backbone of its manual labor force and many industries, including a multi-billion dollar seafood industry, are heavily reliant on foreign workers. Undocumented migrants are sometimes subject to exploitation by employers and cases of forced labor have been found by the media and Thailand's foreign trade partners. Under a decree that came into effect on June 17, an employer who hires an undocumented foreign worker faces a fine of up to 800,000 baht ($23,550). The penalty has some businesses scrambling to fire undocumented workers or get them registered.  Some employees are scared, because they employ illegal workers. Even though we aren't rounding these workers up they are still scared about the hefty fines,  Pornchai Kuntee, deputy commissioner of the Immigration Bureau, told Reuters.  There will be an impact to the economy because foreign workers are an essential part of the workforce,  he said. Thailand's military government says it has made legalizing foreign workers a priority to help business. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had said workers and their employers should be given an extension of 120 days to register and comply with the new decree, his deputy, Wissanu Krea-ngam, told reporters later on Friday. Media had earlier published pictures of workers crossing a border river from Thailand back into Myanmar carrying, bundles of belongings in plastic bags. Official government figures for the number of undocumented workers leaving this week were not available but immigration police estimated 2,000 had gone back to Myanmar and Cambodia. Reuters reported last month that, despite a Thai crackdown on people smuggling and trafficking networks, people-smuggling across the Thai-Myanmar border is on the rise as people arrive in search of jobs. This week, the United States kept Thailand on a trafficking watch list saying it did not meet the minimum standards to end human trafficking. Thailand defended its efforts to stop trafficking and urged U.S. officials to visit and see its efforts.

The U.S. State Department named Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat one of eight winners this year, citing his leadership in combating modern slavery in India, his role in elevating human trafficking as a government priority and his innovative approach to investigating cases. Bhagwat, 48, was presented the award in absentia in Washington on Tuesday.  This award is a recognition for the cause that I have been fighting against for more than a decade,  said Bhagwat, now police chief in Rachakonda district of southern Telangana state.  It has been a long journey from the first trafficking case I stumbled upon sometime in 2004.  I was shocked that school buses were being used to ferry trafficked girls to resorts on the outskirts of the city for prostitution,  he said of his first case.  It rattled me.  Bhagwat, who worked as a civil engineer before joining the police, has been credited with closing 25 brothels in less than a year and participating in one of the country's largest crackdowns on labor trafficking, rescuing more than 350 children forced to work in brick kilns. He called for better cooperation and protocols to combat trafficking effectively.  Dealing with traffickers who operate across state and national borders requires a standard protocol that agencies across these boundaries can effectively use,  Bhagwat told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. India has an estimated 40 percent of almost 46 million people enslaved worldwide, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index. The 2017 Trafficking In Persons report released on Tuesday recognized India's efforts to identify victims, complete investigations and increase spending on rehabilitation of survivors. It also calls for the Indian government to increase prosecutions and convictions for all forms of trafficking and fully resource anti-human trafficking units in all districts.

MSCI's closely tracked emerging economy share index was down 0.6 percent on day and looked set for a modest weekly drop - a low key finish to an otherwise stellar six months that has seen it make a 17.5 percent gain. reut.rs/2ne9sjH China's yuan extended gains for a fourth straight session as it headed for its best quarter since June 2008 and its best week since July 2005, helped, like most of the top performing emerging market assets this year, by a dollar that has had its worst run in 7 years. Mexico's peso strengthened 14.5 percent since the start of the year. Improving growth in Poland has made the zloty the second best global performer with a 12.6 percent gain. tmsnrt.rs/2hniYya  It has generally been a good story this year so far,  said TD Securities emerging market strategist Paul Fage.  Improving global growth is one of the key factors here, that is always good for emerging markets... and dollar weakness also helps EM currencies by definition.  South Africa's rand was the day's other main mover as it slipped 0.6 percent with some market players pointing to comments from finance minister Malusi Gigaba that the country needs  drastic measures  to escape slow growth as the cause. The rand has strengthened some 5 percent since the start of the year, though political uncertainty and concerns over the central bank independence in recent weeks have curtailed gains. While the dollar - on course for its worst quarter in seven years - supported recent gains across emerging currencies, policy shifts from major central banks going forward could well weigh on currencies, said TD Securities' Fage. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, opening the door to tweaks in the bank's aggressive stimulus policy on Tuesday, sent tremors through markets.  I think in the short term emerging market currencies will respond negative to tighter policy from the ECB or the Fed but in six months time whether they have gone up or down will depend on their growth performance,  he said.

Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, 37, known as  Me Nam  (Mother Mushroom), was found guilty at a one-day trial in the province of Khanh Hoa, six months after she was arrested for posting what police described as anti-state reports, including one about civilians dying in police custody. Despite sweeping economic reform in Vietnam, and increasing openness towards social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, the Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.  The verdict was too heavy and unfair,  said Vo An Don, one of her lawyers, adding that she would appeal. The sentence comes at a time when Vietnam's human rights record is in the spotlight, with a recent Human Rights Watch's report highlighting beatings and intimidation of activists, bloggers and dissidents. A foreign ministry spokeswoman, Le Thi Thu Hang, said the court proceedings were public and  in accordance with Vietnamese law . In March 2009, Quynh spent nine days in police detention for receiving funds from Viet Tan, a California-based activist group which Vietnam calls a terrorist group, to print T-shirts carrying slogans against a major bauxite project in the Central Highlands, police said. Quynh had also spoken out against a subsidiary of Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Corp  that caused one of Vietnam's biggest environmental disasters in April. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State said it was deeply concerned about the conviction of Quynh, who she described as a 2017 International Woman of Courage awardee.   We've seen some positive steps on human rights in Vietnam over the past few years. However, the trend of increased arrests and convictions of peaceful protests since early 2016 is deeply troubling,  the spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement.  Progress on human rights will allow the U.S.-Vietnam partnership to reach its fullest potential.  Earlier, the EU delegation in Vietnam called on the government to release Quynh.  This arrest goes against the country's international and domestic human rights obligations,  it said. Vietnam has been accused of using vague laws to stifle bloggers and activists who are getting more exposure from the proliferation of social media. Vietnam has one of Asia's highest concentrations of Web users. Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-court-idUSKBN19L14C"},

Despite the not guilty pleas, former Tepco chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata, 77, and former executives Sakae Muto, 67, and Ichiro Takekuro, 71, apologized during the hearing at the Tokyo District Court for causing trouble to the victims and society, according to a pool report for foreign journalists. They are the first individuals to face criminal charges for the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster but a high bar for proof may prevent a conviction. Prosecutors earlier declined to bring charges but a civilian judiciary panel twice voted to indict the executives, overruling the prosecutors the second time.   I apologize for the tremendous trouble to the residents in the area and around the country because of the serious accident that caused the release of radioactive materials,  Katsumata said, adding he could not have anticipated the risk of high tsunami. Lawyers acting as prosecutors said the three executives had access to data and studies anticipating the risk of a tsunami exceeding 10 meters height in the area that could trigger power loss and cause a nuclear accident, according to the pool report. However, lawyers for the defendants said that such tsunami estimates were not well established, and even experts had divisive views.  The defendants' lawyers were not immediately available to the media, a court official said. A combination picture shows (L-R) former Tokyo Electric Power Co.(TEPCO) Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, former vice presidents of TEPCO, arriving at the Tokyo District Court for the first criminal trial over the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in Tokyo, Japan in this photo taken by Kyodo June 30, 2017.   Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERSCitizen judiciary panels, selected by lottery, are a rarely used feature of Japan's legal system introduced after World War Two to curb bureaucratic overreach. In 2015, Tokyo prosecutors twice declined to bring charges against the three, citing insufficient evidence. But the 11 unidentified citizens on the panel voted for a second time in July that year to indict them.  The panel found the former executives had failed to take countermeasures to strengthen the Fukushima plant despite foreseeing the dangers it faced from tsunamis, according to a copy of the 31-page ruling seen by Reuters. Indictments brought by the panels have a low conviction rate. One review of eight types of these cases by the Eiko Sogo Law Office found just one, equal to a 17 percent conviction rate, compared with an overall rate of 98 percent in Japan.  I think the likelihood of a conviction is exceptionally low, particularly a conviction that survives all the way to the Supreme Court,  said Colin Jones, a professor at the Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.  Tokyo District Court is probably one of the most institutionally conservative courts in the system, so it is a court that is very likely to be government/large company-friendly in this sort of case,  he added. The Fukushima plant, located 220 km (130 miles) northeast of Tokyo, was rocked by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011, sparking three reactor meltdowns. More than 160,000 residents fled nearby towns and radiation contaminated water, food and air in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The current trial is expected to last more than a year, the Asahi newspaper said.

The blue FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,335.21 points by 0848 GMT, underperforming a slightly positive European market. The FTSE 100's heavy weighting towards the resources sectors has hindered its progress over the past month as the price of oil slid to a 7-month low. Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP were down 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, while miner Glencore also dropped 1.4 percent. Worries over central banks hinting that a tightening of monetary policy could be on horizon have also been a key focus this week, hitting shares in defensive, dividend-paying stocks such as utilities and pharma firms, whose dividends become less attractive when bond yields rise.  The market has decided that we are entering an environment where borrowing costs are going to start to rise,  said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index.  That has a lot of implications for debt-dependent, capital-intensive industries, for industries which tend to run a weak or negative cash profile,  Odeluga said, adding that, as many of the UK blue chips tend to be low-growth, high-yielding, value stocks, the recent rotation could be beneficial for the FTSE. United Utilities was the biggest blue chip faller, down 2.5 percent following a downgrade to  underperform  from Credit Suisse.  We think bond yields are equally likely to rise over the coming five-year period. This would exacerbate the valuation impact of the cut to returns,  analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note, referring to the broader water utilities sector.  Financing risk is borne by companies, and while this has led to windfall profits over the past two regulatory cycles, the dynamic could very well reverse.  British utilities had been under particular pressure this month in the run-up to the UK general election, with proposed policies around price caps weighing on the shares. Severn Trent, National Grid and United Utilities were among the worst-performing stocks in June, all losing more than 12 percent this month. The last three months have also been lacklustre for the FTSE, which was set to end Q2 roughly flat, following four quarters of consecutive gains as sterling's post-Brexit vote plunge boosted dollar-earning blue chips. Among mid caps, which were up 0.1 percent, shares in Greene King were among the biggest fallers. They dropped more than 4 percent after JPMorgan downgraded its rating on the pub operator to  neutral , and several other brokers cut their price targets for the stock, following Greene King's full year update in the previous session.

In September last year, a Tokyo city government panel had warned expenses could balloon to 3 trillion yen. That would have been some four times the estimate Tokyo had made when it won the bidding in 2013, and prompted a worried IOC and local organisers to form a working group on cutting costs. Figures released last month showed organisers had trimmed budget estimates to 1.685 trillion yen ($15.7 billion) including contingencies, from 1.8 trillion yen in their initial budget unveiled in December.  We're very pleased, as you know ... we've been able to save 2.2 billion U.S. (dollars) on the revised construction budget,  Coates told a news conference at the conclusion of several days of meetings with Tokyo 2020 organisers and city officials.  But that's not to say that we're not continuing to work with our partners to identify further savings. Savings for tax-payers is very high among our priorities.  Among areas that Coates said could be the targets of further cuts were the costs of the temporary overlay, as well as the planning of venues with international federations. Cost cuts could also potentially be made in the international media centre.  It's important for the IOC, because we want to ensure that these are not only the best Games, but these are Games that can serve as a model as to prudent costing for future Games and encourage future bids,  he said. Four cities dropped out of the race for the 2024 games due to cost concerns, and the IOC is worried that soaring costs could deter future bidders. The meetings included visits to the sites of several venues, including the Olympic Village and the New National Stadium, where construction was delayed by decisions to switch designs in order to cut costs - and which Coates said would be ready by deadline in November 2019. Coates sidestepped questions about transportation between the athletes' village and venues, which has been complicated by delays in deciding to move Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market, throwing construction of a key road and tunnel into doubt. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike has vowed that the road will be completed, but Yoshiro Mori, president of the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, called for clarification by the time of the next IOC visit, in December.  Is it really possible to dig a tunnel? What is the completion date?  he added.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - As U.S. officials investigated in January the FSB's alleged role in election cyber attacks, U.S. technology firms were quietly lobbying the government to soften a ban on dealing with the Russian spy agency, people with direct knowledge of the effort told Reuters.  New U.S. sanctions put in place by former President Barack Obama last December - part of a broad suite of actions taken in response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election - had made it a crime for American companies to have any business relationship with the FSB, or Federal Security Service.  Previous Reuters Cyber coverage: Under pressure, Western tech firms bow to Russian demands to share cyber secretsMore Cyber Risk news U.S. authorities had accused the FSB, along with the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, of orchestrating cyber attacks on the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a charge Moscow denies.  But the sanctions also threatened to imperil the Russian sales operations of Western tech companies. Under a little-understood arrangement, the FSB doubles as a regulator charged with approving the import to Russia of almost all technology that contains encryption, which is used in both sophisticated hardware as well as products like cellphones and laptops.  Worried about the sales impact, business industry groups, including the U.S.-Russia Business Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, contacted U.S. officials at the American embassy in Moscow and the Treasury, State and Commerce departments, according to five people with direct knowledge of the lobbying effort.  The campaign, which began in January and proved successful in a matter of weeks, has not been previously reported.  In recent years, Western technology companies have acceded to increasing demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets, including source code, Reuters reported last week.  Russia's information technology market is expected to reach $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation.  The sanctions would have meant the Russian market was  dead for U.S. electronics” said Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, who argued against the new restrictions. “Every second Russian has an iPhone, iPad, so they would all switch to Samsungs,  he said.  A spokesman for the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. A State Department official said Washington considered a range of factors before amending the FSB sanction and regularly works with U.S. companies to assess the impact of such policies.  The lobbyists argued the sanction could have stopped the sale of cars, medical devices and heavy equipment, all of which also often contain encrypted software, according to a person involved in the lobbying effort. The goal of the sanctions was to sever U.S. business dealings with the FSB - not end American technology exports to Russia entirely, the industry groups argued.  “The sanction was against a government agency that has many functions, only one of them being hacking the U.S. elections,” said Rodzianko.  The lobbyists assembled representatives from the tech, automotive and manufacturing sectors to make the case to the U.S. Treasury Department, said the person involved in the lobbying effort.  FILE PHOTO: Police guard the FSB headquarters during an opposition protest in Moscow, Russia, on March 5, 2012.Mikhail Voskresensky/File PhotoThe industry groups did not argue against the intent of the sanction but asked for a narrow exception that would allow them to continue to seek regulatory approvals from the FSB while still keeping in place the broader ban on doing business with the spy agency.     PUNISHMENT FOR VERY BAD ACTS     The industry groups represent a number of technology firms with a large presence in Russia, including Cisco and Microsoft.  Reuters was unable to determine which companies were directly involved in the lobbying. Microsoft said it did not ask for changes to the sanctions. In a statement, Cisco said it also did not seek any changes to the sanction but had asked the Treasury Department for clarification on how it applied.  In order to get encrypted technology into Russia, companies need to obtain the blessing of the FSB, a process that can sometimes take months or even years of negotiation. Before granting that approval, the agency can demand sensitive security data about the product, including source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment.  The United States has accused Russia of a growing number of cyber attacks against the West. U.S. officials say they are concerned that Moscow’s reviews of product secrets could be used to find vulnerabilities to hack into the products.  Some U.S. government officials rejected the industry groups' arguments. They openly embraced the prospect of any ripple effect that cut further trade with Russia.  Kevin Wolf was assistant secretary at the Commerce Department and oversaw export control policy when the FSB sanction was put in place. Wolf said within days of the sanction taking effect, Commerce received numerous calls from industry groups and companies warning of the unintended consequences.  But for Wolf, who was  furious  with Moscow over the alleged cyber attacks, any additional curbs on trade with Russia was a bonus rather than an unintended downside.   I said, 'Great, terrific, fuck 'em ... The whole point is to interfere with trade',  recounted Wolf. “The sanction was meant to impose pain (on Russia) and send a signal as punishment for very bad acts.   Wolf left the Commerce Department when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.  Other officials felt that the impact on legitimate trade was too great. “The intention of the sanction was not to cut off tech trade with Russia,” said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the process.  The lobbyists had also argued that since the sanctions only applied to U.S. technology makers, it would put them at a disadvantage to European and Asian companies who would still be able to interact with the FSB and sell products in Russia.   We were asking for a narrow technical fix that would give a fair deal for American companies,  Dan Russell, CEO of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, said in an interview.  The advocacy worked. State and Treasury officials began working to tweak the sanction in January before Obama left office, according to people involved in the process.  On Feb. 2, the Treasury Department created an exception to the sanction, about two weeks after Trump took office, to allow tech companies to continue to obtain approvals from the FSB.

The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), part of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said new satellite images show missile shelters and radar and communications facilities being built on the Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi Reefs in the Spratly Islands. The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities on the artificial islands and is concerned they could be used to restrict free movement through the South China Sea, an important trade route. Last month, a U.S. Navy warship sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in a so-called freedom of navigation operation, the first such challenge to Beijing's claim to most of the waterway since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. China has denied U.S. charges that it is militarizing the sea, which also is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trump has sought China's help in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and tension between Washington and Beijing over military installations in the South China Sea could complicate those efforts. Construction is shown on Mischief Reef, in the Spratly Islands, the disputed South China Sea in this June 19, 2017 satellite image released by CSIS Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to Reuters on June 29, 2017.  MANDATORY CREDIT CSIS/AMTI DigitalGlobe/Handout via REUTERSChina has built four new missile shelters on Fiery Cross Reef to go with the eight already on the artificial island, AMTI said. Mischief and Subi each have eight shelters, the think tank said in a previous report. In February, Reuters reported that China had nearly finished building structures to house long-range surface-to-air missiles on the three islands.  Slideshow (4 Images)On Mischief Reef, a very large antennae array is being installed that presumably boosts Beijing's ability to monitor the surroundings, the think tank said, adding that the installation should be of concern to the Philippines due to its proximity to an area claimed by Manila. A large dome recently was installed on Fiery Cross and another is under construction, indicating a sizeable communications or radar system, AMTI said. Two more domes are being built at Mischief Reef, it said. A smaller dome has been installed near the missile shelters on Mischief,  indicating that it could be connected to radars for any missile systems that might be housed there,  AMTI said.  Beijing can now deploy military assets, including combat aircraft and mobile missile launchers, to the Spratly Islands at any time,  it said.

The first trailer for  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,  released on Thursday, shows how four high school teenagers are transported into a Jumanji video game as adult avatars and find themselves pursued by jungle creatures and motorcycle assailants, jumping into waterfalls and encountering perilous caves.  The first  Jumanji  told the story of a boy trapped in the magical board game for 26 years. He is released as a grown man (Williams) when two children discover the game.  As they start playing again, stampeding elephants and wild creatures escape from the Jumanji jungle into the real world, causing havoc in a small town. In the sequel, due out in theaters on Dec. 20, viewers are meant to get a sense of being pulled back into alternative world of the board game jungle.   This has the original energy and magic of the classic that everyone saw 20 years ago but this time, I like to tell people it's in the game,  Black told Reuters Television in interviews from the Hawaii set of the film.  I'd say that our movie is on a grander scale because it's a whole universe of Jumanji,  he added.  To kick the sequel off, four high school teenagers forced to clean out their school's basement while in detention come across an old Jumanji video game. They soon wind up being transported into the game, as the adult video game avatars that they pick.  A nerdy teen becomes the muscle-bound Johnson, a blonde cheerleader transforms into the bespectacled Black, an introverted girl becomes a skimpily-clad Gillan, while a buff football player transforms into the diminutive Hart. Johnson said the sequel pays homage to Williams, who committed suicide in 2014.    In terms of Robin and our story, it's done with so much love and respect that I think we're putting ourselves in a really good position, and I think fans will love it,  he said.

The finance ministry expects the budget to receive 150 billion roubles ($2.5 billion) in dividends from state-controlled Sberbank next year, versus the 67.8 billion roubles the budget is expected to receive this year. It sees Sberbank paying the budget 165 billion roubles in 2019 and 181.5 billion roubles in 2020. The central bank owns 50 percent plus one share in Sberbank and transfers the money it gets from Sberbank dividends to the state budget. Russian authorities are trying to squeeze more dividends from state companies in a bid to close a budget deficit brought about by weak oil prices and anaemic economic growth. Sberbank's 2016 dividends were the highest in the bank's history, amounting to 25 percent of its net profit. Sberbank has outperformed rival Russian banks since 2014, when the Russian economy fell into a deep slump as oil prices plunged and the West imposed sanctions on banks and companies over the Ukraine conflict. It holds around a third of total banking sector deposits in Russia, meaning it is less dependent on more costly central bank financing than other Russian banks, and its pricing power on loans is unmatched. $1 = 59.3710 roubles Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Writing by Alexander Winning; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-sberbank-dividend-idUSL8N1JR1QT"},

It also highlights the risks. Taught by her brother to fire an AK-47 at 15 and encouraged by her mother to fight for Syrian Kurdish autonomy, she says she has killed 50 people since she took up arms in Syria's six-year-old civil war, fighting first al Qaeda, then crossing into Iraq to help Kurds there against Islamic State. Now 26, she leads a 15-woman unit hunting down the hardline group in its global headquarters Raqqa, speeding through streets once controlled by the militants in a pick-up truck as fellow fighters comb through ruined buildings for booby traps. The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), spearheaded by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, have taken several parts of the northern Syrian town since their assault began this month. This week U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Washington may arm the SDF for future battles against Islamic State while taking back weapons it no longer needs. The plan is the  headline  of a still-unfinished stabilization plan for Syria by the Trump administration, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The risk is that it causes new instability in a war in which outside powers are playing ever larger roles. The U.S.-YPG relationship has infuriated Syria's northern neighbor Turkey, a NATO ally which says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, designated terrorist by both Ankara and Washington for its insurgency against the Turkish state. Turkey has sent troops into Syria, partly to attack Islamic State, but also to keep the YPG, which controls Kurdish-populated areas of northern Syria, from moving into an Arab and Turkmen area that would give it control of the whole frontier. On Wednesday Ankara said its artillery had destroyed YPG targets after local Turkish-backed forces came under attack. Turkey has recently sent reinforcements into Syria, according to the rebel groups it backs, prompting SDF concern it plans to attack Kurdish YPG forces. The SDF warned on Thursday of a  big possibility of open, fierce confrontation .  We'll Do What We Can  Syrian Kurdish leaders say they want autonomy in Syria, like that enjoyed by Kurds in Iraq, rather than independence or to interfere in neighboring states. They say Turkish warnings that YPG weapons could end up in PKK hands are unjustified. “We were the victims of the nation state model and we have no desire to reproduce this model,  said Khaled Eissa, European representative of the PYD, the YPG's political affiliate. Sheen Ibrahim, Kurdish fighter from the People's Protection Units (YPG) looks for drones operated by Islamic State militants in Raqqa, Syria June 21, 2017.Goran TomasevicIbrahim and other fighters interviewed by Reuters said they were not terrorists but would “stand up” to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. “Turkey is fighting us,  Ibrahim said.  Anyone who fights us, we will fight.  Washington is working to calm tensions over its relationship with the YPG, which is also backed by Russia.  There is absolute transparency between Turkey and the United States on that subject,  said Major General Rupert Jones, the British deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State. But disarmament will not be easy, judging by the comments of YPG fighters on the ground.  We will not give up our weapons,  said a sniper aiming at Islamic State positions, who only gave her first name, Barkaneurin.  We need them to defend ourselves.  Fellow fighter Maryam Mohamed agreed.  Erdogan is our biggest enemy, we cannot hand over our weapons,  she said. One of the U.S. officials said Washington did not know exactly how many weapons the YPG has because some Arabs had joined its ranks, taking U.S.-supplied weapons with them, when their groups suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Slideshow (6 Images)“Loyalties are as variable as the battle lines and sometimes follow them,  the official said. Asked about weapons recovery, Mattis, in his first public remarks on the issue, said:  We'll do what we can,  while YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud emphasized the target was Islamic State.  We are fighting a global terrorist group,  he said. Battlefield victory is tantalizingly close. U.S.-backed forces in neighboring Iraq announced on Thursday they had retaken Mosul, Islamic State's largest stronghold and the twin capital, with Raqqa, of the  caliphate  it declared in 2014. But the U.S. official and two others who also declined to be named, noted other huge obstacles to stabilizing Syria they said the administration was papering over. Rebuilding Raqqa will need billions of dollars and an unprecedented level of compromise among groups long hostile to each other, all three officials said. One said Iranian forces backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were poised to exploit any setbacks. Kurds are spearheading the attack on Raqqa, but a mainly Arab force is planned to maintain security in the overwhelmingly Arab town thereafter. While Kurds and Arabs fight side by side against Islamic State, with the militants' self-proclaimed caliphate shrinking, competition for territory will intensify. “We are getting ourselves into the middle of another potential mess we don’t understand,” one of the U.S. officials said.

Despite the not guilty pleas, former Tepco chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata, 77, and former executives Sakae Muto, 67, and Ichiro Takekuro, 71, apologized during the hearing at the Tokyo District Court for causing trouble to the victims and society, according to a pool report for foreign journalists. They are the first individuals to face criminal charges for the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster but a high bar for proof may prevent a conviction. Prosecutors earlier declined to bring charges but a civilian judiciary panel twice voted to indict the executives, overruling the prosecutors the second time.   I apologize for the tremendous trouble to the residents in the area and around the country because of the serious accident that caused the release of radioactive materials,  Katsumata said, adding he could not have anticipated the risk of high tsunami. Lawyers acting as prosecutors said the three executives had access to data and studies anticipating the risk of a tsunami exceeding 10 meters height in the area that could trigger power loss and cause a nuclear accident, according to the pool report. However, lawyers for the defendants said that such tsunami estimates were not well established, and even experts had divisive views.  The defendants' lawyers were not immediately available to the media, a court official said. A combination picture shows (L-R) former Tokyo Electric Power Co.(TEPCO) Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, former vice presidents of TEPCO, arriving at the Tokyo District Court for the first criminal trial over the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in Tokyo, Japan in this photo taken by Kyodo June 30, 2017.   Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERSCitizen judiciary panels, selected by lottery, are a rarely used feature of Japan's legal system introduced after World War Two to curb bureaucratic overreach. In 2015, Tokyo prosecutors twice declined to bring charges against the three, citing insufficient evidence. But the 11 unidentified citizens on the panel voted for a second time in July that year to indict them.  The panel found the former executives had failed to take countermeasures to strengthen the Fukushima plant despite foreseeing the dangers it faced from tsunamis, according to a copy of the 31-page ruling seen by Reuters. Indictments brought by the panels have a low conviction rate. One review of eight types of these cases by the Eiko Sogo Law Office found just one, equal to a 17 percent conviction rate, compared with an overall rate of 98 percent in Japan.  I think the likelihood of a conviction is exceptionally low, particularly a conviction that survives all the way to the Supreme Court,  said Colin Jones, a professor at the Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.  Tokyo District Court is probably one of the most institutionally conservative courts in the system, so it is a court that is very likely to be government/large company-friendly in this sort of case,  he added. The Fukushima plant, located 220 km (130 miles) northeast of Tokyo, was rocked by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011, sparking three reactor meltdowns. More than 160,000 residents fled nearby towns and radiation contaminated water, food and air in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The current trial is expected to last more than a year, the Asahi newspaper said.

The rules, which build upon guidelines released in 2012, come as authorities are cracking down on online content such as literature, livestreaming, news and social media - a broad campaign aimed at controlling social discourse online. Weibo Corp, the operator of China's top microblogging site, said this week it would block unapproved video content and work more closely with state media to promote  mainstream  ideas, following a sharp rebuke from regulators. [nL3N1JQ1ZX] Authorities also ordered internet companies this month to close 60 celebrity gossip social media accounts to help  actively propagate core socialist values  and prop up  mainstream public opinion . [nL3N1J526Z] Under the new guidance, which comes into immediate effect, censors should check that content adheres to proper Chinese values and strive to tell Chinese stories to help  realize the China dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Content should  sing the motherland, eulogize heroes,  celebrate our times in song, and lead the people to hold the correct historical, ethnic, national and cultural view . Programs that undermined a respectful national image, ridiculed leaders, promoted negative or decadent views of life and showed the  dark side  of society would be edited, or in severe cases stopped. President Xi Jinping has overseen measures to clamp down on independent online media, while reasserting the ruling Communist Party's role in limiting and guiding online discussion. The Cyberspace Administration of China in May released regulations for online news portals and network providers, which extended restrictions on content and required all services to be managed by party-sanctioned editorial staff.

Pacquiao, one of the finest boxers of his generation, was defeated by Mayweather in an unanimous points decision in Las Vegas two years ago but the 38-year-old wants another shot at the American. Mayweather retired in 2015 with a 49-0 record but the 40-year-old has agreed to a 12-round fight against mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor, a match-up dismissed by boxing purists as a circus. Speculation of a potential Pacquiao-Mayweather rematch has rumbled in the background, with the Filipino's long-time trainer Freddie Roach saying that Mayweather had paid several visits to his Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles in recent months. Roach told reporters in the leadup to Sunday's fight that Pacquiao wanted a rematch with Mayweather but he would have to put on a show against Horn to have any chance of getting it.   To get Mayweather you have to look good. Against Horn, he has to be impressive. It's a good way to get his pay-per-view audience back.  Box Office Appeal While Pacquiao's WBO welterweight title defence will be pay-per-view on Australian television, ESPN's telecast will be beamed prime-time in the United States on Saturday. While Lang Park, a stadium mostly used for professional rugby matches, is an unlikely venue for the Filipino senator's bid to stay relevant in the boxing world Pacquiao (59-6-2) still has huge box office appeal. Enough for the local Queensland government to help bankroll a fight expected to draw over 50,000 spectators. Pacquiao's camp had hoped to arrange a fight with Briton Amir Khan in the United Arab Emirates in May but that deal fell through over money problems, opening the door for Horn (16-0-1), a 29-year-old former schoolteacher who is undefeated against mainly obscure opponents. Roach has predicted a knockout in a  short and sweet  fight.  In all my years of boxing, I have never been as motivated and fired up as this fight,  Pacquiao said on his arrival 'Down Under'. Pacquiao regained the welterweight world title belt he lost to Mayweather when he beat Jesse Vargas in a unanimous decision in November, proving he still remains a formidable competitor. But he has failed to win inside the distance since a 12th round TKO of Miguel Cotto in 2009. While Roach quips that Pacquiao's embrace of Christianity has stopped the knockout blows from coming pundits have questioned whether the southpaw still has the power that accounted for the likes of De La Hoya, Shane Mosley and Ricky Hatton. Horn's trainer Glenn Rushton has bullishly predicted the fight will go the distance but the former Olympian will go into his hometown bout a rank outsider. Horn, who stands to earn a fraction of Pacquiao's guaranteed purse, win or lose, was unimpressed with Pacquiao's lack of interest in the pre-fight media conference this week where the Filipino spent much of the time playing with his phone.  I can’t imagine him doing that at a Mayweather press conference,” Horn told local media.  It definitely shows a bit of 'he doesn’t care' attitude to the fight.

The Outlook is Stable. The covered bonds are issued through DBS and covered bonds payments are guaranteed by Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte. Ltd. (CBG) upon a covered bonds event of default. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is based on DBS's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', an IDR uplift of zero notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches, a recovery uplift of one notch and the asset percentage (AP) used in the programme's asset coverage test, which the issuer intends to decrease to at least our revised breakeven AP of 85.0%. Fitch has revised its 'AAA' breakeven AP to 85.0%, from 85.5%, due to the lower asset margin of DBS's cover pool against swap funding costs in the liabilities - Singapore dollar swap offer - of one month than in January 2017. The revised 'AAA' breakeven AP of 85.0% is equivalent to a breakeven overcollateralisation (OC) of 17.6%. This is driven by the asset disposal loss of 18.0%, which reflects the significant asset and liability mismatches in the programme, with the weighted-average (WA) life of the cover assets at 12.0 years and the liabilities at 3.3 years. The credit loss component contributes 3.4% to breakeven OC and the cash flow component reduces it by 3.7% due to the available excess spread modelled by Fitch in the programme. The relied upon AP equals Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP and corresponds to an 'AA+' tested rating on a probability of default basis and a one-notch recovery uplift. The recovery was capped at one notch as the programme is significantly exposed to foreign-exchange risk from the recoveries given default of the covered bonds. This is because the assets are denominated in Singapore dollars, while the covered bonds issued are denominated in other currencies. Currency risk is hedged for the length of the liabilities, but we expect those hedges to terminate in the event of a covered bond default so that the longer-dated Singapore-dollar asset cash flows would provide recoveries in a different currency than the initial covered bond. The Outlook on the covered bond rating reflects the Stable Outlook on DBS's Long-Term IDR and a four-notch buffer against downgrade of the issuer's IDR. VARIATION FROM CRITERIA Fitch has applied a variation from its cover asset refinancing spread level (RSL) assumptions for Singapore, which provide for refinancing stress on standard mortgage cover assets, simulating their sale to meet covered bond payments. Fitch incorporated a loan sale assumption of 0.25% as an add-on to the standard RSL for Singapore for loans linked to Central Provident Fund (CPF) amounts used for the purchase of residential property. This is because the portion of the cover pool comprising CPF-linked loans is subject to potentially higher sales costs as CPF board consent or court approval is required to transfer the CPF-linked loans to a third party. Fitch believes a potential buyer would want to be compensated for the additional cost of purchasing these CPF-linked loans. Fitch adds a stressed refinancing rate differential of 25bp above Singapore's mortgage RSL for CPF-linked loans. Fitch tested the cash flow in an 'AA+' stress scenario for timely payment by applying an RSL of 251bp instead of 234bp, based on the pro-rata value of the CPF-linked loans to the cover pools. BESPOKE ASSUMPTIONS: SINGAPORE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE Fitch has used the APAC Residential Mortgage Rating Criteria in conjunction with bespoke Singapore-specific assumptions for its asset analysis as set out below: Foreclosure Frequency (FF): Fitch has developed a base default matrix for the cover pool of DBS as follows: Base FF for each rating stress (unit % and starting from AAAsf, AAsf, Asf, BBBsf, BBsf, Bsf) For LTV of less than 30%: 2.3, 1.7, 1.2, 0.9, 0.6, 0.4 For LTV from 30% to less than 40%:  2.9, 2.2, 1.5, 1.1, 0.8, 0.5 For LTV from 40% to less than 50%: 4.7, 3.5, 2.3, 1.7, 1.2, 0.9 For LTV from 50% to less than 60%: 7.0, 5.2, 3.5, 2.6, 1.8, 1.3 For LTV from 60% to less than 65%: 8.2, 6.1, 4.1, 3.0, 2.1, 1.5 For LTV from 65% to less than 70%: 9.9, 7.4, 5.0, 3.7, 2.6, 1.8 For LTV from 70% to less than 75%: 11.1, 8.2, 5.5, 4.1, 2.9, 2.1 For LTV from 75% to less than 80%: 12.3, 9.1, 6.1, 4.6, 3.2, 2.3 For LTV from 80% to less than 85%: 15.2, 11.3, 7.6, 5.6, 4.0, 2.8 For LTV from 85% to less than 90%: 23.9, 17.7, 12.0, 8.9, 6.3, 4.4 FF Adjustment: Adjustments are applied as follows. -- Investment property: Increased base FF by 25% -- Loans in arrears: Fitch increased base FF of loans 30-59 days in arrears by 20% and for loans 60-89 days in arrears by 50%. The floor for loans 30-59 days in arrears is 20%, for loans 60-89 days in arrears 66% and for loans over 90 days in arrears 100%. Loss Severity: In determining the loss severity for a portfolio of residential mortgage loans, Fitch calculates the ratio of the property's sale proceeds to the outstanding loan balance at the time of default on a loan by loan basis. The agency determined the property's indexed value then applied a market value decline (MVD), also accounting for foreclosure and carry costs. Fitch's loss-severity assumptions and the data used to derive these assumptions are detailed below. House Price Assumptions: Fitch reviewed historical house-price movements in Singapore, determining that the largest house-value declines occurred during the Asian financial crisis in 1998-1999. The median peak-to-trough MVD was 41% during this period. Based on the historic variance of house-value movements, we applied a further adjustment of 1.4x the historic-high MVD to derive the 'AAAsf' MVD assumption. MVD: Applying the house-price declines described above, the MVDs calculated by Fitch for apartments in Singapore are as follows: AAAsf: 60% AAsf: 55% Asf: 50% BBBsf: 45% BBsf: 40% Bsf: 35%. MVD Adjustments: Fitch's MVD adjustments apply where the security property is for the landed property (detached and semi-detached house and terrace: 1.1x) based on the market value volatility and severity. Illiquid property adjustments are applied as per the APAC Residential Mortgage Rating Criteria. Property Price Indexation: To estimate the value of a property, Fitch indexed the property value using the Urban Redevelopment Authority's property price index data, the property's location and the date of the original valuation. Fitch's methodology assumed indexed property valuations capture 50% of any increased valuation and 100% of any reduced indexed valuation. Foreclosure Cost and Timing: In its loss-severity calculations, Fitch accounts for the costs related to foreclosing the property of a defaulted borrower. We applied foreclosure and carry cost assumptions of 5% and 4%, respectively. Fitch assumes recovery will take 24 months. Minimum credit loss on a portfolio of housing loans is 4% at 'AAAsf'. Cash Flow Modelling: Prepayment assumptions for DBS from year one to beyond year five are 5% for low constant prepayment rate (CPR) stress and 30% for high CPR stress. Servicer fee is 35bp. RATING SENSITIVITIES DBS's covered bonds would be vulnerable to downgrade if the relied-upon asset percentage (AP) rises above the 'AAA' breakeven AP of 85% or if the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) falls below 'BBB+'. If the AP in the programme rises to the maximum 97% AP allowed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the rating on the programme would be downgraded to 'AA', one notch above the issuer's IDR. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among other factors, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore the 'AAA' breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time Contact: Primary Analyst Keum Hee Oh Director +82 2 3278 8373 Fitch Australia Pty Ltd, Korea Branch 9F, 97 Uisadang-daero Yeongdeungpo-gu Seoul, 07327 South Korea Secondary Analyst Claire Heaton Senior Director +61 2 8256 0361 Committee Chairperson Ben McCarthy Managing Director +61 2 8256 0388 A full rating report will be available soon at www.fitchratings.com.

At least three  auditors  will have to check all movies, dramas, documentaries and animations posted online to ensure they adhere to  core socialist values , the industry body the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA) said. The rules, which build upon guidelines released in 2012, come as authorities are cracking down on online content such as literature, livestreaming, news and social media - a broad campaign aimed at controlling social discourse online. Weibo Corp, the operator of China's top microblogging site, said this week it would block unapproved video content and work more closely with state media to promote  mainstream  ideas, following a sharp rebuke from regulators. [nL3N1JQ1ZX] Authorities also ordered internet companies this month to close 60 celebrity gossip social media accounts to help  actively propagate core socialist values  and prop up  mainstream public opinion . [nL3N1J526Z] Under the new guidance, which comes into immediate effect, censors should check that content adheres to proper Chinese values and strive to tell Chinese stories to help  realize the China dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Content should  sing the motherland, eulogize heroes,  celebrate our times in song, and lead the people to hold the correct historical, ethnic, national and cultural view . Programs that undermined a respectful national image, ridiculed leaders, promoted negative or decadent views of life and showed the  dark side  of society would be edited, or in severe cases stopped. President Xi Jinping has overseen measures to clamp down on independent online media, while reasserting the ruling Communist Party's role in limiting and guiding online discussion. The Cyberspace Administration of China in May released regulations for online news portals and network providers, which extended restrictions on content and required all services to be managed by party-sanctioned editorial staff. [nL4N1I42ID] The new rules also laid out a range of issues that did not meet with approval, including violence, drug addiction, extramarital affairs and religious cults.  Also on the list was homosexuality, underlining the conservative official view on same-sex relations.

The single currency dropped 0.1 percent to trade at $1.1426, but in the April-June quarter the euro has climbed over 7 percent, putting it on track for its biggest quarterly gain since January-March 2011. The euro shot to one-year highs after Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations that a reduction in stimulus measures would be signalled as soon as September. Though policymakers looked to play this down in the days that followed, investors appear convinced that economic strength will push them to end stimulus sooner rather than later.  This is partly a response to Draghi's comments and also on the back of a euro zone economy that is firing on all cylinders and outperforming the rest of the developed economies,  said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. Growth in the bloc outstripped that of the United States in the first quarter and set the stage for a strong 2017.  It's at a different stage in the cycle as the U.S. so I do expect some of that to cool in the second half of the year, but the growth momentum doesn't seem to be going anywhere,  said Clarke. Money markets in the euro zone are fully pricing in a rate rise from the ECB by July next year. Conversely, the dollar was on course for its worst quarter in seven years on Friday, recovering only marginally against major peers.  Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a rate hike was likely to be needed as the British economy came closer to running at full capacity. Sterling edged higher on Friday to $1.301, adding to Thursday's 0.6 percent gain. Two top policymakers at the Bank of Canada also suggested they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July. The environment of tightening policy has seen stocks lose some of the lustre of recent months. MSCI's index of world stocks came further off recent highs, dropping 0.14 percent to add to Thursday's sharp fall. European shares were flat in early deals on Friday, but were set to end June with their biggest monthly loss in one year as worries over tightening monetary conditions soured the mood. Earlier, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent, after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. It is up 5.3 percent for the quarter and has risen 18.3 percent this year. In commodities, oil prices continued their recovery this week on a decline in weekly U.S. crude production. U.S. crude added 0.7 percent to $45.23 a barrel in its seventh straight session of gains, bringing its weekly increase to over 5 percent. Global benchmark Brent gained 0.6 percent to $47.70 a barrel, poised for a nearly 10 percent rise for the quarter.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the actions were designed to cut off funds that North Korea uses to build its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council and unilateral sanctions.  We will follow the money and cut off the money,  he told a news conference. A Treasury statement identified the bank as the Bank of Dandong and the firm as Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co Ltd. It identified the two individuals as Sun Wei and Li Hong Ri. The sanctions imposed on the two Chinese citizens and the shipping company blacklists them from doing business with U.S.-tied companies and people. Bank of Dandong did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A staff member at Dalian Global Unity would not comment on the sanctions and subsequent calls to the firm's office in Dalian went unanswered. Mnuchin said U.S. officials were continuing to look at other companies that may be helping North Korea and may roll out additional sanctions. Related CoverageBlacklisted China bank cited as a North Korea conduit to global financeChina says always opposes non-U.N. sanctions after U.S. targets companyU.S. foreign policy experts say Chinese companies have long had a key role in financing Pyongyang. However, Mnuchin said the action was not being taken to send China a message.  This wasn't aimed at China. We continue to work with them,  he said. Asked about the U.S. sanctions on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said that China consistently opposes unilateral sanctions imposed outside the U.N. framework.  We strongly urge the United States to immediately correct its relevant wrong moves to avoid affecting bilateral cooperation on the relevant issue,  he said, without elaborating. China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said China opposed the United States using domestic laws to impose  long-arm jurisdiction  on Chinese companies or individuals, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. The flag of North Korea is seen in Geneva, Switzerland, June 20, 2017.Pierre Albouy If a Chinese company or individual has acted in a way that violates United Nations Security Council resolutions, then China will investigate and handle the issue in accordance with Chinese law,  he told an event in Washington on Thursday evening. Growing Frustration U.S. officials told Reuters this week that President Donald Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, and was now considering possible trade actions against Beijing. A senior White House official told reporters on Wednesday China was  falling far short of what it could bring to bear on North Korea in terms of pressure.  U.S.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announces measures taken to maximize pressure on North Korea to abandon its weapons programs during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe U.S. move came as Trump was due to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on Thursday to discuss steps to push North Korea to abandon its weapons programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. It also came after the United States sanctioned a Chinese industrial machinery wholesaler, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co, in September for its ties to North Korea's nuclear program, the first time Washington had taken such a step against a Chinese firm. China's Foreign Ministry said in the same month Hongxiang was under investigation for  illegal behavior  and  economic crimes  following the provisions of U.N. resolution 2270, which imposed tighter sanctions on North Korea in March.     Mnuchin said the United States would discuss efforts to choke off funding for North Korea's nuclear and missile programs with China and other countries at next week's Group of 20 summit in Germany. The U.S. Treasury Department said in an online notice published on Thursday the Bank of Dandong had served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. financial system. Authorities said 17 percent of Dandong's customer transactions in the bank's U.S. accounts had ties to North Korea.  Anthony Ruggiero, a former senior Treasury official in the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, said the action against Bank of Dandong was the first time U.S. authorities had sought to punish a Chinese bank accused of helping North Korea. It would immediately cause Western firms to cut off any transactions with Bank of Dandong, he said. It may also cause financial institutions in Western Europe and the United States to further scrutinize whether their Chinese business could have links to North Korea.  The designation will make reputable Western banks ask questions about larger financial institutions in China,  said Ruggiero, who is now a senior fellow at the non-profit Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

While we have become more optimistic about advanced country growth prospects in 2017 and 2018, our latest assessment of medium-term growth potential suggests that this year and next could be more or less as good as it gets,  said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch. New projections of supply-side potential GDP growth for the advanced economies covered in Fitch's Global Economic Outlook (GEO) suggest underlying growth performance over the next five years will lie in the 1.25% to 1.75% range for most of the 10 advanced GEO countries.  The demographic outlook is set to deteriorate further and we do not see a major turnaround in productivity performance after the slowdown witnessed over the last decade or so. Nevertheless rising labour force participation rates - as more women enter the labour force and more over 65's stay in jobs or return to work - give some grounds for encouragement from recent supply-side performance. Furthermore, Germany's success in reducing structural unemployment since the mid-2000's shows the benefits to potential GDP that can accrue from labour market reforms. US potential growth is projected at 1.8% p.a. This compares with long-run historical average growth of just below 3%, with the deterioration primarily reflecting demographics. UK potential growth is estimated at 1.7% relative to long-term average GDP growth of 2.2%. A structural slowdown in UK productivity over the last decade is only expected to be partially reversed. Potential growth for Germany and France is similar at around 1.2% but the mix differs markedly with a better outlook for productivity in Germany offsetting significantly worse demographics.  Spain's potential growth is in a similar range even though it has recently seen significantly faster actual growth. Australia is expected to see the best supply-side performance over the next five years with potential growth of 2.4%, reflecting strong population growth and healthy labour productivity. At the other end of the scale, potential growth in Japan and Italy is projected at just 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Demographics weigh very heavily in Japan although this is partially offset by surprisingly robust productivity. Italy has, however, seen persistently falling productivity levels over the last 10 years. The scope for growth to exceed supply-side potential rates over the medium-term as economic slack is absorbed is also limited. Output gaps - ie the shortfall in the level of actual GDP from potential GDP - are estimated to have been modest in 2016 for most advanced countries and with 2017 growth generally forecast to be faster than potential, they are narrowing. Only in Spain and Italy is the current negative output gap judged to be large enough to expect actual growth over the next five years to materially exceed its estimated supply-side potential rate.

As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

AccorHotels, which operates high-end chains such as Raffles and Sofitel as well as budget brands such as Ibis, initially expected to reach a deal by the end of the first-half 2017. At the meeting, shareholders overwhelmingly approved plans to turn the HotelInvest property business, worth 6.6 billion euros, into a separate entity to be known as AccorInvest prior to selling part of its capital to institutional investors. Bazin said he was confident AccorInvest, which has some 960 hotels in 26 countries and employs 40,000 people, could be worth more than 10 billion euros in the longer-term.

Investors believe a setback for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election, seen as a bellwether for national politics, would spur him to act to boost the economy. Japanese shares .MIJP00000PUS have risen more than five percent this quarter, even more than MSCI's world stock index .MIWD00000PUS which covers 46 markets. That outperfomance, the first time in three quarters, came as Abe's popularity, which looked rock-solid just a few months ago, suddenly crumbled.  A survey this week by Jiji news agency showed that the Abe's LDP was expected to lose about a third of its seats in the capital's assembly, possibly ceding a majority to a new party formed by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. Yet few investors, including event-driven hedge funds that typically make large bets on political events, are selling Japanese stocks. Nor are they betting that the safe-haven yen, which traditionally takes off as the environment gets riskier, will rise.  They think Abe will come up with some economic measure that is friendly to voters if his rating falls. They think Abe knows the rhythm he needs to buoy the government,  said Kyoya Okazawa, head of global markets, Japan and Korea, at BNP Paribas. Abe wants to accelerate plans to amend Japan's pacifist constitution and he expects to submit a proposed revision to lawmakers before the end of the year. Investors suspect Abe will need economic stimulus to please voters and achieve his long-term ambition.  Abe's timeline on constitutional reform hints at a  positive feedback between the national agenda and pro-growth economic policy: Not only can we safely rule out a premature policy tightening, but now the probability of added policy easing has risen,  wrote Jesper Koll, head of WisdomTree Japan, an equity fund.  The more ambitious the constitutional agenda, the greater the imperative to create a stronger 'feel good' factor for the voting public,  he added. Some investors think markets may be underestimating the impact of the election. Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, said a clear-cut defeat in the upcoming Tokyo election is likely to raise more awareness about the likelihood that Abe's LDP will lose seats in the next national election, which must be held by late 2018.  The LDP's retreat could be seen as 'the beginning of the  end' of Abenomics, which has been the main driving force of the yen's fall and rallies in Japanese stocks,  he said.

Picture taken June 29, 2016.Thomas MukoyaFriday's offering left another 3.85 billion shillings to be sold at a later date. The bond sale is a further advance in financial technology for the country which pioneered mobile money with M-Pesa in 2007.  Kenya has borrowed intensively in the past four years to fund an ambitious development programme, including new roads and a coast-capital railway, and the government wants to raise more cash.  However, few ordinary Kenyans bought government bonds, scared off by the minimum investment of 50,000 shillings and the need for a commercial bank account.  M-Akiba allows a single investor to put in a minimum of 3,000 shillings and a maximum 1 million shillings, earning tax-free interest of 10 percent. They will be able to trade them on the secondary market.  The bond was initially available on telecom companies' money transfer services, but has since also been opened to a similar operation run by commercial banks, known as Pesalink.  The bond will be on sale from June 30-July 21 and will be tradable on the stock exchange on July 25.

The pound has risen around 3.5 percent against the dollar since the start of April -- its best quarterly performance in two years and its second straight quarter of gains after six successive losses. On a trade-weighted basis, too, sterling was on track for its best performance since the second quarter of 2015. Sterling has benefited over the quarter from a dollar weakened by the fading of the  Trumpflation trade , with investors disappointed that U.S. President Donald Trump was not so far following through with policies that would boost growth and inflation. It has also been boosted by rising expectations that monetary policy could be tightened. It was given a significant lift this week when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months. British Prime Minister Theresa May's winning of backing for her policy programme on Thursday -- albeit with a slender parliamentary majority - was also seen as a positive by investors.  With UK domestic political uncertainty now dissipating somewhat, the focus is likely to turn to headlines surrounding the Brexit negotiations, as well as monetary policy developments,  said IronFX analyst Charalambos Pissouros.  In our view, the short-term outlook for sterling is cautiously positive, mainly due to all of the attention a potential rate hike by the BoE has attracted recently. Further signs in the next weeks that a policy move may be on the cards this year could work in favour of the pound.  British GDP and current account balance data was due at 0830 GMT.

In Fitch's view, the probability of support is underpinned by (i) the strategic importance of the Russian market for Renault and Nissan and the important role of RNB in supporting the two auto companies' business; (ii) the track record of support, and in particular the predominance of shareholder funding in RNB's liabilities; and (iii) RNB's small size relative to the owners, limiting the cost of potential support. At the same time, RNB's Long-Term IDRs are notched down from those of the bank's shareholders due to (i) each individual owner being a minority shareholder, which may reduce their propensity to provide support; and (ii) Fitch's view that reputational risks for the owners would probably be containable in case of RNB's default. The senior unsecured debt (RUB-denominated local bonds) is rated in line with the Long-Term IDR, according to Fitch's criteria for rating such instruments. RATING SENSITIVITIES Not applicable.

Making housing more affordable in the Asian financial hub, one of the most expensive property markets in the world, will be among Lam's top priorities when she begins her five-year term.

The study by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) study said China's total energy consumption is expected to fall to the equivalent of 4 billion tonnes of standard coal in 2020, which would represent a decline of 8 percent from last year. Consumption would then inch down to 3.74 billion tonnes in 2030 and 3 billion tonnes by 2050, the study said.  (Peak demand) could be this year or next year - this is a gradual process and isn't just coming down suddenly from a very pronounced summit,  said Qiang Liu, director of CASS's Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics. The CASS study suggests Beijing is cutting coal use far faster than expected, and comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to quit the 195-nation Paris agreement on climate change and reaffirmed his commitment to revive U.S. fossil fuels. It also indicates China could reach its pledge to bring climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions to a peak by  around 2030  earlier than expected, given that the energy sector is estimated to account for 70-80 percent of its CO2 emissions. The CASS forecast contrasts with China's 2016-2020 energy plan that said total energy use would grow around 2.5 percent a year until 2020 and a forecast by state-owned China National Petroleum Corp for energy consumption to peak by 2035.

The study by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) study said China's total energy consumption is expected to fall to the equivalent of 4 billion tonnes of standard coal in 2020, which would represent a decline of 8 percent from last year. Consumption would then inch down to 3.74 billion tonnes in 2030 and 3 billion tonnes by 2050, the study said.  (Peak demand) could be this year or next year - this is a gradual process and isn't just coming down suddenly from a very pronounced summit,  said Qiang Liu, director of CASS's Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics. The CASS study suggests Beijing is cutting coal use far faster than expected, and comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to quit the 195-nation Paris agreement on climate change and reaffirmed his commitment to revive U.S. fossil fuels. It also indicates China could reach its pledge to bring climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions to a peak by  around 2030  earlier than expected, given that the energy sector is estimated to account for 70-80 percent of its CO2 emissions. The CASS forecast contrasts with China's 2016-2020 energy plan that said total energy use would grow around 2.5 percent a year until 2020 and a forecast by state-owned China National Petroleum Corp for energy consumption to peak by 2035.

Comments from top central bankers including European Central Bank head Mario Draghi, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and top policymakers at the Bank of Canada earlier this week have indicated that quantitative easing is being put back in its box and interest rates are going to go up.                           Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. However, losses in the dollar, in which it is priced, have been offsetting the impact of higher yields to keep gold range-bound.     Spot gold        fell 0.2 percent to $1,242.56 per ounce, as of 0736 GMT. U.S. gold futures         for August delivery were down 0.3 percent at $1,242.60 per ounce.     Gold slid nearly 2 percent in June in its first monthly decline this year, but gained about 8 percent so far in 2017.       Gold has been range-bound between $1,243-$1,248, and appears to be lacking a catalyst for price action in any direction, MKS PAMP analyst Tim Brown said in a note.       Central banks seem to be moving toward a more hawkish view and the resulting rise in the bond yield curve is putting downward pressure on gold prices.      On Thursday, Germany's 10-year government bond yield rose to a seven-week high, and benchmark U.S. Treasury yields touched  six-week highs on the likelihood that central banks in Europe will become less accommodative.                                Central banks worldwide are going to have some kind of less stimulative economic policies. About the pace of their exit strategies, the only question is regarding the matter of degree and not the direction itself,  said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.     In the wider markets, the dollar index       , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.1 percent after hitting a nine-month low at 95.470 on Friday. Asian shares were pulled down by weaker European and U.S. markets.     Among other precious metals, silver is up 4 percent for the year despite having shed over 9 percent in the second quarter. Spot silver        slipped 0.2 percent to $16.55 per ounce on Friday.      Platinum        dipped 0.2 percent to $917.90, and slipped nearly 3 percent this quarter, but is up about 2 percent for the year.      Palladium       , which has been the best performing precious metal this year, dipped 0.4 percent to $844 per ounce. The metal surged nearly 25 percent this year, and is poised to have its best year since 2010.

Coolpad has repeatedly delayed reporting the results because of audit issues since March, when the annual report was due. Trading in its shares have been suspended since then.  The company needs more time to provide information requested by auditors of its annual report regarding  rationale and business substances of various prepayments and/or loans made by the company as well as going concerns , Chairman Yueting Jia said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Jia, who founded the LeEco group, is Coolpad's largest shareholder with a 28.83 percent stake.  Jia has been fighting financial troubles at various units of the conglomerate with businesses spanning from entertainment to electric cars. He said this week that cash crunch at LeEco was worse than expected and needed additional funding. In Friday's filing, Coolpad said it had received a letter from the exchange setting out conditions for the stock to resume trading, which included publishing the results, conducting investigations to address audit issues and disclosing relevant information so investors could appraise the firm's position. It said it was taking steps to fulfil the conditions, but did not provide any timeline.    In May, Coolpad published unaudited results that showed the company flipped to a loss of HK$4.23 billion ($542 million) for 2016, from a HK$2.3 billion profit in 2015.  Among China's largest mobile phone makers in 2013, Shenzhen-based Coolpad was ranked No.14 in the first quarter of 2017, according to research firm Canalys. Analysts say the top players, such as Huawei [HWT.UL], Oppo and Vivo, in China's fiercely contested smartphone market will take more share away from smaller vendors this year.  Coolpad shares dropped 10 percent over the first quarter and were at HK$0.72 before trading was suspended.

The loading of oil shipments from Europe and the Americas to Asia tapered off in June after surging between March and May, but the recent price slump is pushing Asian buyers and traders to once again turn to the North Sea Forties grade of oil and to U.S. crude. Some traders hope the value of cargoes will increase during the time spent en route to Asia, with a possible upcoming climb in prices indicated by October ICE Brent futures this month rising as much as 70 cents per barrel above the prompt month August contract LCOc1-LCOc3.  We know people are taking WAF (West African) and North Sea,  said a trader with a North Asian refiner, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. A widening of Brent's premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to almost $3 a barrel earlier this month has particularly buoyed the appeal of moving U.S. oil to Asia CL-LCO1=R. Japanese refiners JXTG and Cosmo Energy have bought U.S. cargoes that will arrive in September, trade sources said, ahead of the winter season when power demand jumps as people crank up electric heating. JXTG has purchased 1 million barrels of the Mars grade of crude, while Cosmo has bought a mixture of WTI Midland and Domestic Sweet (DSW) blend, those sources said. Both companies declined to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, traders expect 2 million to 4 million barrels of North Sea Forties to load in July and arrive in South Korea from the end of August to early September. Elsewhere, the release of a second batch of Chinese crude import quotas has also spurred sellers to bring more oil to Asia, said an analyst at a trading company. And shipping data shows that ExxonMobil, which operates a refinery in Thailand, chartered the Aframax Astro Saturn to take U.S. crude from Corpus Christi, Texas to Sri Racha, Thailand for end-July arrival.  U.S. crude has high potential. We want to diversify our supply sources (and are interested),  an official from a Southeast Asian refiner said, adding that it was keen on both light-sweet and medium-sour crude but not the DSW blend because of quality issues.

The report also called for a representative body be set up to advise parliament on indigenous matters. Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2.8 percent of the 24.5 million population but have disproportionately high rates of suicide and incarceration, ranking near the bottom in almost every economic and social indicator. Denied the vote until the mid-1960s, they face a 10-year gap in life expectancy compared with other Australians and make up 27 percent of the prison population. The United Nations has criticized their living standards. Australia's constitution currently makes no reference to the indigenous population and aboriginal leaders have struggled for generations to gain recognition for past injustices since European colonization in the 1700s. The government only issued a formal apology to indigenous people in 2008. Aboriginal leader Joe Morrison said the report provided a  guide to the country's politicians on how to amend the constitution to include indigenous recognition.  Getting the report is one thing, but the prime minister has got to provide the requisite leadership in responding to the matter now put to him and do it in a bipartisan way,  Morrison told Reuters. The exact contents of the report have not been made public and the government declined to immediately comment. But Friday's report builds on a constitutional convention last month at Uluru, a sacred aboriginal site and iconic sandstone monolith in the country's outback, where indigenous delegates called for  substantive constitutional change .     Delegates also called for an advisory voice in parliament, and the creation of treaties between the government and indigenous people which could eventually form the basis of reparations for past injustices. Constitutional recognition of Aborigines is a complex issue in a country where Aborigines only began to be included on population census figures after a referendum to amend the constitution in 1967. Constitutional change requires a national referendum which must be passed by a majority of votes and a majority of Australia's six states. Most referendums fail.  If a great deal is asked for, there is always a danger that the referendum won’t go through,  said political historian David Black, warning a referendum to include Aborigines in the constitution could alienate large sections of the population.  And if the referendum is held and doesn't pass, that would be disastrous for relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.

Syndicated loan volumes in the region (ex-Japan) tumbled 25% in the first six months of 2017 to US$184.83bn from US$248bn in the same period last year. The prolonged slump in lending activity in Asia led to the region’s worst performance since 2012 after Chinese authorities introduced restrictions on outbound foreign investment. Political event risks such as Britain’s exit from the European Union and impending elections in key countries on the continent added to the uncertainty, and as a result event-driven financings from Asia plummeted 60% to US$13.21bn in the first half, from US$33.22bn in the same period a year earlier. Blockbuster outbound M&As; in 2016 made a significant contribution to Asian loan volumes. Unsurprisingly their absence has caused lending to drop significantly, with China’s overall tally falling sharply by 47.5% to US$45.14bn in the first half this year from nearly US$86bn in the corresponding period last year.  2016 was an exceptional year for M&A; financing activity in the loan market, led by China, as a result of a number of jumbo-sized acquisitions boosting volumes. 2017 has seen a return to more normal levels of activity, with Chinese corporates less acquisitive given increased government scrutiny and implemented controls” said Cristian Jonsson, global head of loan syndications at Standard Chartered. The slowdown in China also filtered through to neighbouring Hong Kong, where loan volume declined 8% in the first half to US$53.45bn from US$58bn in the first six months of 2016. Event-driven financings from the territory plunged to US$1.96bn from nearly US$6bn clocked last year. The former British colony, which marks its 20th anniversary on July 1 under Chinese rule, is a key financing hub for China Inc, and this helped it become the biggest loan market in Asia (ex-Japan) this year. This was largely due to big-ticket loans from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , its unit Ant Financial Services Group and internet behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd that raised US$13.3bn combined this year. While some of the top-tier privately-owned enterprises such as Alibaba met with a good reception from the market, troubles at other borrowers such as China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co Ltd , the country’s largest integrated dairy, and China Hongqiao Group Ltd, the world’s largest aluminium producer, raised concerns among lenders. Huishan has had its shares suspended from trading since March 24 and its banks have called an event of default on the company’s debut US$200m three-year loan signed in October 2015. Hongqiao won a waiver until June 30 to a breach of covenants relating to its publication of financials and suspension of trading in its shares. Countering China’s slowdown was Indonesia, which skyrocketed 148% to US$9.07bn in the first half of 2017 from US$3.65bn last year. This was largely due to a US$3.355bn financing for the 2,000MW Tanjung Jati B coal-fired power plant in central Java that closed in February as well as a US$660m acquisition financing in May for a Star Energy Group-led consortium’s purchase of Chevron’s geothermal assets in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Australia received a boost from M&A; loans as its overall tally closed at US$32.63bn, surging 10.4% from the US$29.55bn raised in the first half of 2016. Event-driven loans totalled around US$7bn with the bulk of it coming from privatisations in New South Wales state, including a A$5.9bn (US$4.5bn) loan clubbed between 18 lenders for power grid Endeavour Energy. LBO REVIVAL? The Aussie market also produced a sprinkling of decent-sized leveraged buyout loans pointing to a revival of this segment of financing with green shoots emerging around new financing structures and market participants. “A reasonably-sized market is developing in Australia for domestic currency term loan B financings and unitranche structures, which, along with a growing pool of institutional investors, bodes well for leveraged buyouts and financings,” said John Corrin, global head of loan syndications at ANZ. A slew of LBO loans elsewhere in the region is encouraging for the market with bankers optimistic for the rest of the year. Among the eye-catching transactions brewing are a giant buyout for Singapore-listed Global Logistic Properties Ltd that could lead to a LBO loan of up to US$10bn, including record senior and mezzanine pieces. A debt financing of nearly US$2bn is expected for the buyout of Hutchison Global Communications Ltd, the wholly owned fixed-line unit of Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. Another high-profile LBO loan is the HK$28bn (US$3.6bn) financing for the privatisation of Hong Kong-listed Chinese shoe retailer shoe retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd , which has already received commitments from nine banks other than sole bookrunner Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We expect a stronger second half on the back of more robust acquisition and event-driven deal flow across Asia Pacific. The strong regional liquidity among banks and institutional investors is expected to enable companies and financial sponsors to carry out larger acquisitions,” said Ashish Sharma, head of loan syndications, Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse. “There are early signs of a better pipeline emerging after a stop-start first half. What we need to see is more broad-based activity across the region, as opposed to being reliant on consistent deal flow from just a handful of markets,  said StanChart’s Jonsson.

Brazilian federal prosecutors in May last year served the joint partners in the Samarco iron ore mine with a 155 billion Brazilian real ($47 billion) claim to pay for the social, environmental and economic costs of cleaning up the country's worst environmental disaster.  The Court has extended the final date for negotiation of a settlement until 30 October 2017,  BHP said in a statement. Nineteen people died and nearby towns were inundated with flood waters after a dam designed to hold back mine waste burst on Nov. 5, 2015. The settlement date was originally set for June 30. BHP also said it had approved $174 million in financial support for the Renova Foundation, which was set up to help with the restoration of communities affected by the disaster. Additionally, BHP said it is making available a short-term loan of $76 million to Samarco to conduct remediation and stabilisation work. After the dam gave way, thick reddish-brown sludge flowed into the Rio Doce, one of Brazil's main rivers, killing fish and fouling water supplies for hundreds of kilometres (miles) before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Brazilian prosecutors in October charged 21 people with murder on for their roles in the tragedy.  There were signs that the dam was unsafe for several years before its collapse, Brazilian prosecutors argued last year. The prosecutors said Samarco officials, executives, employees and board members appointed by Vale and BHP failed to take proper action. BHP also said it was unlikely to mine would restart this year because of the time required to win federal government approval, licenses from state authorities and to restructure Samarco's debt.

The Philippines-flagged container ship ACX Crystal and the U.S. warship collided at night just south of Tokyo Bay on June 17. The U.S. deaths were the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed by militants in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000. No one was hurt on the cargo ship. At least six investigations are being carried out, including two U.S. Navy internal hearings and one by the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The Philippines government is also conducting an investigation. The U. S. Coast Guard, which is investigating on behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board, has interviewed the crew of the container ship. But the U.S. navy official, who declined to be identified, said warships were afforded sovereign immunity under international law and foreign investigators were not expected to get access to the U.S. crew.  It's unlikely Japanese or Philippine authorities will have direct access to crew members,  said the U.S. official. The U.S. Coast Guard would instead provide summaries of crew interviews to the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB), which would share them with the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), he said. Declining access may be viewed by Japanese investigators as falling short of a pledge made by Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin of full cooperation in the investigation.  We have asked for access to the U.S. ship and its crew and can't proceed until we hear back from the U.S. Navy,  said a spokesman for the JTSB. He said he was unaware that the U.S. side was likely to turn down the request. A Seventh Fleet spokesman said the navy would  share information in accordance with protocols.  In the first detailed account from someone involved in the accident, the ACX Crystal's captain, in a report seen by Reuters, said his ship signaled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights about 10 minutes before the collision, but the U.S. ship did not respond or alter course. The Fitzgerald will enter dry dock at its home port in Yokosuka, Japan, where engineers will assess damage and patch it up in preparation for a return to the United States for full repairs.  We are still working through the timing and how the ship will get there,  the Seventh Fleet spokesman said.

Coolpad has repeatedly delayed reporting the results because of audit issues since March, when the annual report was due. Trading in its shares have been suspended since then.  The company needs more time to provide information requested by auditors of its annual report regarding  rationale and business substances of various prepayments and/or loans made by the company as well as going concerns , Chairman Yueting Jia said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Jia, who founded the LeEco group, is Coolpad's largest shareholder with a 28.83 percent stake.  Jia has been fighting financial troubles at various units of the conglomerate with businesses spanning from entertainment to electric cars. He said this week that cash crunch at LeEco was worse than expected and needed additional funding. In Friday's filing, Coolpad said it had received a letter from the exchange setting out conditions for the stock to resume trading, which included publishing the results, conducting investigations to address audit issues and disclosing relevant information so investors could appraise the firm's position. It said it was taking steps to fulfil the conditions, but did not provide any timeline.    In May, Coolpad published unaudited results that showed the company flipped to a loss of HK$4.23 billion ($542 million) for 2016, from a HK$2.3 billion profit in 2015.  Among China's largest mobile phone makers in 2013, Shenzhen-based Coolpad was ranked No.14 in the first quarter of 2017, according to research firm Canalys. Analysts say the top players, such as Huawei [HWT.UL], Oppo and Vivo, in China's fiercely contested smartphone market will take more share away from smaller vendors this year.  Coolpad shares dropped 10 percent over the first quarter and were at HK$0.72 before trading was suspended.

It gained around 0.2 percent against the euro in early trade in Europe, but was still down almost 9 percent on the quarter and 2 percent this week alone. Compared with Thursday's U.S. close against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength it was steady. But it fell 0.2 percent against the yen. With investors having shifted aggressively to price in rate rises in the months ahead by a number of major central banks, data and several policy meetings over the next fortnight will be crucial, with Canadian GDP data a focus on Friday. Helped by a recovery in oil, the Canadian dollar has pulled back to less than C$1.30 to its U.S. counterpart for the first time since January as investors priced in a 70 percent chance of a rise in rates on July 12.  Odds for a 2017 BoC hike have ramped up considerably in recent days and this has been a major prop for the Loonie,  said LMAX Exchange analyst Joel Kruger.  This week’s healthy recovery in (oil) has provided another excuse to pile into Canadian Dollar longs. There is every reason to expect another active session today.  As well as the growth data, Canadian banks including RBC pointed to the need for the Bank of Canada's Business Survey to support the positive rhetoric of officials in the past fortnight, if the Canadian dollar was to hold onto its gains. Sterling has also breached $1.30 this week and was holding around that level on Friday, with a hike in interest rates by December now 70 percent priced in. Current account deficit numbers will offer a different focus on Friday, with analysts expecting another softer number that points to some balancing of Britain's huge external deficit thanks to the weaker pound.  This data release adds extra impetus to the debate between the structural sterling bears and the cyclical sterling bulls,  HSBC analysts said in a note to clients.  A wide current account deficit reinforces the argument that further GBP weakness is needed on a structural basis. We believe GBP is structural and that the fall in GBP is necessary.

The Philippines-flagged container ship ACX Crystal and the U.S. warship collided at night just south of Tokyo Bay on June 17. The U.S. deaths were the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed by militants in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000. No one was hurt on the cargo ship. At least six investigations are being carried out, including two U.S. Navy internal hearings and one by the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The Philippines government is also conducting an investigation. The U. S. Coast Guard, which is investigating on behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board, has interviewed the crew of the container ship. But the U.S. navy official, who declined to be identified, said warships were afforded sovereign immunity under international law and foreign investigators were not expected to get access to the U.S. crew.  It's unlikely Japanese or Philippine authorities will have direct access to crew members,  said the U.S. official. The U.S. Coast Guard would instead provide summaries of crew interviews to the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB), which would share them with the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), he said. Declining access may be viewed by Japanese investigators as falling short of a pledge made by Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin of full cooperation in the investigation.  We have asked for access to the U.S. ship and its crew and can't proceed until we hear back from the U.S. Navy,  said a spokesman for the JTSB. He said he was unaware that the U.S. side was likely to turn down the request. A Seventh Fleet spokesman said the navy would  share information in accordance with protocols.  In the first detailed account from someone involved in the accident, the ACX Crystal's captain, in a report seen by Reuters, said his ship signaled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights about 10 minutes before the collision, but the U.S. ship did not respond or alter course. The Fitzgerald will enter dry dock at its home port in Yokosuka, Japan, where engineers will assess damage and patch it up in preparation for a return to the United States for full repairs.  We are still working through the timing and how the ship will get there,  the Seventh Fleet spokesman said.

CDSL's stellar debut comes after its IPO raised 5.2 billion rupees ($80.4 million) in India's most heavily over-subscribed offering this year - one that analysts say had been attractively priced. CDSL, majority-owned by bourse operator BSE Ltd, competes with only National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) in securities deposit services. It has a 43 percent market share.  Given the high entry barriers and with not many competitors, I see a lot of growth potential in that area and also expect their earnings performance to be good,  said Siddharth Purohit, senior research analyst at Angel Broking. India's benchmark BSE index has notched up a string of record highs to be up 15.7 percent this year and long-term demand for the firms' services is expected to grow as households shift some savings to financial markets. Brokerage LKP estimated only around 9 percent of total household savings are invested in financial assets, well below the double digits seen in other countries such as the United States. CDSL shares were up 77.2 percent at 266.30 rupees by 0737 GMT on the National Stock Exchange, compared with their IPO price of 149 rupees. Its IPO was over-subscribed by almost 170 times, surpassing the 105 times seen in Avenue Supermarts Ltd's IPO in March. India's IPO market has boomed this year, with companies raising more than $2 billion so far this year, on pace to match the $4 billion raised in 2016. Benefiting from a rally in equity and debt markets, CDSL's operating profit jumped 24 percent to 795 million rupees in the year ended in March.

The second attack did not affect Ukraine's power network, Vsevolod Kovalchuk told a news briefing on Friday. Ukrenergo was an early victim of a cyber attack that began in Ukraine and spread around the world on Tuesday, knocking out thousands of machines, shutting down ports, factories and offices as it hit around 60 countries.  The virus was slightly different, of a different nature, similar to WannaCry,  Kovalchuk said about the second attack.  The effect from it was insignificant, as some computers remained offline.  WannaCry was the name of a global ransomware attack that struck in May. Speaking about Tuesday's computer virus, Kovalchuk said that, according to preliminary data, it was activated during a software upgrade. Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts. A growing consensus among security researchers, armed with technical evidence, suggests the main purpose of the attack was to install new malware on computers at government and commercial organisations in Ukraine. Rather than extortion, the goal may be to plant the seeds of future sabotage, experts said.

The revised tax structure will kick in from midnight Friday, marking India's biggest tax reform since independence, unifying its $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a common market. Weakness in Asian peers following losses on Wall Street overnight also hurt sentiment. The MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.7 percent.  There is some kind of profit-booking and sideways consolidation in the market, so most sectors are volatile,  said Siddharth Sedani, head and vice president, equity advisory at Anand Rathi. The broader NSE index was down 0.12 percent at 9,492.35 as of 0702 GMT, on track to post its third week of losses. The index was down 1.4 percent for the month, snapping a five-month winning streak. The benchmark BSE index was 0.14 percent lower at 30,815.72. The index was down 1.03 percent for the week and 1.04 percent for the month. Auto makers were among the top losers on worries that GST would push up prices of cars and lead to a decline in sales. The Nifty Auto index lost as much as 0.9 percent, with Tata Motors Ltd falling as much as 1.6 percent. IndiGo owner InterGlobe Aviation Ltd slid as much as 5.7 percent after falling 2.2 percent on Thursday after the company expressed interest in buying a stake in Air India after the government approved plans to privatise the debt-laden state-owned carrier. Central Depository Services (India) Ltd surged as much as 80 percent on its trading debut, after raising 5.2 billion rupees ($80.43 million) in the country's most heavily over-subscribed initial public offering this year.

The reduction came as the world's few other central banks signalled that they are likely to scale back their stimulus in light of an improving economy. The BOJ bought 24.4 trillion yen ($217.8 billion) of JGBs in the three months to June, down from 27.1 trillion yen in the previous quarter and the smallest amount since the July-September period of 2014, when it bought 19.0 trillion yen. Policymakers from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada all signalled this week that they are looking to tighten their policies. On the other hand, the BOJ has not dropped any such hints and the expansion of its balance sheet looks set to continue in the foreseeable future. The Japanese central bank has said it was still aiming to increase its bond holding by about 80 trillion yen per year, even after it introduced its  yield curve control  policy last September. Still, the pace of the increase in its JGB holding has already slowed to about 70 trillion yen by last month and looks set to fall to around 60 trillion yen by the end of year if the current pace of buying continues. The BOJ's balance sheet hit the 500 trillion yen mark last month and looks set to overtake Japan's GDP within a year, raising some questions about the sustainability of its massive buying. $1 = 112.02 yen Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-boj-bonds-idUSL3N1JR2UE"},

The second attack did not affect Ukraine's power network, Vsevolod Kovalchuk told a news briefing on Friday. Ukrenergo was an early victim of a cyber attack that began in Ukraine and spread around the world on Tuesday, knocking out thousands of machines, shutting down ports, factories and offices as it hit around 60 countries.  The virus was slightly different, of a different nature, similar to WannaCry,  Kovalchuk said about the second attack.  The effect from it was insignificant, as some computers remained offline.  WannaCry was the name of a global ransomware attack that struck in May. Speaking about Tuesday's computer virus, Kovalchuk said that, according to preliminary data, it was activated during a software upgrade. Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts. A growing consensus among security researchers, armed with technical evidence, suggests the main purpose of the attack was to install new malware on computers at government and commercial organisations in Ukraine. Rather than extortion, the goal may be to plant the seeds of future sabotage, experts said.

The blue-chip CSI300 index ON Friday fell 0.1 percent, to 3,666.80 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,192.43 points. For the week, CSI300 gained 1.2 percent and SSEC rose 1.1 percent. For the month, CSI300 gained 4.9 percent, its best month since November, while SSEC was up 2.4 percent. For the quarter, CSI300 advanced 6.1 percent and SSEC lost 0.9 percent. Chinese fund managers have turned more upbeat as headwinds that had pressured domestic markets eased, according to a monthly Reuters poll. U.S. index provider MSCI's has agreed to add 222 China-listed large-cap stocks to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion. And the index could raise its weighting of China A-shares, potentially adding 195 mid-sized stocks. China's factories grew at the quickest pace in three months in June, buoyed by strong new orders in a sign of stabilising growth, though analysts expect a further slowdown is inevitable as Beijing cracks down on debt risks.

At a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House this week, Trump said the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including new major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. The effort is part of Trump's policy of seeking to assert power abroad through a boost in natural gas, coal and petroleum exports. He said on Thursday that the  golden era  of the U.S. energy business was now underway.  But any new LNG agreements with India will depend on how GAIL (GAIL.NS) and Cheniere (LNG.A) of the United States deal with a long-term supply contract signed in 2011 for an estimated $22 billion. India's GAIL has deals to buy 5.8 million tonnes of U.S. LNG per annum for 20 years, mostly with Cheniere, but is now asking to re-negotiate the price. A commissioning cargo was sent last year, but supplies in earnest will only likely start in 2018. Two sources at state-run GAIL said they were trying to re-negotiate the contract.  At current U.S. prices, the landed cost of the LNG (in India) is not very attractive,  said one of the sources on condition of anonymity, as he was not cleared to speak to media. Neither source gave any details on what price GAIL was seeking.  We are trying a mix of options on pricing, and re-negotiating is one of them,  the source said.  My perception is that the talks with Cheniere in this regard are not very likely to succeed.  Officially, GAIL has declined comment on the row. Cheniere, currently the only U.S. company exporting LNG, said it was not open to a lower price.  Our customers expect us to deliver on our commitments, and we expect the same. This is a signed long-term contract that we believe will provide long-term value and we expect the contract to be adhered to,  said Eben Burnham-Snyder, a spokesman at Cheniere.  The contract price is calculated on a formula based on U.S. spot prices for natural gas, and currently costs India $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).  Traders said that Cheniere would struggle to send cargoes at a lower price. Gail Under Pressure Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS, which exclude all extra costs like shipping, have fallen by more than 40 percent this year to $5.40 per mmBtu amid ballooning oversupply as production from Australia and the United States rises. R.K. Garg, head of finance at Petronet LNG (PLNG.NS), India's biggest gas importer, told Reuters that at current oil prices, long-term gas contracts were being offered at $6-7 per mmBtu. Mangesh Patankar, head of business development at energy consultancy Galway Group, said that GAIL was trying for lower prices because the company was struggling to sell contracted U.S. LNG on to end-users in India, who are demanding cheaper gas from GAIL themselves.     A lot of the (LNG) buyers are doing that right now. With the ramp up in Australia and U.S. volumes, and demand being not that active in the end-user market, a lot of the buyers have had to do that,  he said. Other LNG buyers, including top importer Japan, are also pressing for better terms.  Washington has been using LNG as a diplomatic and political tool. Although sales are a commercial matter, Washington has been laying foundations for contracts with key buyers, including China.  Trump has made LNG exports a central part of his trade policy, aimed at reviving industry and creating jobs. Asian markets account for about 70 percent of global LNG shipments, and India is one of the fastest-growing importers. Trump will be visiting Poland next week and plans to promote U.S. LNG exports at a meeting in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe.

State-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has promised to meet only around 78 percent of demand in the year to end-March 2018, prompting Indian Railways to escalate the problem to the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, communications between the railways and the steel ministry show. The shortfall means upgrades of the accident-prone network could move at a slower pace than the five years initially planned, and underscores the problems facing Modi as he tries to modernize India's infrastructure. Supplies of rails are only expected to improve next year.  (The) ambitious programme of capacity augmentation undertaken by railways and track renewal, the foremost priority in the recently created (railway safety fund) ... crucially hinges on the supply of rail,  Railways Board Chairman A.K. Mital wrote in a letter to Steel Secretary Aruna Sharma on May 19.  Unless SAIL steps up supply, the whole programme will be at risk.  The state rail operator is in the middle of a $130 billion, five-year overhaul to modernise the world's fourth-biggest network. The government in February launched an additional $15 billion fund to tackle a 25 percent rise in train accidents due to track defects over the past two years. Loss-making SAIL, whose revival is being managed by the steel ministry, supplied about 620,000 tonnes of rails in the fiscal year to end-March, well short of demand of 1 million tonnes. In a meeting called by Modi's office on Feb. 14, SAIL told the railways that supplies would fall well short of demand this fiscal year too, according to the letter. For 2017/18, it has committed to provide 1.14 million tonnes, against a request for 1.46 million tonnes as demand ramps up to meet the safety programme. This represents about 78 percent, but the rate of supplies for the first two months suggested SAIL would struggle to meet even its own reduced target, Mital said in the letter.  The shortfall needs to be made good quickly and supply rate accelerated to meet the committed quantity (for this fiscal year),  Mital wrote. SAIL and Modi's office did not respond to requests seeking comment. The railways had no immediate comment and Mital did not respond to a request for comment. Sail Monopoly Indian Railways have considered ending SAIL's monopoly on supplying rail, but Modi's cabinet in May made the use of local steel mandatory for government infrastructure projects, ruling out the use of imports. Local firm Jindal Steel and Power Ltd has tried for years to win a rail supply contract, but is battling a long-standing preference by Indian policymakers for state companies over private firms for big-ticket government projects. Executives at SAIL, which has lost money in the last seven quarters, have said a surge in demand to replace old tracks and lay new ones meant it was struggling to meet supply targets, despite a rise in production from its existing plant. Steel secretary Sharma wrote to SAIL on May 29, in a letter seen by Reuters, noting that the railway upgrade was a  very important national project  and that  any shortfall in rail supplies to this project would be taken seriously . Sharma told Reuters a new SAIL mill at Bhilai, in eastern India, will help the steelmaker boost capacity, which should ease the rails deficit. SAIL has targeted total capacity of 2 million tonnes per year from its Bhilai plant.  We are conscious about the concerns of the railway ministry but we have enough rail manufacturing capabilities within the country,  she said.

Clayton Kershaw struck out 12 over seven innings to earn his major-league-best 12th win, lifting the Dodgers to a 6-2 win Thursday night at Angel Stadium. The win allowed the Dodgers to split the four games, each team winning one of two in its home ballpark. Kershaw (12-2) posted his second-highest total strikeout total of the season, and he walked two while making 93 pitches. He gave up just three hits and an unearned run. While Kershaw's influence seemed to keep the game relatively drama-free, things got interesting after he left. The Angels had already scored a run in the bottom of the eighth to pull within 6-2, and they had runners on first and third with one out when Dodgers reliever Brandon Morrow hit Yunel Escobar on the left shoulder with a pitch. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at AngelsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchEscobar said something and pointed to his own dugout before having words with Morrow, which resulted in the benches and bullpens emptying. After a few minutes, things calmed down, and the Angels' rally was snuffed out. Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen got the final out of the eighth inning with the bases loaded before closing out the ninth for his 18th save. Angels manager Mike Scioscia didn't seem to have a problem with Morrow's pitch, noting the situation at the time.  (Escobar) felt they came inside, but it's a strange situation to hit somebody and bring the tying run to the plate, so it's tough to see what the intent was,  Scioscia said.  But there's always chirping going on in the game, and no doubt they were trying to come inside, whether it was trying to get in on his swing or try to move him off the plate.  The  chirping  Scioscia spoke of might have had to do with Escobar acting annoyed as he went to first after Kershaw walked him for the second time in the game back in the sixth inning. However, Morrow said he knew nothing of it.  The umpire mentioned maybe a minor interaction between him and Kersh earlier on a walk, but from the bullpen, we can't see that stuff,  Morrow said.  Obviously, it wouldn't be a good situation to put somebody on base right there.  Kershaw laughed when asked about Escobar's reaction to being hit.  I don't know, I get it, you're mad about being hit,  Kershaw said.  But read the room a little bit, and realize we weren't trying to hit you. It's all right.  Kershaw got help from the Dodgers' offense, which smashed three home runs, including what was essentially a game-clinching, three-run blast by Joc Pederson in the sixth inning. Yasiel Puig and Chase Utley each hit solo shots, and all three homers came off Angels starter JC Ramirez. The home runs increased the Dodgers' total to 50 in June, the most in a calendar month in franchise history.  We've got guys with a ton of pop,  Kershaw said.  Up and down the lineup, you saw Trayce (Thompson) last night, hitting ninth, hit a ball 500 feet. We've got guys that you can't really make a mistake to and think you're going to get away with a single. And knowing from experience, it's not fun, knowing that any mistake can leave the yard at any time.  Ramirez was not only knocked around figuratively by the Dodgers bats, but he also was literally knocked out of the game when a sixth-inning line drive by Puig struck him on the right hip. Ramirez (7-6) gave up all six Dodgers runs (five earned) on seven hits and one walk in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out three. The only run the Angels scored against Kershaw came after a fourth-inning error by left fielder Thompson led to an RBI fielder's choice by Albert Pujols.  He pitched really well, you're not going to get too many looks at him,  Scioscia said of Kershaw.  He didn't make a lot of mistakes, and we didn't square too many balls up. Our club doesn't strike out very much, but I think we struck out 15 times tonight, which is odd for us.  NOTES: Dodgers SS Corey Seager returned to the starting lineup after missing five games with a sore right hamstring. He initially hurt the hamstring last Friday against the Rockies. Batting No. 2 in the order Thursday, Seager went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts before being replaced by INF Enrique Hernandez in the seventh inning. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said that Seager would not start Friday's game against San Diego in an effort to ease him back into the lineup. ... Angels SS Andrelton Simmons did not play, getting a day off for rest. He had started 81 of the Angels' 82 games at shortstop before Thursday. Simmons is hitting .316 (56-for-177) over his past 45 games, and his eight home runs are the second most he has hit in a season. He had 17 for Atlanta in 2014. INF Cliff Pennington started at shortstop and committed an error that led to a run.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6UCIBJ1L"},

While 30 of the Topix's 33 subsectors were in negative territory, tech names in particular underperformed after a sharp sell-off in the Nasdaq overnight soured sentiment. The Nikkei dropped 0.9 percent to finish at 20,033.43, after earlier falling to as low as 19,946.51 - the weakest level since June 16 and just above a key technical support from Ichimoku Kijun line at 19,944. On the month, it rose 1.9 percent, the third straight month of gains. For the quarter, it has gained 5.9 percent. In Friday's trading recent gainers bore the brunt of selling, with Nintendo slipping 2.8 percent and Sony 1.8 percent. Some other tech shares were sold, with Advantest Corp tumbling 2.1 percent and Panasonic Corp shedding 1.7 percent. The Nikkei volatility index jumped to 15.75, hitting its highest level since late May. Equity investors are concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, as a drumbeat of hawkish comments from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada prompted investors to review their scenarios.  Stock markets around the world have been supported by ultra-loose monetary policy by their central banks, so the signs of reversing are frightening investors,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.  With these central banks hinting at tightening, the next question will likely be to the Bank of Japan asking whether and when it will start discussing exit strategy.  On Friday, data showed that Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and offering the central bank some hope a strengthening economy will gradually lift inflation toward its ambitious 2 percent target. The broader Topix dropped 0.8 percent to 1,611.90. Dollar-based MSCI Japan rose 1.2 percent on the month and 5.3 percent on the quarter, outperfoming the MSCI ACWI of the world's 46 markets. On the other hand, the index of Japanese real estate investment trusts (REITs) fell to a 16-month low, partly on worries about rise in global interest rates.

Also, some participants likely wanted to sell and lighten their positions and reduce exposure to potential risk before the weekend.  The BOJ will disclose the details of its buying operations in each zone for next month at 17:00 JST (0800 GMT). The BOJ kept its ranges intact in June, after trimming the amount of shorter-dated JGBs it bought compared with previous months in May and April. With a list of negative factors dogging JGBs, there were more sellers than anticipated for the BOJ's offer on Friday to buy 450 billion yen ($4 billion) of five- to 10-year bonds, usually interpreted as a bearish market sign.

North Korea underscored that fact Tuesday when it launched an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to Alaska.   Trump must accept the evidence that sanctions and military shows of force do not move the North. Moon, who met with Trump last Friday, must accept that a “sunshine” policy of economic and political outreach will not coax Pyongyang from its nuclear tether as long as Kim Jong Un equates the arsenal with survival.  Washington also should take military action off the table unless the crisis is so acute that no other option remains. North Korea has advanced its nuclear program too far and concealed too much to allow Israeli-style air strikes like those that eliminated the Iraqi and Syrian nuclear reactors in 1981 and 2007. The mayhem that would result from any U.S. military invasion to find and destroy Pyongyang’s bombs would envelop most of the Korean peninsula and could leave in its wake hundreds of thousands of dead South Koreans.  Fortunately, the history of the nuclear age suggests an alternative. Containment.   MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Dan DePetris: Trump should go easy on N. Korea over Warmbier death Judy Lubin: The biggest victims of the Senate health bill (and other Trump plans) Containment is hard work. To succeed, it needs three elements.  One is deterrence.  When tensions rose between nuclear powers like the United States and the Soviet Union or India and Pakistan, the risk of nuclear armageddon proved to be an overwhelming impediment to pushing the button. The lesson for the Korean peninsula is that the United States should return to South Korea the nuclear weapons Washington withdrew in 1991, but if that’s implausible politically, declare a firm policy - backed by dedicated offshore nuclear forces - that the United States will eliminate the North if it uses nukes or makes a serious nuclear threat.  The second is adopting Cold War-era confidence building measures to further reduce the risk of war.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un smiles as he guides a test fire of a new multiple launch rocket system in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 4, 2016.KCNA/File PhotoThe measures could take the form of adding the United States to a resurrected North-South hotline - permitting instant communication between the Koreas and Washington. U.S. and North Korean liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang would be even better. Verifiable reductions of troops and heavy weapons on both sides of the border would reduce concerns about surprise attack, as would reductions of large U.S.-South Korean military exercises and North Korea military displays. The list can go in many directions. The United States could begin the exploratory process of tapping Pyongyang’s interest through China or other third parties.    The third is crisis management. It is hard to determine whether a North Korea with the bomb will be more or less prone to initiate incidents like the sinking of a South Korean navy ship to embarrass or intimidate Seoul. In the event a spark sets off serious tensions, it will be critical to stop escalation. Unlike the Cuban missile and 1969 Sino-Soviet cases, when surprise forced the adversaries to scramble for a plan, a crisis on the Korean peninsula should not be unexpected.  No doubt Washington and Seoul have military plans in place to respond. But judging from past nuclear crises, the United States may be less prepared diplomatically.    Here again Washington can draw lessons from the past.  A graphic shows the frequency of North Korea's missile and nuclear tests between 2006 and May 2017If a crisis appears to be moving out of control, Washington must have a mediator ready to go. The value of U.S. mediation in the Indo-Pakistan crises proved invaluable. When it comes to Kim Jong Un, Washington should consult with Beijing about preparations for China to serve as an intermediary if necessary.    Second, Trump and Moon could use private parties as conduits to float possible solutions. During the Cuban missile crisis, the Soviets used a U.S. businessman visiting Moscow and an ABC network correspondent in Washington as back channels. President Kennedy turned to his brother Robert to press Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.  In the case of Pyongyang, the United States could enlist former U.S. officials experienced in Track II diplomacy or even unofficially “allow” someone like a former president  - as Bill Clinton did with Jimmy Carter during the 1994 Yongbyon nuclear reactor crisis - to reach out to their own North Korean contacts.    Third, send a very senior official to the capital of the opponent to seek resolution. That’s what the Kremlin did in 1969 when it sent Premier Alexei Kosygin to Beijing in a last-ditch attempt to head off a possible Sino-Soviet confrontation. It worked.  The belief we can make nuclear North Korea go away is a mirage. The time for planning to live with it is upon us. Let’s get on with the task.    (Bennett Ramberg served as a policy analyst in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in the George H.W.

On June 29, after months of urban warfare and U.S. air strikes, Iraqi forces say they are on the verge of expelling the militants from their last holdouts in Mosul. “Their fictitious state has fallen,” an Iraqi general told state TV after troops captured a symbolically important mosque in Mosul’s old city. In Syria, U.S.-backed rebels are moving quickly through the eastern city of Raqqa, another capital of the self-proclaimed caliphate.  With the imminent fall of the last two urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost much of its territory. On June 21, the militants destroyed the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, where three years ago, as Islamic State swept across northern Iraq, the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a caliphate at Friday prayers.  The ruined mosque’s capture by Iraqi forces marks the most public symbol of the caliphate’s fall, but it does not mean the end of Islamic State or its reign of violence. The severe loss of territory in Syria and Iraq means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have contracted. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, secure weapons, raise funds through theft and extortion, and dispatch sympathizers to carry out attacks abroad. As it gets weaker on the ground, Islamic State has less to lose by unleashing attacks outside of Syria and Iraq.  In recent months, the jihadist group has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe, especially in Britain and France. On March 22, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. Two months later, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester. And on June 3, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a white van, ramming into pedestrians. They then emerged from the van with hunting knives and began stabbing people in nearby Borough Market. The attackers killed eight people and wounded dozens before police shot them.

In mid-June, Russian officials said they believed that they had killed Baghdadi in an airstrike that targeted a gathering of senior jihadists outside Raqqa. On July 11, the Syrian Observatory told Reuters it had  confirmed information  that Baghdadi was dead. The claims have not been confirmed, and Baghdadi was erroneously reported killed in the past.  But continued fighting and new attacks underscore that the group must have contingency plans in place to deal with the loss of its senior leadership.  A member of the Iraqi Federal Police throws a hand grenade at Islamic State militants in the Old Mosul, June 27, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniIndeed, it’s clear that Islamic State is already adopting the methods of a “leaderless jihad,” a strategy that al Qaeda tried to use with less success. For more than a year, Islamic State has inspired “lone wolf” attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These radicalized individuals are heeding the call of Islamic State leaders to use whatever methods they have at their disposal - trucks, cars, knives and axes - to carry out attacks that amplify the group’s reach. While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning - such as the coordinated November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people - it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.  These attacks allow Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses. They also signal that the group would revert to its roots as a jihadist insurgency, bent on large and small-scale attacks that instill fear but do little to help the militants keep control of territory in Syria and Iraq.  That’s not to say the loss of territory hasn’t weakened the group and caused some of its operations to fail. On June 19, a 31-year-old man rammed into a French police van on the Champs-Elysees in Paris with an improvised car bomb. The explosives failed to denote and the assailant was killed. A day later, a Moroccan national tried unsuccessfully to set off a suitcase bomb packed with nails and gas canisters inside the central train station in Brussels. Security forces killed the man.  During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2016, Islamic State urged its sympathizers to carry out a spate of bombings, mass shootings and stabbings across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. While the group called for a similar campaign during Ramadan this year, which ended on June 25, there were far fewer successful attacks.  Despite the amateurish nature of some recent attempts, cadres of militants who trained and fought with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have returned to Europe and are now able to train and radicalize others. “Several dozen people directed by [Islamic State] may be currently present in Europe with a capability to commit terrorist attacks,” the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol, warned in a report released in December. It added that the group “has proven to be very effective in inspiring people to commit terrorist acts and in setting attacks in motion themselves.”  Islamic State’s leaders realize that they are losing their “capitals” in Mosul and Raqqa. That means the group has squandered the caliphate that distinguished it from other jihadist movements, and helped it dominate headlines and attract new recruits. By relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized – and, in some cases, are mentally unstable – Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has. And it can continue to spread fear, even as its caliphate crumbles.  (Mohamad Bazzi is a journalism professor at New York University and former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday.

The spot rupee, which has been trading for the ninth straight session after being inactive for six weeks, was at 153.55/65 per dollar, as of 0550 GMT, hardly changed from Thursday's close of 153.50/60. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5 when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  There is a little bit of trading happening but not much of activities,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expected seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. Rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped defending it while the island nation faces a balance of payments crisis. The central bank is also compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet the reserve target set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme.

The body of Elise Dallemange, 30, was found in a jungle on Koh Tao island, where British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered on a beach in 2014. Police said Witheridge, 23, had been raped and bludgeoned to death and Miller 24, had suffered blows to his head. Thailand, famous for its beaches and cultural sites, is a regional tourist magnate and the tourism industry is a major income generator. Posts on social media this week said Dallemange had booked a ticket to Chumphon province, on the mainland, and that her luggage arrived after her death, implying that she had not intended to kill herself.  Police continue to look for new evidence, because it was an unnatural death, but we have not found any,  Police Colonel Preecha Kladsawad, deputy of Surat Thani police, said. The 2014 murders of the British backpackers prompted some local and foreign media to brand Koh Tao  murder island . Two migrant workers from Myanmar were arrested and sentenced to death after they were convicted of the crime in December 2015 - a move criticized by rights groups who say they were wrongfully convicted.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, showed retail sales rose by 0.5 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That was higher than the 0.3 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll and came after a fall of 0.2 percent in April. On the year, sales rose by 4.8 percent in May, almost double the Reuters consensus forecast for a 2.5 percent increase. Consumption has taken over exports as the main driver of growth, supported by a robust labour market and low interest rates. A survey on Thursday showed German consumer sentiment at its best in almost 16 years heading into July.

Singapore shares slid as much as 1.1 percent, dragged down by financials, but the index was set for its fifth straight quarter of gains.     Global equities took a hit when the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by saying that a rate hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. Two top policymakers at the Bank of Canada also suggested they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July.      Meanwhile, official data showed China's manufacturing sector expanded at the quickest pace in three months in June, but the upbeat factory growth figures had little impact on Southeast Asian traders.     Philippine shares fell as much as 0.7 percent to an over one-month low, although the index was on track to post its second consecutive quarter of gains.      SM Prime Holdings fell as much as 1.4 percent and SM Investment was down 0.8 percent.      Thai shares slid as much as 0.4 percent, with the benchmark index on track to snap a five-quarter winning streak with a marginal quarterly loss.      Thailand's headline consumer prices likely dropped for a second straight month in June, a Reuters poll showed, giving the central bank leeway to keep interest rates low to aid economic recovery.     Vietnam shares gained as much as 0.4 percent, with Vietnam Dairy Products JSC and Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp up 1.7 and 1 percent, respectively.

Bob Carr was foreign minister before becoming director of University of Technology, Sydney's (UTS) Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) in 2014. This month, Carr wrote to UTS researcher and prominent Communist Party critic Chongyi Feng complaining about Feng's public statements suggesting he was barred from the department. In his letter, Carr told Feng he had written to the university's vice chancellor  drawing his attention to your comments and pointing out ACRI has no record of any efforts by you to become involved .     ACRI has been in the spotlight since the Australian Broadcasting Corp and Fairfax Media reported this month that the Chinese billionaire who donated A$1.8 million to found the institute was being investigated by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) on suspicion of using political donations in Australia to seek influence on behalf of China. The donor, property developer Xiangmo Huang, was not available for comment. Huang has previously denied acting inappropriately. ASIO said it does not comment on individuals or operational details.  The ABC/Fairfax report, strongly criticized by China's ambassador to Australia, fueled concerns Beijing was using its growing influence to shift public opinion on sensitive policy issues and to stifle criticism.  In a statement to Reuters, ACRI said Huang had no involvement in the strategic direction of its budget, research or other programs.   The Institute is bound by UTS policies and procedures relating to academic integrity, independence and transparency.     ACRI said Carr had written to the vice chancellor to correct the record on Feng's assertions about his attempts to engage with the institute.  Feng has never been in contact with ACRI with any proposal to get involved in any capacity – to collaborate on research or events, or to set up a meeting,  ACRI said.   Feng, who now teaches communications, said he applied for a position at ACRI when it was starting up in 2014. An email reviewed by Reuters showed ACRI, in consultation with UTS, rejecting Feng for the role of academic director. Responding to Carr's letter, Feng told him of that application and how he  expressed my interests in working with ACRI in the areas of my expertise  when he met Carr in July 2014.  I don't know what they might do,  Feng told Reuters at his small UTS office, referring to university management.  I don't want any disciplinary action. I'm in a weak position. I'm not in my research (specialty) so I'm not that important. I'm very, very vulnerable.  A UTS spokesman said the university didn't comment on  internal matters, other than to reaffirm our support for an academic community where diverse views are allowed, and indeed encouraged, as part of a non-negotiable commitment to academic freedom of speech . Carr's letter to Feng showed the mounting pressure Australian universities were under to distance themselves from any suggestion their research was being influenced by a growing pool of private Chinese money, said John Fitzgerald, a professor at Swinburne University of Technology who specializes in China.   For a university, reputation really matters,  he said. Feng published dozens of papers criticizing the Communist Party's human rights record in his earlier roles as head of UTS's China studies for 11 years until 2006, then as deputy head of the university's China Research Center until it folded in about 2014.     Earlier this year while undertaking research in China, Feng was questioned and prevented from leaving the country for more than a week in order to  safeguard national security , according to Chinese officials.  Carr, who was in China at the time, has said he made representations on Feng's behalf. Feng told Reuters he believes he was released as a result of pressure from the international community as a result of media coverage.

I am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,  said one woman on Thursday at a Sam's Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia.  This looks tasty, worth a try,  she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price. Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits. China's beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the world's fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China. Perdue and U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad on Friday met with Chinese Agriculture Minister Han Changfu and Vice Premier Wang Yang. Branstad, who arrived in the capital this week to take up his post, said he hoped the return of U.S. beef would be one of several deals agreed under the 100-day trade talks between the world's top two economies. Other deals he would like to see signed would be to allow imports of more varieties of U.S. genetically modified corn and soybean and to finalise a deal on letting U.S. rice into the country.  We're very hopeful that what's been worked out so far is just the beginning of a significant growth in our trade relationship,  Branstad said at the meeting. Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sam's Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak.  American steak is delicious,  said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo service.  It doesn't have the mutton smell of domestic beef.  Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO, said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com, one of the country's biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the product's availability from mid-July. Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor. Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.com's meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said. Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijing's stringent import requirements. One Sam's Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling:  We should not only stick to foreign beef. They have food safety issues, like growth hormones and GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in the U.S.  $1 = 6.7791 Chinese yuan Reporting by Dominique Patton and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-beef-usa-idUSL3N1JR26H"},

Moller-Maersk two days ago, showing the scale of the damage a computer virus can unleash on the technology dependent and inter-connected industry. About 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, with ships and ports acting as the arteries of the global economy. Ports increasingly rely on communications systems to keep operations running smoothly, and any IT glitches can create major disruptions for complex logistic supply chains. The cyber attack was among the biggest-ever disruptions to hit global shipping. Several port terminals run by a Maersk division, including in the United States, India, Spain, the Netherlands, were still struggling to revert to normal operations on Thursday after experiencing massive disruptions. South Florida Container Terminal, for example, said dry cargo could not be delivered and no container would be received. Anil Diggikar, chairman of JNPT port, near the Indian commercial hub of Mumbai, told Reuters that he did not know  when exactly the terminal will be running smoothly . His uncertainty was echoed by Maersk itself, which told Reuters that a number of IT systems were still shut down and that it could not say when normal business operations would be resumed. It said it was not able to comment on specific questions regarding the breach of its IT systems or the state of its cyber security as it had  all available hands focused on practical stuff and getting things back to normal . The impact of the attack on the company has reverberated across the industry given its position as the world's biggest container shipping line and also operator of 76 ports via its APM Terminals division. Container ships transport much of the world's consumer goods and food, while dry bulk ships haul commodities including coal and grain and tankers carry vital oil and gas supplies.  As Maersk is about 18 percent of all container trade, can you imagine the panic this must be causing in the logistic chain of all those cargo owners all over the world?  said Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping, one of Thailand's largest dry cargo ship owners.  Right now none of them know where any of their cargoes (or)containers are. And this 'black hole' of lack of knowledge will continue till Maersk are able to bring back their systems on line.  Back to Basics The computer virus, which researchers are calling GoldenEye or Petya, began its spread on Tuesday in Ukraine and affected companies in dozens of countries. Maersk said the attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world. In an example of the turmoil that ensued, the unloading of vessels at the group's Tacoma terminal was severely slowed on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Dean McGrath, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 23 there. The terminal is a key supply line for the delivery of domestic goods such as milk and groceries and construction materials to Anchorage, Alaska.  They went back to basics and did everything on paper,  McGrath said. Ong Choo Kiat, President of U-Ming Marine Transport , Taiwan's largest dry bulk ship owner, said the fact Maersk had been affected rang alarm bells for the whole shipping industry as the Danish company was regarded as a leader in IT technology.  But they ended up one of the first few casualties. I therefore conclude that shipping is lagging behind other industries in term of cyber security,  he said.  How long will it take to catch up? I don't know. But recently all owners and operators are definitely more aware of the risk of cyber security and beginning to pay more attention to it.  In a leading transport survey by international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright published this week, 87 percent of respondents from the shipping industry believed cyber attacks would increase over the next five years - a level that was higher than counterparts in the aviation, rail and logistics industries. Vulnerable Apart from their reliance on computer systems, ships themselves are increasingly open to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), and they lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes, according to cyber security experts. There were no indications that GPS and other electronic navigation aids were affected by this week's attack, but security specialists say such systems are vulnerable to signal loss from deliberate jamming by hackers. Last year, South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after GPS signals were jammed by North Korea, which denied responsibility.  The Maersk attack raises our awareness of the vulnerability of shipping and ports to technological failure,  said Professor David Last, a previous president of Britain's Royal Institute of Navigation.  When GPS fails, ships' captains lose their principal means of navigation and much of their communications and computer links. They have to slow down and miss port schedules,  said Last, who is also a strategic adviser to the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland. A number of countries including the UK and the United States are looking into deploying a radar-based back up navigation system for ships called eLoran, but this will take time to develop. David Nordell, head of strategy and policy for the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace and Security Science, a London-based think-tank, said the global shipping and port industries were vulnerable to cyber attack because their operating technologies tend to be old.  It's certainly possible to imagine that two container ships, or, even worse, oil or gas tankers, could be hacked into colliding, resulting in loss of life and cargo, and perhaps total loss of the vessels,  Nordell said.  Carried out in a strategically sensitive location such as the Malacca Straits or the Bosphorus, a collision like this could block shipping for enough time to cause serious dislocations to trade.  Secretive Industry Cyber risks also pose challenges for insurance cover. In a particularly secretive industry, information about the nature of cyber attacks is still scarce, which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk, which means there are gaps in the insurance cover available.  There has been a lot of non-reporting (of breaches) on ships, and we're trying efforts where even if there could be anonymous reporting on a platform so we can start to get the information and the data,  said Andrew Kinsey, senior marine consultant at insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. There is also a gap in provision, because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies - which insure the ship itself - will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack.  The industry is just waking up to its vulnerability,  said Colin Gillespie, deputy director of loss prevention with ship insurer North.  Perhaps it is time for insurers, reinsurers, ship operators and port operators to sit down together and consider these risks in detail. A collective response is needed - we are all under attack.

Pens, contraceptives, lipstick, eye drops, opium, perfume and pets were among an unlikely list of items guests were banned from taking on a trip to a People's Liberation Army (PLA) base on Friday as part of activities to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from British to Chinese rule. Security officers were taking no chances as they offered invitation-only guests a rare glimpse of barracks life at the Shek Kong base in a lush corner of the New Territories that sits in the shadow of Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong's highest mountain. Umbrellas, a symbol of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were also banned but purple alternatives were provided. The roughly 1,500 guests were told to pull down their souvenir umbrellas, even as temperatures sweltered above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), when Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived to inspect a military parade. Security personnel also confiscated a pen, taxi receipts, a 4G dongle, water, mints and pain relief tablets and other medication from Reuters reporters. Several correspondents had their notebooks searched. A list of prohibited items provided to reporters ahead of the visit also included heroin, marijuana, psychotropic substances, sunscreen, cosmetics, microwave transmission equipment, animals and plants. Police were stationed on top of roadside cliffs leading to the base as helicopters circled overhead. Guests were treated to a military display that included Z8 helicopters, mobile air defence missile trucks and armoured cars as martial music drowned out the high-pitched song of cicadas. PLA soldiers also handed guests goody bags filled with camouflage hats, flags, water, biscuits, and a bun. Xi, who oversees the PLA in his role as head of the powerful Central Military Commission, arrived in a motorcade and inspected 20 squadrons of troops and more then 100 pieces of military equipment, as music blasted from loud speakers. While its precise numbers are unknown, foreign envoys and diplomats believe the PLA garrison in Hong Kong is made up of between 8,000-10,000 personnel, including infantry and special forces troops. The force is split between a network of barracks and facilities inherited from the British military in Hong Kong, as well as bases across the border in Guangdong, where its jet fighter planes are kept. The troops spend their time isolated on barracks strictly separated from the public.

The often-billed shopping paradise, with Asia's highest retail space per capita, has seen vacancy rates and rents near their weakest in at least six years - metrics which place its malls among the worst-performing of the region's bigger economies. Malls globally have long been countering Internet shopping by adding features not easily replicated online, such as cinemas and schools, but the impact of changing consumer trends is more pronounced in Singapore due to an oversupply of retail space. To make up for lost revenue, Singapore mall operators have doubled the space for food and beverage (F&B;) tenants compared with a decade ago to as much as 40 percent, analysts said, even though it is costly to refit units to accommodate kitchens, while rents can be lower than for fashion stores, for instance.  They are no longer 'shopping' malls,  said Desmond Sim, research head at real estate services firm CBRE in Singapore. They are adding more activity-based tenants and facilities that  provide a little bit more sustainability away from e-commerce . Real estate services firm JLL put F&B; space in Singapore malls at over 30 percent, compared with 23 percent in rival shopping destination Hong Kong and 10-15 percent in Europe. In September, M&G; Real Estate reopened its Compass One mall in the island's north-east with 33 percent of space allocated to F&B; outlets, from 20 percent before a year-long refurbishment.  F&B;, in Singapore, I will consider that as rather non-discretionary,  said Ng Chiang Ling, M&G; Real Estate's Asia chief executive.  So that was one of the key things - offer more F&B; (and) to offer more choices.  AsiaMalls also added eateries after refurbishing its Tiong Bahru Plaza and White Sands shopping centres, while Sim Lian Group gave F&B; about 30 percent when it opened Hillion Mall in February.  Regionally, other countries will definitely look at us in terms of our offerings, and we can be used as a reference as well,  said Singapore-based Diane Aw, head of retail services at property consultancy Colliers International. Giant Food Court Singapore has about 11.6 square feet of retail space per capita, showed data from JLL. That compared with Hong Kong's 11.5 square feet, Bangkok's 8.6 and Shanghai's 4.8. But its retail vacancy rate hit 8.4 percent in July-September, the highest since at least January-February 2011, government data showed, increasing the pressure to fill units.  Malls have been providing more room for negotiation compared with a few years back,  said Vincent Tan, managing director at Select Group, which runs Peach Garden and Texas Chicken restaurants.  We have been able to strike better deals with regard to rent.  To be sure, F&B; is just one means of countering a downturn, with others including loyalty programmes and technology to track shopping behaviour.  Malls will never go 100 percent F&B; - nobody wants to go to a giant food court,  said Christopher Tang, chief executive officer, Singapore, at developer Frasers Centrepoint Ltd .  It can be 35-40 percent. I'm not sure where the magic line is at the moment.

Investors were already increasingly wary about smaller stocks. Restoring trust will take stronger rules and better enforcement. More than a month ago, activist investor David Webb published an article titled  The Enigma Network: 50 stocks not to own . The market initially shrugged off his warning about the web of cross-holdings among some 50 stocks. Then investors abruptly dumped shares in of some of these firms on Tuesday for no clear reason. Graphic: Small cap indexes have underperformed Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index: reut.rs/2tw6EoR Some were already the subjects of warnings by the Securities and Futures Commission, the local regulator, that shareholdings had become highly concentrated. Others had absurdly high valuations. Civil engineering firm Luen Wong Group, for example, was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of over 800 when it received investment from China Environmental Energy Investment. Luen Wong shares dropped 90 percent during the crash. This builds on an existing trend. Investors have grown weary of small cap shares in Hong Kong and China. The index of small caps listed on Hong Kong’s main board is down 34 percent from a peak in 2015. The mainland Chinext growth board is down 45 percent over the same period. Hong Kong's junior Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) is down a whopping 65 percent.   This is partly about reversing a rally that got out of hand. The declines also reflect wariness about the quality of these companies and their governance. GEM, extraordinarily, brands itself as a  Buyers Beware Market for Informed Investors . The Hong Kong Stock Exchange wants to attract more hot startups to its staid bourse, currently dominated by old-economy stalwarts such as banks and property developers. The exchange is mulling a  New Board  that would focus on attracting such firms. But activists like Webb worry current regulations are inadequate, as is enforcement. The list of worries include obfuscated cross-shareholdings, weak disclosure, and the ease with which companies, once listed, can sell off assets and switch their focus without consent from minority shareholders. He has a point. Right now, urging “caveat emptor” will not cut it. A flood of new small cap debutants would only make the problem worse.

European markets were set to open a little lower, with financial spreadbetter LCG expecting Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 to all start the day down 0.1 percent. All three lost between  0.5 percent and 1.9 percent on Thursday. But global stock market indexes are set for more gains by the end of this year, driven by an economic revival in Europe and bright prospects for much of Asia, a Reuters poll of around 300 financial professionals showed. The dollar index fell 0.1 percent to 95.549, poised for a 1.8 percent slide this week, having fallen in all sessions but one. It is down 1.4 percent for the month, and 4.8 percent for the quarter. The Korean won weakened against the dollar after the country reported industrial production rose by 0.2 percent in May from a month earlier, missing expectations for growth of 1.5 percent. That followed a 2.2 percent decline in April The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 1,142.5 won. But the greenback remained lower against other major currencies. Adding to the dollar's weakness against the yen was data showing Japanese core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier in its fifth straight month of gains, although inflation remains well below the central bank's 2 percent target. The dollar fell 0.25 percent to 111.95 yen, after losing 0.2 percent on Thursday. It was heading for a 1.2 percent gain for the month, but is down 4.2 percent this year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a rate hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. Sterling was 0.1 percent higher on Friday at $1.3017, adding to Thursday's 0.6 percent gain. Two top policymakers at the Bank of Canada also suggested they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July. The dollar slipped 0.15 percent to C$1.2984, extending Thursday's 0.26 percent loss. Despite comments by sources that European Central Bank President Mario Draghi had intended to signal tolerance for a period of weaker inflation, not an imminent policy tightening, the euro on Friday revisited the 13-month high of $1.1445 hit on Thursday. The euro remained close to that level and was at $1.1439 on Friday, retaining most of Thursday's 0.6 percent gain.  Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy. In stocks, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent, after hitting a two-year high on Thursday. It is up 5.3 percent for the quarter and has risen 18.3 percent this year. The negative sentiment infected Chinese shares despite surveys showing activity in the country's manufacturing and services sector accelerated in June from the previous month. Manufacturers appeared to enjoy strong external demand, as new orders and production rose at a solid pace. The CSI 300 index fell 0.3 percent, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.9 percent. Japan's Nikkei tumbled 1.2 percent, shrinking its monthly gain to 1.7 percent. It is up 4.5 percent this year. Overnight, the tech-heavy Nasdaq led declines on Wall Street with a 1.4 percent loss. The Nasdaq is poised to post a 0.9 percent loss for the month, but is still up 14 percent this year. The drop in tech stocks overnight was due to a rotation into bank shares, which have lagged this year, after the biggest U.S. banks revealed buyback and dividend plans that beat analysts' expectations after the Fed approved their capital proposals in its annual stress test program. The S&P; financials index rose as much as 2 percent overnight, while the S&P; technology index fell as much as 2.7 percent. In commodities, oil prices continued their recovery this week on a decline in weekly U.S. crude production. U.S. crude added 0.7 percent to $45.15 a barrel in its seventh straight session of gains, bringing its weekly increase to 5.05 percent, and narrowing its quarterly loss to 10.75 percent. Global benchmark Brent gained 0.6 percent to $47.67 a barrel, poised to post a 9.8 percent for the quarter. The dollar's weakness this year has been a boon for gold, which is up 8.25 percent in the same period. It was up 0.1 percent at $1,246.46 an ounce on Friday.

The details on how this happened, we don't know,  she said.  Rescue workers received a call at about 4:20 p.m. local time about a possible explosion at the plant.

Exchange students and foreign trainees who apply for asylum may be held in immigration detention centers once their visas expire, Yasuhiro Hishida, a justice ministry official overseeing asylum recognition, told Reuters on Friday. Currently, people with valid visas who apply for asylum receive six-month, renewable permits that let them stay and work in Japan while their applications are reviewed.  The possible crackdown, which comes after the number of asylum seekers soared to a record high last year, would clamp down on what is effectively a system of back-door immigration that has allowed companies to hire cheap migrant workers. Labor demand is at a 43-year high in Japan as its population shrinks and barriers for blue-collar workers remain high. This has spawned a gray labor market, especially in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which hire asylum seekers from countries such as Turkey and Bangladesh, Reuters investigations found. The justice ministry's Hishida said many jobseekers claim asylum to get work permits.      Foreigners who want to work in Japan find out they're allowed to work while their asylum applications are reviewed, and this has led to the rise in abuse and misuse of the refugee system,  Hishida said. Immigration lawyer Chie Komai said the move could see legitimate asylum seekers locked up.  There are exchange students whose political activity in Japan make it dangerous for them to return home, and those who study in Japan waiting for the danger of persecution to wane,  Komai told Reuters. In 2016, a record 10,901 people from countries such as Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines sought asylum in Japan, justice ministry data showed. The government accepted 28. Last year, 1,106 trainees applied for asylum - roughly a 26-fold increase from 43 in 2012. The number of asylum-seeking exchange students multiplied nearly 14 times in the same period, to 1,399 in 2016 from 102 in 2012. Curbs on residence and work permits for exchange students and trainees who seek asylum will start as early as July, the Yomiuri daily reported on Friday.  But Hishida said the government was still considering various steps to curb abuses of the asylum system and had yet to decide on which measures to implement and when. Lawyers and activists say exchange students and foreign trainees, who are allowed to work in Japan for a set number of hours or period, often become targets of exploitation. Violations among groups accepting foreign trainees in Japan hit a record last year, government data showed.

This is a result of the changing character of contemporary conflict,  Dan Tehan, the minister assisting the prime minister on cyber security, told reporters in Melbourne.  The new unit, known as the information warfare division, will allow Australia to increase the sort of cyber attacks made on Islamic State that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last year were making valuable contributions to efforts to loosen the militant group's hold in Syria and Iraq.  Cyber attacks supplement air strikes and other warfare activities that are part of Australia's role in the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State, the country's defense force said. The new unit will also be responsible for defending Australia's armed forces against cyber attacks, Tehan said.  Another government agency will expand its remit from defense to begin cyber attacks on offshore criminals, Tehan also said.      The moves come amid a wave of global cyber assaults, including one this week that originated in Ukraine and the WannaCry ransomware attack in May that infected computers in nearly 100 countries.  Australia has largely escaped significant damage from the attacks, though Tehan said the global impact demonstrates the need to take the cyber fight to the foreign hackers.   We have to make sure that we are keeping the mums and dads, the small businesses, the large businesses, government departments and agencies secure in this nation,  he said.

Moments after Ender Inciarte led off the sixth inning with a double to become the first Brave to reach second base in the game, Snitker walked onto the field to ask crew chief Mike Winters and plate umpire Jim Reynolds to check Lamet for a foreign substance. Certainly, something had to be amiss. The 24-year-old Lamet retired the first 11 Braves before Nick Markakis singled with two outs in the fourth. By the time he was finished, Lamet had allowed four hits and a walk with eight strikeouts over seven innings. So Winters and Reynolds trekked to the mound to frisk Lamet. They found nothing. And if the goal was to shake up Lamet, that didn't work either. Inciarte never advanced from second.  He doesn't rattle,  Padres manager Andy Green said. Wil Myers and Hunter Renfroe rocketed two-run homers off Jaime Garcia changeups. and relievers Kirby Yates and Jose Valdez retired all six Braves they faced to complete the Padres' shutout. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at PadresAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchThe win was San Diego's second straight over Atlanta after the Braves won the first five meetings this season, including the series opener on Tuesday.  He's really good,  Snitker said of Lamet (3-2).  I've never seen him; none of us had seen him. But that was pretty impressive. He was alive. The breaking ball was really good.  Of his sixth-inning challenge, Snitker said,  Some guys put sunscreen (on the ball) and all that. I thought he had something on there because he kept going to it all the time, so I just wanted to check it.  Lamet does have a routine. Between pitches, he goes to his mouth, then touches the ground and wipes off his hand on the back of his right leg.  It's normal for me,  Lamet said.  It creates a little mud. I knew they weren't going to find anything.  And if Snitker's plan was for Lamet to lose concentration or get rattled, that didn't work either. Lamet retired six of the last seven Braves he faced after the inspection.  That is their job,  Lamet said of the umpires.  It didn't bother me.   He handled it fine,  Green said.  It's well within (the Braves') rights to ask.  After Lamet departed, Yates (two strikeouts) and Jose Valdez (three K's) each worked a perfect inning. As for offense, Myers and Renfroe each hit their 16th homer of the season, and Manuel Margot had three hits and two RBIs. Myers capped a three-run third with his 402-foot drive onto the second balcony of the Western Metal Supply Co. building, off an 83 mph changeup by Garcia. Two innings later, Renfroe drove an 82 mph Garcia changeup 439 feet to straightaway center. The drive to the base of the batter's eye was the longest homer at Petco Park this season. Garcia (2-6) gave up six runs on seven hits and three walks in six-plus innings. He struck out six. Jose Pirela singled with one out in the Padres' third and scored on Margot's double through the gap in left-center. Myers, who lost a home run in the series opener on a misinterpretation of a Petco Park ground rule, followed with his fifth homer in June, off a 1-0 pitch. Myers drew a two-out walk ahead of Renfroe's blast in the fifth. Renfroe's sixth homer this month -- and first since June 16 -- also came on a 1-0 changeup. The Padres added a sixth run in the bottom of the seventh. Matt Szczur pinch-hit for Lamet and drew a walk as the last batter Garcia faced. Szczur moved to second and scored on Margot's second RBI hit, a single off reliever Rex Brothers, who was promoted from Triple-A Gwinnett to replace Bartolo Colon on the Atlanta roster. NOTES: Braves 1B Matt Adams left the game after fouling a pitch off his left foot in his first at-bat. X-rays were negative. ... The Braves designated 44-year-old RHP Bartolo Colon for assignment on Thursday and promoted LHP Rex Brothers from Triple-A Gwinnett. Colon was 2-8 this season with an 8.14 ERA in 13 starts. He gave up six runs on eight hits and three walks in four innings to the Padres on Wednesday night.  We hated to do it, and it wasn't easy because he's such a great guy,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  But it just wasn't happening here.  ...

Mali is hosting a heads of state summit with Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania - known as the G5 Sahel - who could ultimately deploy thousands of troops into the vast, arid Sahel region that remains a breeding ground for militants and traffickers that Paris considers a threat to Europe.  Four years after intervening in its former colony to ward off a jihadist offensive, there is no sign of France withdrawing its 4,000-strong regional Barkhane contingent as they, alongside 10,000 U.N. peacekeepers, struggle to stabilize Mali and implement peace accords.  It's not wrong to say that it's part of an exit plan because the Barkhane mission is not intended to be there for ever, but it's hard to see how we could draw down soon,  said a senior French diplomat.  We need a long-term multilateral strategy so that we're less exposed. The time of doing everything alone in West Africa is over.  The force endorsed by the U.N. aims to initially establish specially-trained units by the end of the year, which would work with French forces where jihadist groups are known to operate . But it faces headwinds before it even becomes operational, with questions over financing, manpower and equipment.  France had an exit strategy in mind when it spearheaded the new force and wanted as much multilateral funding as possible,  said Vincent Rouget, West Africa analyst at Control Risks.  They don’t have the option that they had in CAR (Central African Republic) to just leave. The fact that Macron is in Bamako twice in a month really shows he is pushing his whole weight behind it.  Experts and officials question the merits of a mission that could muddy the picture in an area where there are already a plethora of military operations and there is a risk of diverting money away from local governance.  By putting the emphasis on setting up a new autonomous force with ​mostly ​external financing the risk is ​that it might distract from the absolute necessity of consolidating the states in all their dimensions,  said Yabi Gilles, founder of WATHI, a citizen think tank of West Africa.  French officials insist that their efforts will not just focus on security aspects. Macron pledged in May to ensure unfulfilled development promises from Paris and the wider international community would materialize. Reaching the Limit But the real concern is that there will not be enough appetite to finance another regional military operation and that it could be hampered because interests and objectives are not aligned. The neighboring multi-national joint task force (MNJTF) to fight Boko Haram, for example, has been complicated by divisions and a lack of cooperation. With the world's wealthy nations focused on the fight against Islamist militants in the Middle East, financial support for the MNJTF, has fallen short.  Chad and Niger are already members of the MNJTF so a solid foundation has been laid; let us build on it instead of creating another layer and going begging for resources from the same donors,  said an African security source.  The G5 Sahel gives them (France) leverage over the heads of states who virtually depend on it for their security.  Those concerns were echoed by the United States when it watered down the French-backed Security Council resolution fearing that U.N. funding - as much as $800 million could be required - would be wasted and that bilateral financing would be more fruitful. In response, France is lobbying for more European involvement beyond an initial 50 million euros and at some point might push for a donor conference. It will also have to dig into its own pocket despite its own budget constraints.   We have always said that the security of the region should be done by Africans themselves,  Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Le Monde newspaper on June 29.  Barkhane will accompany them for as long as it takes... until the situation is pacified.  But where those thousands of efficient troops to replace Barkhane will come from is a mystery. The G5 Sahel nations are already heavily committed, leading to speculation that Chad, Burkina Faso and Niger may simply re-hat some or all of their 4,100 soldiers now serving in the U.N. MINUSMA force in Mali, potentially undermining a mission that is already struggling.  We have reached our limit. We can't continue to be everywhere,  Chadian President Idriss Deby, whose troops are considered the most battle-hardened in the region, said in an interview to French media on Sunday.  Even if we had financing, Chad would be either in the G5 or Minusma. Choices will have to be made.

Peace is not a matter of course...,  Tsai said.  Only by actively preparing for battle can the battle be stopped. Only with our own strength can peace be maintained.  Without referring to China, Tsai said Taiwan remains under  huge military threat . China deems the island a wayward province under its  one China  policy and has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Tsai has been trying to shore up the island's defenses since she took power last year, as Beijing refuses to engage with her government because she leads an independence-leaning ruling party and refuses to recognize the  one China  policy. The U.S. State Department said it notified Congress of a proposed arms sale on Thursday, the first under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The arms package  includes technical support for early warning radar, high speed anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and missile components. The United States is the sole arms supplier to diplomatically-isolated Taiwan.  Tsai, who is also commander-in-chief of Taiwan's armed forces, also said that reform of military pensions would take into account  the special nature  of the armed forces.  A planned new pension system for military personnel would provide for  reasonable life security , Tsai said, even as protesters unhappy over legacy benefits being cut were shown on live television protesting outside the graduation ceremony. This week, parliament approved bills to reduce the government's financial load on pensions for civil servants and teachers, fulfilling one of Tsai's campaign promises and delaying the possibility of a default in payments to retirees by a decade.

The acquisition offers a chance for bidders to grab control of Asia's biggest warehouse operator which counts Amazon among its clients and is benefiting from rising demand for modern logistics facilities, driven by a boom in e-commerce business. It could rank as one of the biggest private equity backed deals in Asia. Singapore-listed GLP was thrust into the spotlight late last year after sovereign wealth fund GIC, which owns a 37 percent stake, nudged it to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to the highest in more than three years. After months of negotiations with a special committee of GLP's independent directors, the race has narrowed to between a group led by Chinese private equity firms Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group, with the support of GLP CEO Ming Mei, and a rival consortium headed by Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood, the sources said.

I am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,  said one woman on Thursday at a Sams Club store in Beijing owned by Walmart. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia.      This looks tasty, worth a try,  she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price.  Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits.  China's beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the world's fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand.  U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang.      Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Sams Club store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak.  A hostess holds a tray of sliced American beef at an event to celebrate the re-introduction of American beef imports to China, in Beijing, China June 30, 2017.Mark Schiefelbein/Pool American steak is delicious,  said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo service.  It doesn't have the mutton smell of domestic beef.   Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO [CNCOF.UL], said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com, one of the country's biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the product's availability from mid-July.  Slideshow (13 Images)Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor.  Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.com's meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said.  Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijing's stringent import requirements.  One Sams Club shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling:  We should not only stick to foreign beef. They have food safety issues, like growth hormones and GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in the U.S.   (This version the story is corrected to show the store was Sams Club, owned by Walmart, not a Walmart supermarket in 2nd, 7th and 13th paras) Reporting by Dominique Patton and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Tom Hogue","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-beef-usa-idUSL3N1JF0AE"},

MAS had said last November that it would consider ways to offset the cost of ratings. It has also repeatedly said that it would like to see more rated issuances in the market.  MAS strongly encourages all issuers in the SGD bond market to rate their bonds,  MAS Deputy Managing Director Jacqueline Loh said in statement on Friday.  This will help provide greater transparency to investors, broaden the pool of market participants, and grow the SGD bond market.  $1 = 1.3770 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Eric Meijer","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/singapore-cenbank-bonds-idUSL3N1JR1WR"},

Democratic Governor Kate Brown is expected to sign the bill into law.   The measure would go into effect next year and apply to Oregon workers on the payrolls of retail, food service and hospitality companies with at least 500 employees worldwide. Under the bill, those companies must provide employees in Oregon, starting on July 18, with written estimates of their work schedules seven days in advance, with the required scheduling notice increased to two weeks beginning in July 2020. Workers also would be entitled to a break of at least 10 hours between work shifts from one day to the next, and to receive extra pay if they agreed to a shorter rest interval - typically between closing hours at night and opening hours the next morning.

Work schedule predictability has emerged as a major issue causing growing anxiety in the American labor force even as the U.S. jobless rate has fallen to below-average levels.

The government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi had already said it would not cooperate with a mission set up after a Human Rights Council resolution was adopted in March.  If they are going to send someone with regards to the fact-finding mission, then there's no reason for us to let them come,  said Kyaw Zeya, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital, Naypyitaw.   Our missions worldwide are advised accordingly,  he said, explaining that visas to enter Myanmar would not be issued to the mission's appointees or staff. Suu Kyi, who came to power last year amid a transition from military rule, leads Myanmar through the specially created position of  State Counsellor , but is also minister of foreign affairs. Although she does not oversee the military, Suu Kyi has been criticized for failing to stand up for the more than 1 million stateless Rohingya Muslims in the western state of Rakhine. She said during a trip to Sweden this month the UN mission  would have created greater hostility between the different communities . The majority in Rakhine are ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who, like many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, see the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Some 75,000 Rohingya fled northwestern Rakhine state to Bangladesh late last year after the Myanmar army carried out a security operation in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents that killed nine border police. A U.N. report in February, based on interviews with some of the Rohingya refugees, said the response involved mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya, and  very likely  amounted to crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing. Myanmar, along with neighbors China and India, dissociated itself from the March resolution brought by the European Union, which called for a mission to look into the allegations in Rakhine as well as reports of abuses in ethnic conflicts in the north of the country. Indira Jaising, an advocate from the Supreme Court of India, was appointed to lead the mission in May. The other two members are Harvard-trained Sri Lankan lawyer Radhika Coomaraswamy and Australian consultant Christopher Dominic. Myanmar insists that a domestic investigation - headed by former lieutenant general and Vice President Myint Swe - is sufficient to look into the allegations in Rakhine.  Why do they try to use unwarranted pressure when the domestic mechanisms have not been exhausted?  said Kyaw Zeya.  It will not contribute to our efforts to solve the issues in a holistic manner,  he said. An advisory panel headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan is set to propose solutions for the broader issues in Rakhine but has not been asked to investigate human rights abuses.

Such a prospect has unnerved investors in Canada's third-most populous province, not least owners of oil and gas projects such as Kinder Morgan Inc's  C$7.4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which the New Democratic Party (NDP) has vowed to halt. But an NDP government, which has to be propped up by the third-place Green Party to achieve a slim parliamentary majority of one, is fragile, and few expect it to survive the four-year term. On Thursday, seven weeks after a knife-edge election, NDP and Green lawmakers used their 44 votes in the 87-member legislature to pass a non-confidence amendment to the Liberal government's Throne Speech. After the vote, NDP leader John Horgan told reporters he had met the province's nominal head, Lieutenant-Governor Judith Guichon, and that she had invited him to form a new government, making him British Columbia's next premier.  We'll have access to government documents tomorrow to start working on a transition,  Horgan said.  I can't predict when that (transition) will be, but it's going to be soon.  Incumbent Premier Christy Clark told media she offered her resignation to Guichon, but asked for a dissolution of the legislature, which the lieutenant-governor did not grant. Dissolution would trigger another election. While Guichon technically has that power, such a move would go against convention for the largely ceremonial leader. Guichon said in a statement she will accept Clark's resignation. The NDP and Greens struck an agreement last month to oust the right-leaning Liberals - unaffiliated with the left-leaning Liberals in power federally - after a May 9 election reduced Clark's party to a minority. The NDP and Greens, which will form the province's first minority government in 65 years, have accused the Liberals of trying to retain power after the election by stealing their election promises and introducing them as last-minute legislation to delay being voted out. Yet those same promises could be hard to deliver under an NDP government, which needs Green cooperation and every legislator to be present for every vote to pass laws, said University of British Columbia political science professor Hamish Telford.  The NDP may decide on its own accord that it needs to have a fresh election,  he said.

The euro has risen rapidly after Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi bolstered expectations for the central bank to announce a reduction of its stimulus as soon as September. In addition, comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and two top Bank of Canada policymakers on Wednesday ramped up expectations for interest rate increases from those central banks, putting pressure on the U.S. dollar.  Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy. The euro last traded at $1.1441, clinging near this week's high of $1.1445, its strongest level since May 2016, having rallied 2.2 percent so far this week. In the April-June quarter, the euro has climbed 7.4 percent, putting it on track for its biggest quarterly gain since the July-September quarter of 2010. The focus now is whether the euro can rise beyond $1.15, a threshold that has capped the single currency's gains for most of the last two years, said Teppei Ino, analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore.  Judging from the prevailing mood, it looks like there could be a test of that level,  Ino said. The greenback hit a nine-month low against a basket of six major currencies, dented by the shift in market expectations toward more hawkish monetary policies in Europe and Canada, as well as lingering doubts about the chances of another U.S. interest rate rise this year. The dollar index slipped to as low as 95.470 earlier on Friday, and last stood at 95.520. The Australian dollar hit a three-month high after a gauge of Chinese factory activity exceeded market expectations, with commodity-linked currencies also drawing support from firmness in oil prices. The Australian dollar edged up 0.2 percent to $0.7699 , having risen to as high as $0.7712 at one point, its strongest level since March. Investors will be keeping close watch on the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy statement, due on Tuesday, for any shift in language from its neutral stance. The RBA is widely expected to hold interest rates at a record low of 1.50 percent next week. The Canadian dollar touched a five-month high of C$1.2970 per U.S. dollar on Friday, and was last up about 0.2 percent on the day at C$1.2983.

Household spending also fell in May, leaving the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target seemingly out of reach. Energy costs were the sole driver of what little inflation there is, further underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's recovery. Recent declines in oil costs and stubbornly slow wage growth could further cloud the outlook and force the BOJ next month to cut its rosy inflation projections yet again, analysts say.  Production looks like it will enter a period of stagnation,  said Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center,  If production is weak, consumer spending is unlikely to strengthen. The BOJ may have to lower its consumer price forecasts.  Industrial output fell by a larger-than-expected 3.3 percent in May as the makers of cars and construction machinery cut output because of high inventories, trade ministry data showed on Friday. While manufacturers' forecasts for June suggest that output will rise by 2 percent or more in April-June, output could peak after the current quarter because some manufacturers of capital goods are ordering fewer parts from overseas, a trade ministry official told reporters. A downturn in output would be bad news for Japanese policymakers, who have pinned their hopes on strong overseas demand boosting corporate profits, wages and eventually consumption. Inflation Remains Subdued Core consumer prices, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in April. But after stripping out the effect of energy costs, consumer inflation was unchanged in May from a year earlier. Workers are seen at a construction site in the midnight in Tokyo, Japan June 29, 2017. Picture taken on June 29, 2017.Kim Kyung-HoonCore consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, were unchanged in June from a year earlier, against a 0.2 percent gain projected in a Reuters poll.  The BOJ argues that trend inflation is improving due to a strong economy. But that's not happening,  said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  It just shows how companies, knowing consumers are very sensitive to prices, are reluctant to raise prices.  Slideshow (3 Images)Separate data showed household spending dipped 0.1 percent in May from a year earlier to mark a 15th straight month of declines - the longest falling streak on record. Such weak spending reflects slow wage growth, despite a continued tightening in the job market, analysts say. Japan's jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 3.1 percent in May as more workers resigned to seek better jobs and new entrants joined the labor market. Job availability rose for the third straight month in May to reach 1.4 jobs per applicant, its highest since February 1974, data from the Internal Affairs Ministry showed, suggesting an ongoing mismatch between the jobs on offer and the jobs workers either want or are qualified to do. Japan's economy expanded at an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter on robust exports and a boost from consumption, prompting the BOJ to upgrade its economic assessment in April. But consumer inflation remains subdued, underscoring the challenge for the BOJ in driving up inflation to its target. The BOJ is set to upgrade its economic assessment again but cut its inflation forecast at a quarterly review of its projections in July, sources have told Reuters.

Right-hander Jameson Taillon lacked his best stuff but held Tampa Bay scoreless over 6 1/3 innings as the Pirates beat the Rays 4-0 on Thursday at PNC Park. Andrew McCutchen had three hits and a walk, and Josh Harrison also reached base four times, thanks to twice getting hit by pitches. He has been plunked a major-league-most 18 times.  I guess I just got a magnet or something,  Harrison said. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at PiratesTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchDeposed closer Tony Watson turned in a clutch seventh-inning performance in relief of Taillon (4-2), and John Jaso and Gregory Polanco homered. None of it was flashy, but the Pirates (37-42) are contending.  We got a good group of guys, and nobody presses because we know at the end of the day, if we all do our job, we'll be in a good spot,  Harrison said. McCutchen, batting. 398 in June, drove in the first Pirates run with an opposite-field single on a low, out-of-the-zone slider from Rays right-hander Chris Archer that few could have handled.  Sometimes you throw a pitch where you want it and it gets hit,  said Archer (6-5), who gave up three runs in six innings.  Typically it doesn't get hit like that, but I got to be better.  That was debatable, but no one argued about the home runs balls to Jaso and Polanco.  I wish I executed a handful of pitches at a higher level, kept the game a little closer,  Archer said. Taillon, a big right-hander making his fourth start since undergoing testicular cancer surgery on May 8, continued a remarkable comeback. In only one of the games since his return has he allowed more than two runs.  I feel healthy. I'm back,  he said.  That's back-to-back games, six innings the last one, 6 1/3 this time, (103) pitches. I feel like I'm back with the team, I'm contributing and we're playing for something.  Taillon got sharper as the game progressed until he ran into  a little turbulence  in the seventh, as Hurdle put it. Tampa Bay's Jesus Sucre and Mallex Smith started the inning with singles, and Steven Souza Jr. lined out hard to left field. That was it for Taillon. In came Watson, who lost his closer's job earlier in the month. The left-hander struck out Corey Dickerson, the Rays' best hitter, and got Evan Longoria to pop out.  We just got beat tonight, you know?  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Last two nights. Not for lack of effort or anything. We were just outpitched a little bit, outhit a little bit. The bats kind of went quiet.  NOTES: The Rays activated RHP Brad Boxberger from the 60-day disabled list and designated RHP Danny Farquhar for assignment.

Researchers had women posing as 17-year-old girls in need of emergency contraception use a standard script to call 979 pharmacies in five U.S. cities. About 83 percent of the pharmacies said emergency contraception was available, but drugstores gave correct information about over-the-counter access only 52 percent of the time, and 8 percent said it wasn’t for sale under any circumstances.  These results, from calls made in 2015, weren’t much different from responses researchers got using the same script in 2012 before the FDA eliminated age restrictions on over-the-counter access to emergency contraception.  “It is surprising that access hasn’t improved despite the change in regulations that were intended to improve access for adolescents in particular,” said lead study author Dr. Tracey Wilkinson, a pediatrics researcher at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis.  “Not having timely access to emergency contraception is a problem - not only because its efficacy decreases with time but because it is an important part of pregnancy prevention,” Wilkinson said by email. “Without access, more unplanned pregnancies can result and for adolescents in particular the repercussions of unplanned pregnancy can be substantial and life-long.” Emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, can prevent pregnancy by stopping the ovary from releasing an egg, preventing sperm from fertilizing the egg or blocking the fertilized egg from implanting in the womb. It works best when taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex or condom failure, although it can work for up to 72 hours.  The FDA initially cleared over-the-counter emergency contraception access for people 18 and older, in part because of concerns about whether younger teen girls would use the medication properly. Later, the FDA lowered the age for non-prescription access to 17 before ultimately extending access to people of all ages in 2013.  Pharmacies are more likely to say emergency contraception isn’t available under any circumstances in low-income neighborhoods than in more affluent communities, the researchers report in Pediatrics.  One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t contact all the same pharmacies in the two different studies, so they couldn’t see whether individual drugstores changed policies over time as the law shifted. What happens on the phone also might not reflect what would happen when teens walked into the pharmacy, the authors note.  Still, the results suggest that not all pharmacists are clear on who should get the morning-after-pill, said Abigail R.A. Aiken, a public policy researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who wasn’t involved in the study.  “It’s important for people to know the facts on emergency contraception access for themselves,” Aiken said by email. “Anyone who receives incorrect information or is denied emergency contraception by a pharmacy can request to talk with the pharmacist in charge if a member of staff gives incorrect information or to the store manager.” It may also make sense for women to go to a pharmacy in person instead of calling to find out if they have emergency contraception, and to consider trying another drugstore if one place turns them away, Dr. Regina-Maria Renner, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “Patients may encounter problems in accessing emergency contraception, but FDA policy is on their side,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a researcher at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis who wasn’t involved in the study.  “It matters because preventing unintended pregnancy, especially for low-income teens, can influence a person’s life trajectory,” Kozhimannil said by email.

Overseas deals by Chinese companies - the engine of M&A; activity in Asia - fell 49 percent in the first half of 2017 from the year-ago period to $64.2 billion, dragging down regional deal volumes, according to Thomson Reuters data. The total value of announced M&A; activity in Asia Pacific fell 15 percent in the first half of this year to $458.4 billion from the year-ago period, the data showed. China was the top nation for both inbound and outbound deals in Asia Pacific for the half-year, attracting $28.5 billion worth of inbound deals. A slowdown in Chinese deals, especially large-sized ones, could inflict further pressure on Asian revenues of Wall Street banks, who are already feeling the pain of growing competition from Chinese investment banks. M&A; is among the few areas where Chinese banks haven't already gained a strong foothold.  Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas, ranging from movie studios to football clubs in 2016, but Beijing's move to prop up the yuan by restricting capital outflows has made it tougher for buyers to win deals abroad. China's banking regulator tightened the screws further last week, ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on an overseas buying spree, two people familiar with the matter said. FILE PHOTO: The HNA Group logo is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017. Picture taken June 1, 2017.Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo The latest crackdown takes away people from the market who were very active on the M&A; scene and creates a sense of uncertainty. You will see the impact on volumes,  said an Asia financial institutions M&A; banker at a large European bank. The elevated regulatory hurdles for Chinese buyers to get their cash out of the country have caused delays and even withdrawals of a number of China outbound M&A; transactions targeting U.S. and European assets.  The sellside needs to ascertain the credibility of a buyer (from China). The second thing is to address any questions around certainty, in particular funding and approvals,  said John Kim, head of M&A; for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs.  Still, Chinese state-owned firms struck some of Asia's top deals in the first half. China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] wrote a 12.25 billion euros ($13.93 billion) cheque to acquire European warehouse firm Logicor from private equity group Blackstone (BX.N), the region's largest during the first half. But this year is unlikely to see any blockbuster deals such as last year's around $44 billion ChemChina-Syngenta tie-up. Bankers instead expect more activity to be driven by private equity firms which have plenty of capital after a busy fundraising period in 2016. They are already heavily involved in some of Asia's most high-profile takeovers and take-private deals, including the potential sale of Singapore-listed warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties Ltd (GLPL.SI), which will likely be the region's biggest buyout this year.

The Trump administration had previously decided, on the basis of its interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, that grandparents, grandchildren and fiancés traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The 90-day ban took effect at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT Friday), along with a 120-day ban on all refugees.  On Monday, the Supreme Court revived parts of Trump's travel ban on people from the six Muslim-majority countries, narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a March 6 executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, who also requested anonymity, said it would be updating its guidance to state that fiancés would not be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The Supreme Court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the United States. As an example, the court said those with a  close familial relationship  with someone in the United States would be covered.  The state of Hawaii asked a federal judge in Honolulu on Thursday evening to determine whether the Trump administration had interpreted the court's decision too narrowly. Hawaii said in a court filing that the U.S. government intended to violate the Supreme Court's instructions by improperly excluding from the United States people who actually have a close family relationship to U.S. persons, echoing criticism from immigrant and refugee groups.  Hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship  a plain violation of the Supreme Court's command.   Hawaii's Attorney General Doug Chin asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who blocked Trump's travel ban in March, to issue an order  as soon as possible  clarifying how the Supreme Court's ruling should be interpreted. Watson ordered the Justice Department to respond to Hawaii's request by Monday, and said he would allow Hawaii to reply by July 6.

The U.S. government expected  things to run smoothly  and  business as usual  at U.S. ports of entry, another senior U.S. official told reporters. A handful of immigration lawyers gathered at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Thursday in case of any problems.  We're going to keep fighting this ban, even if it applies very narrowly,  said Sirine Shebaya, a senior staff attorney at Muslim Advocates.  It's still a Muslim ban, and its still trying to send a message to a whole community that they're not welcome here.  Slideshow (12 Images)The administration said refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the United States would not be exempted from the ban, likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months. Hawaii said in its court filing it was  preposterous  not to consider a formal link with a resettlement agency a qualifying relationship. Refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would-be refugees would qualify as  bona fide.   The administration's decision likely means that few refugees beyond a 50,000-cap set by Trump would be allowed into the country this year. A U.S. official said that, as of Wednesday evening, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year. The State Department said refugees scheduled to arrive through July 6 could still enter. Trump first announced a temporary travel ban on Jan. 27, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop  better security vetting. The order caused chaos at airports, as officials scrambled to enforce it before it was blocked by courts. Opponents argued that the measure discriminated against Muslims and that there was no security rationale for it. A revised version of the ban was also halted by courts. The State Department guidance, distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday evening and seen by Reuters, fleshed out the Supreme Court's ruling about people who have a  bona fide  relationship with an individual or entity in the United States. It defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations. A department cable said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés,  and any other 'extended' family members  were not considered close family. The guidelines also said workers with offers of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer addressing U.S. audiences would be exempt from the ban, but that arrangements such as a hotel reservation would not be considered bona fide relationships.

Overseas deals by Chinese companies - the engine of M&A; activity in Asia - fell 49 percent in the first half of 2017 from the year-ago period to $64.2 billion, dragging down regional deal volumes, according to Thomson Reuters data. The total value of announced M&A; activity in Asia Pacific fell 15 percent in the first half of this year to $458.4 billion from the year-ago period, the data showed. China was the top nation for both inbound and outbound deals in Asia Pacific for the half-year, attracting $28.5 billion worth of inbound deals. A slowdown in Chinese deals, especially large-sized ones, could inflict further pressure on Asian revenues of Wall Street banks, who are already feeling the pain of growing competition from Chinese investment banks. M&A; is among the few areas where Chinese banks haven't already gained a strong foothold.  Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas, ranging from movie studios to football clubs in 2016, but Beijing's move to prop up the yuan by restricting capital outflows has made it tougher for buyers to win deals abroad. China's banking regulator tightened the screws further last week, ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on an overseas buying spree, two people familiar with the matter said. FILE PHOTO: The HNA Group logo is seen in this illustration photo June 1, 2017. Picture taken June 1, 2017.Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo The latest crackdown takes away people from the market who were very active on the M&A; scene and creates a sense of uncertainty. You will see the impact on volumes,  said an Asia financial institutions M&A; banker at a large European bank. The elevated regulatory hurdles for Chinese buyers to get their cash out of the country have caused delays and even withdrawals of a number of China outbound M&A; transactions targeting U.S. and European assets.  The sellside needs to ascertain the credibility of a buyer (from China). The second thing is to address any questions around certainty, in particular funding and approvals,  said John Kim, head of M&A; for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs.  Still, Chinese state-owned firms struck some of Asia's top deals in the first half. China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] wrote a 12.25 billion euros ($13.93 billion) cheque to acquire European warehouse firm Logicor from private equity group Blackstone (BX.N), the region's largest during the first half. But this year is unlikely to see any blockbuster deals such as last year's around $44 billion ChemChina-Syngenta tie-up. Bankers instead expect more activity to be driven by private equity firms which have plenty of capital after a busy fundraising period in 2016. They are already heavily involved in some of Asia's most high-profile takeovers and take-private deals, including the potential sale of Singapore-listed warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties Ltd (GLPL.SI), which will likely be the region's biggest buyout this year.

The feud between Arab powers threatens to undermine the region's progress in positioning itself as business friendly and raises concerns that some firms may be forced to pick sides. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed economic sanctions, accusing it of funding terrorism, a claim Qatar rejects. Many multinational businesses, from builders to law firms and banks, have a base in Dubai from where they serve the region, including Qatar.  Qatar is a valuable market for us and we want to continue here but it has become difficult and if there's no improvement we will have to review our strategy [in Qatar],  said a commercial manager at a European construction services company with a regional head office in UAE. The company may be forced to stop bidding for new contracts in Qatar or wind down its operations altogether if sanctions intensify, the manager, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said. Global banks are also in a bind. Some have joined lenders from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in curtailing new business in Qatar, while others including a few large Asian, European and U.S. banks are still providing financing. Many of the big international banks have strong relations with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. HSBC, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were involved in sovereign bond issues by both Qatar and Saudi Arabia last year. The three banks declined to comment on how they are responding to the crisis. Suspended land, sea and air links with Qatar have had the most immediate impact on businesses. For William Grieve, a Bahrain-based businessman with consulting work in Manama and Doha, his weekly 40-minute flight to Qatar is now a 10-hour journey via Kuwait.  When two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers and that's what's happening now,  said Grieve. A Doha-based executive at an international engineering firm said the situation had already forced his company to delay some projects.  As a satellite office in Qatar we rely on being able to bring staff across from UAE regularly. Several jobs have had to be postponed due to building materials being held up in Jebel Ali port (in UAE),  he said.  Where necessary, employees have had to travel for seven hours via Oman to get to Qatar.  One construction firm in Doha has been forced to bypass the port of Jebel Ali and import raw materials either directly or via Oman - and discovered that it has actually lowered costs in doing so, a sales manager at the firm said. Risks to businesses, however, could increase as the four countries that cut ties with Qatar are now stepping up pressure. Last week they issued 13 demands to Doha, including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran and shutting a Turkish military base. Qatar is reviewing the list but has said the demands are not reasonable or actionable. Opportunities and Risks Governments dominate the commercial landscape of the region but they have worked hard to cultivate a business friendly image and are keen to attract foreign capital. Qatar attracted 133 billion riyals ($36 billion) in foreign investment in 2015, the latest available figure. Opportunities in the region include oil giant Saudi Aramco's planned initial public offering in 2018, potentially the world's biggest IPO ever; the 2022 World Cup in Qatar; and the Dubai World Expo 2020. A Qatari official downplayed concerns about the rift making life harder for businesses and said it was an opportunity for new firms to enter a lucrative market.  Don't believe all the hype about business being affected. Qatar can weather the storm. It is business as usual for us here,  said the official who declined to be named under government briefing rules. Still, the CEO of the Qatar Stock Exchange, Rashid al-Mansoori, said the bourse may look to Asia or Europe for new consultants as transport costs for its current Dubai-based advisers have soared. And the dispute has left some companies worried about the political risks attached to commercial deals. On June 20, Attorney General Ali al-Marri said Qatar would pursue legal action against firms and individuals that caused harm to Qatar.  Nobody is being asked to pick sides and I don't know if it will come to that, but if it did there would be some uncomfortable and potentially costly decisions to be made,  said an Australian businessman working for a multinational with interests in Doha, Dubai and Riyadh. Some companies are already turning down business for fear of being accused of a conflict of interest. Law firms, for example, are being approached by Qatari individuals and businesses about potential class action law suits in the United States relating to the embargo.  We have been approached to represent those who have been damaged by the crisis but we are not in a position to accept as we are conflicted,  one lawyer said.  Although we have business in Qatar, we also have clients in UAE and Saudi Arabia. All the law firms do.  For businesses the drying up of financial flows between Qatar and its neighbours has made it trickier to make payments. One executive at a global engineering company, with a regional headquarters in Dubai, said his firm was making contingency plans to pay Qatar-based staff salaries through its European office if the dispute stops payments being made between Doha and Dubai.
