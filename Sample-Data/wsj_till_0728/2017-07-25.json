Susan Collins       of Maine and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska, who joined all Senate Democrats in voting against proceeding to debate the legislation.The vote, punctuated by an emotional last-minute appearance by Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), who was diagnosed recently with brain cancer, delivered a come-from-behind victory for President       Donald Trump       and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who persuaded Republicans skeptical of the GOP bill to band together long enough to begin debate.Mr. Trump said after the vote that his party had taken \u201ca big step\u201d that would \u201cmove forward to truly great health care.\u201dEven with their surprise win on the procedural motion, which seemed a long shot just last week, Republicans were subdued Tuesday about their prospects of passing a sweeping overhaul of the ACA by week\u2019s end.\u201cWe knew this wasn\u2019t going to be easy, and there\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d said Sen.       John Thune       of South Dakota, a member of the Senate GOP leadership.On Tuesday night, the first of Senate leaders\u2019 health-care options, a bill toppling and replacing major portions of the ACA, gained only 43 votes to 57 against. That measure included a much-debated proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) allowing insurers who offer one ACA-compliant health plan to also sell cheaper insurance options that don\u2019t meet ACA rules.Senate leaders had expected the measure to fail, as Senate rules made it ineligible to pass on a simple majority vote. But the defection of nine GOP Senators\u2014enough to sink the bill even under a simple majority\u2014underscored the lack of support within the party for the ACA replacement that leaders had cobbled together.On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to take up a separate bill that would largely repeal the ACA with a two-year expiration date, to give lawmakers time to craft a replacement.The Senate debate will culminate later this week in a marathon session of amendment votes, but it isn\u2019t clear GOP leaders have the 50 votes needed to pass any of the proposals, fueling the uncertainty over where the week\u2019s legislative twists will end.Democrats said that while the ACA can be improved, it has provided health insurance to 20 million Americans, and it should be built upon rather than dismantled. Many Republicans say it has resulted in higher premiums and less choice, and that an entirely new approach is needed.In a memorable moment on the Senate floor, Mr. McCain criticized the GOP\u2019s legislative effort, despite flying across the country to prevent the procedural motion from falling short due to his absence. He delivered a sobering rebuke to GOP leaders, even while agreeing that they should at least begin debate on the health legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s a shell of a bill right now,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it\u2019s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don\u2019t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201dMr. McConnell on Tuesday pitched GOP senators on a backup proposal, if they can\u2019t agree on any other plans for repealing and possibly replacing the ACA. Under this \u201clowest common denominator\u201d proposal, Republicans would cobble together just the elements that they all agree on, including repealing the individual and employer mandates and a tax on medical devices.That would knock down the most controversial elements of the ACA, including the requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have insurance. But it would likely increase the number of people without insurance, compared with the ACA, making it a potentially hard sell for centrist senators. But centrists may like the fact that it would leave the Medicaid program for low-income Americans unchanged, unlike the current bill\u2019s $756 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid funding.\u201cWe\u2019ll see where we get to in the end,\u201d said Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.). \u201cThey\u2019re going to see what the broadest measure is that they can get people to support.\u201dGOP leaders hope that passing just a scaled-back bill as a default would at least start negotiations with House Republicans over their version of a health overhaul, which passed in May, keeping alive the effort to repeal the ACA.It could also provide the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office more time, while those negotiations are under way, to provide an estimate of the cost and coverage impact of some Republican proposals that could be incorporated into the legislation.Those measures include an additional $100 billion so states can assist people who lose Medicaid coverage due to the Republican bill, as well as a proposal to allow insurers to sell less expensive plans with fewer benefits if they also sell more robust plans.Still, it isn\u2019t clear Republicans can secure 50 GOP votes for the scaled-back repeal plan. Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) called the proposal a \u201cpolitical punt,\u201d and other senators uneasy over the bill could also emerge as opponents.Many Republicans said opening debate was a good first step, while generally being cautious about the path ahead.\u201cThis vote is the first step toward solving the problems created by Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.). \u201cAnd as the Senate continues to deliberate, I will be carefully monitoring any legislative changes that are proposed. It\u2019s important we get this right.\u201dDemocrats said the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d strategy exposed Republicans\u2019 difficulties in coalescing around a health-care plan, despite promising voters for seven years they would repeal the ACA as soon as they took power in Washington.\u201cIt shows the bankruptcy of Republicans\u2019 policy efforts,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), calling the plan \u201ca naked political move to get it off the floor of the Senate\u201d that \u201cdoes nothing to move us closer to actually addressing the health-care needs of Americans.\u201dThe vote to proceed to debate was somewhat dramatic, in part because the outcome wasn\u2019t entirely certain when it began.When Sens. Collins and Murkowski voted no, it became clear that just one more defection would end the GOP health overhaul push for now. Mr. McCain\u2019s plane from Arizona was landing in Washington around the same time, and he raced to the Capitol.Meanwhile, Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), who hasn\u2019t always seen eye-to-eye with GOP leaders, withheld his vote until the last minute, engaging in a long talk with Mr. McConnell on the Senate floor. Mr. Johnson later said he had been discussing with Mr. McConnell how he could continue \u201cto be a positive influence.\u201dDemocrats, for their part, refrained from voting until all Republicans had cast their votes, saying they wanted to highlight all of the GOP senators who were voting to advance an effort that has been broadly unpopular in recent polls.\u2014Louise Radnofsky, Byron Tau and Janet Hook contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Pushes Ahead on Health Repeal.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-votes-to-begin-debate-on-health-care-bill-1501009650", "keywords": [" donald trump, gop, health care,health care vote, obamacare, repeal and replace, republicans, senate,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 21:49:00", "news_title": "The Number of Defendants Held in N.J. Jails Drops ", "content": "The number of defendants in New Jersey jails who are awaiting trial has decreased more than 20% since January, when the state\u2019s overhaul of its bail policy went into effect.Data released\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0by New Jersey\u2019s court system show the impact of changes designed to largely eliminate money bail, which is used as a deposit to ensure that a defendant returns to court.Previously, bail was set for many defendants and typically only those who couldn\u2019t afford to pay ended up being held in jail. Now, state officials say, defendants are held based on factors such as risk to public safety or likelihood to flee.Of 21,763 defendants statewide who appeared in court during the first six months of this year, about 14% were held in jail. Nearly 10% were released without conditions, and 73% were released with mandatory monitoring, which can include drug and alcohol screening or house arrest.The percentage of defendants held in jail varied greatly by county. Atlantic County, in southern New Jersey, detained 28% of its pretrial defendants. Bergen County, in the northeastern part of the state, detained 6%.New Jersey has been hailed nationally for its bail changes, which proponents say is fairer to poor defendants who don\u2019t have the money to get out of jail, and assures dangerous defendants with financial means can\u2019t be released.As the new system has rolled out this year, some critics say judges have released defendants who have gone on to commit other crimes. In one instance, a man released with a monitoring bracelet in January was charged with a shooting in March, Newark officials said. No one was injured in the incident, they said.Court officials contend that these same defendants could have been released under the previous system if they had the financial means to pay bail.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Defendants Locked Up Less Often Before Trial.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-number-of-defendants-held-in-n-j-jails-drops-1501008163", "keywords": ["new jersey bail policy,new jersey incarceration,new jersey jails,political,general news,crime,legal action"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 21:34:00", "news_title": "Cuomo to Meet With Federal Officials About State Infrastructure ", "content": "New York Gov.

MTA Chairman       Joseph Lhota       said the immediate fixes\u2014focused primarily on maintenance\u2014are intended to resolve about 79% of the problems that lead to delays.The plan aims to improve reliability, enhance stations and safety, and provide better communications to customers. The focus is on one thing\u2014subway riders, said Mr. Lhota.\u201cThe subway system is in distress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are failing our customers.\u201dMr. Lhota said the city and state haven\u2019t properly funded the capital and operating budgets for years, and many issues are coming to a head all at once. If the city doesn\u2019t pick up its share of the bill, he said he would go to Albany to press legislators for the funds.\u201cRaising fares is not an option,\u201d he said.Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       said in a statement that the state \u201cwill do its part\u201d and pay for half the cost of the plan.Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking from inside the City Hall subway station, called Mr. Lhota\u2019s initiative, a \u201cgood faith plan.\u201d But he hewed closely to his previous position, saying the state already had the funds in its coffers to pay for the proposal.\u201cNew York City taxpayers are already paying a disproportionate share,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio said he was willing to add resources for police and fire services in the subway, including efforts to decrease litter in the system.\u201cIt is befuddling that the mayor praised the MTA repair plan, but said he would not agree to fund it 50/50 with the state,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in a statement.Mr. Lhota\u2019s plan comes about a month into his tenure as MTA chairman and after several serious problems across the subway system. Last week, a Q subway train car derailed in Brooklyn, creating a cascade of delays across the system. Signal problems and a track fire on July 17 crippled service during a Monday rush hour. And in late June, an A train derailed in Harlem, injuring dozens. The cause of that derailment was caused by an improperly secured piece of equipment, according to MTA officials.The worsening crisis has increased tensions between Messrs. de Blasio and Cuomo, with each pointing the finger as to who runs the system and who is responsible for its costs.The MTA\u2019s plan has two phases. The first\u00a0focuses on the key reasons for delays, with a back-to-basics, but accelerated maintenance approach for the repair of subway cars, signal and track maintenance and station cleanliness. Mr. Lhota said 54% of delays are related to signal, track and power issues. More than 40% of the city\u2019s signals are over 50 years old.Mr. Lhota said the agency knows where its major signal failures are and it will concentrate its efforts on some 1,300 hot spots first. There will be 31 teams dedicated to targeting places with the highest rate of incidents, he said.The MTA will station dedicated repair teams around the city to reach problems faster. The MTA will add a shift to the repair and maintenance of subway cars, making that work 24 hours, seven days a week. Broken train car doors are the major reason for car breakdowns.Mr. Lhota identified water as a major source of problems for the subway system, and there will be an enhanced effort to seal the system, as well as clean out grates and drains. Station deep-cleans, currently every six weeks, will increase to every four weeks. Fixing tiles, broken windows, escalators and elevators is also a priority, he said.Customer communications will get an overhaul, too, with the old recorded messages replaced with detailed, clear information. The MTA will place more customer services representatives around the system and step-up the installation of countdown clocks in stations.The MTA will also roll out its own version of a performance management system, modeled after the CompStat program used by the New York Police Department. The plan also creates an emergency management operations center to monitor subway problems in real time.How the MTA responds to sick passengers will change, said Mr. Lhota, as the MTA adds dedicated medical technicians to certain stations around the city. Ill passengers caused some 34,000 delays last year. There will also be an \u201caggressive public awareness campaign\u201d to educate riders on the consequences of littering, a subject that has frustrated Mr. Lhota personally and which contributes to track fires, he said.To relieve overcrowding, the MTA plans to add cars where it can to certain lines and experiment with removing seats on some lines to make cars that are mostly standing-room only.All of the improvements will result in the addition of roughly 2,700 employees. When the financial crisis hit, Mr. Lhota said, some maintenance was cut and other maintenance cycles lengthened. When employees retired, they weren\u2019t replaced. This plan intends to replace some of those people and return some of those services.The second phase of the plan will address modernizing the system, focusing on a new signal system, new cars and communications. Mr. Lhota said the rough tab on those capital costs is $8 billion.\u2014Mara Gay contributed to this article.Write to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'MTA Will Speed Up Work to Fix Subway.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mta-unveils-836-million-subway-plan-1501016161", "keywords": ["delays,maintenance,mta,subway,track repair,Joseph Lhota,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 20:38:00", "news_title": "State Street Votes Against 400 Companies Citing Gender Diversity ", "content": "Index-fund giant             State Street        STT 1.88%       Global Advisors voted against the reelection of directors at 400 companies this year on grounds they failed to take steps to add women to their boards.The money manager, a unit of custody bank State Street Corp., said it discovered that 476 companies whose shares it owned lacked a single female board member. Of that group, the Boston-based firm said 400 companies failed to make any significant effort to address the issue, and voted against the reelection of directors charged with nominating new board members.State Street, which oversees more than $2.5 trillion in assets, had pledged in March to throw its weight behind the issue of gender diversity this year. At that time, State Street said a firm that doesn\u2019t have women on its board, for example, would have to prove to State Street it attempted to cast a wider net and set diversity goals.Primarily a manager of exchange-traded funds and other so-called passive investments, the firm targeted companies within Russell 3000 Index, the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 350 and S&P/ASX 300 in Australia.

Security Council to approve fresh punitive actions against North Korea in the aftermath of a July 4 test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile with the potential to reach Alaska.But amid complaints by the U.N.\u2019s own experts that sanctions compliance among the institution\u2019s member countries has been inadequate, many U.S. analysts say such a multilateral strategy has failed to put a dent in Mr. Kim\u2019s aspirations for a nuclear weapon that can strike the U.S.That is one reason Congress has rallied behind legislation that will require the administration to levy tougher sanctions against North Korea as part of a larger sanctions bill that also targets Russia and Iran. It also accounts in part for the unilateral U.S. action.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in the process of trying to elevate that pressure and change the calculus,\u201d Ms. Thornton said.China, a North Korean ally that shares a long border with the country, is the nation\u2019s biggest trade partner. Analysts say cutting off financing for Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program and military requires ratcheting up sanctions on Chinese banks, firms and individuals.\u201cThe Chinese are now very clear that we\u2019re going to go after Chinese entities if need be,\u201d Ms. Thornton said.The Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, but Beijing has said it opposes U.S. unilateral sanctions against North Korea.Although administration officials have said they are not targeting China\u2019s government, the State Department\u2019s senior East Asia official said Beijing needed to do \u201ca lot more work\u201d implementing U.N. sanctions, including stopping illicit cross-border trade flows and tracking financial transactions.But while many U.S.-based analysts are calling the administration to roll out a comprehensive sanctions strategy, Ms. Thornton said Washington will move gradually.\u201cRatcheting up sanctions pressure is not like a cobra strike, it\u2019s definitely a slow squeeze, a slow tightening of the screws,\u201d she told the subcommittee.In a major new phase of unilateral sanctions, the U.S. Treasury last month move to cut off Chinese Bank of Dandong from U.S. financial markets. The move, while only targeting one small bank, is meant to chill financing for North Korea more broadly by sending a signal to other institutions facilitating the regime that they could lose access to the world\u2019s most important financial market.But many U.S. analysts say only an Iran-style sanctions regime\u2014where the administration effectively cut off the flow of dollars into the country over the last decade\u2014will force Pyongyang to negotiate a halt to his nuclear and ballistic missile development.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. to Sanction Chinese Entities Over North Korea.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-readies-more-sanctions-against-chinese-entities-over-north-korea-1501028132", "keywords": ["north korea,north korea nuclear,United Nations,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 20:14:00", "news_title": "SunEdison Wins Final Approval for Bankruptcy Exit ", "content": "SunEdison\u00a0Inc.       won final court approval\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0of a bankruptcy-exit plan that wipes out billions of dollars in investments and renders the one-time renewable energy darling\u00a0a shadow of its former self.Following a hearing at the\u00a0U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York,\u00a0Judge Stuart Bernstein\u00a0said he would approve the plan, the culmination of nearly 15 months of hard-fought negotiations between\u00a0the solar-power developer\u00a0and its creditors.SunEdison is expected to formally emerge from bankruptcy by\u00a0Nov. 15, according to its lawyers.The vast majority of objections to the bankruptcy-exit plan were resolved ahead of\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0hearing.\u00a0AQR Capital Management LLC, which pressed its objection\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0but was\u00a0overruled, sought modifications to the plan because of a dispute over a $300 million rights offering, funding that the company says will serve as the backbone of its exit from chapter 11.Tony Clark, a lawyer representing SunEdison in court\u00a0Tuesday, called AQR \u201cnothing more than a disgruntled bidder.\u201dAnother objection from SunEdison\u2019s shareholders, who have already lost several battles seeking greater representation in the bankruptcy, was also overruled. SunEdison shares will be erased once the bankruptcy exit plan is implemented, a common fate for stock of public companies that file for bankruptcy.SunEdison\u2019s plan is broadly supported by creditors, nearly all of whom voted in favor of the proposal. The bankruptcy code requires both a creditor vote and a final say from a judge to fully enact a chapter 11 plan.Court papers show about 78% of the company\u2019s unsecured creditors, owed billions of dollars and set to recover only about 3% of those obligations, signaled their approval for the plan\u2019s terms. Second-lien lenders, another group of creditors that will take a substantial hit as a result of the bankruptcy, voted nearly unanimously to support the plan.Judge Bernstein said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that reaching a largely\u00a0consensual outcome was a \u201cremarkable feat\u201d given the \u201cvery difficult, contentious, complex case.\u201dSunEdison sought bankruptcy protection April 21, 2016, amid mounting debt, questions about accounting, failed deals and federal investigations.\u00a0At the time of its bankruptcy, SunEdison owed more than $8 billion.The company has since sold off its portfolio of projects and interests, which are in various stages of development, in an effort to pay back the debt. And though more than 35 asset sales generated proceeds of about $1.2 billion, a huge gulf of obligations will go unpaid.Creditors will also benefit from several key settlements\u00a0that were instrumental in smoothing out a tangle of complex disputes and stemming the potential for future litigation.\u00a0One such settlement produced an estimated $800 million worth of value from the sale of SunEdison\u2019s stake in two companies\u2014            TerraForm Power\u00a0Inc.      \u00a0and\u00a0            TerraForm Global\u00a0Inc.      \u2014that escaped its bankruptcy, but were part of the financial machinery that powered its growth.SunEdison is set to emerge from bankruptcy in drastically slimmed-down shape, tasked with managing remaining assets, such as tax refunds, but no longer operating a solar-power development business.\u2014-Peg Brickley contributed to this article.Write to Tom Corrigan at\u00a0tom.corrigan", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sunedison-wins-final-approval-for-bankruptcy-exit-1501028077", "keywords": ["bankruptcynews,bankruptcy plan,creditors,AQR Capital Management,SunEdison,SUNEQ,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,bankruptcy reorganization,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,renewable energy generation,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,electric utilities,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,solar energy,utilities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 20:12:00", "news_title": "Strong Demand Leads to Questions About New York Scholarship Program", "content": "New York state budgeted $87 million to fund its new Excelsior Scholarship this year so that roughly 23,000 students could attend public colleges tuition-free.The wrinkle: More than three times as many students applied for the award.The state says there won\u2019t be a shortfall in the end. It expects some of the applicants won\u2019t be eligible for the grant by the time funds are disbursed to schools at the end of the semester, as their grades may not be up to snuff, family income is too high or they will drop their commitment to stay in-state after graduation.\u201cWe still think our estimates are going to be close to what the accepted application rate is going to be,\u201d said New York State Budget Director       Robert Mujica,        citing rates of ineligibility for a more established tuition assistance program.Still,\u00a0      Robert Kelchen,        an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, said the outsized demand on limited state funds \u201cwill leave some students scrambling.\u201dWhile those with significant financial need still have access to federal and other state grants, many were banking on the Excelsior award to ease the financial burden of attending college.\u201cThis is really late in the cycle\u201d for students to be finalizing how they actually pay for school, he said, as classes start in about six weeks and many schools have depleted their institutional aid accounts.The scholarship, which is applied after federal and other state aid is exhausted, provides tuition-free access to SUNY and CUNY schools for full-time students from families earning $100,000 or less. The income cap will rise to $125,000 over three years, at which point the program will cost the state $163 million annually.After graduation, students must remain in New York for as many years as they received the benefit; if they leave, the grant reverts to a loan.More than 75,000 students applied in the window that closed\u00a0Friday, including 30,845 to CUNY colleges.\u201cWe are thrilled by the widespread interest in the program,\u201d said Abbey Fashouer, a spokeswoman for Gov.       Andrew Cuomo.       \u201cA central goal of this administration is making college affordable for our middle class, and we look forward to seeing this initiative help more students achieve their dreams of higher education both now and into the future.\u201dState education officials said the $87 million allotment would be \u201cmore than sufficient to cover the cost of all eligible students who will receive awards in the first year.\u201dMr. Mujica of the budget office said that because discussions on next year\u2019s budget will begin during the current school year, \u201cwe have time\u201d to know what the financial needs will be for next year, based on early indicators from the fall semester.Mr. Mujica said he doesn\u2019t expect New York will need to change its Excelsior eligibility requirements because of funding issues.Still, education experts say the imbalance between supply and demand illustrates a weakness of state-funded free-tuition programs: State funds are limited.Oregon officials announced last week that the state Legislature only approved $40 million of the $48 million it would need to cover its program for free tuition at community colleges over the next biennium. It is tightening eligibility requirements for the fall.The New York state program will get more expensive each year as multiple classes get scholarships and the income cap for eligibility rises.\u201cI think the [New York] governor\u2019s office has done a lousy job of doing its homework on how to design and execute a smart free-college program,\u201d said       Sara Goldrick-Rab,        a professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University.

Mr. Trump\u2019s team is also getting ready to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, though he said he still regards the pact as \u201cone of the truly bad deals.\u201dMr. Trump also said his administration\u2019s long-expected curbs on steel imports were still being discussed internally, though it may be some time before he acts on the issue.Ticking off what he sees as his accomplishments, Mr. Trump mentioned his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, his deregulatory efforts and changes at the Veterans Affairs Department, which has pushed to reduce wait times for patients needing care.Asked about disappointments, Mr. Trump made a reference to the health-care debate. \u201cI have to see where we are with this,\u201d he said in the hours before the Senate voted to advance the debate on its health-care bill. Besides a tax code overhaul this year, he said he placed a priority on improvements in the nation\u2019s infrastructure.His term so far also has been marked by investigations into what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a campaign backed by the Kremlin to influence the presidential campaign in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. Investigations in Congress and by special counsel Robert Mueller are looking into the Russian meddling and whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied. Russia has denied any interference.The Russia investigations often have stymied the White House\u2019s ability to make progress on its agenda, and Mr. Trump reiterated his recent criticism of Mr. Sessions.Mr. Trump on Tuesday blamed Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal as the reason the Justice Department named Mr. Mueller as special counsel. Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment came after Mr. Trump fired former FBI Director       James Comey,        who had been overseeing the investigation.When asked whether Mr. Mueller\u2019s job is safe, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cI have no comment yet, because it\u2019s too early. But we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re going to see.\u201dHe also declined to offer a vote of confidence in Mr. Sessions, who was one of the earliest Washington supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Mr. Sessions\u2019s endorsement was seen at the time as a tough blow to Trump rival Sen. Ted Cruz, who was counting on evangelical support in Southern states, including Alabama. Mr. Trump suggested that his own popularity in Alabama was the reason for Mr. Sessions\u2019 endorsement.Mr. Sessions backed Mr. Trump at a rally that drew tens of thousands in Mobile, Ala., one of the largest rallies of the campaign at that point. \u201cHe looks at the 40,000 people and he probably says, \u2018What do I have to lose?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement.\u201dA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.During the interview, Mr. Trump appeared relaxed in the company of close aides, which included his daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Communications Director       Anthony Scaramucci,        Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications, and Mr. Cohn.Mr. Trump praised the arrival of Mr. Scaramucci, who was appointed Friday, suggesting that he would help settle internal unrest and backbiting that has characterized the West Wing.He quipped that this type of palace intrigue was \u201cWhite House stuff, where they\u2019re fighting over who loves me the most.\u201d Mr. Trump said he has no other immediate changes planned for his senior staff.Mr. Scaramucci had endorsed two of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals during the primary campaign. Mr. Trump shrugged that off on Tuesday. He said Mr. Scaramucci offered his support before he was ready to enter the race. \u201cHis first choice was Trump,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to say that.\u201dAsked if Mr. Cohn was a candidate to become the next Federal Reserve chairman, Mr. Trump said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know this, but yes, he is.\u201dHe said he would wait until the end of the year to make a decision, even if it would require a confirmation hearing. He predicted that such a process would \u201cgo quickly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve known Gary for a long time, but I\u2019ve gained great respect for Gary working with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo Gary certainly would be in the mix.\u201dMr. Cohn responded by laughing, and placing his hands over his ears. \u201cThis is an interview with the president,\u201d he said, declining additional comment.Mr. Trump said he has \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Ms. Yellen, praising the decisions to keep interest rates low and crediting her for keeping the U.S. dollar \u201cnot too strong.\u201d \u201cShe is in the running to stay,\u201d he said.Turning to taxes, Mr. Trump echoed some of the populist themes from his presidential campaign. He described twin imperatives in overhauling the tax structure: boosting economic growth and easing the tax burden on middle-class families.\u201cI have wealthy friends that say to me, \u2018I don\u2019t mind paying more tax,\u2019 \u201d the president said.He added that \u201cwe have to take care of middle-income people in this country. They built the country. They started this whole beautiful thing that we have. And we have to take care of them. And people have not taken care of them, and we\u2019re going to.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s aides are working with top Republican lawmakers on a proposal that would bring about the first major rewrite of the tax code in 30 years. Mr. Trump and White House officials have been vague on significant middle-class provisions, such as the personal exemption, while promising specific benefits for high-income households such as the repeal of the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t elaborate Tuesday on how he planned to favor the middle class.On Iran, Mr. Trump said the administration had given Iran \u201cthe benefit of every doubt\u201d about their compliance with the 2015 multinational nuclear deal. The president must certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is in compliance with its obligations. The president made such a certification earlier this month.But when certification comes up again, Mr. Trump said he believes Iran will be judged not compliant with the agreement. He said he would be prepared to overrule his own advisers in proclaiming that Iran hasn\u2019t met the terms of the agreement.\u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely nice to them in saying they were compliant,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPersonally, I have great respect for my people, but if it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about the subject in 90 days but I would be surprised if they were in compliance.\u201dThe interview came hours before the Senate voted to advance health care legislation that in recent weeks had appeared stalled.Mr. Trump has suggested different approaches toward abolishing the Affordable Care Act signed into law seven years ago. At times he has called for letting Obamacare,as it is known, collapse before ushering in a replacement. At other times he has said the best strategy would be repealing the law and quickly approving a new system.GOP leaders have primarily pursued a strategy of repealing and replacing the health law simultaneously. In the interview, Mr. Trump said he preferred that option.The \u201ctrouble with [straight] repeal is you\u2019ll have millions of people out there that ... will say, \u2018Well, you know, how do we know we\u2019re going to have health care?\u2019 And I hate to do that to people,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cSo I\u2019d rather see replace. I\u2019d rather add the replace. And we have a very good plan.\u201d\u2014Richard Rubin and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Michael C.

It also publishes such fashion and beauty titles as InStyle and Marie Claire UK.In its 2016 annual report, Time Inc. said its U.K. operations generated $313 million in revenue, down from $370 million in 2015. The division\u2019s revenue represented 10% of the company\u2019s total 2016 revenue of almost $3.1 billion.It is unclear how much money Time Inc. may be able to get in a sale of the U.K. business.The decision to re-examine its brand portfolio comes as Time Inc. is betting more heavily on its digital and video future, and as its print advertising and circulation revenues continue to decline.Time Inc. shares had topped more than $19 earlier this year, when discussions were ongoing with potential suitors for the whole company, but now trade around $14.30, giving the company a market value of $1.4 billion.On Monday, Time Inc. said it was looking to sell a majority stake in Essence, the monthly African-American women\u2019s lifestyle publication focused on entertainment, fashion, beauty and culture.Separately, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Time Inc. is exploring the sale of three magazines\u2014Coastal Living, Sunset and Golf.

Martin, a senior counsel at Covington & Burling LLP who was formerly a top SEC official.The price of bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies, fell on the announcement. Bitcoin lost 7% of its value, trading at $2,592. Ether was also down 12% to $201, according to CoinDesk.The SEC report was related specifically to a coin offering that debuted last summer called DAO, which raised more than $150 million for an investment fund before a hacker exploited its code and stole $55 million. The commission decided against pursuing an enforcement action against the DAO\u2019s creators, but rather used the report to clarify its authority over the burgeoning market and to raise awareness of potential problems.The SEC report is just a \u201cshot across the bow,\u201d said Marco Santori, a partner at the law firm Cooley LLC, who has advised a number of startups on coin offerings. \u201cThe interesting question is not whether the DAO was a security - it was - it\u2019s whether the other stuff is a security.\u201dThe SEC wrote that he DAO became the functional equivalent to a share of stock because it offered investors the potential for a return on their investment.In an initial coin offering, a company, usually associated with the digital-currency sector, creates a bitcoin-like coin and offers it to the public. In effect, they are like a cross between traditional initial public offerings and crowd funding.These offerings have become more common this year, with more than 70 different startups using the structure to raise money.Many of the coins are designed to be used with an online service, and many of the more recent offerings have stressed that they are not equity or securities but \u201cutility coins,\u201d and do not carry any of the shareholder rights of equity or debt. Many startups even barred U.S. investors from their offerings, out of concern about how the SEC would rule on them.Tuesday, the SEC said \u201cthe definition of a security under the federal securities laws is broad, covering traditional notions \u2026 such as a stock or bond, as well as novel products or instruments where value may be represented and transferred in digital form.\u201dMany of the coin-offering tokens fell in value Tuesday before the SEC\u2019s report, and continued falling after it. Some were down 20% to 30%, according to Coinmarketcap.com . Specifically, Status was down 28%, iconomi was down 25%, veritaseum was down 22%. EOS was down 16%, and gnosis was down 15%. Of the top 50 coins by market value, 46 were in the red, the website said.The report doesn\u2019t exonerate all other initial coin offerings, or             ICO\u2019s      , that happened before the SEC weighed in with its view on the DAO, according to a person familiar with the agency\u2019s thinking. The SEC continues to scrutinize other initial coin offerings, the person said.Still, \u201cto the extent that the facts are similar enough, the SEC would be hard pressed to take enforcement action,\u201d said Michael Liftik, a former SEC enforcement lawyer who is now a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.While the commission was exerting its authority over the burgeoning investment method, it did acknowledge that there could be differences among the coins. Firms using tokens to raise cash in some cases would have to seek SEC approval for the offering and provide detailed financial disclosures if they market the deal to the general public.\u201cThe innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.Write to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com and Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Digital Coin Sales Set Off SEC Alarm.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-it-will-patrol-red-hot-virtual-coin-offerings-1501017684", "keywords": ["currencies,digital tokens,ico,initial coin offerings,sec,vc regulatory,Covington & Burling,Stephanie Avakian,David B.H.

Any Cabinet appointee serves at a President\u2019s pleasure, but the deeply troubling aspect of this exercise is Mr. Trump\u2019s hardly veiled intention: the commencement of a criminal prosecution of       Hillary Clinton       by the Department of Justice and the firing of special prosecutor       Robert Mueller.On Tuesday morning Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Sessions \u201chas taken a very weak position on       Hillary Clinton crimes.      \u201d This might play well with the red-meat crowd in Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitterverse, but Sen.       Lindsey Graham       was explicit and correct in describing the legal line Mr. Trump had crossed.\u201cProsecutorial decisions should be based on applying facts to the law without hint of political motivation,\u201d Sen. Graham said. \u201cTo do otherwise is to run away from the long-standing American tradition of separating the law from politics regardless of party.\u201d Republican Sen.       Thom Tillis       also came to Mr. Sessions\u2019 defense, citing his \u201cunwavering commitment to the rule of law,\u201d and Sen.       Richard Shelby       called him \u201ca man of integrity.\u201dWe will put the problem more bluntly. Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that his Attorney General prosecute his defeated opponent is the kind of crude political retribution one expects in       Erdogan\u2019s       Turkey or Duterte\u2019s Philippines.Mr. Sessions had no way of knowing when he accepted the AG job that the Russia probe would become the firestorm it has, or that his belated memory of brief, public meetings with the Russian ambassador in 2016 would require his recusal from supervising the probe. He was right to step back once the facts were out, not the least to shelter the Trump Administration from any suspicion of a politicized investigation.If Mr. Trump wants someone to blame for the existence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, he can pick up a mirror. That open-ended probe is the direct result of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director       James Comey       months into his Russia investigation and then tweet that Mr. Comey should hope there are no Oval Office tapes of their meeting. That threat forced Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       to appoint a special counsel.As a candidate, Mr. Trump thought he could say anything and get away with it, and most often he did. A sitting President is not a one-man show. He needs allies in politics and allies to govern. Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of Jeff Sessions makes clear that he will desert both at peril to his Presidency.No matter how powerful the office of the Presidency, it needs department leaders to execute policy. If by firing or forcing out Jeff Sessions Mr. Trump makes clear that his highest priority is executing personal political desires or whims, he will invite resignations from his first-rate Cabinet and only political hacks will stand in to replace them. And forget about Senate confirmation of his next AG.Even on the day that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was scraping together enough Republican votes to avoid a humiliating defeat for the President on health care, Mr. Trump was causing Senators to publicly align themselves with Mr. Sessions. Past some point of political erosion, Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative agenda will become impossible to accomplish. Mr. Trump prides himself as a man above political convention, but there are some conventions he can\u2019t ignore without destroying his Presidency.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-sessions-abuse-1501026895", "keywords": ["Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 19:49:00", "news_title": "Caterpillar Boosts Outlook, Signaling Cautious Optimism in Recovery", "content": "Caterpillar Inc.        CAT -0.89%       signaled cautious optimism about global growth, offering fresh evidence that many markets are in rebound mode after a yearslong slump.The world\u2019s largest heavy-machinery maker, an economic bellwether, in its second-quarter earnings report Tuesday highlighted growing demand in China\u2019s construction sector and a revitalization of the mining industry. The company boosted its earnings outlook for the year, despite sluggish infrastructure spending in the U.S. and weakness in Brazil and the Middle East.The Peoria, Ill., maker of bulldozers and mining trucks said it expects revenue of $42 billion to $44 billion for 2017, up from a previous forecast of as much as $41 billion.If that prediction is borne out, it would be Caterpillar\u2019s first year-over-year revenue increase since 2012.The upbeat earnings report was one of many that helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 100.26 points, or 0.5%, to 21613.43. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed at new records.DuPont Co.       and             United States Steel Corp.       also topped expectations, due to improved demand for products ranging from soybean seeds to flat-rolled steel.\u201cThis is the first time since the Great Recession ended that we\u2019re seeing a synchronized global recovery and that\u2019s what the markets are keying on right now,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \u201cIn some past years, whenever the U.S. was doing well, Europe wasn\u2019t and vice versa. Now everyone seems to be more on the same page.\u201dA stabilization of commodity prices has put major developing economies like China, Brazil, Russia and Nigeria on stronger footing after they were hit by a commodity-price plunge in 2014.An International Monetary Fund index of global commodity prices has risen nearly 27% since hitting a 12-year low in 2016. The World Bank projected last month that, by next year, global economic growth would reach a seven-year high.And stability in global manufacturing has been widespread. None of the top-15 trading partners for the U.S. were contracting in June, said Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.Industrial output in the U.S. has risen steadily, climbing for the past five months, thanks in part to renewed oil and gas production to feed global demand.The Federal Reserve\u2019s measure of industrial production in June was the strongest since February 2015. That has helped the U.S. economy add 581,000 jobs in the second quarter despite a slowdown in consumer spending and job losses in the retail sector.Caterpillar\u2019s U.S. payroll grew to 48,500 employees by the end of June, an increase of 2,000 over the previous three months, and Caterpillar is hiring at factories in Illinois, Indiana and Arkansas.But there are doubts the recovery will be sustained. Caterpillar executives noted that revenue increases in some sectors, particularly mining, followed years of steep declines and that sales were still off their highs from earlier in the decade.The company said it is expecting strengthening demand for excavators in China in response to government spending on public-works projects, a pickup in the North American natural-gas industry and increasing sales of replacement parts for mining equipment as fewer trucks remain idle.Geopolitical uncertainty and commodity-price volatility still pose risks to Caterpillar\u2019s rosy outlook. Executives declined to speculate how the company might fare next year and beyond.Caterpillar\u2019s second-quarter revenue jumped 10% from the year-earlier period to $11.3 billion, and profit of $802 million beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations.Shares rose $6.36, or 5.9%, to $114.54, contributing about 44 points to the DJIA\u2019s gain.Solid corporate earnings have supported major stock indexes this year, helping them climb to records. Companies in the S&P 500 are poised to report earnings growth of 7.8% in the second quarter from the year-earlier period, according to FactSet, building on gains from the first quarter, when firms posted their strongest results since 2011.A weakening dollar could further boost profits at multinational corporations and, in turn, lift the stock market through the second half.Sales of construction equipment in North America, Caterpillar\u2019s largest market, rose 3% in the second quarter. But U.S. government spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure was lackluster, executives said.\u201cThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment,\u201d Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer       Brad Halverson       said.While Caterpillar\u2019s revenue from construction equipment rose 11% overall in the quarter, sales decreased 5% in the region including Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Latin American sales rose 31% as several economies there showed signs of improvement, but Brazil remains a weak spot, executives said.Signs of turnaround in Caterpillar\u2019s retail segment emerged in the first quarter. That trend continued as retail sales of Caterpillar machinery increased 7% world-wide during the three months ended June 30.Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.26 in adjusted earnings per share.\u2014Akane Otani and Austen Hufford contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Caterpillar Boosts Outlook On Signs of Global Upturn.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/caterpillar-sees-improving-construction-demand-1500985613", "keywords": ["caterpillar,caterpillar earnings,caterpillar profit,construction demand,earnings,earnings outlook,earnings season,Caterpillar,CAT,Jim Umpleby,financial performance,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,industrial production,economic news,machinery,construction machinery,basic materials,resources,industrial goods,mining,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 19:45:00", "news_title": "A GOP Gallows Reprieve", "content": "Louisiana Republican John Kennedy cracked to Politico this week that \u201cthe sight of the gallows focuses the mind,\u201d and perhaps that explains why after months of group therapy Senate Republicans finally voted Tuesday to open debate on repealing ObamaCare. Whatever the impetus, the vote kept GOP reform hopes alive and may have saved the GOP Congress.The 51-50 vote\u2014with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking the tie\u2014was as close as it gets but vindicates Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to force Senators to be accountable. Maine Senator       Susan Collins\u2019s       defection was expected, and at least she was consistent with her opposition to repeal in 2015.The same can\u2019t be said for Alaska\u2019s       Lisa Murkowski,        who also voted against allowing even a debate on repeal. We look forward to her explaining how this squares with her May 2016 press release in which she \u201ccalled for action in the Senate to repeal and fix this unworkable law.\u201d She added that \u201cwhile a full repeal of the law would be the best course of action, it is simply not possible under the Obama Administration.\u201d Apparently she only meant that when her vote didn\u2019t matter.Democrats continued their pattern of total resistance, but Mr. McConnell corralled every other Republican to pass the bill under the Senate\u2019s arcane reconciliation rules.       John McCain       made a heroic entrance after his recent diagnosis with brain cancer to cast a necessary vote. And perhaps his fortitude inspired reluctant colleagues to take responsibility after seven years of repeal promises.Ron Johnson of Wisconsin cast the 50th vote, though only after a visibly tense conversation on the Senate floor with Mr. McConnell. Mr. Johnson has been unhappy with the Majority Leader\u2019s consultation, and he fears the bill won\u2019t repeal as much of the law as it should. But Mr. Johnson has always said that ObamaCare propelled him to leave private business and run for the Senate in 2010, and killing debate would have blocked any chance at even partial repeal.The Senate will now move to debate and an amendment vote-a-rama, and where that ends nobody knows. One vote to watch would repeal ObamaCare with a two-year window to replace it, which is similar to a bill that 51 Senate Republicans voted for in 2015. We\u2019ll see how many have changed their minds.The GOP will need enormous discipline to defeat poison-pill amendments\u2014from Democrats and maybe some Republicans\u2014to emerge with a bill that can get 50 votes at the end of the debate. Toward that end GOP leaders began floating the possibility of passing a \u201cskinny bill\u201d version of reform. This could include killing the individual and employer mandates and perhaps the medical-device tax. But it would not include the House bill\u2019s biggest prize, which is Medicaid reform.This would be disappointing, but it beats failure and would allow the bill to go to a House-Senate conference. Republicans could then work out how much reform the politics will bear. They might keep in mind that the political gallows they avoided on Tuesday can always be reconstructed\u2014and will be if they renege on this core campaign promise.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gop-gallows-reprieve-1501026341", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 19:44:00", "news_title": "Khosla Bets on AI for Robots That Handle \u2018Uncertainty\u2019", "content": "Manufacturing companies of all types dream big about putting robots on their assembly lines, but few industries outside the automotive sector actually are doing it today.Some visionaries in the robotics community say the missing piece in the technology puzzle is giving machines the degree of artificial intelligence needed to make human-type judgments, such as quality control or dealing with unforeseen production hiccups.Khosla Ventures led a group of investors in putting $50 million behind an AI startup that is dedicated to filling that technological gap.\u201cThat\u2019s intelligence enabled by a new style of machine learning,\u201d said Khosla Ventures\u2019s namesake founder, Vinod Khosla. \u201cThat\u2019s what is exciting about Vicarious.\u201dVicarious Inc., which just closed the Series C round, aims to deliver the robotics industry an AI platform that would make it easier for machines to not only learn to do tasks but also to respond effectively to solve problems autonomously when confronted with \u201cuncertainty.\u201d\u201cWe want to move the world of robots beyond just one-off scripts for single-purpose work cells to more general-purpose intelligent machines that can do a lot of tasks,\u201d said Vicarious co-founder       D.

Mr. Shkreli said Monday that he wouldn\u2019t testify. Closing arguments are scheduled to take place Thursday; the jury could get the case before the end of the week.Prosecutors allege that Mr. Shkreli, 34 years old, misled investors in two hedge funds he ran and, with Mr. Greebel\u2019s help, looted Retrophin to cover millions of dollars in hedge-fund losses.\u201cRetrophin itself isn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing, and the company has sued Mr. Shkreli for $65 million.\u201d Mr. Shkreli was ousted as Retrophin\u2019s chief executive in 2014, and Mr. Greebel\u2014a former law-firm partner\u2014is no longer the company\u2019s outside counsel.During the four-week trial, prosecutors have presented evidence that, even as Mr. Shkreli was reassuring investors that they were earning strong returns, his funds had almost no money left and had ceased trading activity.Mr. Greebel has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. He is scheduled to go on trial later this year. Mr. Greebel\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t immediately provide comment.Several months after warning Mr. Shkreli about his plan to buy Retrophin stock, Mr. Greebel wrote to Mr. Shkreli about finding a source of unrestricted shares to settle the claims of an investor in one of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s hedge funds, MSMB Healthcare, according to emails presented in court Tuesday.\u201cTake from anyone\u2014I don\u2019t care\u2014do the math?\u201d Mr. Shkreli responded.When another investor threatened to sue, citing \u201cbroken deals and broken promises,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Shkreli told Mr. Greebel to talk the investor \u201cdown from the ledge\u201d and offer a \u201csweetener\u201d in the form of additional Retrophin shares.At times, Mr. Shkreli insulted Mr. Greebel and threatened to fire him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do your job,\u201d Mr. Shkreli wrote to Mr. Greebel, in March 2013, after learning that he hadn\u2019t delivered a Retrophin consulting agreement. \u201cYou embarrass me.\u201dBut the emails also showed how Messrs. Shkreli and Greebel managed communications with investors and hammered out settlement and consulting agreements to satisfy investors\u2019 demands for redemptions.Mr. Brafman left open the possibility that he may decide to call witnesses. But it is common for the defense not to put forward any witnesses of its own. The burden of proof lies with the government, and the defense has no obligation to present a case.Throughout the trial, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers have sought to undermine the credibility of government witnesses, including millionaire investors from Dallas, pharmaceutical industry leaders and former employees. They have described the government\u2019s view of the alleged frauds as myopic, not taking into account the inherent risks assumed by investors in a hedge fund.The defense also has tried to strip away sympathy for the investors who testified, emphasizing that most eventually got their money back and in some cases tripled their investments through the sale of Retrophin stock.Defendants rarely take the stand in their own defense, as it exposes them to cross-examination. In Mr. Shkreli\u2019s case, prosecutors would have been free to explore before the jury some of the behavior that has made Mr. Shkreli infamous, such as raising the price of a drug used to treat people with AIDS from $13.50 to $750 a pill, his use of Twitter and his $2-million purchase of an album by the Wu-Tang Clan.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecution-in-martin-shkreli-case-presents-final-evidence-1501025886", "keywords": ["drug company executive,fbi,federal case,martin shkreli,retrophin,trial,Retrophin,RTRX,Martin Shkreli,corporate crime,legal action,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,securities fraud,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,health care,life sciences,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 19:37:00", "news_title": "Greece and the Market", "content": "After three years of political and economic upheaval in Greece, Tuesday\u2019s sale of \u20ac3 billion ($3.5 billion) of five-year government bonds is good news. Never mind that this puts Greece exactly where it was before those three years of political and economic upheaval.Athens priced the bond issue at 4.625%, some 0.33 of a percentage point lower than the last time it sold bonds, in 2014. It will use the newly raised money to retire debt maturing in 2019, reducing the possibility of another bailout showdown when those payments would come due.The issue\u2019s success is more a testament to investors\u2019 continuing thirst for yield than a market vote of confidence in Athens. As in 2014, Greece remains burdened by a European Union bailout that prioritizes fiscal balance over deregulation and economic growth. It\u2019s further saddled with a political class that\u2019s not committed to implementing the policy reforms that are part of the bailout.This time might be different, if only because Greek politicians and voters have been so beaten down by the traumas of 2015 that it\u2019s hard to see where opposition to the current bailout might arise. The rise to power of Prime Minister       Alexis Tsipras       and the far-left Syriza party at least allowed voters to test the theory that a daring leader could challenge the EU\u2019s fiscal strictures.

But one sign of similar irrational exuberance has them spooked: Since 2015 Chinese companies have gone on a buying spree for trophy assets much like the Japanese did three decades ago.Beijing has blocked several big deals this year, leading to a dramatic decline in transactions. Regulators also warned banks last month to stop lending to five private conglomerates that have spent $57 billion on foreign hotels, entertainment companies and other assets over the past two years. The government actions caused investors to sell off the companies\u2019 stocks and bonds.One concern is that Chinese companies are overpaying and lack the expertise to manage the assets, much like the Japanese in the 1980s. The Wanda Group paid a startling $3.5 billion last year for Legendary Entertainment, the Hollywood studio that produced \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201c300.\u201d It has since made several flops, including the China-themed \u201cGreat Wall.\u201d That\u2019s reminiscent of             Sony\u2019s       disastrous 1989 purchase of Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion, most of which was written off in the 1990s.Anbang Group, an insurance-led conglomerate, has paid eye-watering prices for buildings in Manhattan. That recalls             Mitsubishi Estate\u2019s       $1.4 billion deal for 80% of Rockefeller Plaza. Five years later it turned over the stake to its creditors to avoid default, losing $600 million.In both Japan and now in China, loose monetary policy and a weak dollar started the trend. In order to prevent their currencies from appreciating too much against the dollar, Beijing and Tokyo encouraged companies to acquire foreign assets.The parallel isn\u2019t exact, since China\u2019s outbound investment boom started relatively late in the cycle. The frothiest deals came after 2015, when the value of the yuan peaked. Companies are also acting rationally to reduce their exposure to an overvalued yuan by stocking up on dollar assets. There\u2019s also a uniquely Chinese political aspect, as some of the most risk-prone companies boast political connections that allow them better access to credit.That doesn\u2019t mean Beijing can be sanguine. Capital flight carries its own risks, and Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the five companies is part of a wider effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating too rapidly.The Chinese government can avoid a Japan-style lost decade if it takes the right lesson from this episode. While Beijing may be able to rein in its companies\u2019 foreign deals, that doesn\u2019t mean the danger is over. Their acquisition mania is a symptom of an economy whose fundamentals are out of kilter.The excessive risk-taking by companies has its roots in government policy. As regulators play Whac-a-Mole with systemic risks, China\u2019s government continues to prop up economic growth with fiscal and monetary stimulus. That has caused debt to grow at twice the rate of GDP.

But many of the Obama appointee\u2019s midnight rule-makings need not see the light of day\u2014for instance, his arbitrary ban on mandatory arbitration that the House voted to repeal on Tuesday.The Congressional Review Act lets a majority of both chambers rescind a final agency rule issued in the past 60 legislative days. The 231-190 House vote overturns the CFPB\u2019s new rule prohibiting class-action waivers in virtually all financial consumer-service agreements. Twenty-four GOP Senators have introduced a similar resolution.Mr. Cordray said the ban would protect consumers, but his own agency\u2019s study suggests otherwise. Consumers who prevailed in arbitration recovered on average $5,389 while those who joined class actions received $32. Trial lawyers on average raked in $1 million.Most claims can\u2019t be litigated on a class basis\u2014though trial attorneys try\u2014and arbitration provides an affordable and expeditious alternative. Companies typically pick up most if not all of the filing, administrative and arbitrator costs. Consumers usually obtain relief within two months, while class actions typically take years to resolve.The rule would cause many firms to stop using arbitration since they would have to spend more defending class actions. The CFPB estimates that financial companies would spend between $2.62 billion and $5.23 billion over the next five years\u2014much of which would go to attorneys\u2014to defend some 6,000 class actions.Ohio Senator       Sherrod Brown,        another plaintiff-bar favorite, cites             Wells Fargo,       which was found to have opened millions of unauthorized accounts in the names of its customers. But Wells Fargo agreed to settle the case on a class basis for $142 million\u2014twice as much as estimated consumer out-of-pocket losses\u2014because arbitrating individual disputes could have cost much more. The bank also paid $185 million to regulators and agreed to refund fees for unauthorized accounts.Mr. Cordray wants to build a nationwide plaintiff-lawyer fund-raising base for his Ohio campaign. And he may hope that a few Republican Senators like South Carolina\u2019s       Lindsey Graham       will sink the repeal resolution for their trial-bar campaign donors. But if Republicans stand together on repeal, the CFPB would be prohibited from ever issuing a similar rule.

The industrial metal used for manufacturing and construction has increased in 10 of the past 12 sessions and is up 14% in 2017.Copper got an additional boost Monday after the International Monetary Fund increased its growth expectations for China in 2017 and 2018 while leaving its forecast for the global economy unchanged and trimming its forecast for the U.S. The IMF also raised its growth estimates for Europe and Japan.On Tuesday, copper eclipsed its previous 2017 high from February. Back then, strikes at mines and hopes that Mr. Trump would quickly push through an infrastructure plan had extended a rally that started in October. Around February, nervousness that a U.S. infrastructure package could take longer than expected and concerns over China and supply caused copper to start to retreat. Prices fell 10% by early May.Since the low in May, prices are up 14%, getting a boost from supply threats and a brighter outlook on the strength of the world economy, particularly in emerging markets, according to investors and analysts.\u201cEven in the absence of the U.S.\u2019s increased expenditure on infrastructure, global infrastructure spending remains very strong\u201d driven by robust Chinese demand, said       Nitesh Shah,        a commodities strategist at asset-management firm ETF Securities.A report from             Citigroup Inc.       on Monday showed that Chinese imports of refined copper rose from a month earlier. China accounts for nearly half of the world\u2019s copper consumption, and its faster-than-expected economic growth and increase in industrial production have helped drive prices higher.Caterpillar Inc.       reported Tuesday that Chinese demand for equipment to carry out infrastructure projects fueled a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue from the previous year. Shares of the manufacturer posted their highest close since March 2012.Meanwhile, investors are monitoring Chinese monetary policy for signs of tightening, which could slow demand for copper.Many analysts have also said they will watch closely how mine disruptions affect supply. Strikes at copper mines in Chile and Indonesia have swung prices this year and could lead to short-term price volatility, analysts said. Strikes often boost metals prices as they crimp production.On Thursday, the International Copper Study Group released data for April showing that world refined copper usage exceeded production for the second straight month.Hedge funds and other speculators are positioned for further gains in the metal. Net bullish bets on copper futures by the group rose to the highest level in five months in the week ended July 18, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Bullish bets outnumbered bearish ones by 74,233, the most since Feb. 21.Many investors now have doubts that Mr. Trump will be able to unleash a huge infrastructure package soon. However, political uncertainty in the U.S. has spurred a retreat in the dollar. That is adding to support for the prices of copper and other metals, since a weaker dollar tends to help dollar-denominated commodities by making them more affordable for holders of other currencies.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that a big, extensive infrastructure program is in the cards anytime soon,\u201d said       Bart Melek,        head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. \u201cPeople are still thinking that it\u2019s a possibility, but it\u2019s one that is diminishing.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Copper\u2019s July contracts rose to $2.8405 on Tuesday.

He said that \u201cthere may be things that we do with the U.K. that are not covered by the EU\u201d under current trading arrangements.During the interview, Mr. Trump also said his administration\u2019s long-anticipated curbs on steel imports were still being discussed internally, and that it may be some time before he takes any action\u2014perhaps after higher-priority agenda items like overhauling the tax code get completed.Earlier this year, Mr. Trump and his Commerce Secretary,       Wilbur Ross,        had said they would look to impose new steel protections in the name of \u201cnational security\u201d by the end of June. But that timetable slipped amid objections from trading partners, domestic steel users, and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own aides.Asked about the status of the tariffs, Mr. Trump said \u201cwe don\u2019t want to do it at this moment.\u201d He added that \u201cwe\u2019re waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure,\u201d a sequencing that suggests steel action may not take place for months.\u201cThe president said he\u2019s waiting for more and more information,\u201d the White House official said in explaining the delay. The official added that Mr. Trump is focused on \u201cgetting things done right, and in an order that makes sense.\u201d He then said: \u201cThe first priority for the president and his agenda is tax reform.\u201dTalk of forging a U.S.-U.K. deal works politically for both sides, allowing Mr. Trump to point to deals that could create jobs for Americans and Mr. Fox, a strong opponent of British membership of the European Union, to point to a deal as the sort of agreement that would be impossible with the U.K. inside the EU. Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for working with an independent Britain marks a sharp turn from the perspective of his predecessor,       Barack Obama,        who threatened the U.K. before the June 2016 vote that a Brexit would force the U.K. to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for trade talks.The U.K. talks allow Mr. Trump to show progress in his quest to expand trade under certain circumstances he deems in America\u2019s interest\u2014not just imposing new trade barriers or trying to rip up or rewrite existing pacts\u2014and to pursue the kind of bilateral trade deal he favors over multilateral agreements. The U.K.\u2019s enthusiasm for negotiating a bilateral agreement with the Trump administration contrasts with other trading partners, like Japan, which has been cool to similar overtures.Britain\u2019s membership of the EU\u2014a customs union that sets common external tariffs\u2014means it can\u2019t negotiate in detail a trade deal until it leaves the EU, which will likely happen in March 2019.EU members haven\u2019t objected to the U.K. scoping out the prospect for post-Brexit trade deals, which it has also explored with countries like Australia, New Zealand and India. But any U.S.-U.K. deal would also need to be considered in light of what the post-Brexit trade environment between the EU and U.K. would look like.In particular, the British government appears to have reached a consensus that a transition period of some years will be necessary to minimize the trade disruption with the EU, which accounts for about 44% of British exports compared with around 17% for the U.S. (The U.S. is one of the few major economies with which Britain runs a trade surplus.)The transition is likely to include continued British membership of the EU\u2019s customs union, which would mean the U.K. couldn\u2019t enter into any deal with the U.S. until 2022 at the earliest.The U.S. would certainly require access for its farm products\u2014including chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-fed meat, and GMO crops that are controversial in the U.K. as elsewhere in Europe. Meantime, the U.K. would seek access to the U.S. for its financial-services industry, which the U.S. Treasury opposed for the now-moribund trade agreement the Obama administration was negotiating with the EU.While pursuing the new trade deal with Britain, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is also preparing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.Mr. Trump instructed his aides to try to rewrite the 23-year-old pact after he weighed pulling out altogether back in April. But he made clear in the interview that he still holds the agreement in disdain\u2014calling it \u201cone of the truly bad deals,\u201d and said he still reserves the right to pull the U.S. out if the talks don\u2019t satisfy him.\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a renegotiation right now,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see. And maybe we\u2019ll have to terminate.\u201dAsked if he thought the pact was salvageable, he answered: \u201cit may be salvageable\u2026I have an obligation to give it a shot.\u201d\u2014Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Jacob M.

Sprint                   Corp. last month launched an offer that promised a year of free wireless service.AT&T countered those deals with bundle offers designed to keep customers satisfied with savings from combined phone, TV and internet service. The company lost another 199,000 video customers in the U.S., though its new DirecTV Now streaming service gained 152,000 subscribers to end the quarter with 491,000 accounts.Mr. Stephens said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of DirecTV Now customers were bundling the online TV package with wireless service. About half of them had no traditional pay-TV at all before signing up for the streaming service, he added. The gains weren\u2019t enough to grow AT&T\u2019s total video customer base, which stayed flat at 25.2 million.AT&T is counting on bundled-service offers to stanch customer losses that have sapped its top line for two years.The company, already the biggest pay-television operator in the U.S. since it acquired satellite provider DirecTV, is now looking to addTime Warner Inc.       to the fold, which would give the Dallas company high-profile media brands including CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio.The company is still waiting for government authorities to approve the deal, worth $85 billion when it was announced last year.

The company ended the quarter with 136.5 million U.S. wireless subscribers.The results followed last week\u2019s quarterly report from T-Mobile US Inc., which showed the No. 3 domestic carrier had added 786,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the latest period. The No. 1 U.S. carrier by subscribers, Verizon Communications Inc., will report its results on Thursday.AT&T\u2019s overall second-quarter profit rose 15% to $3.92 billion, or 63 cents a share. Excluding merger and integration costs and other items, profit rose to 79 cents a share, from 72 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell 1.7% to $39.84 billion, its third consecutive quarterly decline.The company\u2019s Latin American operations helped improve those results.

PKF Hong Kong can reapply after three years.In 2015, the Chinese affiliates of the Big Four accounting firms\u2014PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, KPMG and Ernst & Young\u2014paid $2 million in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over their past refusal to turn over documents.Write to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-audit-regulator-sanctions-hong-kong-based-accounting-firm-1501023381", "keywords": ["auditing ,crowe horwath ,sanctions ,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,independent advisory bodies,politics,international relations,domestic politics,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:49:00", "news_title": "Petronas Ends Canadian LNG Project", "content": "Malaysia\u2019s state-owned energy company said Tuesday it was ending its multibillion-dollar plan to build a natural-gas export terminal on Canada\u2019s west coast, saying prolonged low natural-gas prices doomed the project.The decision marks a major setback in Canada\u2019s attempt to build up its capacity in the liquefied natural gas market, which is now dominated by the U.S., Australia and Qatar. It also brings an end to one of the biggest proposed energy ventures in recent years: The project had a total price-tag of 36 billion Canadian dollars ($28 billion). It was the subject of an exhaustive environmental assessment that didn\u2019t conclude until the fall of last year, and a hotly contested foreign-investment review earlier this decade.Petroliam Nasional Bhd., better known as Petronas, said it judged the Pacific NorthWest LNG venture couldn\u2019t be economically competitive in the present marketplace.\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe we had that mix where the sweet spot could be hit. So we decided to stop the project,\u201d said       Mohd Anuar Taib,        chairman of the Pacific NorthWest venture and a senior Petronas executive, on a conference call Tuesday. \u201cWe are disappointed that the extremely challenging environment brought about by the prolonged depressed prices and shift in the LNG industry has led to this decision.\u201dThe proposed LNG export terminal would have been located in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, a port town nearly 1,000 miles north of Vancouver.Mr. Taib said the decision wasn\u2019t linked to the new left-leaning government in the province. The new British Columbia government has been more skeptical about the benefits of LNG development, compared with its predecessor.A representative for British Columbia Premier       John Horgan       wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.The project\u2019s fate has been under a cloud of uncertainty for some time, with The Wall Street Journal reporting in August 2016 that Petronas was considering a delay due to concerns about oversupply and cheap competing fuels. The federal government completed its environmental review just last fall and said the terminal could proceed subject to nearly 200 conditions.Mr. Taib told reporters Pacific NorthWest had met all of the environmental conditions set by the federal and provincial governments.Policy makers in British Columbia outlined plans in 2012 to become a global LNG player. Since then C$20 billion has been spent to develop export projects in the province. Canada produces more natural gas than it needs to meet domestic demand.The bid to become a world-class LNG player came at a time when Canadian officials, under former Prime Minister       Stephen Harper,        tried to position the country as an energy superpower. But policy goals have shifted due to a combination of lower commodity prices and the rise to power of Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau,        who has put a higher priority on fighting climate change.Getting projects off the ground has also proved a challenge in Canada. Of the 18 LNG export licenses approved by Canada\u2019s energy regulator, only one LNG project in British Columbia\u2014Woodfibre LNG Ltd, a subsidiary of Pacific Oil & Gas Ltd.\u2014is under construction.In contrast, U.S. companies have moved more quickly than their Canadian competitors to build export facilities. There are seven such facilities under construction, while another four have received regulatory approval but aren\u2019t yet under construction, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Fourteen others have submitted applications to FERC to build billion-dollar export-terminal facilities, which chill gas to a liquid state, making it more efficient to ship.\u201cIf LNG in North America was a race, Canada is losing pretty badly,\u201d said       Jackie Forrest,        director of research at Arc Energy Research Institute in Calgary.However, she added all projects globally are currently under pressure from low spot prices and a glut of gas. \u201cIn this way Canada is not unique,\u201d she said.Work on the Pacific NorthWest venture dates back to 2012, when Petronas made a bid to take over Canadian firm Progress Energy Resources Corp., and gain control over one of the richest gas reserves on the continent. Petronas\u2019s takeover attempt was originally rejected by the former Conservative government under Canada\u2019s foreign-investment regime, but later approved after the company was allowed to resubmit its application.\u2014Christopher Matthews in Houston contributed to this article.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and David George-Cosh at david.george-cosh@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/petronas-ends-canadian-lng-project-1501011743", "keywords": [" british columbia,lng terminal, natural gas, shelved,Petroliam Nasional Bhd,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,liquefied,compressed gas,integrated oil,gas"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:48:00", "news_title": "Brexit and the Disunited Kingdom", "content": "I met last week with Robin Niblett, director of the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs, widely known as Chatham House. It was a bracing discussion.Regarding his country\u2019s domestic scene,       Mr. Niblett       said that \u201cI\u2019ve never seen British politics as chaotic as it is now.\u201d The two major parties, he declared, are \u201ctearing themselves apart.\u201d The disastrous snap election undermined Conservative Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       authority. If she had prevailed by the margin she expected when she called it, many new members of Parliament would have supported her approach to Brexit. Instead, more than half of the Conservatives\u2019 diminished parliamentary ranks probably favor remaining in the European Union. Although a leadership challenge could occur this fall, there is no obvious candidate around whom the party is prepared to rally.Many MPs from the opposition Labour Party were as disappointed by the election results as were the Tories. They had hoped that a poor outcome would help them oust their hard-left leader,       Jeremy Corbyn,        whom they regard as an inconceivable prime minister. Instead, they got the worst possible outcome: Labour\u2019s performance was strong enough to undercut the anti-Corbyn effort but too weak to form a government. In Mr. Niblett\u2019s view, Labour probably will be stuck with Mr. Corbyn for the next five years, during which the party will continue to struggle with the tension between its upscale, urban-based professional supporters and anti-immigration, pro-Brexit working-class voters in Northern England.This disarray comes at the worst possible time, because there is serious business to be done on a tight timetable. As things now stand, the U.K. and EU have less than two years to negotiate the terms of their separation. Because Prime Minister May\u2019s authority is so diminished, it will be impossible for Britain to do so from a position of strength. Instead, each step will have to be fought out among contending Conservative factions as well as outside forces. The business community, for example, is intensifying its pressure on cabinet ministers to shape a post-Brexit world compatible with its core interests.The British public is gradually awakening to the implications of its decision to leave the EU. As with all hangovers, it is not much fun. The public\u2019s desire to have its cake and eat it too is giving way to reality. \u201cThere is only one Brexit,\u201d declared Mr. Niblett\u2014hard Brexit. If Brexit goes through, Britain will not be a member of the common market or the customs union. If it wants to end the free flow of labor from EU countries and regain sovereignty over its own affairs, Britain will have to pay the price.Because this price is higher than many people understood a year ago, said Mr. Niblett, \u201cThere is a sense emerging that Brexit may not go through.\u201d While separation from Europe remains the most likely outcome, the current Parliament lacks the authority to ratify the eventual deal. The odds of a second public referendum are small but rising. If the people are asked to render judgment on terms of an actual agreement\u2014rather than an abstract concept onto which they projected their various hopes\u2014who knows what they will do?On Europe\u2019s relations with the U.S., Mr. Niblett was equally trenchant: \u201cOnce you say \u2018America First,\u2019 you can\u2019t take it back.\u201d Soothing remarks from senior administration officials don\u2019t make much difference. The idea of the U.S. as the ever-present guardian of Europe \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the currency it once did.\u201d Europeans are becoming more comfortable, instead, with the idea that America serves as an \u201cinsurance policy of last resort\u201d and that they will have to take more responsibility for themselves. \u201cEurope is growing up,\u201d he said, and that\u2019s not altogether a bad thing.It remains to be seen whether the institutions designed to foster European cooperation will prove equal to the task. Europe may be moving out of the woods economically, but it remains politically fragile. Economic growth will not efface concerns about immigration, identity and sovereignty that have come to the fore during the past decade. A divided Europe will find it hard to take on the added responsibilities that \u201cAmerica First\u201d imposes.In the end, said Mr. Niblett, \u201cthe values dimension is what\u2019s most worrying.\u201d Along with his repeated criticisms of the EU, President       Trump\u2019s       support for Poland\u2019s Law and Justice Party and for Hungarian Prime Minister       Viktor Orban\u2019s       hard-line immigration policy have led increasing numbers of Europeans to wonder whether the U.S. remains aligned with them on political fundamentals. In the immediate wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Warsaw, the Polish government\u2019s move to curb the independence of the Constitutional Court underscores these doubts.Such a breach in the unity of the West would represent the ultimate success of the long game       Vladimir Putin       is playing.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-and-the-disunited-kingdom-1501022891", "keywords": ["brexit,common market,eu,European Union,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:47:00", "news_title": "Closing the \u2018Empathy Gap\u2019", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s election has riveted attention on blue-collar voters, whose economic and social woes\u2014and discontent with the status quo\u2014gave Mr. Trump his margin of victory. It is this group that Henry Olsen discusses in \u201cThe Working Class Republican,\u201d an attempt to understand the future of \u201cblue-collar conservatism.\u201d Mr. Olsen\u2019s title character\u2014hero, really\u2014is       Ronald Reagan,        the last Republican before Mr. Trump to win the blue-collar vote. His book explores how Reagan did so and what his example means, in the long term, for the GOP and the country.A career conservative think tanker now with the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, Mr. Olsen admits that he long thought of Reagan as basically a tax- and government-slashing near-libertarian, succeeding politically where       Barry Goldwater       failed but following a similar script. Mr. Olsen decided to re-examine the record and concludes that Reagan was a proponent of \u201cNew Deal conservatism\u201d who believed that government should help those in need and enable America\u2019s working class to enjoy \u201cdignity, comfort and respect.\u201dBoth political parties, Mr. Olsen says, have ignored the needs of a working class rocked by globalization, technology and immigration, setting the table for Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Like Reagan, Mr. Trump is opposed to cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits and seems committed to combating what he sees as unfair foreign trade practices. Like Reagan, he has appealed to white workers who are today disdained by conservative elites as \u201ctakers\u201d and by liberals as \u201cdeplorables.\u201dBut Mr. Olsen disputes the idea that Mr. Trump is \u201cthe new Reagan.\u201d Mr. Trump has employed \u201cracialism and white nationalism,\u201d he says, while Reagan was \u201cfree of bigotry\u201d and welcoming toward immigrants. Mr. Olsen also doubts Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to deliver on his promises to better the lot of workers. \u201cHe has shown no inclination to develop the type of comprehensive philosophy that drove Reagan\u2019s political ambitions.\u201d Like Reagan, Mr. Trump expresses a \u201clove\u201d for ordinary Americans, but Reagan meant it.By Henry Olsen  Broadside, 345 pages, $27.99Mr. Olsen repeats this thesis incessantly and irritatingly, but he has Reagan\u2019s outlook right. Reagan grew up in a working-class home, experienced the Depression and knew what hardship was. He cast his first vote for       FDR       in 1932, wrote that he \u201cidolized\u201d Roosevelt and called himself a onetime \u201chemophiliac liberal.\u201d He was president of the Screen Actors Guild, opposed right-to-work laws and campaigned for       Harry Truman.Reagan began doubting the liberal faith in the 1950s after fighting communists in Hollywood and having to pay taxes as a movie actor at the top marginal rate of 94%. He started making speeches for General Electric in 1954 and discovered virtues in business and businessmen. But he did not become a Republican until 1962. He often said that he did not leave the Democratic Party\u2014it left him, by becoming weak on national security and ever more wedded to high taxes, regulation, welfare and metastasizing bureaucracies.Critics can cite plenty of evidence that Reagan became a hardline conservative, notably his 1964 speech a week before the election boosting Goldwater and his early efforts (blocked by congressional Democrats) to slash domestic spending. But a close review of Reagan\u2019s speeches and actions, Mr. Olsen says, shows that he \u201calways recognized that government could and should legitimately act to ensure that every American had sufficient material goods and opportunity.\u201d In the 1964 speech, he defended Social Security and declared that \u201cno one in this country should be denied medical care for lack of funds.\u201dReagan won workers away from the Democratic Party in 1980 by asking \u201care you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d In the Carter era of stagflation and gas lines, the answer was obviously \u201cno.\u201d Reagan made it clear, as Mr. Olsen emphasizes, that he valued workers and respected their values. But his appeal to this bloc wasn\u2019t merely rhetorical. He won the allegiance of working-class voters\u2014\u201cReagan Democrats,\u201d as they came to be called\u2014by conquering inflation and rekindling economic growth through across-the-board tax cuts and tax reform, creating millions of jobs. What he sought to cut from the budget, Mr. Olsen maintains, was bureaucracy and spending not targeted at the \u201ctruly needy.\u201dMr. Olsen is at odds with current attempts at entitlement reform, especially the proposals of House Speaker       Paul Ryan,        Sen.       Ted Cruz       and Tea Party Republicans. He also opposes tax cuts skewed to the wealthy. After       Barack Obama\u2019s       2012 victory, he notes, GOP strategists said that they had to close a gender gap and ethnic gap. Mr. Olsen says that what really hurts the party is \u201can empathy gap.\u201d To make empathy concrete, he favors cutting payroll taxes for workers and allowing tax cuts for corporations that hire Americans or raise wages.What would Reagan do at the current moment? Mr. Olsen speculates that he would repeal ObamaCare\u2019s coverage mandates but guarantee that people would not lose the coverage they had obtained through the program\u2019s exchanges or Medicaid expansion. To deal with out-of-control entitlements, he would means-test Social Security and Medicare on the Reaganite principle that, in Mr. Olsen\u2019s words, \u201cbenefits should go to people who need them.\u201dAs to a 2020 posing of the question \u201care you better off?\u201d: Mr. Olsen fears that if Republicans continue to misread Reagan\u2014and assuming that Mr. Trump does not fulfill his pro-working-class promises\u2014the answer will be \u201cno.\u201d He implies that \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d will then return to FDR\u2019s party if it can figure out how to appeal to them. What will happen if Democrats continue heading left toward high-tax, high-unemployment, European-style social democracy is anyone\u2019s guess.Mr. Kondracke is the former executive editor of Roll Call and co-author, with       Fred Barnes,        of \u201c      Jack Kemp      : The Bleeding-Heart Conservative Who Changed America.\u201dAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/closing-the-empathy-gap-1501022820", "keywords": ["book review,Ronald Reagan,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:47:00", "news_title": "The Deadline to Kill the Death Panel", "content": "All eyes are on the Senate as it debates what to do about ObamaCare. But the House has a last chance this week to abolish one of the law\u2019s most dangerous creations: a board with sweeping, unchecked power to ration care.The Independent Payment Advisory Board\u2014what critics call the death panel\u2014would be an unelected, unaccountable body with broad powers to slash Medicare spending. But the law contains a living will for IPAB. If the president signs a congressional resolution extinguishing the panel by Aug. 15, it will never come into existence.The real deadline is closer, since the House plans to recess Friday and not return until Sept. 5. But if the House does act, the Senate will have time to follow, since it plans to remain in session until mid-August.The IPAB\u2019s powers would be vast. If government actuaries find that Medicare spending would exceed caps established by ObamaCare, the board is required to write a plan to stay under the caps. Congress can pass its own bill to reach the target if it acts promptly\u2014but if not, the secretary of Health and Human Services must implement IPAB\u2019s plan, which would be exempt from judicial review.Medicare spending has so far not exceeded the IPAB trigger, but eventually it will. Although the statute expressly forbids IPAB from \u201crationing,\u201d that is scant comfort. Government-run health systems typically ration care by cutting payments to doctors and hospitals, something IPAB has the authority do.Medicare\u2019s trustees warn in their new annual report that \u201caccess to physicians treating Medicare patients may become a significant issue in the long term.\u201d In the same report they predict that \u201capproximately half of hospitals, 70 percent of skilled nursing facilities, and over 80 percent of home health agencies\u201d would be losing money by 2040 under IPAB-enforced spending caps, \u201craising the possibility of access and quality-of-care issues for Medicare beneficiaries.\u201dThe IPAB repeal provision has a catch: Passage of the resolution requires a three-fifths vote in the House and Senate. House leaders would need 261 votes (there are 240 Republicans), a tall order. But not all Democrats supported IPAB when ObamaCare was enacted. If an unelected panel is calling the shots, asked then-Rep.       Pete Stark,        a liberal Democrat, \u201cwhy have legislators?\u201dThe resolution against IPAB would be unamendable and immune to filibuster\u2014meaning it would have a much easier time in the Senate than would ordinary legislation to abolish IPAB.The outcome of this week\u2019s Senate debate on ObamaCare will likely disappoint many of the law\u2019s opponents. But repealing the ObamaCare \u201cdeath panel\u201d would give Congress a much-needed accomplishment and give legislators breathing room to reform Medicare the right way.

Ford.       \u201cPass the budget that provides for higher, stable and predictable funding levels for our military needs that our fighting men and women deserve.\u201dThe president is right, but what\u2019s standing in the way is the Budget Control Act of 2011. So why don\u2019t we repeal it already?In retrospect, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was ill-conceived from the start. Rather than attack America\u2019s spending problem at its root, the law only clipped a few stray leaves off the branches. In the early       Obama       years, the federal deficit spiraled out of control, reaching $1.4 trillion in 2009 before settling in around $1.3 trillion for the next two years. Entitlement programs\u2014which, combined with interest payments on the national debt, make up two-thirds of federal spending\u2014are the key driver of our long-term debt challenges.But President Obama refused to address this problem and instead made a deal with Senate Majority Leader       Harry Reid       and House Speaker       John Boehner      \u2014neither of whom is in office today\u2014to squeeze some savings from the remaining one-third of the budget, what\u2019s called \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending.The BCA put budget caps on discretionary spending for 10 years, ending in 2021, and established a 12-member congressional \u201csupercommittee\u201d to find at least $1.2 trillion in additional savings over that same 10-year window. The law stipulated that should the committee fail, there would be an across-the-board cut, or \u201csequester,\u201d to keep spending below the caps. Half the savings would come from the defense budget and half from nondefense spending, meaning the military would absorb 50% of the cuts, even though it accounts for only about 16% of all spending.The BCA proved flawed in execution as well. To everyone\u2019s dismay and no one\u2019s surprise, the supercommittee deadlocked. In 2013, a sequester took effect, though the cuts in overall spending were short-lived.It\u2019s true that after the BCA became law, there was a modest decline in federal spending: from $3.6 trillion in 2011 to $3.5 trillion in 2012 and $3.4 trillion in 2013. But this diet proved as short-lived as most others. By 2015, federal spending was back to $3.6 trillion, and it\u2019s been growing ever since.Why? Because in 2013 and again two years later, Congress raised the BCA\u2019s budget caps. We already know how 2017 will end. In September, Congress will pass what\u2019s known as a continuing resolution, which essentially freezes spending at last year\u2019s levels. Later in the fall, congressional leaders will meet behind closed doors to write a two-year budget deal that again raises the BCA caps. In December, Congress will pass a massive omnibus spending bill with all sorts of not-so-goodies slipped in undetected. Then, in December 2018, there\u2019ll be another omnibus, and the cycle will likely repeat in 2019-20.How do we know? Because that\u2019s exactly what Congress did in 2013-14 and in 2015-16.This bust-and-boom budgeting cycle\u2014in which Congress pretends for years to adhere to budget caps until it frantically raises them at the last minute\u2014cripples the military\u2019s long-term planning abilities. Pentagon planners have to buy year by year, when it takes decades to do something as basic as build a Navy ship. It\u2019s inexcusable to keep this charade up when we have only 275 ships\u2014former chief of naval operations Adm.       Jonathan Greenert       has testified that the Navy needs 450\u2014in a world that\u2019s growing only more dangerous. It\u2019s irresponsible not to write a budget and stick to it based on current needs and threats.The law\u2019s defenders say repealing the BCA would increase spending, but spending is already increasing. A cap is a cap only if you stick to it. Repealing the BCA in itself wouldn\u2019t increase spending. It would be up to Congress to set spending levels in annual budget and appropriations legislation, as the Constitution envisions. Besides, it\u2019d be far better to write a budget out in the open\u2014instead of through backroom deals\u2014and repealing the BCA would be the first step toward reviving the long-dormant budget process.So there\u2019s no need for my colleagues to fear a future without the BCA. The 112th Congress wasn\u2019t the Constitutional Convention, and the Budget Control Act isn\u2019t the Constitution. It\u2019s a flawed law whose repeal is overdue. It\u2019s time to stop the Kabuki theater, get down to business, and build the military this country needs and the troops deserve.Mr. Cotton,        a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Arkansas.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/repeal-the-budget-control-act-1501022756", "keywords": ["budget cuts,defense spending,federal deficit,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,navy,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:45:00", "news_title": "Why Israel Removed the Metal Detectors", "content": "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Fatah Party announced Saturday that the \u201ccampaign for Jerusalem has effectively begun, and will not stop until a Palestinian victory and the release of the holy sites from Israeli occupation.\u201d Fatah demanded the removal of metal detectors and other security devices from the entrance to the Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount. A week earlier two Israeli policemen were killed by terrorists who had stashed their weapons inside the mosque.The Fatah statement was illogical and hypocritical. Many mosques in Muslim-majority countries use the same security technology to protect worshipers, tourists and police. Yet       Mr. Abbas       managed to force the Israeli government to remove them. He did it by deflecting attention from the policemen\u2019s murders and stoking fear of a religious conflagration with vast repercussions.The Temple Mount crisis highlights with exceptional clarity three factors that explain why a steady 80% of Palestinians believe they can eliminate the Jewish state: Islamic doctrine, international succor and Israeli timidity.Islam carries with it the expectation that any land once under Muslim control is an endowment that must inevitably revert to Muslim rule. The idea has abiding power: think of       Osama bin Laden\u2019s       dream of resurrecting Andalusia and Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       hopes of regaining influence over the Balkans. Palestinians consistently report their belief that the state of Israel will collapse within a few decades.A confrontation over the Temple Mount uniquely excites this expectation because it reaches far beyond the local population to arouse the passions of many of the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims. The most prominent Muslim leaders and institutions overwhelmingly supported Fatah\u2019s position on the Temple Mount security provisions. Islamic voices outside the pro-Palestinian consensus are rare. Palestinians rejoice in their role as the tip of an enormous spear.Palestinians\u2019 illusions of might enjoy considerable international support. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization routinely passes critical resolutions aimed at Israel. Columbia University houses something called the Center for Palestine Studies. Major corporations such as Google and news organizations like the British Broadcasting Corp. pretend there\u2019s a country called Palestine. Foreign aid has created a Palestinian pseudo-economy that in 2016 enjoyed a phenomenal 4.1% growth rate.In the Temple Mount crisis, the U.S. government, the Europeans and practically everyone else lined up to support the demand for the elimination of metal detectors, along with high-tech cameras or any other devices to prevent jihadi attacks. The Quartet on the Middle East welcomed \u201cthe assurances by the Prime Minister of Israel that the status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem will be upheld and respected.\u201d With this sort of near-unanimous support, Palestinians easily imagine themselves stronger than the Jewish state.Israel\u2019s security services timidly avoid taking steps that might upset the Palestinians. This soft approach results not from starry-eyed idealism but from an exceedingly negative view of Palestinians as unreformable troublemakers. Accordingly, the police, intelligence agencies and military agree to just about anything that ensures calm while rejecting any initiative to deprive the Palestinians of funds, punish them more severely or infringe on their many prerogatives.The Israeli security establishment knows that the Palestinian Authority will continue to incite and sanction murder even as it seeks to delegitimize and isolate the state of Israel. But those security services emphatically prefer to live with such challenges than to punish Mr. Abbas, reduce his standing and risk another intifada. The collapse of the Palestinian Authority and a return to direct Israeli rule is the security services\u2019 nightmare. Mr. Abbas knows this, and this week\u2019s fiasco demonstrates that he\u2019s not afraid to exploit Israeli fears to advance his dream of debasing and eventually eliminating the Jewish state.Mr. Pipes       is president of the Middle East Forum.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-israel-removed-the-metal-detectors-1501022738", "keywords": ["benjamin netanyahu,israeli-palestinian conflict,terrorism,the Palestinian Authority,Mr. Abbas,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:45:00", "news_title": "\u2018A Better Deal,\u2019 or Just a Better Spiel?", "content": "Have Democrats finally come to grips with why they lost the presidential election? On Monday party leaders traveled to a rural Virginia county that       Donald Trump       won by 20 points. There they unveiled their 2018 campaign platform, called \u201cA Better Deal.\u201d The plan keeps in mind both kinds of Democratic candidates\u2014blue-state progressives and red-state moderates. It includes a $15 minimum wage, a proposal to lower prescription-drug costs, new child-care support and tougher regulation of Wall Street.One of the document\u2019s authors, Rep.       Cheri Bustos,        is among the dozen Democrats who won a congressional district last fall that went for Mr. Trump. Ms. Bustos, who represents working-class northwestern Illinois, is precisely the type of Democrat party leaders ought to be listening to, and bully for them if they\u2019re taking her counsel.\u201cIn the last two elections, Democrats, including in the Senate, failed to articulate a strong, bold economic program for the middle class and those working hard to get there,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in an op-ed announcing the new agenda. \u201cWe also failed to communicate our values to show that we were on the side of working people, not the special interests. We will not repeat the same mistake.\u201d This is a long way from blaming       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       loss on those deplorables.Still, not everyone on the left wants to focus on winning back the voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who backed       Barack Obama       but rejected Mrs. Clinton. Some would rather try to rebuild the twice-successful Obama coalition of young voters, minorities and socially liberal whites. The mathematical reality is that Democrats will probably have to do a little bit of both.Those white voters who switched from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump are simply too numerous to write off. Yes, Democrats could win the popular vote without them, but maybe not the Electoral College. Therefore, the party needs a message that resonates with its base but also with voters who are turned off by the overt racial and ethnic appeals Democrats have long relied on.Whether \u201cA Better Deal\u201d will do the trick may be up to President Trump. His low job-approval numbers don\u2019t much faze him. He has done little to broaden his appeal, perhaps because he isn\u2019t on the ballot next year. His base seems to care more about his in-your-face style than concrete legislative accomplishments. The president ought to understand, however, that some of his support is quite soft and has already started to erode. Republican and independent voters who reluctantly backed Mr. Trump have lost confidence in his ability to address their concerns.His approval rating among white college-educated women has fallen to 31% from 44% since the election, according to Washington Post/ABC News polls. Fifty-nine percent of these voters would now prefer a Democratic Congress, compared with 35% who favor the GOP. Independent voters who initially were \u201csomewhat approving\u201d of Mr. Trump are increasingly \u201csomewhat disapproving.\u201d The stadium rallies the president holds don\u2019t seem to be doing it for them, and they may swing back toward a Democratic Party that appears eager to pursue them.The president\u2019s unpopularity is affecting his ability to control the Republican caucus and push his agenda in Congress. Mr. Trump can earn loyalty from lawmakers and officials in his administration by demonstrating it himself. If he wants to change the subject to tax reform from Russia investigations and internecine strife in the West Wing, maybe he should stop sounding off to         New York Times               editors about matters best handled out of public view.Even if the president\u2019s job-approval numbers don\u2019t concern him, they most definitely concern Republicans up for election next year. Lawmakers like to run on accomplishments, and so far this Congress doesn\u2019t have many. Now that voters have handed the GOP control of the Oval Office and both the House and Senate, the party is out of excuses.It\u2019s progress if Democratic leaders have accepted why they really lost last year. But the party still needs to spend the next 15 months figuring out how to win again. Demonizing Mr. Trump didn\u2019t work last time. Reaching out to his voters instead of scoffing at them might be a better tactic. If Mr. Trump and Republicans want to hang on to their majorities, they\u2019ll have to show voters that they can govern.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-deal-or-just-a-better-spiel-1501022711", "keywords": ["better deal,chuck schumer,clinton,congress,democratic party,donald trump,obama,progressive,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:44:00", "news_title": "James Comey Is Maxwell Smart", "content": "Terry McAuliffe,        governor of Virginia and former prolific Clinton fundraiser, is no idiot when it comes to politics. In response to a general question about       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       postelection deportment, he not only turned a recent Politico podcast discussion to Russia\u2019s election meddling but zeroed in on fake Russian intelligence implicated in FBI chief       James Comey\u2019s       election interventions.Why this underplayed episode, among all the overplayed theories of Russian meddling, might weigh on his mind is no mystery. Put aside the obvious objection that if Hillary Clinton had been a better candidate, she would have won.       Joshua Green,        author of a new book about the election, \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d says internal       Trump       polls showed a clear view of the race\u2019s final days. Voters who liked neither candidate broke decisively for Mr. Trump after Mr. Comey\u2019s Oct. 28 letter reopening the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server.Nate Silver,        the polling authority at FiveThirtyEight.com, reached the same conclusion using public surveys: \u201cHillary Clinton would probably be president if [Mr. Comey] had not sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28.\u201dMr. Comey, in public testimony, attributed his serial interventions to the Arizona tarmac meeting of       Bill Clinton       and Attorney General       Loretta Lynch.       A Washington Post headline blared: \u201cNow we know: Bill Clinton cost his wife the presidency.\u201dExcept that, in later reporting by the Post and other new organizations, it wasn\u2019t the tarmac meeting at all; it was planted Russian intelligence about Attorney General Lynch that led to Mr. Comey\u2019s intervention.This story actually makes a lot more sense. The public knew about the tarmac meeting. Voters were already factoring it in. If the Justice Department worried how its Clinton decision would play, it could have leaked the Comey recommendation. It could have authorized him to speak publicly.Plenty of Hillary surrogates, from President       Obama       on down, stood ready to lend credibility to a decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Comey\u2019s unprecedented, protocol-violating step simply wasn\u2019t required.It\u2019s far more likely that Mr. Comey conceived of his intervention as a counterintelligence operation. Hillary would win. Russia\u2019s fake email about Ms. Lynch conspiring to prevent a Hillary indictment would become public and be used by Trump partisans and America\u2019s adversaries to discredit her victory. Therefore he would neutralize this Russian threat by clearing Mrs. Clinton himself. In doing so, it now appears he accidentally secured Mr. Trump\u2019s win.Free yourself from any hindsight bias. All actors at the time were convinced Hillary would win; for U.S. officials, the urgency was to protect Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inevitable presidency from Russian dirty tricks.Mr. McAuliffe, in last month\u2019s podcast, opined flatly that Russia also expected Mrs. Clinton to win and wanted to destabilize her presidency.Mr. Comey himself, in public testimony, gave mumbly assent to the \u201cintelligence community\u2019s\u201d now-claim that Russia wasn\u2019t just trying to weaken Mrs. Clinton but elect Donald Trump, arguing that in a two-person race, hurting one necessarily helps the other.Such sophistries aside, this is implausible. Against all polling, Russia would not have thought trying to elect Mr. Trump a good investment. In effect, this claim about Russian motives is another counterintelligence operation by our own intelligence community to distract from its botched counterintelligence operation that elected Mr. Trump.To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a conspiracy exactly, but about intelligence leaders adjusting their statements and emphases on the fly to pretty up an embarrassing picture.Nonetheless, the effect has been not unlike that of a counterintelligence operation mounted against a duly elected president.Let\u2019s have a dose of realism. Other countries take an interest in our leadership decisions; we take an interest in theirs. We\u2019d say the U.S. actually did a pretty good job of inoculating itself against Russia\u2019s interest in our recent election. Hillary and her surrogates tirelessly flogged an apparent Trump-Putin affinity to her advantage. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mistake was devoting too many of her resources to the wrong states.Mr. Comey\u2019s intervention was the one exception. Voters weren\u2019t told about his Russian concern. They couldn\u2019t factor it into their big picture of the election. What was the exact nature of the planted info? How did it come into U.S. hands? (For the record, Mr. McAuliffe speculated, wildly, that \u201ctreasonous\u201d Americans must have helped Russia devise its intelligence ruse.)A verb from the Nixon era is \u201cstonewall\u201d\u2014to hold back the truth in any way possible. It\u2019s useful to recall that what the FBI handed over to Special Counsel       Robert Mueller       was a \u201ccounterintelligence investigation\u201d\u2014an inquiry into the facts of Russia\u2019s meddling, not a criminal investigation seeking something, anything to pin on Donald Trump.If Mr. Mueller does not see the importance of coming clean on the Comey intervention (whether or not he wants to acknowledge that the Comey intervention may have elected Mr. Trump), then Mr. Mueller is part of the stonewall.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-comey-is-maxwell-smart-1501022653", "keywords": ["federal bureau of investigations,russia investigation,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:44:00", "news_title": "Republicans, Former DOJ Officials Come to Sessions\u2019 Defense ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Republicans and former Justice Department officials rallied around Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he continued to weather public criticism from President Donald Trump over his decision to recuse himself from investigations into Russia\u2019s election interference, and other concerns.The defenders voiced their support in response to a flurry of unusual attacks by a president on his top law-enforcement official, who was an early and ardent backer of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cvery disappointed in Jeff Sessions\u201d for stepping aside from the probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cI\u2019m just looking at it,\u201d the president said when asked how long he could continue to criticize Mr. Sessions without firing him. \u201cI\u2019ll just see. It\u2019s a very important thing.\u201dMr. Trump on Monday and Tuesday also tweeted that Mr. Sessions was \u201cvery weak\u201d and \u201cbeleaguered\u201d for not investigating his electoral opponent,       Hillary Clinton,        or those who leak intelligence information. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton should be prosecuted and go to jail for sending classified information over a private email server she used as secretary of state. After winning the presidency, Mr. Trump reversed course and said he didn\u2019t think his political rival should be investigated.At his January confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself on any pending investigation into Mrs. Clinton, saying that some of his comments during the campaign could lead to a perception of bias. Last summer, the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that Mrs. Clinton shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.The Justice Department brought one leak case last month, when it charged a federal government contractor with providing classified information to a news organization.Mr. Sessions couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Top aides said he has no plans to step aside and is focusing on running his department. In May as he became aware of the president\u2019s displeasure, Mr. Sessions told Mr. Trump he would be willing to resign, according to people close to the attorney general. Mr. Trump declined the offer.Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for another senior Justice Department post,\u00a0Brian Benczkowski, at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday described Mr. Sessions as a \u201cman of integrity who cares deeply about the institutional independence of the department.\u201d\u201cI think he goes to work every day doing his dead-level best to protect that independence, and those sorts of comments are painful and difficult for me to hear,\u201d Mr. Benczkowski said in response to questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets. At his hearing, Mr. Benczkowski faced questions about his work for a Russian bank.At his news conference Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Mr. Sessions and that \u201che should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office.\u201d\u201cIf he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He added: \u201cSo I think that\u2019s a bad thing, not for the president but for the presidency. I think it\u2019s unfair to the presidency, and that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201dThe president\u2019s sharp critiques raised questions about whether Mr. Sessions would resign or if Mr. Trump was laying the groundwork to fire him. Top elected Republicans said they hoped Mr. Trump would back off Mr. Sessions and chastised the president for urging the prosecution of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThe attorney general is doing a fine job and he made the right decision to recuse himself,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said.Mr. Sessions\u2019 former home-state colleague, Sen. Richard Shelby (R, Ala.), said: \u201cJeff Sessions is a man of integrity, loyalty, and extraordinary character.\u201dLindsey Graham       (R, S.C.), one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics in the GOP, was among lawmakers who blasted the president\u2019s treatment of Mr. Sessions. He also said it was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d for Mr. Trump to tell the attorney general to go after his former Democratic opponent.Sen.       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah) said Mr. Sessions \u201cis among the most honorable men in government today.\u201d\u201cI have full confidence in Jeff\u2019s ability to perform the duties of his office and, above all, uphold the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Former Justice officials said that Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism has potentially eroded Mr. Sessions\u2019 ability to lead the department. They were concerned that if Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Sessions, other top Justice Department officials might resign in solidarity, creating a constitutional crisis.They also said they were shocked that Mr. Trump would publicly attack a member of his own cabinet, especially one who supported his candidacy so early in the process and who has so aggressively promoted his platform of tougher policing and a crackdown on illegal immigration. Mr. Sessions as attorney general has hailed a new \u201cTrump era\u201d of stepped-up immigration enforcement, a central tenant of the business mogul\u2019s campaign platform.\u201cWhat I am observing here is without precedent,\u201d said Joe Whitley, a former top Justice Department official in Republican administrations.John Yoo,        a former top Justice Department official in the       George W. Bush       administration, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism \u201creally undermines the attorney general\u2019s position within his own department, and it also sends a terrible signal about the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department.\u201dIf Mr. Sessions were fired or forced to resign, Mr. Trump would have a hard time finding a replacement that could be confirmed by the Senate, according to Mr. Yoo, a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.\u201cThe president would be in an enormous political hole,\u201d Mr. Yoo said. \u201cAll of the other members of his cabinet would wonder who is next. And who is going to take a job to replace Sessions knowing this is how he treated the attorney general? And who can get confirmed?\u201dIf Mr. Sessions were to step down or be fired, Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       would become the acting attorney general. After Mr. Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, it was supervised by Mr. Rosenstein. In May, shortly after Mr. Trump abruptly fired FBI Director       James Comey,        the deputy attorney general appointed       Robert Mueller,        a former FBI director, to become the special counsel overseeing the investigation.Mr. Trump might be able to appoint another acting attorney general without Senate confirmation, if the Senate is closed for business for more than 10 days, but the chamber usually conducts pro forma sessions during recess to prevent any such appointments.Mr. Trump could also move another Senate-confirmed official, from the Justice Department or any other department, to serve as acting attorney general for a limited time. But the pool of potential candidates is relatively small, and it is unclear who the White House might consider to make such an appointment.\u2014Michael C.

In the ensuing discussion, a widespread misunderstanding kept cropping up\u2014one that is understandable but important to correct. A pardon, the misunderstanding goes, entails a declaration of some underlying guilt, so that if the president pardoned his aides, he would be acknowledging that they had done something wrong.This isn\u2019t true. While the overwhelming majority of pardons are issued as forgiveness for guilty people, the authority to pardon also includes the power to exonerate the innocent. A president could issue a pardon while saying: This investigation has run amok. The charges are bogus; my people are innocent. I have the power to stop this, and I\u2019m going to use that power.I would strongly disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s issuing a pardon like this. But if he did so, people would be free to draw their own conclusions. The president and his tens of millions of supporters could follow this alternative script.A common source for the notion that a pardon requires underlying guilt is an out-of-context quotation from the Supreme Court\u2019s 1915 decision in       Burdick v.       United States. The justices held that       George Burdick,        a newspaper editor, could reject a presidential pardon whose purpose was to strip him of the right against self-incrimination and compel him to reveal sources. The court\u2019s comment that a pardon \u201ccarries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it\u201d was a general empirical observation, made in the service of a peripheral part of the argument\u2014what lawyers call \u201cdicta.\u201d It was not a finding of law that pardons are only for the guilty.The president\u2019s power to pardon is based on the notion that the criminal-justice system does not always work perfectly. Pardons provide a safety valve. In almost all cases the imperfection is that a contrite guilty person who long ago served his sentence is worthy of having his civil rights restored. Most federal pardon applications go through the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which requires applicants to wait until they have been out of prison for at least five years, and typically to accept responsibility for their crimes.But there are other circumstances in which safety valves may be needed, and presidents have the authority to bypass the usual process. A president may think that people in prison should be released earlier, such as when President       Obama       commuted the sentences of hundreds of nonviolent drug offenders. A president may think that people who have not even been charged or convicted should avoid the possibility of prosecution, such as when President Carter pardoned hundreds of thousands of Vietnam-era draft evaders, or when President Ford pardoned       Richard Nixon.And a president may think that an innocent person deserves exoneration. Consider Ford\u2019s pardon of       Iva Toguri       d\u2019Aquino. She had been convicted of treason in 1949 and served six years in prison for broadcasting anti-American propaganda from Japan during World War II as Tokyo Rose. But d\u2019Aquino was no traitor; the case against her was based on perjury suborned by federal officials. After investigative journalists publicized the truth, Ford issued her a full and unconditional pardon. He had the power to clear her name, and he used it.This year, Indiana Gov.       Eric Holcomb       kept a campaign promise to pardon       Keith Cooper,        who had been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for 10 years. The premise of the pardon was that Cooper was innocent.There would be a huge difference between Ford\u2019s and Mr. Holcomb\u2019s pardons and President Trump\u2019s pre-emptively pardoning his aides, declaring them innocent and ravaging the       Mueller       investigation. The latter would be completely unacceptable\u2014if not impeachable\u2014to much of the country, myself included. But that would be a political problem. His assertion of his aides\u2019 innocence would present no legal contradiction at all.Mr. Kalt       is a law professor at Michigan State University and author of \u201cConstitutional Cliffhangers: A Legal Guide for Presidents and Their Enemies\u201d (2012).Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Pardons Aren\u2019t Only For the Guilty.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pardons-arent-only-for-the-guilty-1501022687", "keywords": ["federal bureau of investigations,presidential pardon,russia investigation,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:41:00", "news_title": "SoftBank Boosts Bet on Ride Hailing With Play for Stake in Uber", "content": "SoftBank Group Corp.        9984 0.74%       is angling for a piece of Uber Technologies Inc., a move that would further the grand ambitions of the tech investor\u2019s founder and muddy the mix of alliances in the global ride-hailing business.The Japanese technology company has approached San Francisco-based Uber about a multibillion-dollar stake, people familiar with the matter said. Talks between the companies are described as preliminary and one-sided, and any deal would likely be on hold until Uber hires a new chief executive, which isn\u2019t expected for weeks, the people said.SoftBank founder       Masayoshi Son       has sought to seize hold of cornerstone technologies he expects to dictate how humans interact with the world for decades to come. As early adopters of self-driving technology, ride-hailing firms are central to Mr. Son\u2019s strategy to accelerate a robotic revolution and generate value from his varied investments in semiconductors, networks, cybersecurity and deep learning.Softbank is a big investor in the three largest Asian ride-hailing companies: Singapore\u2019s GrabTaxi Holdings Pte., India\u2019s Ola and China\u2019s Didi Chuxing Technology Co. On Monday, SoftBank said that it and Didi would lead\u00a0a $2.5 billion fundraising round in Grab, giving the startup more ammunition in its battle against Uber across Southeast Asia.Spokesmen from both Uber and SoftBank declined to comment.While it is rare for SoftBank to hedge its investments, an offer could mean the company hopes Uber combines its operations with Grab and Ola, as it did last year with Didi. Such a merger would give SoftBank a formidable share of the Asian market.Uber, which is struggling with management challenges at home and strong competition from rivals overseas, has shown a willingness to retreat from costly battles around the world. Earlier this month, it said it\u00a0plans to combine its operations with Russian rival Yandex.Taxi, owned by             Yandex                   NV.Uber co-founder\u00a0      Travis Kalanick      \u00a0relinquished his role as chief executive\u00a0last month after investors demanded he step down. His resignation followed a number of scandals as well as an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the company. Mr. Kalanick remains on the board.A massive capital injection wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary for Uber, which has raised more money\u2014about $15 billion in equity and debt funding\u2014than any other private company backed by venture capital.\u00a0Uber has had to tap increasingly larger sources of capital to support its breakneck global expansion and fight fierce price wars around the U.S. The company\u2019s losses last year totaled more than $3 billion, though it still had about $7 billion in cash on its balance sheet.A year ago Uber turned to the Middle East for its biggest single capital infusion, a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s main investment fund, the Public Investment Fund.\u00a0That deal handed an Uber board seat to       Yasir Al Rumayyan,       \u00a0the managing director of PIF\u00a0who also now sits on the board of SoftBank. The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund is the lead investor in SoftBank\u2019s new $93 billion fund that is already starting to shower startups with hundreds of millions of dollars in capital.With the Vision Fund, Mr. Son is likely to wield extensive influence on Silicon Valley and beyond through significant bets in areas such as robotics and deep learning, as artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities. He has turned SoftBank into one of Japan\u2019s biggest companies by making sizable investments in telecommunications, e-commerce and technology, including an early investment in Chinese internet company             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , a gamble on U.S. telecommunications company             Sprint Corp.       and a buyout of U.K. Microchip designer ARM Holdings PLC.\u201cMany more changes are coming\u2014I am so excited, even sleeping is a waste of time,\u201d Mr. Son, 59, said at an event for SoftBank\u2019s corporate clients and partners on Thursday. He compared SoftBank\u2019s role to that of the landed elites played to enable the industrial revolution. \u201cWe want to be the gentry of the IT revolution.\u201dSoftBank\u2019s big wagers have tended to greatly inflate startup valuations. The newest investment in Grab, which operates private-car, taxi, motorcycle and carpool bookings across seven countries in Asia, would value the startup at more than $6 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation. That is double the valuation from less than year ago and would make Grab the most valuable startup in Southeast Asia. SoftBank\u2019s $5 billion investment in Didi last year catapulted the Chinese startup\u2019s valuation to $50 billion from $33 billion.Bloomberg News earlier reported SoftBank\u2019s potential interest in buying shares of Uber.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com, Joann S.

But the Gore analysis on another issue is being rejected by even some of his committed climate allies.The good news for all of us is that Mr. Gore appears to have overstated the threat of eco-apocalypse, which he seems to implicitly acknowledge on his latest media tour.Back in 2006,             CBS Newsreported on Mr. Gore\u2019s arrival at the Sundance Film Festival:Eleven years later, the mischief makers at the Climate Depot website asked him about the 10-year deadline at this year\u2019s festival\u2014just before he climbed into a large chauffeured sport-utility vehicle. He didn\u2019t have much to say then, but in the absence of drastic global measures, it\u2019s clear that Mr. Gore now believes that the end is not quite nigh. The tech website CNET describes an \u201coptimistic\u201d Mr. Gore with a \u201csunny outlook\u201d discussing his latest cinematic venture with a crowd in San Francisco.The new movie will likely spark more discussion about the accuracy of various Gore environmental predictions. The left-leaning Politifact has flagged several \u201chalf-truths\u201d from the former vice president.But now Mr. Gore seems to have a separate argument on his hands even with people inclined to buy his climate predictions. In an excerpt from his new book accompanying the new film, Mr. Gore writes on another topic popular with global doomsayers: population growth. According to Mr. Gore:But Gore pal and fellow warmist       Elon Musk       says this is no success story. He recently warned on Twitter of a global population \u201ccollapse, but few seem to notice or care.\u201d Mr. Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, among other ventures, pointed to an article in the British journal New Scientist, which asked last year:Glenn Stanton at the Federalist points out that Mr. Musk has been concerned about this topic for some time.

He describes the difficulty of fewer workers supporting more and more retirees in developed nations and observes that \u201cthe social safety net will not hold.\u201dNow there\u2019s an inconvenient truth.

Several committees have begun questioning associates and family members of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law,       Jared Kushner,        who is a senior White House official, was on Capitol Hill twice this week to speak to House and Senate Intelligence-committee investigators.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and top Democrat       Dianne Feinstein       (D., Calif.) said in a statement: \u201cFaced with issuance of a subpoena, we are happy that Mr. Manafort has started producing documents to the Committee and we have agreed to continue negotiating over a transcribed interview.\u201dThe back-and-forth between Mr. Manafort and the committee caps several days of negotiations between the former Trump campaign official and congressional investigators who want to hear from him on topics related to possible Russian activity during the 2016 election.The Judiciary Committee in particular is looking at unregistered lobbying and influence peddling. The Intelligence Committee, led by Sen.       Richard Burr       (R., N.C.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), has been conducting a bipartisan probe of Russian activity during the 2016 presidential campaign.According to a January report from U.S. intelligence agencies, the interference was directed by the highest levels of the Russian government. The tactics included hacking state election systems, stealing and leaking information from party committees and political strategists, and using social media and other outlets to disseminate negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.Mr. Manafort voluntarily appeared Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is expected to do the same in front of the Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks.Mr. Manafort served as Trump campaign chairman for several months before resigning amid questions about his past consulting work for Ukrainian political figures.Mr. Manafort, who hasn\u2019t been charged with wrongdoing, is under scrutiny from investigators over his participation in a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a Russian-born lobbyist and an executive at a Kremlin-linked Russian real-estate firm. Also at the meeting were Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.Emails the president\u2019s son released this month showed the Trump camp was promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton said to be offered by the Russian government in support of the elder Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Donald Trump Jr. has said the meeting didn\u2019t result in any significant exchange of information or action.The younger Mr. Trump was also asked to appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, but the committee said he is cooperating and may be excused from publicly testifying. No subpoena has been issued for the younger Mr. Trump.Also on Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee withdrew a subpoena for Glenn Simpson, founder of a firm that compiled a dossier of unverified research about Mr. Trump, after Mr. Simpson agreed to sit for a transcribed interview and cooperate further with the panel\u2019s investigation, according to two people familiar with the matter.Mr. Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who now runs a political-intelligence firm in Washington called Fusion GPS, was subpoenaed last week to appear at the same hearing as Mr. Manafort.

The CBOE index, called VIX, didn\u2019t set a record closing low, settling at 9.43 at the end of the day. The all-time closing low of 9.31 was set on Dec. 22, 1993.The VIX uses S&P 500 options prices to project expected stock-market swings over the next 30 days. It tends to rise when stocks are falling and vice versa.Markets have been calm this year, and some investors and analysts have said that a resurgence in volatility could be on the horizon. The VIX\u2019s lows have induced investors to fret about the lack of fear, even spurring some to bet on a reversal.\u201cI remember a lot of people feeling this way in early 2007,\u201d said       Amy Wu Silverman,        an equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in an email, adding that at the time people were aware about risks lurking in subprime mortgages and real-estate investments. \u201cIt was more about how long it could carry on, and investors not wanting to miss the party.\u201dOn Tuesday, equities rose around the world following a positive reading of business sentiment in Europe and corporate earnings results from companies including             Caterpillar Inc.       and             McDonald\u2019s Corp.With a close under 10 on Tuesday, the VIX closed in single digits for nine consecutive sessions\u2014by far its longest streak ever. The previous record of four was set in December 1993, and the VIX closed under 10 just four times from 1995 to 2016.In May, two professors asserted that the VIX could be manipulated. CBOE Holdings, which administers the index, disagreed.Wall Street heavyweights have expressed differing views on what is behind the muted volatility.       Marko Kolanovic       at             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. has said a slew of technical factors have pushed volatility lower.Passive investing\u2014strategies that involve betting against the VIX, selling options for income, and weaker correlation between stock sectors\u2014all have unduly suppressed volatility, the New York-based global head of macro quantitative and derivatives strategy said in a June note.Fewer investors are buying and selling based on stock-specific fundamentals and that is driving volatility lower, wrote Mr. Kolanovic, who estimated that such investors only constitute about one-tenth of trading volumes.Passive and quantitative investors make up about 60% of stock assets, he estimated. Meanwhile, central banks world-wide have kept rates low.\u201cLow volatility is not a new normal or fundamentally justified,\u201d wrote Mr. Kolanovic.Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       said passive investing hasn\u2019t contributed to low volatility. John Marshall, a New York-based derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a June note that if passive investing were a factor, sectors would be moving together more.That hasn\u2019t been the case, he said. Correlations among stocks have fallen, even as passive funds have attracted money, according to Goldman Sachs.Regardless, with another dip, the VIX could fall below nine, a level that previously seemed unimaginable to some market watchers.\u201cI think less and less it is reflecting the risks in the market,\u201d said Ms. Silverman. \u201cVIX has never been a leading indicator.

John McCain (R., Ariz.) returned to the Senate Tuesday determined to challenge his own party by calling for a return to the decorum and courage that have often defined the chamber.\u201cI hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us,\u201d Mr. McCain said\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to colleagues who listened in near silence. \u201cStop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don\u2019t want anything done for the public good.\u201dMr. McCain, an 80-year-old who spent years as a Vietnam POW, spoke after he had cast a vote that was critical to allowing his party to open a health-policy debate. He had just arrived at the U.S. Capitol after an extended absence during which he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.Instead of cheering on Republican leaders for having rounded up votes to initiate debate without any Democratic support, Mr. McCain warned that the body\u2019s deliberations had become too corrosive.\u201cThey are\u00a0more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cOur deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we\u2019d all agree they haven\u2019t been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren\u2019t producing much for the American people,\u201d he said.Mr. McCain had previously said that Congress should work on a replacement for the Affordable Care Act on a bipartisan basis, as had other senators. But in taking to the Senate floor to lay out his thinking, the senator of nearly three decades brought to bear an authority that is essentially unmatched in the chamber.\u201cThe most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America\u2019s problems and to defend her from her adversaries,\u201d Mr. McCain said.The senator spared no one\u2014not himself, not Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). \u201cSometimes I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cSometimes I wanted to win more for the sake of winning\u00a0than to achieve a contested policy.\u201dBut he also took aim at the process devised by Mr. McConnell,\u00a0who assembled a series of health bills behind closed doors without a single hearing before ultimately asking the Senate to open debate without knowing what they would ultimately be considering. Mr. McCain predicted that Republican efforts to advance a new health bill wouldn\u2019t succeed.\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it\u2019s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201dMr. McConnell told reporters that he agreed with Mr. McCain that \u201cthe parties needed to come together\u201d but said \u201csome issues are just more partisan than others.\u201dHis sober message was broken up by a bit of his legendary humor, saying he\u2019d \u201chad so\u00a0many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else.\u201dA skin cancer survivor, he vowed to overcome his latest health challenge.\u201cI have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me,\u201d Mr. McCain concluded. \u201cAnd, I hope, to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the American people in your company.\u201dWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Back, McCain Calls For Bipartisanship.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mccain-returns-to-senate-with-calls-for-bipartisanship-1501021481", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:21:00", "news_title": "Celgene Settles Lawsuit Over Improper Promotion of Cancer Drugs ", "content": "Drugmaker             Celgene Corp.        CELG 0.96%       agreed to pay $280 million to the U.S. and many state governments to settle a former sales manager\u2019s lawsuit accusing the company of improperly promoting two cancer drugs and causing false reimbursement claims to be submitted to federal and state health-insurance programs.Celgene, of Summit, N.J., didn\u2019t admit liability in the settlement and said Tuesday it denies any wrongdoing. The company said it settled the case to avoid the uncertainty and expense of protracted litigation.The settlement stems from a lawsuit initially filed in 2010 in federal court in Los Angeles by former Celgene sales manager       Beverly Brown,        alleging the company marketed the drugs Thalomid and Revlimid to treat multiple types of cancer for which the drugs weren\u2019t approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as cancers of the brain and breast.Doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs for uses not approved by the FDA, a practice known as off-label prescribing. But the FDA has generally prohibited companies from marketing their drugs for off-label uses.The FDA initially approved Thalomid to treat leprosy in 1998. In 2006, the FDA approved widening Thalomid\u2019s uses to include treatment of the blood cancer multiple myeloma.The FDA initially approved Revlimid in 2005 to treat a blood disorder but later expanded the approved uses to include treating multiple myeloma. Global sales of Revlimid have surged, to $6.97 billion last year, or more than 60% of total company revenue.In her lawsuit, Ms. Brown alleged her superiors at Celgene instructed her and other sales employees to promote to doctors various off-label uses of the drugs, and that she was rewarded for it in her compensation. The lawsuit alleged the marketing activities caused doctors to write prescriptions for the drugs that government health programs such as Medicare shouldn\u2019t have paid for, but did.\u201cThis case was about the marketing of dangerous drugs being driven by Wall Street promises and not medical necessity,\u201d said Ms. Brown\u2019s attorney,       Reuben Guttman.Ms. Brown filed her lawsuit under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and many state governments. The False Claims Act allows people bringing such lawsuits to receive up to 30% of any monetary recoveries, to encourage people with knowledge of suspected fraud to come forward. The Justice Department has the option to intervene and take the lead in such lawsuits, but in this case it didn\u2019t intervene. Instead, it monitored the case, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California said in a press release.Mr. Guttman said he expects Ms. Brown to receive 25% to 30% of the settlement amount, but said he didn\u2019t yet know the exact amount.Celgene will pay $259.3 million to the federal government and $20.7 million to be split among 28 states and the District of Columbia.Celgene said that before it reached the settlement, a federal judge had dismissed part of the case, including allegations that Celgene illegally paid doctors to induce them to prescribe Thalomid and Revlimid.Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/celgene-settles-lawsuit-over-improper-promotion-of-cancer-drugs-1501021308", "keywords": ["beverly brown,celgene corp.,drugmaker,fine,food and drug administration,fraud,health insurance,lawsuit,mulitple myeloma,pharmaceuticals,revlimid,settlement,thalomid,Celgene,CELG,Drugmaker Celgene,U.S. Food and Drug Administration,corporate crime,legal action,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,settlements,out-of-court agreements,cancer,political,general news,crime,health,medical conditions,health care fraud,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,biotechnology,cancer drugs,health care,life sciences,biopharmaceuticals,specialized drugs,medications"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:20:00", "news_title": "AMD\u2019s New Chips Are Stacking Up ", "content": "New chips from             Advanced Micro Devices        AMD 4.61%       are selling.

Another three buildings are currently in escrow for three separate buyers.These buildings have so-called triple-net-lease structures, which are typically leased to single tenants such as McDonalds\u2019s Corp. or             CVS Corp.       Landlords simply own the buildings, while tenants under long-term leases of about 10 to 20 years manage the properties and pay the operating expenses and taxes. These real-estate holdings are seen to generate low but stable yields.\u201cThe buyers are typically baby boomers and other high net worth individuals looking for something with no landlord maintenance,\u201d said       Eric Carlton,        senior vice president at Colliers International, a real-estate services firm.The Wal-Mart locations each changed hands for $12 million to $15 million, prices that implied capitalization rates, a measure of yield, of 5.15% to 5.75%.Wal-Mart is a creditworthy tenant with a strong brand name that attracts a lot of buyers that are \u201cturning to coupon clipping,\u201d said Mr. Carlton, who is the broker representing Hutton in these transactions. Older investors of past generations clipped coupons to send to a utility company that offered bonds, and received quarterly checks.Investors these days generally prefer retail real estate featuring tenants that are more resistant to competition from the internet, such as grocery stores, fitness centers, health clinics and laundromats.Online grocery sales, for instance, accounted for less than 1% of the $1 trillion U.S. grocery retail market in 2016, making it one of the lowest online-penetrated categories in retail, according to             Moody\u2019s Investors Service.Grocery-anchored shopping centers are priced to deliver superior private-market returns compared with so-called power centers, said real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors in a recent research note. Power centers are open-air shopping centers that typically have off-price, apparel or office-supply retailers as tenants.\u201cIt\u2019s been a profitable and high-profile assignment for us to invest in, build and now offer for sale these Wal-Mart occupied stores that have brought with them jobs, lower prices, and convenience to many communities where the closest grocery store was sometimes 100 miles or more distant from where customers live,\u201d said Karen Hutton, chief executive of Hutton Cos.Hutton was one of the developers retained by Wal-Mart to build 30 sites two years ago, and another 15 sites are for sale, mainly in secondary markets in Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia.Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-buy-wal-mart-neighborhood-grocery-sites-in-the-south-1501020279", "keywords": ["grocery stores,hutton cos.,investors,markets,property,real estate,the south,wal-mart,walmart neighborhood market,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,CVS,Hutton,McDonald's,MCD,Karen Hutton,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,political,general news,retail,wholesale,pharmacies,drug stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,real estate transactions,retail real estate,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 18:02:00", "news_title": "Study Shows Toll on Brain in Former Football Players ", "content": "A new study shows that the vast majority of former football players whose brains were donated for research showed signs of severe trauma, reinforcing the dramatic toll the sport can take on its participants.The report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 87% of the 202 donated brains of former high school, college, semiprofessional and pro football players showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by repetitive head trauma. Of the former NFL players in the sample, 110 of the 111 brains showed symptoms of the disease.\u201cThe fact that we found it in 99% of individuals who donated their brain is a frightening statistic,\u201d said Ann McKee, a neuropathologist at the Boston University CTE Center, which sponsored the study along with the VA Boston Healthcare System.Severe CTE also appeared in the brains of players at lower levels of the game, including 48 of 53 college players. The trend was less pronounced for players whose only exposure to the sport came in high school, with 3 of 14 brains showing mild signs of the disease.Of the players diagnosed with severe CTE, 47 percent of players died of neurodegenerative diseases linked to the years of hits sustained while playing the game. The damage players sustain on the field also affects players in life, with 89 percent exhibiting negative behavioral or mood symptoms long before their deaths and 85 percent showing signs of dementia.While the prevalence rates in the study appear damning, sports neurologist Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher cautioned against drawing broad conclusions because it only included the brains of individuals who either personally chose to participate or whose families donated their organs posthumously.\u201cThe reality is this study does not add anything to the science,\u201d said Kutcher, who works at the Core Institute in Brighton, Mich. \u201cThe reason is this is not a random sample of NFL players.\u201dResearchers in the study noted that it relied upon a \u201cconvenience sample,\u201d in which the former players and families entered with suspicions that the brains had sustained considerable trauma. The players included in the study averaged 15 years of time on the field, a much larger exposure to repeated hits than most recreational football players.Regardless of how the study was compiled, its detailed pathological descriptions of CTE-affected brains bring researchers closer to being able to diagnose the disease while the patient is still living.\u201cIf we were able to detect the lesions and see that there were some brain changes with these early manifestations, that would bring tremendous comfort to the individual because they would know they\u2019re not just losing their minds,\u201d said McKee. \u201cIt would also give us something to address, something to try to fix.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-shows-toll-on-brain-in-former-football-players-1501019366", "keywords": ["cte,football,nfl,nfl study,American Medical Association,american football,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 17:58:00", "news_title": "Chipotle Earnings Improve, But Customers Aren\u2019t Flocking Back", "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.        CMG -2.30%       offered mixed financial results on Tuesday, as it continues to struggle to bring back customers despite giving away food and airing its first national ad campaign.The second quarter results, which beat earnings expectations but missed analysts\u2019 projections for revenue and same-store sales growth, comes about a week after a norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle restaurant in Virginia. More than 135 customers reported getting sick after eating at its Sterling, Va., location and marked a setback from the company\u2019s efforts to recover from a series of food-safety crises in 2015.\u201cWe saw encouraging signs in our improved financial results during the first half of the year. Recent events, however, have shown that we still have a lot of opportunity to improve our operations and deliver the outstanding experience that our customers expect,\u201d said Chipotle Chief Executive       Steve Ells.The company\u2019s shares lost nearly 13% of their value last week, erasing the nearly 5% gain made this year before the norovirus outbreak was disclosed. The shares recovered somewhat on Tuesday, closing up 2.6% to $348.95. Shares continued to climb in aftermarket trading.Chipotle said its second-quarter earnings rose to $66.7 million, or $2.32 a share, from $25.6 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 17.1% to $1.17 billion and same-store sales rose 8.1%. Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.18 a share on revenue of $1.19 billion.Chipotle raised menu prices by an average of 5% in many of its markets in April, the first time in more than two years, after returning to profitability in the first quarter. The latest outbreak may delay Chipotle\u2019s ability to raise prices again to offset investments in marketing and upgrades to food-safety systems, and make it even harder to catch up to competitors that have passed along modest yearly price increases to their customers.The company on Tuesday said it has seen little resistance so far to the price increases and feels that it has room to raise prices in other markets.While Chipotle\u2019s brand perception scores were starting to climb in recent months, it hadn\u2019t returned to precrisis levels, according to brand tracking firm YouGov BrandIndex. Since the reports from Virginia surfaced, Chipotle\u2019s brand scores have slid. The percentage of consumers saying they would consider Chipotle the next time they buy fast food fell 2 percentage points to 16%, and its quality scores among consumers dropped to less than half of what it was on July 18, when the reports surfaced, the firm said.The Virginia outbreak was compounded by a viral video the same week that showed rodents scurrying around a Chipotle location in Dallas. The chain is also facing shareholder lawsuits over the company\u2019s declining stock price.Mr. Ells told investors Tuesday that an employee in Virginia was working while sick, in violation of company policy. \u201cWe took swift action and made it clear we have a zero-tolerance policy for not following our protocols,\u201d Mr. Ells said, adding that when its food safety protocols are followed, \u201cthey work perfectly.\u201d\u201cThey have an existential problem,\u201d said       Eric Schiffer,        chairman of Reputation Management Consultants. \u201cThey can\u2019t escape their past.\u201dChipotle has experienced some other problems in the past year, including a credit card data breach. Chipotle on Tuesday said it has completed its investigation into that security incident and found that the spring time frame it had previously disclosed for affected transactions was accurate for almost 99% of the restaurants.The company has made some missteps, including its first national\u2014and largest-ever\u2014ad campaign aimed at winning back customers. The ad campaign, intended to deliver the message that Chipotle only uses real ingredients, fell flat, according to analysts and branding experts. The TV spots, which featured comedians trying to act \u201creal\u201d inside a Chipotle burrito, didn\u2019t feature any food until flashing an image of a burrito at the end. In an early test of the campaign, the company said sales dropped in one out of the three markets where the ads were aired.\u201cWhen an advertising test shows that one-third of test markets have seen worse demand, that\u2019s typically not a great sign,\u201d said Sanford Bernstein analyst       Sara Senatore.       \u201cNational advertising is for introducing the brand to a broad array of people. To not talk about the food at all strikes me as odd. I view it as a missed opportunity.\u201dIt was also a costly one. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how much it spent on the ad campaign, which began running nationally in April, but said recently its marketing and promotion costs in the second quarter were higher than in the first, amounting to 3.7% of sales, or more than $43 million.Chipotle Chief Marketing Officer Mark Crumpacker on Tuesday said that while the campaign resonated with existing customers, it wasn\u2019t as effective at drawing in new customers. He said the company has begun featuring food in its ads.Mr. Schiffer said Chipotle needs to do something drastic to recover, such as change its name. Ms. Senatore, however, said that is unlikely to happen: \u201cThey just have to hope nothing else happens.\u201dWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Chipotle Wavers on Road to Recovery.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/norovirus-outbreak-undoes-progress-at-chipotle-1500984001", "keywords": ["branding,burrito,chipotle,earnings,marketing,norovirus,restaurant,steve elis,viral video,Chipotle Mexican Grill,CMG,financial performance,sales figures,earnings surprises,markets,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 17:50:00", "news_title": "Lawmaker to Try Again to Find Common Ground on Internet Rules", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014An influential House committee chairman is launching a new effort to pass compromise net-neutrality legislation, seeking common ground between high-tech and telecommunications firms that have battled for a decade over internet governance rules.Commerce Chairman       Greg Walden       (R., Ore.) said he would begin hearings in early September with executives from major internet firms such as             Facebook Inc.,Alphabet Inc.,Amazon.com Inc.       and             Netflix Inc.,       as well as major broadband providers such as             AT&T Inc.       and             Comcast Corp.The Federal Communications Commission is moving toward a vote as soon as September to void much of the current rules of the road for the internet, although officials on Tuesday didn\u2019t offer a firm timeline for a decision.Internet and telecommunications firms have bickered for the past decade over details of the rules\u2014for example, whether providers should be prohibited from blocking content or offering fast lanes to those willing to pay. The FCC also has struggled to find the proper legal footing for its internet rules among the aging federal telecommunications laws, and two previous versions of its rules were tossed out by courts.Many policy makers and tech-law experts say Congress has neglected to keep telecommunications laws up to date given the pace of change in technology and the growth of the companies that drive the internet. The last major rewrite was more than 20 years ago.\u201cIt is time for Congress to legislate the rules of the internet, and stop the ping-pong game of regulations and litigation,\u201d Mr. Walden said. He made his comments Tuesday at a subcommittee hearing on FCC oversight.Tech firms gained strong protection from their telecommunications rivals in the latest version of the net-neutrality rules adopted by the FCC in 2015, during the Obama administration. Those strict rules prohibited the providers from blocking, throttling or offering fast lanes, and reclassified the internet providers as common carriers, subjecting them to strict utility-style oversight.But the GOP victory in 2016 has led to an effort to roll back those net-neutrality rules. Republicans generally have been sympathetic to arguments by telecommunications firms that the strict 2015 version will slow investment in broadband, partly because of the risk that the rules will be further tightened to include rate regulation. Republicans are likely to seek to maintain net-neutrality principles in whatever they adopt, but the new rules are likely to be less prescriptive.The rollback effort has generated considerable controversy, and more than 12 million comments\u2014many of them opposing the rollback\u2014have been filed with the FCC, although officials question the validity of some, saying they were generated by bots. Whatever the FCC adopts is almost sure to be the subject of another lengthy legal challenge.That has further encouraged Republicans to try to pass legislation, which they last tried in 2015.Faced with the growing likelihood of a sweeping rollback of the 2015 rules, some tech firms also have appeared to voice stronger support for legislation lately.During an internet protest of the planned rollback on July 12, for example, Facebook CEO       Mark Zuckerberg       said in a posting that his company strongly supports the current rules, but is \u201copen to working with members of Congress\u201d on new legislation to protect net neutrality.Telecommunications firms were encouraged by the news, while internet companies were more reserved.AT&T Executive Vice President       Tim McKone       said in a blog post that Mr. Walden\u2019s announcement \u201cdemonstrates that momentum appears to be building for a legislative solution to put sensible open internet rules on solid ground....While being trapped in an endless loop of controversy over net neutrality may be in the interest of those who fundraise off of it, it is poor public policy that threatens investment by service providers and denies consumers the tremendous benefits that stem from such investment.\u201dComcast said in a statement, \u201cWe applaud Chairman Walden\u2019s call to hear from companies across the internet ecosystem...on the ground rules for net neutrality going forward. Comcast believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation.\u201dA spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the company received an invitation to the event and is currently reviewing it. Representatives of for Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix declined to comment.\u2014Douglas MacMillan in San Francisco contributed to this article.Write to John D.

The assets for sale include the Gawker brand, domain name, social media accounts and archive of stories.\u201cWe have begun the process of how to monetize the residual Gawker brand,\u201d Mr. Holden told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Mr. Holden said the sale process is in the early stages and that a decision on whether to retain professional advisers hasn\u2019t yet been made.Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. acquired Gawker Media\u2019s other websites last summer for $135 million. Those sites\u2014Jezebel, Gizmodo, Deadspin, Lifehacker, Jalopnik and Kotaku\u2014were integrated into Univision\u2019s Fusion Media Group and have been operated under a new company, Gizmodo Media Group.But Univision declined to take Gawker.com, \u00a0leaving the site in the hands of advisers liquidating the media company founded by       Nick Denton.       The site has been dormant for nearly a year.The terms of the Univision sale restrict anyone from publishing new content on Gawker.com until March 9, 2018, Mr. Holden said. Exploring a sale now is intended to give any interested buyers time to come up with a plan for Gawker before the content restriction expires, Mr. Holden said.The ultimate fate of Gawker.com is one of the few questions that remain unanswered in the bankruptcy. Gawker Media was forced into chapter 11 in June 2016 by a $140 million judgment in a lawsuit brought against it by Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea. The lawsuit was over the publication of the wrestler\u2019s sex tape on Gawker.In bankruptcy, Gawker Media settled with Mr. Bollea, for $31 million. The settlement also entitles Mr. Bollea to 45% of any proceeds from a potential sale of Gawker.com.Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawsuit was secretly financed by venture capitalist       Peter Thiel,        who was angered by a Gawker article published years earlier that identified him as gay.

The president has expressed skepticism about Russian interference and opposes a portion of the bill that the White House says infringes on his executive authority.The House vote was 419 to approve the bill, with just three Republicans voting against it.The provision the White House has objected to would require the president to obtain congressional approval before relaxing any sanctions against Moscow or restoring Russia\u2019s control over diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that the Obama administration had seized.The measure must now pass the Senate, which approved a different version of the bill last month that also included the congressional oversight language.\u201cNorth Korea and Russia and Iran all pose serious threats to our national security,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.) told reporters Tuesday. \u201cSuccessive administrations have struggled and failed to address them, and it is well past time to respond with meaningful action.\u201dIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he hasn\u2019t decided on whether he will sign the legislation into law. The bill can still become law without the president\u2019s signature \u200bif it goes unsigned for 10 days.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen them yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in final form.\u201dThe White House has said Mr. Trump supports sanctions but continues to have concerns about the provision that would expand congressional influence in this area.The legislation is a political challenge for the president, as congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russia\u2019s actions last year and whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. The president and Russia have denied any collusion.According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia\u2019s interference was directed from the highest levels of its government. Its tactics included hacking state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and disseminating through social media and other outlets negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.Despite the House vote, it may be weeks before a version of the sanctions bill reaches the president\u2019s desk. Although it has drawn bipartisan support, some lawmakers signaled that there were still changes to be made before the bill could reach the president\u2019s desk.The House bill, which was the subject of bipartisan negotiations, combines two measures: a North Korea bill that passed the House in May and a measure punishing Iran and Russia that cleared the Senate last month.Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.) expressed doubt on Monday that the bill could pass in the Senate before Congress leaves town for its August recess.\u201cThere are some things on the North Korea portion that need to be looked at,\u201d said Mr. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.If the Senate insists on significant changes, the legislation would have to go back to the House for a vote. The House leaves for its August recess on Friday and the Senate, which is bogged down in its attempt to pass a health-care bill, isn\u2019t likely to take up the sanctions legislation this week.The compromise legislation would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities and mandates sanctions on actors undermining cybersecurity and people engaging in significant transactions with the Russian defense and intelligence sectors. It would allow a carve-out for some joint energy ventures to go ahead, but it would sanction any new projects with foreign firms in which a sanctioned Russian person or entity holds a stake of 33% or more in the project.The bill maintains a provision related to Russian energy export pipelines, which says the president \u201cmay\u201d impose penalties on firms backing a high-profile Russian pipeline project but stops short of mandating them.That provision has upset Europeans because it poses a potential risk to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Gazprom project backed by a consortium of five European countries to transport gas from Russia to Europe through the Baltic Sea. The House bill added a stipulation that the president may do so \u201cin coordination with allies of the United States,\u201d after European countries, including Germany and Austria, protested. \u200bU.S. energy companies had lobbied Congress against the bill, citing their particular concern with an earlier version that included measures to block partnerships with Russian individuals or companies, which they said could scuttle any U.S. business partnership that involved Russian entities.\u200bThe legislation also imposes new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile program and the Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, and attempts to squeeze the cash available to North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.\u200b\u2014Paul Sonne and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-passes-bill-to-impose-new-sanctions-on-russia-1501019132", "keywords": ["congress russia sanctions,house republicans russia ,republicans russia,russia sanctions,trump russia,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 17:44:00", "news_title": "Trump Says Administration Is Taking Time on Steel Tariffs", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       said his administration would take its time in making a long-awaited decision on whether to block steel imports, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t want to do it at this moment.\u201dMr. Trump and his Commerce Secretary,       Wilbur Ross,        had earlier this year said they would complete a plan to reduce steel imports in the name of \u201cnational security\u201d by the end of June.

He said that while he scuttled a plan in April to pull out of the 23-year-old pact in favor of renegotiation, he still reserved the option to withdraw if the talks with Mexico and Canada aren\u2019t settled to his satisfaction.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a renegotiation right now, so we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have to terminate it.\u201dAsked if he thought Nafta was salvageable,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt may be salvageable\u2026I have an obligation to give it a shot.\u201dThe formal renegotiation process is slated to begin Aug. 16 in Washington.

Chief Executive Tim Cook has committed to build three big manufacturing plants in the U.S., a surprising statement that would help fulfill his administration\u2019s economic goal of reviving American manufacturing.Mr. Trump, in a 45-minute interview with The Wall Street Journal, said Mr. Cook promised him Apple would build \u201cthree big plants, beautiful plants.\u201d Mr. Trump didn\u2019t elaborate on where those plants would be located or when they would be built.\u201cI spoke to [Mr. Cook], he\u2019s promised me three big plants\u2014big, big, big,\u201d Mr. Trump said as part of a discussion about business-tax reform and business investment. \u201cI said you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won\u2019t consider my administration an economic success. He called me, and he said they are going forward.\u201dApple declined to comment.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were some of the first he has made regarding Apple manufacturing since assuming the presidency and revives pressure on the world\u2019s largest company by market value to move manufacturing operations from Asia to the U.S.Apple faced criticism from Mr. Trump last year on the campaign trail for outsourcing the production of its iPhones and other devices to factories in China. After Mr. Trump won the election, he said in Time magazine that he told Mr. Cook that he wanted \u201cApple to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it\u2019s only a foot bigger than some place in China.\u201dApple has said it supports about two million jobs in the U.S., including its own employees and those of suppliers, app developers and entrepreneurs who offer products across its devices. The company directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S.In May, Apple said it planned to create a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. companies that do advanced manufacturing. It has committed $200 million from that fund to             Corning Inc.\u2019s       glass-making facility in Harrodsburg, Ky.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this thing deeply,\u201d Mr. Cook said during an appearance on CNBC when he announced the new fund. \u201cHow do we grow our employee base? How do we grow our investor base? How do we employ [in] manufacturing?\u201dA small share of Apple\u2019s products are made in the U.S. by contract manufacturers. Flex Ltd. makes Mac computers in Austin, Texas, and             Quanta Computer Inc.       produces Macs in Fremont, Calif. However, the overwhelming majority of Apple products are assembled in China, primarily by Foxconn Technology Group, which manufactures Apple\u2019s iPhone and other products.Mr. Trump also said Tuesday that Foxconn plans to build a big plant in the U.S. and is strongly considering putting it in Wisconsin. The Wall Street Journal reported this week the Taiwan-based company is nearing a decision to invest in a manufacturing facility that would produce display panels for television sets. It could hold an event in Washington, D.C., as soon as next week regarding those plans.In an emailed statement earlier this week, Foxconn said it was reviewing \u201cpotential locations for establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S.\u201d but declined to name them.In Tuesday\u2019s interview, Mr. Trump said people in New York and other states without jobs will have to move to states like Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado that are adding manufacturing.\u201cYou\u2019re going to need people to work in these massive plants,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to start explaining to people: When you have an area that just isn\u2019t working like upper New York state, where people are getting very badly hurt, and then you\u2019ll have another area 500 miles away where you can\u2019t get people, I\u2019m going to explain, you can leave. It\u2019s OK. Don\u2019t worry about your house.\u201dBuilding three manufacturing plants would be unprecedented for Apple as it only has one plant of its own currently in Cork, Ireland, where it has operated since 1980 and benefits from lower taxes on overseas profits. Apple instead primarily relies on contract manufacturers such as Foxconn,             Pegatron Corp.      ,             Wistron Corp.       and others to make iPhones, iPads and Macs.Under Mr. Cook, Apple has built one of the business world\u2019s most sophisticated supply chains, primarily in Asia where it sources parts ranging from chips to memory. The parts are sent to manufacturers in China which assemble more than 200 million iPhones annually. Apple\u2019s manufacturing prowess has helped the company achieve gross margins\u2014a closely watched measure of profitability after manufacturing costs\u2014of about 38% and helped it rake in more than 90% of the world\u2019s smartphone profits.Jason Dedrick, a professor focusing on the globalization of information technology at Syracuse University, said in December that forcing Apple to shift manufacturing to the U.S. could put it at a competitive disadvantage to rivals like Samsung Electronics Co. He estimated that assembling iPhones in the U.S. would add $30 to $40 in production costs to each device. He would raise that total to $80 an iPhone if components like the processor, memory and display were also made in the U.S.Mr. Dedrick said that if Apple lost competitive ground to rivals, it could put some of Apple\u2019s high-paying U.S. jobs in marketing and engineering at risk. \u201cYou have to ask: Do you want to put well-paid engineers out of work because you created policies to create assembly jobs?\u201d Mr. Dedrick said.Apple, which is expected to announce second-quarter earnings next week, stands to benefit as much as any U.S. corporation from the Trump administration\u2019s tax-reform proposal, which would slash business taxes and grant a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home from overseas. It would allow Apple to bring back about $240 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries.Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-apple-ceo-has-promised-to-build-three-manufacturing-plants-in-u-s-1501012372", "keywords": ["apple manufacturing,trump apple,trump promises about apple,Apple,AAPL,Donald Trump,Tim Cook,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,interviews with corporate executives,interviews,computers,consumer electronics,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 17:30:00", "news_title": "Citigroup Aims High With Profit, Capital-Return Targets", "content": "Citigroup Inc.

The KBW             Nasdaq                   Bank index gained around 1.3% as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose to 2.33%.Citigroup shares are the best performing of the six biggest U.S. banks so far this year, up around 15%. The stock got a lift in June after the Federal Reserve approved Citigroup\u2019s $19 billion capital-return plan.During presentations\u00a0Tuesday, Citigroup executives said the bank could generate annual net income of $20 billion by 2020, up by around a third from today\u2019s level. The bank is also aiming to boost its return on tangible common equity from less than 8% in the past year to 11% by 2020.Doing so would involve returning at least $20 billion a year to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks over the next three years.Executives added that with a typical earnings multiple, Citigroup\u2019s share price could be $100 by 2020, up from around $68 today. Even so, that would still leave the stock around 80% lower than its precrisis peak, when adjusted for a reverse share split.Underpinning Citigroup\u2019s drive to improve its financial performance is a renewed focus on consumer banking. The bank plans to boost this business through new wealth services, cards and digital offerings, ending a yearslong period in which it shrunk the number of branches and products it offered.Consumer banking has been the bank\u2019s sore spot, generating returns of 13% on tangible common equity in the past year against a long-term target of 20%.The bank\u2019s head of global consumer banking,       Stephen Bird,        told investors that between cards and retail banking, Citigroup\u2019s consumer operations can achieve a 19% return on tangible common equity by 2020.That would partly be a result of higher interest rates, but also through adding more U.S. customers to its highest tier of bank account, called Citigold. Such customers generate 25 times the revenue of a typical account. The bank also aims to serve more people through inexpensive digital channels like mobile apps.\u201cWe want to have better and deeper relationships, and when we do that we earn superior economics,\u201d Mr. Bird said.Jud Linville,        the bank\u2019s global head of credit cards, said that better-than-anticipated growth in demand for cards the bank issues with Costco Wholesale Inc. will help to drive nearly 50% pretax net income growth in its\u00a0branded cards by 2020, from $2.2 billion in the past 12 months to $3 billion.He cautioned, though, that credit losses and transaction costs may creep higher, especially as more people use their cards without carrying a balance.Technology was also touted as a driver of better returns. Finance chief       John Gerspach       said automation and mobile computing will help slash $1 billion in costs by 2020.

Such requirements are typically included in the fine print of financial-services contracts for products such as credit cards, student loans and bank accounts.The vote was split along party lines, with one Republican, Walter Jones of North Carolina, joining Democrats in voting against repealing the rule.The GOP-backed measure faces tougher prospects in the Senate, where the Republicans can\u2019t lose more than two votes to pass it.Industry experts have said some senators might be reluctant to kill the rule, worried that they may be seen as siding with banks against consumers. Clauses requiring arbitration are already banned in mortgage contracts and for products sold to members of the military.The White House said Tuesday that it \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the Republican bill, adding that the CFPB\u2019s rule would harm consumers and \u201cbenefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class-action lawsuits.\u201dSupporters of the rule, including consumer groups, say repealing it would hurt consumers.Republicans are targeting the CFPB rule with the Congressional Review Act. It allows lawmakers to overturn a newly issued regulation on an expedited schedule with a majority vote in Congress. Republicans have successfully repealed more than a dozen rules under the mechanism since President       Donald Trump       took office.Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate, but it might not come up for a vote until September.Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-votes-to-repeal-cfpbs-arbitration-rule-1501017889", "keywords": ["arbitration,cfpb, class action lawsuits,congressional review act, consumer financial protection bureau, financial industry, financial regulation, lawsuits, regulations, republicans, rules,senate,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,corporate crime,legal action,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 17:21:00", "news_title": "Blue Apron Co-Founder to Step Aside as Operating Chief", "content": "One of the founders of newly public             Blue Apron Holdings Inc.             is stepping down from executive leadership after the company\u2019s rocky first month on the market.The food-delivery startup said Tuesday that Matthew Wadiak will step down as chief operating officer and serve as a senior adviser to the company.

Along the way he sponged up cultural references both of the moment and from centuries past as he strove to invest his designs with the emotional impact and elemental clarity of a kiss.\u201cEttore Sottsass: Design Radical,\u201d at the Met Breuer, tries hard to put the designer in context with the ages. But in the process it does not allow his creative output to make its own case for enduring significance. Always colorful and confrontational, Sotsass\u2019s designs range from the slightly inflated but still sleekly geometric to bulbous collages of form reminiscent of graphic comic strips, to accretions of elemental shapes approaching the archetypal.The show includes some 85 objects and drawings by Sottsass alongside about the same number of works made by other artists and from other times\u2014including Egyptian blue faience from 1400 B.C. and Buddhist shrine figures from the seventh century, classics of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in Austria circa 1900, and modern and contemporary paintings by       Paul Klee,       Wassily Kandinsky       and       Frank Stella.       (Works by such talents of today as Studio Job and Oeuffice are intended to show how Sottsass continues to inspire, but many look more like products of a postmodernist revival.)Arraying Sottsass\u2019s zigzag-shaped ceramics together with ceremonial Aztec burial pots and Tantric cosmology drawings is both revealing and intriguing. And the colored glass jars from the fourth to fifth century look like direct ancestors of his blown-glass vases from the 1980s. But there\u2019s a danger in placing, for instance, one of       Donald Judd\u2019s       stacked works next to Sottsass\u2019s pinstriped laminated nearly 7-foot-tall cabinet (\u201cSuperbox,\u201d c. 1970), where the former\u2019s mesmerizing precision is likely to upstage the latter\u2019s insouciant utilitarianism.Presenting Sottssas\u2019s fervid imagination as having been fertilized by centuries of precedents is too simplistic. A manufacturing resurgence in postwar Italy\u2014especially among fashion, design and furniture factories in the north\u2014 fueled new wealth as well as passionate ambivalence about American-style consumerism. Then came the \u201960s, churning with disenchantment and political disarray that in Italy disintegrated into chaotic violence. Many creative intellectuals withdrew into utopian theory, experiment, an embrace of American pop culture, and\u2014for Sottsass especially\u2014Eastern cultures and mysticism. That\u2019s the context that really informed Sottsass\u2019s restless imagination.But it was world travel in search of raw inspiration that increasingly shaped his emotionally resonant forms. For decades he seemed to land wherever the talent and the action was, from a brief stint in New York in the 1960s working for       George Nelson,        the influential midcentury-modern designer, to San Francisco, where he hung out with the poet       Allen Ginsberg,        who introduced him to       Bob Dylan.       Back East he participated in the landmark 1972 exhibition \u201cItaly, the New Domestic Landscape\u201d at the Museum of Modern Art, and along the way vacationed with       Ernest Hemingway       and visited       Andy Warhol       at the Factory. He followed the truth-seekers to India, returning there almost yearly, and then started going to China, where the ancient round houses stimulated new ideas for architecture in his final years. The show includes vivid snapshots of those travels taken by Sottsass and others, as well as a rivetingly weird film from the 1972 MoMA exhibition.The last and largest gallery space focuses on Memphis, the company Sottsass co-founded with an international troupe of designer renegades intent on casting off the straitjacket of modernism (already quite threadbare) and injecting household objects with a life force more colorful, irreverent and emotionally charged than the dull mass-produced wares on the market. Described as the New International Style, the first Memphis collection of chairs, cabinets, lamps, jewelry and ceramics shown at a Milan gallery in September 1981 was an instant sensation, with some 2,500 people stampeding the opening.

Baime.The Mille Miglia started out in 1927 as an Italian race from Brescia to Rome and back\u2014a thousand miles of flat-out speed. In 1957, a famous driver named       Alfonso de Portago       lost control of his Ferrari, and an accident left about a dozen people dead. The race was canceled. But in the late 1970s, organizers brought the Mille Miglia back as a controlled rally for vintage cars\u2014vehicles that had competed in the original race, or a period-correct make and model of one.I read about this rally, and along with my old college roommate       Brian Grozier      \u2014who has since passed away\u2014we began to hunt for a car. I was not keen on spending hundreds of thousands\u2014or even millions\u2014on a vintage Ferrari, Maserati or Alfa Romeo, but I learned that there were a few American cars that competed in the original Mille Miglia. So I bought a 1954 Lincoln Capri seven years ago, for just over $30,000. This was a car we could actually fit in. (Both Brian and I were over 6 feet.)This past May, the Lincoln finished its fifth Mille Miglia. Compared to the other cars, it\u2019s ginormous, and one of the cheapest. The toolboxes of some of these vintage Ferraris cost more than my car. The Lincoln is also very comfortable. It has bucket seats, power windows, an automatic transmission and a big V-8 engine. At times, you\u2019re moving at 90 mph, and it\u2019s like driving a sofa.The event itself is astonishing\u2014four days motoring through Italy. In Siena, we took the car down centuries-old thoroughfares normally closed to vehicles, with stone walls less than a thumb-width on either side of the car. In Rome, the rain came in sheets. In one village after another, you see old couples dressed to the nines sitting at tables with bottles of wine, watching these glamorous cars go by. The event is often called \u201cthe greatest antique car rally in the world,\u201d and I would agree.I have had plenty of mechanical problems through these rallies. Before my friend Brian passed away, he nicknamed the car Regan after the character in \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d because clearly this vehicle is haunted. But it has never failed to finish a rally, and I am already eyeing next year\u2019s drive.\u2014Contact A.J.

Jerry Brown      \u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0signed into law a cap-and-trade program he hailed as central to achieving the state\u2019s ambitious agenda on climate change.Considered a global model, California\u2019s cap-and-trade program requires businesses here to obtain permits for greenhouse-gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. Scientists say such gases are a major contributor to climate change.\u00a0Under the new law,\u00a0the program will be extended through 2030.The state hopes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, one of the most ambitious targets in the world.\u201cYou are here witnessing one of the key milestones in turning around this carbonized world into a decarbonized, sustainable future,\u201d Mr. Brown told a crowd of industry officials, environmentalists and politicians, including former Republican Gov.       Arnold Schwarzenegger,        who gathered at a bill-signing ceremony on San Francisco\u2019s Treasure Island.But some environmentalists are openly criticizing Mr. Brown\u2019s new formation of cap and trade as too lenient on industry, giving businesses too many loopholes.\u00a0For instance, the new legislation blocks local air districts from setting new limits on CO2 emissions from refineries and other businesses under the cap-and-trade program.Kathryn Phillips,        director of the Sierra Club California, said that rule, among others issues, led her group to oppose the extension, saying\u00a0the policy\u00a0\u201callows an industry to effectively pay its way out of putting on emission control devices.\u201dThe Brown administration has pushed back on these criticisms, saying the legislation places only narrow restrictions on the state\u2019s regulators. They also say the legislation reduces the number of free permits the state gives to industry over time, reducing giveaways to industry.Mr. Brown has sought to position the state as a leader on climate change and placed a high priority on the program\u2019s extension. His efforts increased after President       Donald Trump       said in June the U.S. would withdraw from the 2016 Paris agreement\u2014a global accord that saw nations around the world voluntarily sign on to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.Mr. Brown has helped lead an effort of cities and states determined to meet the U.S. commitments under the agreement, but back home the governor had struggled to unite Democrats, Republicans, environmentalists and businesses.Some moderate Democrats didn\u2019t approve of Mr. Brown\u2019s cap-and-trade extension over concerns about job losses.\u00a0Some Republicans said his agenda will result in economic calamity.State Sen.       Ted Gaines,        a Republican representing 11 rural counties in the state\u2019s northeast, said last week that the program would bring about \u201cthe next great California recession.\u201dFollowing weeks of intense negotiations, Mr. Brown gained approval of his plan with Republicans joining Democrats for a vote that required two-thirds of the legislature.Last week\u2019s\u00a0two-thirds margin\u2014the threshold needed for new revenue proposals in the state\u2014should insulate the program from further legal challenges such as the one brought by the California Chamber of Commerce.The Chamber sued the state, arguing cap and trade is an illegal tax on businesses, but the program was upheld by a state appeals court in April, and the California Supreme Court last month declined to hear the group\u2019s appeal.After the loss, the Chamber backed cap and trade as a better option than more-onerous regulations.California began using a cap-and-trade program to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2013. The state imposes a limit on the CO2 that industry is allowed to release and then auctions or gives away permits for those emissions. Businesses are free to sell permits they don\u2019t need, allowing market forces to distribute and price these allowances.Money from the quarterly auctions, so far totaling $4.9 billion, will also go toward a state fund used for projects that include one of Mr. Brown\u2019s priorities: a high-speed rail train from Los Angeles to San Francisco.Write to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-governor-signs-cap-and-trade-legislation-1501014813", "keywords": ["california,california chamber of commerce,cap-and-trade program,climate change,co2 ,environmentalists,greenhouse-gas emissions,Jerry Brown,political,general news,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,air,water,land quality,regional politics,commodity,financial market news,emission markets"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 16:27:00", "news_title": "McDonald\u2019s Earnings Top Expectations, Helped by New Sandwiches", "content": "McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s        MCD -1.61%       bet that low prices will bring in customers is paying off for now.The burger giant, which beat analysts\u2019 expectations with its second-quarter results, said its $1 drinks promotion and a new line of burgers helped reverse a sales slump in its U.S. business.\u201cIt\u2019s a market-share fight,\u201d Chief Executive       Steve Easterbrook       told investors on Tuesday, saying McDonald\u2019s has won back some customers after deciding that price promotions were a way to quickly boost traffic.But the company isn\u2019t relying on such short-term tactics to regain and retain customers it lost to rival fast-food chains in the last few years.McDonald\u2019s has been introducing new menu items priced with its core budget-conscious customers in mind and adding more conveniences like self-order kiosks, food delivery and a mobile order and payment app. It has also been remodeling many of its restaurants. Those moves are all longer-term changes the company said it hopes will keep customers coming back.\u201cPeople had quit giving McDonald\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, a Memphis-based investment firm that owns shares of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cTo get people to see the changes you\u2019re making, you have to drive them in the door. They may not be getting as fast of an experience as they were a year or two ago but it\u2019s a higher quality experience.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s speed of service has been declining, Mr. Easterbrook confirmed with analysts. But order accuracy and quality perception scores have improved, he said, adding that he hopes the self-order kiosks and mobile-order and pay app will shave seconds off order times.The chain reported better-than-expected domestic same-store sales growth in the second quarter, contributing to the strongest global same-store sales and traffic growth in more than five years.Revenue fell for the quarter, however, as McDonald\u2019s sold more of its restaurants to franchisees and is no longer collecting the full amount of revenue from them, the company said.Investors cheered the results, sending McDonald\u2019s shares up 5.1% to $159.57.McDonald\u2019s recently found that most of the consumers it had lost in recent years had defected to rival fast-food chains serving cheaper food rather than the higher-priced fast-casual restaurants it had been trying to emulate with healthier items such as salads and snack wraps.The company said its renewed focus on the fast-food customer led to its recent decision to begin using fresh, rather than frozen, beef in its quarter-pound burgers. It is currently rolling out a line of semi-customizable burgers topped with ingredients other than the usual tomatoes and lettuce. Those burgers, while more expensive than its Big Macs, are a lot cheaper than the ones sold by \u201cbetter burger\u201d restaurants such as Five Guys.Executives said they need to be careful about not raising menu prices too much. Restaurants in the last year have taken a hit as customers found it much cheaper to eat at home than to eat out. The gap between the cost of food-at-home and away widened considerably last year as a number of key commodities prices dropped.McDonald\u2019s finance chief,       Kevin Ozan,        said he is carefully monitoring key inflation indexes to make sure McDonald\u2019s price inflation remains below that of food-at-home.The company has tightened its focus on operations, with plans to encourage underperforming franchisees to sell their restaurants to better-performing ones, resulting in fewer, better operators. RBC Capital Markets, which expects more than 1,000 McDonald\u2019s in the U.S. to change hands, says the move could prove to be a \u201cpowerful sales driver.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s also agreed to put up 55% of the cost of certain restaurant upgrades if franchisees agreed to fund an advertising campaign for a national value menu.The majority of its U.S. franchisees approved the advertising funding and will be renovating their restaurants to include new dessert counters and self-order kiosks.McDonald\u2019s reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $1.70 a share, up from $1.09 billion, or $1.25 a share a year ago. Analysts were expecting $1.62 a share.Revenue for the quarter totaled $6.05 billion, down from $6.27 billion last year, but above the $5.96 billion analysts expected.

That euphoria might have led them to over promise when they laid out their goals for the next few years.A big driver of the rally has been improved capital returns. Citigroup passed the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress test in June, winning authorization to double its dividend and boost share buybacks by 50%.Over the next four quarters, Citigroup is set to pay out nearly 130% of its projected profit to shareholders, executives said Tuesday. This is crucial because it means the bank can begin whittling away at the excess, dormant capital that has dragged on returns.Citigroup\u2019s new set of ambitious financial targets, unveiled at an investor day on Tuesday, sent shares up around 3%. Before Tuesday, the stock had risen 9% since the end of May.The main number to watch is an 11% return on tangible common equity that the bank is targeting in 2020. The number was 7.6% in 2016 and was already promised to be 10% in 2019.Some of the assumptions feeding into this forecast are reasonable and within the bank\u2019s control, namely more capital payouts and cost cuts. Others are less so. Citigroup believes it can boost revenue in its institutional client business by 4% a year, and in its global consumer business by 5% a year in constant currency terms. Particularly on the consumer side, this looks optimistic.Citigroup acknowledges that revenue has been weak in this business for years but notes it has risen 4% over the past 12 months. To keep this growth spurt going for years, the key drivers will be credit-card lending in the U.S., 10% annual growth for its Mexico business, and expansion of wealth-management services in markets across Asia.Responding to a questioner who was skeptical of the Mexico growth target,       Stephen Bird,        head of the global consumer business, said it is based on just 2% economic growth in Mexico. Deepening penetration of credit cards and other financial products will allow the bank to grow faster, he argued.In Asia, Citigroup\u2019s plan to court on wealthy clients is similar to that of many competitors, including Swiss private banks, other global commercial banks, and ambitious local lenders in Singapore and Hong Kong. Not everyone will succeed.Finally, relying too much on credit cards and other unsecured consumer loans, in the U.S. and elsewhere, carries the risk of more defaults.Citigroup Chief Executive       Michael Corbat       and his team deserve credit for turning around a huge, struggling financial giant.

On Monday, SoftBank confirmed it and Didi would lead a $2.5 billion fundraising round in Grab, giving the startup more ammunition in its battle against Uber across Southeast Asia.SoftBank\u2019s talks with Uber are described as preliminary and one-sided, and any deal would likely be on hold until Uber hires a new chief executive, which isn\u2019t expected for weeks, the people familiar with the matter said.An Uber spokesman declined to comment. SoftBank didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.While it is rare for SoftBank to hedge its investments, an offer could mean it hopes Uber combines its operations with Grab and Ola, as it did last year with Didi.Such a merger would give SoftBank a formidable share of the Asian market. Uber, which is struggling with management challenges at home and strong competition from rivals overseas, has shown a willingness to retreat from costly battles around the world.Earlier this month, it said it plans to combine its operations with Russian rival Yandex.Taxi, owned by Yandex NV.Uber co-founder       Travis Kalanick      relinquished his role as chief executive last month after investors demanded he step down. His resignation followed a number of scandals as well as an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the company. Mr. Kalanick remains on the board. SoftBank and Didi will pour as much as $2 billion into Grab, which operates private-car, taxi, motorcycle and carpool bookings across seven countries in Asia.The deal would value Grab at more than $6 billion, making it the region\u2019s most-valuable startup, according to a person familiar with the situation.

GM 0.14%       provided a clearer portrait of its future, revealing how big a bet it is placing on the continued strength of U.S. buyers.The company\u2019s financial performance, reported Tuesday, was dented by moves it is making to exit Europe and certain emerging markets. More than $1 billion in costs led to a 42% plunge in second-quarter earnings to $1.7 billion and overshadowed the underlying strength of its core North American operation.The Detroit auto giant said the short-term pain is worth it, with Chief Executive       Mary Barra       saying that selling its money-losing Opel unit and shuttering operations in India and South Africa \u201cwill allow us to deploy resources and capital to higher-return opportunities.\u201d Topping that list: a new line of hulking pickup trucks due in 2018 and the revitalization of Cadillac\u2019s premium product line.Ms. Barra has benefited from a strengthening U.S. market since taking GM\u2019s helm in 2014, banking record profits and fat margins that helped the company pay for costly safety recalls and jump-start its self-driving car efforts. In the second-quarter, North American margins exceeded 12%, among the healthiest anywhere in the global auto industry, as customers continued to snap up Chevy Silverados and Cadillac Escalades that are popular amid cheap gasoline prices.Ms. Barra, however, faces one of her thorniest challenges in more than three years at the helm. She \u200bneeds to maintain production discipline and hold incentives in check, a job that is complicated by the company\u2019s drastic pullback from selling to rental-car fleets that have long been Detroit\u2019s biggest customer.GM\u2019s North America unit contributed nearly all of the company\u2019s $3.68 billion in operating profit in the second quarter, dwarfing the operating profit and equity income derived from its other key operations\u2014China and the GM Financial lending arm.The auto maker enters the second half of 2017 with excess inventory in North America, resulting from robust production schedules in the first six months of the year. Nearly 1 million unsold GM vehicles are sitting on dealer lots, representing 105 days of supply.Inventories ballooned amid slower-than-expected sales of passenger cars, which prompted GM to begin cutting production at several U.S. factories. Other plants will be temporarily idled this fall so that assembly lines can be prepared for new sport utilities, pickups and crossover wagons, the hottest models on dealer lots.GM Chief Financial Officer       Chuck Stevens       said the company will report weaker third-quarter earnings as a result of needed production cuts. He committed to whittling down excess stock by the end of the year.Mr. Stevens said history is on the company\u2019s side. The strongest selling season for trucks is traditionally the second half of the year, a factor that could offset the negative impact of production cuts.\u201cThe North American business model is proving to be very resilient to some of the challenges that we\u2019re facing,\u201d Mr. Stevens said. GM should finish 2017 with 10% pretax operating margin and could hit that level again next year, he said.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said GM \u201cdeserves credit\u201d for sticking by its 2017 profit forecast of $6 to $6.50 per share even amid weaker-than-expected demand, and he believes the company could finish at the high end of that range. Still, he warned in a research note that next year could get tougher as falling industry sales pressure profit margins.\u201cThe risk of negative earnings revisions of \u201918 estimates could pressure GM,\u201d he wrote.For the second quarter, GM posted operating profit of $1.89 per share, breezing past Wall Street expectations of $1.69 per share. The per-share figure excludes results from GM\u2019s Opel business in Europe, which is slated to be sold to French car makerPeugeot                   by year\u2019s end.China\u2014GM\u2019s No. 2 profit generator and top market by sales volume\u2014continued to provide steady income of about $500 million, even amid flattening consumer demand as sales of pricier SUVs and GM\u2019s Cadillac luxury line padded profits.GM got a lift from a nascent recovery in South America, which has been a drag on the bottom line in recent quarters.

But he said he also is considering replacing Ms. Yellen with Mr. Cohn, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council director after a 26-year career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know this, but yes he is,\u201d he said, when asked if Mr. Cohn, who was present during the interview, was a candidate for the job. \u201cI actually think he likes what he\u2019s doing right now.\u201dMr. Cohn has been managing the search for the next Fed chief and has emerged as a key intermediary in the administration\u2019s relationship with the central bank.\u201cI\u2019ve known Gary for a long time, but I\u2019ve gained great respect for Gary working with him, so Gary certainly would be in the mix,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Cohn and other White House officials have said he is focused on his current job. But former colleagues have said he has developed an appreciation for the power of the Fed during his long career on Wall Street, and for the central bank\u2019s relative independence during his current stint in Washington.As for Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump said, \u201cShe is in the running, absolutely.\u201d\u201cI like her; I like her demeanor. I think she\u2019s done a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see rates stay low. She\u2019s historically been a low-interest-rate person.\u201dMr. Trump said there are \u201ctwo or three\u201d other contenders in the mix, but declined to name any other potential candidates and said he probably wouldn\u2019t announce a nominee until the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s early to make the decision,\u201d he said, noting Ms. Yellen\u2019s term doesn\u2019t expire until February. He said he expected the confirmation process for the Fed job would move quickly.Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce criticism of the Fed and Ms. Yellen in the final weeks of his campaign led many to conclude he was unlikely to reappoint her. But the two have forged an amicable relationship since he took office, reflected in part by his willingness to consider her for the job.Mr. Trump has offered contrasting views of Ms. Yellen during the campaign and his first months in office.In May 2016 Mr. Trump said Ms. Yellen was doing a good job, but he likely would replace her when her term expires. Four months later, he accused the Fed chairwoman of being \u201chighly political\u201d and keeping interest rates low to help President       Barack Obama.In an April interview with the Journal, he left open the possibility of nominating Ms. Yellen for another four-year term as chairwoman. \u201cI like her; I respect her,\u201d he said at the time.Since taking office, the president and his advisers haven\u2019t publicly questioned the Fed\u2019s actions\u2014including its decision to raise short-term interest rates in March and June, and pencil in another rate increase this year.The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at its two-day meeting that ends Wednesday.Ms. Yellen hasn\u2019t said whether she would like to serve another term as chairwoman, or whether she intends to step down from the Fed board of governors when her term as chairwoman expires.\u201cI absolutely intend to serve out my term,\u201d she told lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m very focused on trying to achieve our congressionally mandated objectives, and I really haven\u2019t had to give further thought at this point to this question.\u201dLater, when asked what she would say if Mr. Trump asked her to serve another term, she said, \u201cIt is certainly something that I would discuss with the president, obviously.\u201dIf Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t renominate Ms. Yellen, it would be highly unusual. The tenure of Fed chairmen is staggered, by design, to end the year following a new president\u2019s inauguration. But most presidents have chosen to keep the central bank chief on for another term.The last time a Fed chairman wasn\u2019t renominated by a new president was in 1978, when President       Jimmy Carter       replaced Arthur Burns with William Miller. Mr. Miller lasted for 17 months at the central bank before Mr. Carter nominated him to be Treasury secretary, and replaced him with       Paul Volcker.Mr. Trump entered office with two vacancies on the Fed board, and a third slot opened up in April when Fed governor       Daniel Tarullo,        the Fed\u2019s point man on Wall Street regulation, stepped down.Mr. Trump nominated       Randal Quarles,        an investment-fund manager who served in the Treasury Department in both Bush administrations, to be Fed vice chairman for supervision earlier this month. The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a hearing on his confirmation Thursday, and he is expected to receive broad Republican support.The White House also has been considering economist       Marvin Goodfriend       to fill a second vacancy on the Fed board, according to people familiar with the matter. It isn\u2019t clear when his nomination might be announced and submitted to the Senate.The White House also has been searching for a community banker to fill the third vacancy, the result of a new requirement that someone on the Fed board have experience dealing with small banks. But officials have had trouble finding a nominee willing to comply with strict federal ethics rules, which require Fed governors to divest of their interest in financial firms.Write to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'President Weighs Yellen, Cohn for Fed.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-cohn-and-yellen-are-contenders-to-lead-the-fed-1501011815", "keywords": ["cohn,fed,fed chair,fed leader,trump,trump fed,yellen,The Fed,Marvin Goodfriend,Randal Quarles,Gary Cohn,Janet Yellen,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 15:43:00", "news_title": "Trump Nominee for Justice Post Defends His Work for Russian Bank ", "content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       nominee for a top Justice Department post defended his work for a Russian bank Tuesday and he said Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets attacking Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       were \u201cdifficult\u201d for him to hear.Brian Benczkowski,        a lawyer who served in the       George W. Bush       Justice Department, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering his nomination to run the department\u2019s criminal division. The division handles some of the department\u2019s highest-profile fraud, public corruption and cybercrime cases.Mr. Benczkowski, who has never worked as a line prosecutor, fielded questions about whether his experience qualified him to run the division.But given Mr. Benczkowski\u2019s ties to a Russian bank, lawmakers focused most of their questions on how the nominee would handle any investigations into Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. Special Counsel       Robert Mueller      is investigating that interference and whether there was any coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.Democrats pressed Mr. Benczkowski Tuesday on whether he would step down if Mr. Trump tried to fire Mr. Mueller, and they pressed him to remove himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation. Mr. Benczkowski said he would recuse himself from any probe touching former clients, but declined to remove himself entirely from the special counsel investigation, saying he wasn\u2019t yet briefed on Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.He said he would refuse to follow orders he believed to be unlawful. \u201cIf I were designated to do anything that I believe violated the law, or a statute, I would try to talk whoever asked me to do that out of that order. And I couldn\u2019t convince him...I would resign,\u201d Mr. Benczkowski said.Mr. Trump in recent days has publicly criticized Mr. Sessions, describing him as \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and asking why he isn\u2019t investigating Democrat       Hillary Clinton,        who was Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the presidential campaign. Mr. Sessions recused himself from that investigation at the outset of his tenure, citing his work on the Trump campaign.Mr. Sessions, a former senator from Alabama, in March also recused himself from overseeing any investigations into Russia\u2019s interference, again citing his involvement in the campaign. His decision came shortly after he acknowledged that he hadn\u2019t disclosed in his confirmation hearings that he had meetings with a Russian diplomat during the campaign.Mr. Benczkowski described Mr. Sessions, whom he worked for when Mr. Sessions served in the Senate, as a \u201cman of integrity who cares deeply about the institutional independence of the department.\u201d\u201cI think he goes to work every day doing his dead-level best to protect that independence, and those sorts of comments are painful and difficult for me to hear,\u201d Mr. Benczkowski said in response to questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets.Mr. Benczkowski also defended his recent work as a private attorney for Alfa Bank, a Russian institution with close ties to Russian President       Vladimir Putin.       Earlier this year, he supervised a computer forensic investigation on behalf of the bank into suspicious cyber activity targeting the financial institution.The bank came under scrutiny last year after allegations surfaced that its computer servers were covertly communicating with one at the Trump Organization offices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has since determined there were no such exchanges of information, according to people briefed on the investigation.Mr. Benczkowski said he was approached by a fellow partner at the Kirkland & Ellis law firm,       Viet Dinh,        to oversee the investigation by Stroz Frieberg, a cybersecurity firm.Stroz Frieberg determined there was no evidence that activity resulted from communications between the bank or the Trump Organization, Mr. Dinh wrote in a letter to the committee. In fact, Mr. Dinh wrote, the pattern of activity led to \u201cconcerns that Alfa Bank had been the victim of a malicious and potentially unlawful effort to manufacture the false appearance of a relationship\u201d between the Trump Organization and the bank.Mr. Benczkowski said he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation involving the forensic examination. He said he would recuse himself for two years from overseeing any investigations involving Alfa Bank.\u201cMy job was to oversee Stroz\u2019s work, to set the scope of their investigative mandate, to remain in contact with them during the course of their investigation and essentially ensure their work was proceeding apace,\u201d Mr. Benczkowski said. \u201cIt is something I have done many times in the course of the last seven years as an attorney in private practice.\u201dDemocrats expressed incredulity that Mr. Benczkowski would have accepted such work when he was potentially up for a job at the Justice Department. Mr. Benczkowski said he wasn\u2019t sure he would be offered a Justice Department position when he accepted the Alfa Bank project.Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       of California and other Democrats expressed disappointment that Mr. Benczkowski wouldn\u2019t commit to recusing himself from any matters being investigated by Mr. Mueller in light of his work for Alfa Bank, including reviewing a dossier that discussed the bank and potential election meddling.\u201cI\u2019m concerned with his refusal, especially given the position for which he has been nominated,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.Write to Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-nominee-for-justice-post-defends-his-work-at-senate-hearing-1501011585", "keywords": ["criminal division,justice department,lawmakers,lawyer,russian bank,senate judiciary committee,trump organization,Donald Trump,Brian Benczkowski,assault,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 15:38:00", "news_title": "U.S. Government Bonds Pull Back Ahead of Fed Statement", "content": "A bout of selling hit the U.S. government bond market Tuesday as investors hedged their bets ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting.Bond prices dropped at the start of trading in Europe and continued falling for most of the U.S. trading session without much of a catalyst to spark the move.The selling sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2.328% from 2.253% Monday, marking its largest one-day increase since March 1. Yields rise when bond prices fall.After two weeks of gains, investors and analysts said the time was probably right for a pullback in the market, especially as the Fed prepares to make its latest policy statement on Wednesday.Small to moderate selloffs heading into Fed decisions have happened often recently, as the central bank has begun to slowly raise interest rates.In this case, investors don\u2019t expect the central bank to lift rates. But the central bank could set a date for when it will start unwinding its balance sheet\u2014a move that, while not a big surprise, would signal a level of confidence in the economy and a willingness to pursue tighter monetary policies.\u201cIf they go ahead and announce the actual date, even if it\u2019s October, that would indicate that they must have learned something,\u201d said Jim Vogel, interest-rates strategist at FTN Financial.Other factors also weighed on Treasurys. Strong corporate earnings and a move higher in oil prices helped push up U.S. stocks and sap demand for haven bonds. There was also a $26 billion sale of two-year notes, the first of three auctions this week.The combination of a Fed meeting and new debt supply \u201ctends to push customers to the sideline and maybe get people a little nervous,\u201d said Ray Remy, head of fixed-income trading in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.This week\u2019s turn toward higher yields is the latest twist for the Treasury market, which has endured big swings over the past month.Toward the end of June, bonds sold off sharply amid signs that major central banks outside of the U.S., such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, were poised to start scaling back stimulus programs.After spending two weeks climbing higher, yields proceeded to fall almost as hard as central bank officials on both sides of the Atlantic suggested they would be cautious about tightening monetary policy in the face of soft inflation data.Though occasionally influenced by political developments, investors say that the fate of the Treasurys market largely comes down to economic data. If inflation picks up, it would present a clear path for the Fed to keep raising interest rates, likely pushing the 10-year yield back toward its 2017 high of around 2.6%.If inflation remains stuck below the Fed\u2019s 2% annual target, many investors expect yields to either fall or stay around current levels.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bonds-pull-back-signaling-end-to-rally-1500992857", "keywords": [" 10 year bond, 10 year note, 10 year yield, 30 year yield, bond market,bonds, treasury note, treasury notes, treasurys, us bonds,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 15:17:00", "news_title": "Labor Shortage Squeezes Home Builders ", "content": "One of the reasons for the housing shortage that is gripping the U.S. is especially perplexing: the dearth of construction workers.The size of the construction workforce in the U.S. declined to 10.4 million in 2015 from 10.6 million near the bottom of the market in 2010, according to a new analysis of U.S. Census data by       Issi Romem,        chief economist at BuildZoom, a website for contractors.Contrast that with the period from 2000 to 2005 when the construction labor force\u2014the sum of employed and unemployed workers\u2014swelled to 11.5 million from 9.3 million.A critical reason for the recent declines is the graying of the American construction workforce. While construction workers in 2000 were younger on average than workers overall, that trend has reversed, according to Mr. Romem. In 2000, the average construction worker was 7.5 months younger than the typical U.S. worker. By 2005, the gap widened to nearly 18 months.But now the average construction worker is older than the average employee by 5.5 months.\u201cThe industry has lost a lot of its younger workers and hasn\u2019t been able to bring them back,\u201d Mr. Romem said.As older workers retire, younger ones aren\u2019t replacing them, leading to a crunch for workers. The result: fewer new housing units are being built, and those that are tend to be more expensive, in part because of rising wages.Economists don\u2019t have a compelling answer for why young workers are shunning the construction industry, even though jobs are plentiful and wages are rising. Builders and economists speculate that young people want jobs that involve technology because those are seen as more fashionable and spending hours in front of computers has made manual labor less appealing.It also might be that because the housing boom has been concentrated in pricey downtowns, far from where many millennials without college educations live.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-shortage-squeezes-home-builders-1501010255", "keywords": [" construction jobs, construction workers, demographics, home building,home construction, housing construction,political,general news,real estate,property,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading   industry news,suggested reading \u2013 construction,building construction,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 15:15:00", "news_title": "Trump Won\u2019t Say if He Will Fire Sessions ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump      \u00a0expressed his disappointment in Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0and questioned the importance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s early endorsement of       Mr. Trump\u2019s       candidacy, but the president declined to\u00a0say whether he planned to fire him.\u201cIt\u2019s not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\u201dAsked\u00a0whether he would remove Mr. Sessions from office, Mr. Trump said he was unhappy with the attorney general\u2019s\u00a0decision to recuse himself from the probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.The president has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sessions in recent interviews and on Twitter.\u201cI\u2019m just looking at it,\u201d the president said when asked how long he could continue to criticize Mr. Sessions without firing him. \u201cI\u2019ll just see. It\u2019s a very important thing.\u201dMr. Trump said he had no immediate plans to make any other changes to his top staff.In the interview, he was joined by his daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump, National Economic Council Director       Gary Cohn,        Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Communications Director       Anthony Scaramucci       and Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications.Mr. Trump said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the addition of Mr. Scaramucci, whose appointment was announced Friday.

He was a senator from Alabama. I won the state by a lot, massive numbers. A lot of the states I won by massive numbers. But he was a senator, he looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, \u2019What do I have to lose?\u2019 And he endorsed me. So it\u2019s not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement. But I\u2019m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\u201dMr. Trump blamed Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal on the Russia probe as the reason the Justice Department named       Robert Mueller       as special counsel in charge of the investigation. Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment came after Mr. Trump fired former FBI Director       James Comey,        who had been overseeing the investigation.According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence community, Russia\u2019s interference was directed at the highest levels of its government. Its tactics included hacking state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and disseminating through social media and other outlets negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said. Russia has denied meddling. The investigation is also looking at whether anyone on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians, which Mr. Trump has denied, characterizing the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dMr. Trump suggested Tuesday that those intelligence leaks that revealed his team\u2019s contacts with Russian officials were coming from people who supported his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.\u201cThey\u2019ve lost an election and they came up with this as an excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd the only ones that are laughing are the Democrats and the Russians.

The event\u2019s Spirited Awards is considered the industry\u2019s equivalent to the Oscars, with honors in several categories.Other New York City award recipients included Dante, the Greenwich Village dining and drinking spot that was recognized as the Best American Restaurant Bar and the NoMad Bar, which was honored for the Best American Bar Team.       Jeff Bell,        general manager of PDT, a craft cocktail bar in the East Village, was named American Bartender of the Year.BlackTail has won fans for its fanciful takes on tropical drinks and other classic cocktails, from the daiquiri to the Old Fashioned, since it opened in August 2016. Even the bar\u2019s version of the rum-and-cola is an elaborate affair that goes beyond the namesake ingredients to incorporate Champagne and a bitter Italian spirit.For the BlackTail team, headed by veteran barmen       Jack McGarry       and       Sean Muldoon,        the Tales recognition is something of a repeat affair.Messrs. McGarry and Muldoon took home the World\u2019s Best New Cocktail Bar honor at Tales\u2019 Spirited Awards in 2013 for the Dead Rabbit, their Irish-themed establishment in lower Manhattan that has one of the city\u2019s most ambitious drink menus. The Dead Rabbit also has received other Tales awards over the years, including ones for World\u2019s Best Bar in 2015 and Best Cocktail Menu in 2013 and 2015.Still, Mr. Muldoon says the honor for BlackTail was especially gratifying because it showed the team\u2019s previous success wasn\u2019t a fluke. Moreover, even though the award is best known among members of the trade, he says the recognition doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by the general public.\u201cIt definitely raises the bar\u2019s profile,\u201d he said. To that end, BlackTail already is promoting the honor via social-media channels and on its website.Ann Tuennerman,        founder and executive director of Tales of the Cocktail, says she wasn\u2019t surprised the BlackTail team emerged victorious.\u201cThey\u2019re amazing operators,\u201d she said, noting how Messrs. McGarry and Muldoon focus on the smallest of details, even beyond the cocktail menu.Indeed, at BlackTail, the barmen went so far as to find a furniture maker who could craft stools similar to the ones       Ernest Hemingway       had in his Cuban home.Though he wouldn\u2019t provide sales figures, Mr. Muldoon says business has been steady at BlackTail.

The category enjoyed compound annual growth of 9% over the past decade, compared with growth of 5% for the larger luxury sector, according to Exane.High-end brands like Michael Kors have stalled after pushing distribution too hard and selling through discount channels, said       Luca Solca,        Exane BNP Paribas\u2019s head of luxury research.The luxury industry\u2019s biggest players\u2014Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy             LVMH,       Herm\u00e8s and Kering, owner of Gucci\u2014have reinvigorated their brands with a focus on sharper designs that generate buzz on the runway and beyond. European luxury houses also tightly control their brand images by selling through their own stores.In the U.S., Michael Kors and rival             Coach Inc.       have historically been more reliant on department stores that often deeply discount their products, leaving shoppers reluctant to pay full price.Michael Kors reported a $26.8 million loss for the quarter ended April 1 and has embarked on a turnaround program. In May the company said it would close 100 to 125 of its full-price retail stores and renovate existing shops.The company has reined in the amount of products it sends to department stores, raised prices and set out to get more creative with its designs.Pressure on Michael Kors to seek out new growth intensified after Coach in May agreed to buy Kate Spade & Co. for $2.4 billion, in a bid to tap its colorful styles to woo younger consumers. Coach in 2015 made its own luxury shoemaker acquisition, buying upscale brand Stuart Weitzman in a deal valued at up to $574 million.Buying London-based Jimmy Choo reduces Michael Kors\u2019s reliance on the Americas to 66% of sales from 70% and its dependence on accessories\u2014mainly handbags and small leather goods\u2014likewise to 66% from 70%, according to the company.\u201cThis gives us diversification both from a product standpoint and from a geographic standpoint,\u201d said Mr. Idol. \u201cWe love America but we think there is a great opportunity for luxury growth in Europe and Asia.\u201dJimmy Choo, whose image was burnished by fans like Princess Diana and appearances in hit TV show \u201cSex and the City,\u201d commands high prices for its shoes, selling pumps and boots for as much as $4,250 a pair. The brand has performed strongly in markets such as the U.K., China and Japan but in the U.S., like Michael Kors, it has grappled with discounting.Upscale women\u2019s shoes remain Jimmy Choo\u2019s core business, but it has been branching out into men\u2019s shoes in search of growth. Last year it reported a 15% rise in sales to \u00a3364 million ($475 million) and a 43% rise in operating profit to \u00a342.5 million ($55.5 million). The company has about 150 directly operated stores, leaving what analysts have described as a long runway for brick-and-mortar expansion.Mr. Idol said he sees an opportunity to increase Jimmy Choo sales to $1 billion by opening new retail stores for the shoemaker and developing its online presence. Michael Kors also plans to expand Jimmy Choo\u2019s offerings beyond shoes.The company won\u2019t sell Jimmy Choo products through its own network of 614 full-price stores, leaving the shoe brand to operate as an independent entity. Jimmy Choo will continue to be run by current Chief Executive       Pierre Denis,        a former LVMH executive who has led the shoe company since 2012.\u2014Suzanne Kapner in New York contributed to this article.Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-kors-to-buy-jimmy-choo-for-1-17-billion-in-all-cash-deal-1500965373", "keywords": [" acquistion,competition, footwear,jimmy choo, luxury fashion,luxury handbags , luxury shoe maker, michael kors,pe exits,shares,Jimmy Choo,CHOO.LN,UK:CHOO,Michael Kors Holdings,KORS,JAB Holding,John Idol,financial performance,earnings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,leather goods,footwear,clothing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,textiles,consumer goods,designer clothing,luxury goods,luxury leather goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:38:00", "news_title": "Suspect Arrested in Brooklyn Attacks", "content": "Police arrested a Bronx man for allegedly following women into their Brooklyn homes and assaulting them on four different occasions this month.Police said Tuesday that Dennis Ofuoma, 19 years old, engaged in \u201cpush-in\u201d attacks during a two-day span in the Crown Heights neighborhood.Mr. Ofuoma was arrested on Monday afternoon.A spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0Mr. Ofuoma hadn\u2019t yet been arraigned. It wasn\u2019t clear if he had an attorney.Police used tips, witness accounts and statements from victims in the investigation, which is still ongoing, officials said. Police also found a clue at the crime scene of the fourth and most recent sexual assault in an apartment building at Pacific Street and Nostrand Avenue.A 32-year-old woman was exiting from an elevator at\u00a03:30 a.m.\u00a0on July 13, when the suspect \u201capproached her from behind, placed a hand over her mouth and attempted to sexually assault her,\u201d police officials said.The woman pushed the suspect back and he fled.Police found a gold skull-shaped ring at the scene, which the woman said fell off the suspect during the assault. The ring was sent to a police laboratory for DNA testing.The first incident happened on July 12 at 11:45 p.m. Police said Mr. Ofuoma followed a 22-year-old woman inside of her building on Pacific Street and Nostrand Avenue, placed his hand over her mouth and pressed her against the hallway wall.Mr. Ofuoma allegedly touched the woman\u2019s genitals and told her \u201che wanted sex,\u201d officials said.The woman screamed and fought back against the suspect, officials said. He then fled the scene.At\u00a01 a.m.\u00a0on July 13, the suspect followed a 29-year-old woman to her apartment on St. Marks Avenue and New York Avenue, police said. He then pushed her inside when she opened the door, placed one hand over her mouth and his other arm around her body. The woman also fought the suspect before he ran outside.Less than a mile away at Sterling Place and Albany Avenue, the suspect followed another 22-year-old woman inside her apartment at\u00a02:30 a.m., police said.\u00a0When she unlocked her door, the suspect pushed her to the ground and said he had a knife, police said\u201cI will kill you,\u201d Mr. Ofuoma told the woman, according to officials.The woman fought back, kicking and spraying mace on the suspect causing him to run away.The city has experienced an uptick in sex crimes in recent years. Last year the city recorded 1,336 felony sex crimes, a 24% increase from the 1,073 in 2013.Mr. Ofuoma is charged with four counts of burglary, two counts of sex abuse and harassment.Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspect-arrested-in-brooklyn-attacks-1501007882", "keywords": [" arrested,crown heights, push-ins,assault,political,general news,crime,legal action,sex crimes"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:31:00", "news_title": "Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down D.C.\u2019s Concealed-Carry Ban ", "content": "A federal appeals court struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s restrictions on carrying concealed guns, ruling that the right to bear arms outside the home is at the core of the Second Amendment\u2019s protections.The 2-1 ruling on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recognized that \u201cthe rights to keep and bear arms are on equal footing\u201d and said the D.C. law violated the Second Amendment by prohibiting most residents from carrying weapons in public.The 2014 law required anyone seeking a license to carry a concealed gun to show \u201cgood reason to fear injury,\u201d such as serious threats of death or serious bodily harm. Living in a high-crime neighborhood wasn\u2019t reason enough, according to rules put out by D.C.\u2019s chief of police.\u201cBans on the ability of most citizens to exercise an enumerated right would have to flunk any judicial test that was appropriately written and applied, so we strike the District\u2019s law here,\u201d wrote Judge       Thomas Griffith,        an appointee of President       George W. Bush,        for the majority.The decision breaks with at least four other federal appeals courts that upheld similar restrictions in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California, though those courts offered varying views of the Second Amendment\u2019s strength in public.At least one other appeals court has recognized a constitutional right to carry a gun outside the home, striking down an Illinois ban in 2012.Most state restrictions on bearing weapons outside the home are looser than D.C.\u2019s and allow residents to carry concealed guns without having to justify it. About a dozen states require no permits at all.The Supreme Court has yet to review a concealed-carry case since its landmark 2008 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which recognized an individual\u2019s right to possess a gun for self-defense inside the home. The split that emerged with Tuesday\u2019s ruling could tempt the justices to take up the case if the D.C. government appeals.The D.C. Circuit panel that delivered Tuesday\u2019s ruling also included Judge       Karen Henderson,        an appointee of President       George H.W. Bush,        and Senior Judge       Stephen Williams,        a Reagan appointee.Judge Henderson, writing in dissent, said the majority played down the Supreme Court\u2019s characterizations of the Second Amendment right as strongest in the home, as stated in its Heller decision.\u201cA right that is less notable and less acute cannot reside at the Second Amendment\u2019s core,\u201d she wrote, referring to carrying outside the home.Karl Racine, D.C.\u2019s attorney general, said he was considering asking the D.C. Circuit to rehear the case with more judges.\u201cThe District of Columbia\u2019s \u2018good reason\u2019 requirement for concealed-carry permits is a common-sense gun regulation,\u201d Mr. Racine said in an emailed statement.Charles Cooper,        who represents one of the groups that challenged the D.C. law, said Tuesday\u2019s ruling deepened a split among federal appeals courts \u201cand it makes it even more inevitable that the Supreme Court will have to take this issue up.\u201dMr. Cooper\u2019s client, the Pink Pistols, an organization that advocates for concealed firearms for the self-defense of the LGBTQ community, filed a lawsuit in December 2015 and won an early victory when a judge temporarily blocked the D.C. law last year. The D.C. attorney general\u2019s office appealed the ruling.The Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group based on the West Coast, lodged a separate challenge that was consolidated with the Pink Pistols case. A federal trial judge ruled against the foundation last year, prompting the appeal to the D.C. Circuit.Lawyers in the D.C. attorney general\u2019s office had argued that limits on carrying concealed weapons traced to the Middle Ages, and that at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification, in 1791, more than half the original states restricted firearms in fairs, markets and other populated places.The laws were patterned after the Statute of Northampton, an English law enacted in 1328 that said \u201cno man\u201d could \u201cgo nor ride armed by night nor by day, in Fairs, Markets, nor in the presence of the Justices or other Ministers, nor in no part elsewhere.\u201dThat point wasn\u2019t convincing to Judge Griffith. \u201cHappily, though, the state of the law in Chaucer\u2019s England\u2014or for that matter Shakespeare\u2019s or Cromwell\u2019s\u2014is not decisive here,\u201d he wrote.Judge Griffith said historical restrictions on carrying guns weren\u2019t complete bans. By the time of the founding, the right to bear arms was thought to protect carrying for self-defense generally, he wrote.The government \u201cmust leave ample channels for keeping and for carrying,\u201d he said, adding that a ban on carrying concealed guns could be permissible if the district allowed residents to carry guns openly, or vice versa.Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-d-c-s-concealed-carry-ban-1501007476", "keywords": ["concealed-carry laws, d.c. federal circuit court of appeals, second amendment,Thomas Griffith,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,firearms,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:31:00", "news_title": "Canada\u2019s Trudeau: \u2018Essential\u2019 Revised Nafta Contain Dispute-Resolution Panel ", "content": "OTTAWA\u2014Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday it was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d that a revised North American Free Trade Agreement contain a dispute-resolution panel, setting the stage for a showdown between Ottawa and the Trump administration ahead of trilateral talks next month.Trade analysts and U.S.-Canada watchers have identified the Nafta provision known as Chapter 19\u2014which makes it easier for Canada and Mexico to contest trade sanctions from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2014as crucial to Canada. Without it, attempts to challenge Commerce Department sanctions would have to be argued before U.S. courts, which Canadians see as less friendly to their interests.But the Trump administration wants that system scrapped, as outlined in its objectives for the Nafta talks released last week.The dispute-settlement system was a point of contention between Canada and the U.S. in the 1980s when they eventually clinched a U.S.-Canada free-trade deal, a Nafta predecessor. Mr. Trudeau said Tuesday keeping the system intact was a top priority.\u201cA fair dispute-resolution system is absolutely essential for Canada,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a joint press conference with the new premier of British Columbia, John Horgan. \u201cWe expect that will continue to be the case in any renegotiated Nafta\u2014that we will continue to have a fair dispute-resolution system.\u201dTrade watchers say Mr. Trudeau\u2019s comments are the most pointed yet on the issue.\u201cThis is the hill Canada is prepared to die on,\u201d said Eric Miller, a former Canadian official and now head of Rideau Potomac Strategy Group, a Washington-based trade consulting firm. \u201cThis is a strong signal that Canada takes Chapter 19 very seriously and is willing to work very hard to keep it.\u201dUnder Nafta, Chapter 19 provides a mechanism for exporters and importers subject to anti-dumping or countervailing duties by authorities in the U.S., Canada or Mexico to seek review from a binational panel. The panels are made up of trade experts from the two countries involved in the dispute, and have a mandate to determine whether trade sanctions have legal justification.In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mexico\u2019s Economy Minister       Ildefonso Guajardo       warned scrapping Chapter 19 could prove to be an obstacle during trilateral talks, and affect U.S., Canadian and Mexican exporters alike. \u201cWe need to take care to preserve something that has been positive,\u201d he added.In addition to the repeal of the so-called Chapter 19 clause, the U.S. Trade Representative said the U.S. will be looking in the Nafta talks to preserve \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions and find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with its Nafta partners. Overall, though, the Nafta objectives the U.S. laid out last week largely step back from some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most fiery campaign rhetoric on trade with Mexico and Canada.Daniel Ujczo, a Columbus, Ohio-based trade lawyer at Dickinson Wright, said the Trump administration heard from some influential constituencies\u2014 most notably the U.S. lumber industry\u2014that called for scrapping the dispute-settlement scheme. Mr. Ujczo said the U.S. Trade Representative has recommended the establishment of a new system to resolve trade disputes among Nafta trade partners.\u201cThe parties should take that opportunity,\u201d he said in a recent note to clients.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Canada Presses for Nafta Panel.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-trudeau-essential-revised-nafta-contain-dispute-resolution-panel-1501000006", "keywords": [" canada, ch 19, chapter 19, nafta,north american free trade agreement, trade, trade sanctions, ustr,North American Free Trade Agreement,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,fair trade,political,general news,international relations,politics,tariffs,trade barriers"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:29:00", "news_title": "Trump Is Optimistic Senate Will Vote to Begin Debate on Bill to Repeal Obamacare", "content": "President       Donald Trump       said Tuesday he was optimistic that the Senate would vote to begin debate on legislation that would do away with the health-care law enacted by his predecessor, a central promise of his campaign.Mr. Trump,        in a 45-minute interview with The Wall Street Journal, said he has been working to secure the 50 votes needed to pass the measure, which he described as a difficult but crucial step toward ultimately putting in place a health-care system that would replace former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       Affordable Care Act.\u201cI think we\u2019re doing pretty well on health care,\u201d the president said in the Oval Office interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dThe Senate vote was planned for mid-afternoon, with Sen.

But once you get that motion, it\u2019s in pretty good shape.\u201dIn recent weeks Mr. Trump has suggested different approaches toward a health-care issue that has bedeviled the Republican-controlled House and Senate. At times he has called for letting the Affordable Care Act collapse before ushering in a replacement. At other times he has said the best strategy would be repealing the 2010 health-care law and quickly approving a new system.GOP leaders have primarily pursued a strategy of repealing and replacing the health law simultaneously.In the interview, Mr. Trump said he prefers that option.\u201cThe problem with [straight] repeal is you\u2019ll have millions of people out there\u2014you\u2019ll have people out there who will say, \u2018How do we know we\u2019re going to have health care?\u2019 And I hate to do that to people.

And we have a very good plan.\u201dIn Mr. Trump\u2019s six months as president, Republican lawmakers have struggled to forge a consensus on a substitute for the ACA. Democrats have been united in their opposition.Mr. Trump said that it\u2019s difficult to appease different factions and overcome the ideological gap between Republican centrists and conservatives.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult situation,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you move a little to the left, and you lose four guys. You move a little bit to the right, and all of a sudden you have a bloc of people who are gone. You have a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley.\u201dAttending the interview were Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming communications director,       Anthony Scaramucci,        White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, National Economic Council Director       Gary Cohn       and Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks.At one point Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, came into the room.\u201cThanks, honey,\u201d Mr. Trump said.

Commuter Train Crash ", "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the driver of the sport-utility vehicle that was hit by a Metro-North train in Valhalla, N.Y., in February 2015 was responsible for the accident.Investigators found the driver was warned of the incoming train by its horn and shouldn\u2019t have moved her vehicle into its path.The crash resulted in six deaths, including the SUV\u2019s driver,       Ellen Brody       of Scarsdale, N.Y., and 10 injuries. During a hearing Tuesday morning, NTSB investigators determined that Ms. Brody should have been able to hear the train\u2019s horn, which sounded four times, and view warning signs before the accident.According to investigators, Ms. Brody was on her way to meet a potential business client in Scarsdale when she entered the grade crossing at Commerce Street in Valhalla. After entering the boundary of the crossing, the warning system activated and the gate arm struck the back of Ms. Brody\u2019s SUV. She got out of her car, examined the crossing gate, then moved forward into the train\u2019s path. According to the NTSB\u2019s findings, the collision occurred 39 seconds after the warning became active. During questioning by NTSB board members, the investigating team said they believe the incident would have been a more minor collision had the car not moved at all.Kenny Brag,        an investigator of the accident, said a \u201cconsiderable amount of research\u201d was done to determine the driver\u2019s conditions and reasons to move the car forward, but said his team couldn\u2019t arrive at a definite conclusion for why Ms. Brody got out of the car. By getting out of the car, she lost necessary time to move the vehicle out of the train\u2019s way.\u201cThere are numerous possibilities which may have contributed to why she got out of the car, why she did not realize the train was approaching and a lot of these things, we were not able to determine,\u201d Mr. Brag said.Investigators found no evidence of alcohol or drug use by the driver. She wasn\u2019t on her phone at the time of the accident.The investigation also found that one of the two traffic signal pre-emptions on the crossing didn\u2019t comply with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices issued by the Federal Highway Administration. The second did function properly. Because of this, the investigator said the New York Department of Transportation is currently examining all the state\u2019s grade crossings with pre-emption. An investigator said the grade crossing warning system on the crossing was functioning as designed when the accident happened, adding that the warning system didn\u2019t contribute to the accident.A Metro-North spokesman said the MTA is eliminating grade crossings in connection with new rail projects and is also working with localities to eliminate these crossings wherever possible.As result of the investigation, the NTSB made six recommendations to different transportation agencies, including the Federal Transit Administration and the Metro-North Railroad, and the town of Mount Pleasant. Recommendations included the enforcement of risk-assessment tests for crossing areas and the implementation of necessary adjustments found through these risk assessments.The accident prompted Mount Pleasant to consider shutting down the train crossing, and another one close to it. Ms. Brody\u2019s family also filed a lawsuit in 2016 against the Metropolitan Transportation Association and other agencies, contending that the crossing didn\u2019t have enough signage or warning lights to prevent the accident.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ntsb-finds-driver-at-fault-in-deadly-n-y-commuter-train-crash-1501006921", "keywords": ["car accident,metro-north train, n.y.,ntsb,scarsdale,suv,valhalla,The National Transportation Safety Board,Ellen Brody,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:18:00", "news_title": "UTC Warns Jet Makers That Poaching Service Business Will Mean Higher Prices", "content": "United Technologies Corp.\u2019s        UTX -0.73%       boss warned Tuesday that the company may need to raise prices for its jet engines and aerospace parts, if airplane makers try to steal some of its lucrative maintenance business.Jet engine makers, like United Technologies\u2019 Pratt & Whitney division,             General Electric Co.       and             Rolls-Royce Holdings        RYCEY -0.33%       PLC, typically sell the huge machines with little or no profit but then make up the money by selling decades of servicing and parts.But             Boeing Co.        BA 9.88%       and Airbus SE have been nudging their way into that aftermarket business to capture some of that profit\u2014a strategy that puts them on a collision course with suppliers.United Technologies is particularly exposed because aside from Pratt & Whitney it runs a large aerospace division, which makes parts such as wheels and landing gear. Those units accounted for more than half of its $15.28 billion in second-quarter revenue.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to change that model, where the [plane makers] are going to take more of the aftermarket or demand more of the aftermarket, we\u2019re going to have to think about how we price our products,\u201d United Technologies CEO       Greg Hayes       said on a conference call.The Farmington, Conn., company spent $10 billion developing its latest engine, called the geared turbofan, and the launch will continue to hurt profits at the Pratt & Whitney division before it starts making money on the installed engines. \u201cIf all of a sudden I lose that aftermarket, I don\u2019t have a business going forward,\u201d he said.United Technologies shares dropped 2% midday Tuesday.Other jet engine makers have taken notice of the shift by Boeing and Airbus. \u201cThey can try to squeeze the engine companies out of the aftermarket, but if they do so at some point the engine companies won\u2019t invest the same level in all of the new technology we are doing,\u201d       Eric Schulz,        president of civil aerospace for Rolls-Royce, said last month.GE Aviation spokesman Rick Kennedy said the company isn\u2019t concerned about Boeing\u2019s move into aircraft services. There is already a \u201csignificant number of viable competitors in the engines aftermarket,\u201d he said, and GE doesn\u2019t expect a big impact from plane makers entering the fray.Boeing launched a new services unit this month as part of a push to cut costs and boost margins, part of its effort to more than double its service revenue to $50 billion in five years. Boeing, which reports second-quarter results Wednesday, isn\u2019t just stirring up its suppliers but has also said it may want to service planes made by rivals like Airbus.Mr. Hayes, who called the tension around the aftermarket \u201cone of the fundamental strategic issues\u201d in the future of the aerospace industry, said his company, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning systems, may have to decide to allocate investment to areas where it has an advantage. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure out there,\u201d he said.In reporting second-quarter results Tuesday, United Technologies\u2019 aerospace division was only business with a drop in sales. It cited slowness in business from companies like Boeing as well as sluggishness in the business jet and civil helicopter market.Over all, second-quarter net income rose 4% to $1.44 billion, or $1.80 a share, while revenue increased 3% from a year ago. The conglomerate raised the lower end of its full-year earnings estimate and now projects annual sales of at least $58.5 billion, up from a prior forecast of at least $57.5 billion.Chief Financial Officer       Akhil Johri       said the change came from the first-half performance rather than any shift in second-half views. \u201cUnlike in prior years, EPS in the second half will be lower than the strong first half,\u201d he said.\u2014Doug Cameron and Robert Wall contributed to this article.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/utc-warns-jet-makers-that-poaching-service-business-will-mean-higher-prices-1501006721", "keywords": ["pratt & whitney ,united technologies,United Technologies,UTX,Boeing,BA,Rolls-Royce Holdings,RR.LN,Greg Hayes,financial performance,earnings,earnings projections,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,machinery,turbines,aerospace products,parts,aircraft engines,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 14:02:00", "news_title": "Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe Stumbles on Response to Cronyism Allegations ", "content": "TOKYO\u2014Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       stumbled in an attempt to pull out of a career-threatening slump in popularity, reversing part of his response to allegations of cronyism and apologizing for what he called a mistake.Mr. Abe is fighting for his political future after support for his cabinet fell below 30% in some opinion polls. A former vice education minister alleged the prime minister\u2019s staff intervened last year to clear an application by a longtime friend of Mr. Abe to open a veterinary school.Mr. Abe says his staff followed proper procedures, and he denies any involvement in the approval for the school. No new veterinary schools have opened in more than 50 years in Japan, reflecting opposition from the Veterinary Medical Association, which says the nation has a sufficient supply of veterinarians.The furor over the allegations of cronyism has dominated Japanese news coverage for weeks. And support for Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet is at its lowest level since he took office in December 2012, with many poll respondents saying they don\u2019t trust him, and the ruling party suffering a heavy defeat in a regional election in Tokyo this month. Mr. Abe has said he will shuffle his cabinet next week, which could give him a chance to replace controversial ministers.Few previous prime ministers have been able to recover from approval ratings below 30%, spurring speculation over Mr. Abe\u2019s policy objectives, including revising the nation\u2019s pacifist constitution.This year, Mr. Abe appeared to be on course to comfortably win a third term as party leader in an election next year. Now, analysts say he could face a strong challenge from within his party, though most ruling-party lawmakers have so far avoided criticizing Mr. Abe, in part because there aren\u2019t any obvious candidates to succeed him.The government, under pressure to provide answers, agreed to reopen parliamentary committees to allow for debate for two days. On Tuesday, Mr. Abe repeated his defense in response to questions from lawmakers at the parliamentary committee hearing. He and other officials said new veterinary schools could help Japan deal with livestock-related risks such as bird flu.But he ran into a trouble when the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party accused the prime minister of contradicting himself over when he first learned of the school application.On Monday, Mr. Abe said he found out about it on Jan. 20, when it was approved. In June, he had told Parliament that he knew about the application earlier, when the city where the school is to be located had filed papers with the government.Mr. Abe said his June explanation had been mistaken. \u201cIt was a sudden question and I had not sorted it out sufficiently,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cI must apologize for my confusion.\u201dOpposition lawmakers jeered and questioned whether Mr. Abe could have been unaware of the application until Jan. 20.Mr. Abe has known the head of the proposed veterinary school since they studied together in the U.S. in the 1970s, and the two men still play golf and socialize together.Besides the veterinary-school issue, scandals or misstatements by cabinet ministers have hurt the Abe government. The controversy also threatens to weaken Mr. Abe\u2019s ability to seal a version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement with 10 other nations. He has said he intends to champion free trade globally after the U.S. under President       Donald Trump       withdrew from the TPP.Tomoaki Iwai,        an expert on politics at the Nihon University College of Law in Tokyo, said it will likely be hard for Mr. Abe to fully recover.\u201cFirst, he must first keep a humble, low profile and govern honestly and steadily. Second, he should focus on the economy,\u201d Mr. Iwai said.It will be difficult for Mr. Abe to move forward on controversial projects like revising the constitution, Mr. Iwai said, but he added that he didn\u2019t expect Mr. Abe to resign.\u2014Koji Everard contributed to this article.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-shinzo-abe-stumbles-on-response-to-cronyism-allegations-1500980132", "keywords": [" abe, cronyism, japan, japan pm, prime minister,shinzo abe, veterinary school,Shinzo Abe,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 13:46:00", "news_title": "Why Kyrie Irving\u2019s Trade Request Was the NBA\u2019s Surprising Twist  ", "content": "The entirety of the NBA universe being in the same place at the same time doesn\u2019t usually result in discussions of astrophysics. But that\u2019s what happened at last season\u2019s All-Star Game. Kyrie Irving said he believes the earth is flat, and the basketball world turned upside down.ESPN\u2019s report last week that Irving wants a breakup with Cleveland was more or less the same thing. Irving requesting a trade from the Cavaliers was another bombshell that once again shook the NBA because it questioned everything that was thought to be true.That\u2019s what has been overlooked in the conversation about the surprising twist of this NBA off-season and the speculation about where Irving might land if he escapes Cleveland. It\u2019s the exact opposite of what the league has come to expect in recent years: Irving is a star player who is angling to be on a team where he is less likely to win.The league\u2019s other star players are looking for ways to play together because that makes them more likely to win. It seems impossible, in fact, to win any other way. And the more players unite, the more others are incentivized to unite. The only way to beat a superteam is to start another one.Irving was already on a superteam. The Cavaliers have played in three straight NBA Finals and, for all their internal dysfunction, were still favored to make a fourth consecutive appearance next year. There are few teams more super.They\u2019re not as good as the Golden State Warriors, but that didn\u2019t stop them from winning the 2016 championship. The Warriors are undeniably better, especially as they\u2019ve gotten even better this summer, but there was a reason that fans in Oracle Arena were quietly terrified before Game 5 of the Finals. They feared the Cavs as the only team that could have upset the Warriors. They\u2019d already seen it happen.Irving has reaped the benefits of his relationship with James. He averaged more shots per game than him last year, the first time that James didn\u2019t lead his team in field-goal attempts, and the ball was in Irving\u2019s hands more last season than in his last season alone. James even deferred to Irving before he made the single most important shot in NBA history. Irving seemed to understand he was in an enviable position. As recently as last month, he soliloquized about what it meant to play alongside his sport\u2019s most dominant player.\u201cThat\u2019s the type of guy that I want to be with every single time I\u2019m going to war,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that if we continue to be with one another and keep utilizing one another, man, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201dThe sky will be shorter wherever he goes. That\u2019s what makes Irving\u2019s trade request so unusual. He\u2019s trying to get out of the position that, now more than ever, NBA players are scheming to get in.Gordon Hayward signed with the Boston Celtics because they were the best team chasing him. Chris Paul guided himself to the Houston Rockets for a similar reason. He felt that playing with James Harden was his shot to win big. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason in playing unless you\u2019re playing to win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think Ricky Bobby said it best: If you\u2019re not first, you\u2019re last.\u201dKevin Durant didn\u2019t quote the tao of \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d when he dumped the Oklahoma City Thunder last summer, but Ricky Bobby\u2019s wisdom applies to his situation, too. What he did wasn\u2019t shameful. It was strategic. By signing with the Warriors, he was simply choosing to play for a better team.James himself did the same thing\u2014twice. That\u2019s how he ended up on the same team as Irving.It was the impulse that drove James to Miami that eventually dragged him back to Cleveland. His choice to return may have been \u201cbigger than basketball,\u201d as he said, but the basketball itself was compelling. That was the savviest part of his decision. Enough had changed between 2010 and 2014 that Cleveland, not Miami, was suddenly the team that maximized his chances to win another championship.Why? Because his sidekick could be Kyrie Irving.But that\u2019s the power of NBA free agency. Teams can add stars without subtracting other stars. James and Durant chose their destinations based on which teams offered the brightest futures. Irving has no such leverage. The Cavaliers don\u2019t even have to trade him\u2014and they may not.None other than Kobe Bryant, Irving\u2019s role model, demanded a trade from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007. It never materialized, and he won two more titles with the Lakers. It\u2019s unlikely that would have happened anywhere else. He would\u2019ve cost too much.Irving, meanwhile, is a 25-year-old virtuosic talent entering under contract for two more years as he enters the prime of his career. He may be the most valuable asset in the league. There are few teams, if any, that could surround Irving with the players necessary to win. Those are the players it\u2019ll take to get him.That\u2019s why Irving\u2019s request to play elsewhere was so unexpected. Exactly why he wants out is unclear, and ESPN analyst Chauncey Billups told a Denver radio station that he was surprised to hear about Irving\u2019s discontent when he interviewed for the Cavs\u2019 president job last month.\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that doesn\u2019t make sense. All I cared about was winning.\u201dThere is one team that gives him a good chance to win a championship in the immediate future. It\u2019s the team he\u2019s already on.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-kyrie-irvings-trade-request-was-the-nbas-surprising-twist-1501004778", "keywords": ["basketball,cavs,cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,kyrie,kyrie irving,lebron james,nba,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 13:44:00", "news_title": "EPA Moves to Expedite Superfund Cleanup Projects ", "content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       administration is moving ahead with a plan to accelerate the rehabilitation of Superfund sites, polluted locations designated by the government for long-term cleanup projects.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator       Scott Pruitt      \u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0signed off on recommendations from a task force that will accelerate cleanup efforts to reduce the more than 1,300 Superfund sites on the agency\u2019s priorities list amid dwindling budgets.Mr. Trump has proposed cutting another $330 million from the program annually, but Mr. Pruitt doesn\u2019t see that as an impediment to cleaning up the contaminated areas and making them ready for business investment.\u201cThis is something that is core to this agency,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cThe statute puts it upon this agency to get accountability from those companies [responsible for the pollutants at the sites]. Our job is to get sites remediated. Let\u2019s set some goals, let\u2019s set some objectives and get some of these sites off the list.\u201dAmong the strategies the EPA plans to implement: targeting specific sites that are \u201cnot showing sufficient progress,\u201d clarifying and streamlining agency policies and guidance to expedite remediation and encouraging private investment in the cleanup process and reuse of contaminated facilities.When Mr. Pruitt convened the Superfund task force in May, some environmental groups expressed concern with the former Oklahoma Attorney-General\u2019s close contact with the oil-and-gas industry and his early efforts to unwind several of President       Barack Obama\u2019s       environmental protections. The groups also worried that speeding up the process may lead to inadequate cleanup efforts.But Mr. Pruitt believes the new plan will help to determine the best method for cleaning a site, as well as the total cost. This will help the EPA in its efforts to hold the responsible parties accountable.\u201cThose companies need to be held responsible,\u201d he said.\u201cOne of the most fundamental and important things for us to do is just decide,\u201d Mr. Pruitt continued, noting that sites have been \u201clanguishing\u201d for years without a decision about how to remediate sites. \u201cAnd I think there has been hesitancy, or a reluctance, to do that.\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a list that you never get off of,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate each of these on a case-by-case basis and move them towards remediation.\u201dThe Superfund program was created in 1980. Some sites have been on the list for more than a decade.The agency also plans to formulate a \u201ctop 10\u201d list of sites deserving the most attention, an effort to focus public attention on specific sites.

My favorite by far was a cameo of the Virgin Mary sitting above the doorway of the Diocesan Museum. Hoisting a big bat in her manly fist, more holy avenger than stoic saint, she was nonchalantly clubbing the bug-eyed devil slithering at her feet.This particular Mary also functions ably as a metaphor for Minorca (Spanish for \u201cminor island\u201d), which has largely managed to protect its honor by batting away the big developers and supersize projects overrunning its fellow Balearic islands. Mega resorts crowd Mallorca. And Ibiza, the home of thumping all-night clubs and all-day hangovers, looks nothing like the quiet outlier it was 50 years ago. But as far as tourist destinations go, Minorca has remained so relatively untouched that it still lives down to its recessive name. As word gets out that this slumbering isle is the next big Mediterranean thing, however, its future doesn\u2019t look so minor.I discovered Minorca\u2019s paradox\u2014idyllic but relatively unfrequented\u2014on a recent visit. Flying into Mah\u00f3n airport, I picked up a rental car and set out on a route that would bisect the island, taking me 28 miles from the capital of Mah\u00f3n on the east coast to Ciutadella on the west. Minorca\u2019s coves, pocking its 120 miles of coastline, offer some of the finest sand beaches in the Mediterranean. So where were the crowds? After a few big-box hotels popped up on the island in the \u201970s, and its Balearic neighbors started to look manically overbuilt, the Minorcans opted for a more thoughtful kind of development. The result: an island that\u2019s the poster child for very slow travel.My first stop, Torralbenc Hotel, which opened in 2013, seems to embody this more delicate approach to tourism. Instead of another Brutalist resort, this renovated 19th-century farmstead is a sprawl of whitewashed buildings and red-tile roofs, surrounded by vineyards and olive trees. My room was all bucolic restraint, from its limestone floors to its exposed beamed ceiling, and the hotel\u2019s restaurant featured a strictly locavore menu. \u201cI work almost entirely with what Minorca has to offer,\u201d said chef Luis Loza proudly, serving me shavings of Iberian ham in a dining room crowned by a high cane ceiling. Local red prawns, langoustines, olives, figs and plums also frequent his menu.The tourist attractions at Torralbenc skew organic too. You can horseback ride through the olive groves, or head down to the beach. On my first day on the island, I chose instead to explore neighboring Mah\u00f3n, the tiny capital (population: 28,000). Still very much a working market town, Mah\u00f3n felt drowsy. Boys were kicking soccer balls in the plazas, matrons were drinking the local gin in outdoor cafes, and the shops were stocked with regional crafts. The classic souvenir to take home: the espadrilles that jam the dollhouse-sized Boba\u2019s shop, in the city\u2019s center.\u201cThe heritage of shoemaking is a Minorcan tradition,\u201d owner and espadrille designer Lloren\u00e7 Pons told me as I tried on some of his work. \u201cI try to combine that heritage with my own designs.\u201d Dangling from the atelier\u2019s walls were every imaginable, and some unimaginable, iteration of espadrille: leopard skin, polka dot, ikat, graffiti, chintz and a rubber-soled, high-top sneaker version that probably qualifies as the butchest espadrille ever made. I opted for restraint, purchasing a pair of green-tartan creations that seemed subtle by local standards. The one time I wore them back home, they looked about as understated as clown shoes, but they went unnoticed on the island as I worked my way through Mah\u00f3n\u2019s produce market, which is tucked into the cloisters of La Verge del Carme church. I scanned the pyramids of Minorcan cheese, lemons, artichokes, eggplants and melons, under the stone arches, and settled on a basket of strawberries. Then I headed off in my rental car, driving west out of town into Minorca\u2019s interior.Within minutes Mah\u00f3n gave way to the back country, where dry stone walls were looping, like a craggy necklace, through pastures as green as those in the Cotswolds. Olive groves popped up frequently, and sometimes I glimpsed the glint of the ocean along Minorca\u2019s sandy coast. What turns Minorca into something more enigmatic than other beach destinations are its cultural heirlooms. Cyclopean stone burial chambers dating as far back as 1400 B.C. and still lined with skulls, survey the island\u2019s meadows. But it\u2019s the island\u2019s taulas, tall stone structures shaped like giant Ts, jutting up everywhere, that remain a riddle. My guide, Luis Ameller, a local historian, led me down a rocky path to the taula that anchors the Torretrencada site, a prehistoric settlement 26 miles northwest from Mah\u00f3n. We walked through a field of purple thistle, as the original Minorcans might have, and suddenly the soaring standing stones, topped by a thick slab, soared up with a kind of primal jolt. \u201cThere are lots of theories regarding the taulas,\u201d Luis told me. \u201cThe current theory is that they represent some version of divinity, maybe the bull god or a phallic fertility symbol. What\u2019s clear is that they were a kind of religious altar.\u201d As we left, I realized the pottery shards, crunching under our feet were splinters of ancient votive offerings.The taula was the last stop along my route to Ciutadella. If Mah\u00f3n is a ruddy, forthcoming city, Ciutadella is more patrician and self-sufficient. A Baroque port, the town feels slightly haunted, like a place that\u2019s hugging its own sad secrets. Sacked by the Ottomans in 1558, it was left largely abandoned; most of its surviving 3,000 inhabitants were hauled off and sold in the slave markets of Constantinople. Today, its narrow, winding streets still look deserted at dusk. Carriage lanterns light the golden stone manor houses, and if you look up you see the raucous world of cherubs, saints and apostles carved into the austere facades.The Palau Salort house museum allows a peek inside one of the mansions but a better view was offered by the Hotel Can Faustino, a refurbished 16th-century palace where I stayed the night. \u201cWhen I started restoring the place it was still a private house in a state of decay,\u201d owner Laurent Morel-Ruymen told me, giving me a tour of the library and guest rooms, all minimally designed, showcasing the mansion\u2019s own baroque, vaulting bones. Sitting just below Can Faustino\u2019s terrace was Ciutadella\u2019s wide curve of a harbor, where I had dinner, alternating between two dueling seafood restaurants. At Caf\u00e9 Balear I sampled the island\u2019s signature lobster rice stew, a creamier take on paella; at S\u2019Amarador I tackled coins of octopus dusted with paprika.Mr. Morel-Ruymen, who\u2019s originally from Paris, was waiting for me back at Can Faustino, relaxing on the terrace with a nightcap. \u201cI wanted to bring the palace back to its original beauty,\u201d the hotelier said. \u201cWhen I sailed into the port here a long time ago, it was still unique and still preserved.\u201d Sitting under the golden stones of his revived palace, staring down at the ancient harbor, he could make the same claim today.Getting There: Flights from major European cities connect to the island\u2019s Mah\u00f3n Airport.Staying There: Rising above Ciutadella\u2019s harbor, Hotel Can Faustino offers 25 rooms in a renovated 16th-century palace (from $160; San Rafael 9, canfaustino.com). If you want more of a bucolic retreat, book the 27-room Hotel Torralbenc, which sits outside Mah\u00f3n overlooking the sea (from $220, torralbenc.com).Eating There: Other than the fine restaurants at Can Faustino and Torralbenc hotels, sample the daily catch at Caf\u00e9 Balear in Ciutadella (Pla de Sant Joan 15, cafebalear.com) and the neighboring S\u2019Amarador (Port de Ciutadella, samarador.com).

Criminals, using names and Social Security numbers typically obtained outside the tax system, would file fake tax returns and get refunds on debit cards before the real taxpayer ever knew what happened.Mr. Koskinen credited the partnership between the IRS, private-sector tax preparers and state tax officials to make taxpayers and tax preparers more aware of data security.Nina Olson, the independent taxpayer advocate inside the IRS, reported similar data last month.She wrote that she couldn\u2019t be certain what was causing the decline.Ms. Olson wrote that the IRS has improved its procedures for assisting victims and computerized filters for flagging suspicious returns. It also limited how many refunds can be delivered to a single bank account.In a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Olson said the IRS systems were still flagging too many legitimate tax returns as potentially fraudulent.\u201cThose taxpayers are unduly burdened with a quirky authentication process that sometimes requires taxpayers to authenticate their identities in person,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to do better.\u201dCriminals have moved to other weak spots in the tax system.

The ambitious showing of this now-landmark work, which ended on Sunday, brought to the stage of the David H. Koch Theater\u2014the very boards where \u201cJewels\u201d had its world premiere\u2014three different ballet troupes, all of international renown.In its first outings a half-century ago, \u201cJewels\u201d didn\u2019t yet have that title and was simply shown as three successive one-act ballets. For the latest presentation\u2014which is not likely to be repeated without concentrated effort and financial planning\u2014each performance involved the participation of the Paris Opera Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet and, most aptly, the New York City Ballet, which had Balanchine\u2019s visionary direction from its inception in 1948 until his death in 1983. Despite moments that failed to find the heart of Balanchine\u2019s heart-stoppingly beautiful arrangement of music-inspired ballet dancing, these variously shared programs thrilled overall.The home team had the upper hand. Though each troupe brought its own costuming, each ballet was framed by the settings       Peter Harvey       reworked in 2004 for NYCB to indicate, respectively, a secluded forest, a deco ballroom and an open-air plateau as he aimed to build on what he understood of Balanchine\u2019s wishes. Likewise, Karinska\u2019s mostly original costumes outfitted NYCB\u2019s \u201cRubies\u201d and \u201cDiamonds,\u201d bettering the mixed efforts of       Elena Zatitseva       for the Bolshoi Ballet;       Christian Lacroix\u2019s       dusky green creations for \u201cEmeralds\u201d feel flat when recalling Karinska\u2019s long-familiar, glowing confections for NYCB.\u201cEmeralds,\u201d set to excerpts of music by       Gabriel Faur\u00e9,        and thus seemingly a fine fit for the Paris troupe, turned out to be only intermittently successful in its hands. Missing from alternate casts of dancers was the effortless shimmer that Balanchine\u2019s sometimes meditative and consistently courtly solos and duets find in the resonant music. It took the tendrilled character of       Doroth\u00e9e Gilbert\u2019s       arm embellishments and the dreamy, walking-on-moss quiet of       Mathias Heymann       as he found the depths of Balanchine\u2019s romantically tinged movements to strike the ballet\u2019s inherent tone.\u201cRubies,\u201d to       Stravinsky\u2019s       \u201cCapriccio for Piano and Orchestra,\u201d showed NYCB on fire and full of blazing freedom. Gyroscopically centered       Megan Fairchild      \u2014ably partnered by a teasingly athletic       Joaquin De Luz       alongside a leggy and classy       Teresa Reichlen       as an Amazonian soloist\u2014showed that this artful romp to playful Stravinsky could be light of attack and piquant of attitude. For its foray with this breezy, American aesthetic, the Bolshoi Ballet overdid the witty accents and underserved its academic aspects, stressing gags and giving short shrift to the choreography\u2019s throwaway, jaunty moments for spinning-top turns and bounding jumps that tell of a friendly chase.\u201cDiamonds,\u201d which takes inspiration from four of the five movements of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony No. 3 in D Major, came into being as Balanchine\u2019s tribute to the ballerina and her classical art at its most magisterial, all in concert with the most solicitous of consorts and framed by the most elegant of male and female courtiers. The capstone display reveals the grandeur of Balanchine\u2019s vision, with moves and groupings that cover the space like a diamond necklace laid out on velvet and others that mate the central ballerina with her dancing partner in a pas de deux that feels, at recurring moments, as if its man and woman are poised on a knife-edge.Again, NYCB dancers, who regularly live and breathe this work, triumphed. Lustrous       Sara Mearns       scaled the heights and plumbed the depths of the choreography\u2019s often rococo dimensions, in which       Tyler Angle,        as her partner, embodied the adoring cavalier.None of this means, however, that the Bolshoi Ballet failed to distinguish itself in this showpiece.       Olga Smirnova,        a dancer of stirring power, had an imperial presence, missing only the finer, filigreed accents of the role\u2019s complex challenges. As her escort,       Semyon Chudin       attended her heroically and lovingly; only in his solo dancing did he show more push than poetry.Finally, for one matinee, two members of the Bolshoi\u2019s corps de ballet led this lavish showcase with\u2014especially in the case of 18-year-old       Alena Kovaleva       in the ballerina role\u2014the kind of freshness and charm that only first-blush artistry can convey. With her delicate, feline-featured face and her almost endless limbs, Ms. Kovaleva revealed prodigious strength and scale of dancing. Possessed of an expansive jump and sky-reaching extensions that she can almost, if not quite, control in reaching for the choreography\u2019s more intricate aims, this budding ballerina left her mark on \u201cDiamonds\u201d\u2014as if she were an expert gem-cutter happily honing her craft.After 50 years, the ballet that wasn\u2019t fully christened at first has endured as an artistic challenge to its dancers world-wide and as a ready chance for audiences to find untold revelations.Mr. Greskovic writes about dance for the Journal.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jewels-review-mining-thrills-from-an-artistic-challenge-1501003544", "keywords": ["arts in review, ballet, bolshoi ballet, dance,george balanchine, jewels, lincoln center festival, new york city ballet, paris opera ballet,political,general news,dance,ballet,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 13:22:00", "news_title": "Charlie Gard\u2019s Mother Seeks to Bring Son Home to Die ", "content": "LONDON\u2014The mother of       Charlie Gard       returned to court\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to seek permission to bring the terminally ill 11-month-old home to die.The hearing came the day after Charlie\u2019s parents,       Chris Gard       and       Connie Yates,        abandoned their five-month-long legal effort to take the boy abroad for experimental therapy because his muscles have been irreversibly damaged by his rare genetic disease.Grant Armstrong, the lawyer for Charlie\u2019s parents, told the U.K. High Court that the parents were desperate for \u201ca few days of tranquility with Charlie outside of a hospital setting\u201d but that Great Ormond Street Hospital, where the boy has been treated, had been putting up obstacles.Great Ormond Street argues that ventilator equipment he requires so that the family can spend his last few days with him can only be provided in a hospital. It said it has also suggested a hospice and a mediator to help the two sides come to an agreement.Katie Gollop,        the lawyer for the hospital, said Great Ormond Street has \u201cmoved heaven and earth\u201d to try to address the parents\u2019 needs and the child\u2019s interests.Judge       Nicholas Francis       said he preferred that the hospital and the parents reach a decision on their own, but that he would intervene if necessary.\u00a0The judge said he would decide on the case\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0afternoon once he heard further evidence from an expert for the parents.Charlie suffers from a mitochondrial disorder that renders him unable to move his arms or legs or breathe without assistance.His case has attracted the attention of President       Donald Trump       and       Pope Francis,        and put a spotlight on the role of British courts in making decisions for the very young.\u00a0Courts in the U.K. have the final say when parents and doctors disagree over the treatment a child should receive.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Boy\u2019s Mother Aims To Bring Him Home.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-gards-mother-seeks-to-bring-son-home-to-die-1501003326", "keywords": ["experimental therapy ,hospital,mediator,mitochondrial disorder,sick baby,terminally ill,u.k. case,Charlie Gard,Chris Gard,Connie Yates,political,general news,health,genetic disorders,medical conditions,medical treatments,procedures,health care,life sciences,hospital care,hospice care,healthcare provision"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 13:12:00", "news_title": "Viacom CEO Considers Costly Scripps Networks Acquisition ", "content": "Since taking over as Viacom Inc.\u2019s chief executive last year with the blessing of powerful shareholder Shari Redstone,       Bob Bakish       has been working to win over Wall Street with moves meant to stabilize the embattled entertainment giant.Now Mr. Bakish is contemplating what would be his boldest bet yet: an acquisition of rival media outfit Scripps Networks Interactive, operator of HGTV and Food Network. People familiar with the situation say Viacom is in talks to acquire the company, as is Discovery Communications Inc.Members of the Scripps family were expected to meet Tuesday to discuss a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter. The family members collectively control a 91.8% voting stake in the company and are expected to make a decision soon.In a sign that investors are optimistic about the odds of a deal, Scripps shares have risen by about 20% since The Wall Street Journal first reported last week that the company was in play.At Viacom, Mr. Bakish has sharpened the company\u2019s focus on six key cable channels, including MTV and Nickelodeon, brought in new management at the Paramount film studio, given the green light to spend more on talent, and unloaded the company\u2019s stake in pay-television channel Epix for about $600 million.At first glance, Viacom and Scripps would be odd partners. The Scripps channels are lifestyle brands primarily aimed at families or people looking to upgrade their homes and kitchens. Viacom\u2019s core brands target teens and young adults, often with reality shows.However, such a deal could potentially strengthen Viacom\u2019s hand in channel-carriage negotiations with cable companies and emerging streaming TV players.The Scripps networks have been solid performers. In the second quarter, domestic ad revenue for Scripps was up 4% while Viacom\u2019s was off by 2%, according to MoffettNathanson, a media analyst firm. Subscriber fees grew by 6% in the second quarter for Scripps, compared with 1.9% for Viacom, MoffettNathanson said.Together, the companies would account for about 18% of TV ratings, on par with conglomerates like             Walt Disney Co.       and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, according to RBC Capital Markets.For Viacom, the question is how financially feasible such a takeover would be. Scripps had an $8.8 billion market capitalization before the Journal reported on July 18 that the company was in talks with Discovery. Reuters later reported that Viacom had talks with Scripps. The company is now valued at $10.4 billion.Viacom had $12.2 billion in debt as of March 31 and is clinging to the lowest level of investment-grade credit ratings, according to             Moody\u2019s Investors Service.       That means a deal would likely need to be financed substantially with stock, rather than cash, so as not to further burden the balance sheet, said Moody\u2019s debt analyst       Neil Begley.\u201cI don\u2019t think that they have a lot of financial capacity on their balance sheet,\u201d Mr. Begley said.But Viacom\u2019s equity isn\u2019t as valuable as it once was. The shares trade at about 12 times earnings, compared with Scripps at about 18 times. Viacom has a market capitalization of $14.5 billion.One benefit would be that Viacom could boost revenue by helping Scripps\u2019 channels gain greater distribution globally, Mr. Begley said.The additional free cash flow from Scripps could also be used to help Viacom reduce its leverage,             Barclays                   equity analyst       Kannan Venkateshwar       wrote in a note last week, adding that a deal would still be \u201ca confusing step in the wrong direction.\u201dFor Discovery, an acquisition of Scripps could help the company offer a compelling package of popular, nonfiction channels for \u201cskinny\u201d online TV bundles, and a good mix of male and female-skewing audiences, among other benefits.Investors have been on a roller coaster with Viacom lately. When Mr. Bakish was installed as permanent CEO in December, following a power struggle that led to the overhaul of management and the board, shares began to rebound from the mid-$30 range and reached about $47 in late March.But persistent Wall Street concerns about the TV ad market and Viacom\u2019s place in the cable TV bundle have helped push the stock down to $35, slightly above where they were when Mr. Bakish took over. Over three years, Viacom\u2019s class B shares are down more than 50%.Mr. Bakish is still dealing with baggage he inherited, including a weak slate of movies at Paramount and several cable channels enduring rating declines.He landed the job of chief executive after winning the confidence of Ms. Redstone, president of Viacom\u2019s controlling shareholder National Amusements Inc. and daughter of ailing mogul Sumner Redstone.Mr. Bakish hasn\u2019t been as tightfisted with the creative community as the company was perceived to be under the previous regime. In June, Paramount tapped       Brian Robbins,        a successful producer of content targeting teens and young adults to head the new production division Paramount Players.In another big deal, Viacom struck a partnership with successful movie and television producer       Tyler Perry       to produce content for BET and other networks as well as getting a first look at any new feature concepts.\u2014Sarah Rabil and Dana Cimilluca contributed to this articleWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/viacom-ceo-considers-costly-scripps-networks-acquisition-1501000837", "keywords": ["acquisition,ad revenue ,bob bakish, bob bakish ,cable channels,channel carriage negotiations ,credit rating, discovery communications ,scripps channels , scripps family ,scripps networks,scripps networks ,shari redstone,takeover ,talks,tv bundles,viacom,viacom ceo,viacom shares,Discovery Communications,DISCK,DISCA,Scripps Networks Interactive  ,SNI,Viacom,VIA,VIAb,National Amusements,Viacom Cl A,Scripps Networks Interactive Cl A,Discovery Communications Series A,Walt Disney,DIS,Comcast Cl A,CMCSA,Kannan Venkateshwar,Neil Begley,Tyler Perry,Bob Bakish,Shari Redstone,Sumner Redstone,Brian Robbins,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,automotive parts,tire stores,specialty stores,broadcasting,television broadcasting,interactive television,cable broadcasting,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 13:09:00", "news_title": "Fintech Firm Backed by Warburg Pincus Files for Bank Charter", "content": "Within a week\u00a0of a Trump administration official\u00a0endorsing the idea of giving bank charters to fintech companies, a startup is putting that to the test.Varo Money, a digital banking startup backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus, last week formally applied for a national banking charter and deposit insurance, the company said.

Canaan\u2019s 11th fund is the largest in its 30-year history, up from $675 million three years ago, it says.Canaan\u2019s new war chest furthers a trend since early last year of venture funds ballooning to levels not seen since the dot-com boom. The influx of capital has helped startups stay private longer with money that in past eras would have been raised on the public markets.Last year, U.S. venture firms raised 30 funds totaling at least $500 million each, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. That is up from 17 in 2015 and is by far the most in a year since 2000 when there was 54.Through the first half of this year, there were eight such megafunds recorded by VentureSource that collected a total of $9.3 billion, which represented about half of the entire sum of capital raised by 302 venture-capital funds. The median fund size is generally around $100 million.Fund managers raising outsize funds over the past year include venerable firms such as New Enterprise Associates and Technology Crossover Ventures, which raised $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, both their largest to date.\u201cIt feels like people are saying, we want to double down on the winners,\u201d said       Maha Ibrahim,        a managing partner at Canaan. \u201cIt\u2019s a very active environment.\u201dThe influx of money from so-called limited partners\u2014the foundations, pension funds, endowments and other big money managers that invest in venture capital\u2014suggests investors hope the startup frenzy of recent years will march on.Investment returns in recent years have been notably strong amid a low-interest environment, thanks to startup valuations soaring to new heights. As of July, 100 U.S. startups were valued at $1 billion or more, about triple the number from three years ago, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Billion Dollar Startup Club.Those returns, however, are mostly on paper since so few startups are holding initial public offerings, the main vehicle for venture firms to reap big profits. The lack of appetite from the public markets spooked venture capitalists, pushing startup funding down 29% to about $55 billion last year, according to VentureSource. Investment in venture firms, meanwhile, rose 18% to about $44 billion last year, the most since the height of the dot-com boom.Ms. Ibrahim said Canaan\u2019s existing investors collectively wanted to invest about 50% more money than the last fund while new investors were eager to get in, leading to demand well in excess of the $800 million.\u201cWe\u2019re looking to invest with the best managers that are likely to outperform the public markets and their peers,\u201d said Amanda Outerbridge, a principal at HarbourVest Partners, a longtime Canaan investor.Two of Canaan\u2019s past three funds have so far delivered returns at or near the top 10% of venture-capital firms tracked by investment adviser Cambridge Associates, according to data provided by Canaan. A third fund has generated middle-of-the-road returns.The Menlo Park, Calif., firm was formed as a spinoff of             General Electric Co.       in 1987, initially funding small bets in biotech and a once-tiny computing sector. It has remained in both industries, with about 60% of its capital earmarked for tech in areas like online marketplaces and fintech, and 40% devoted to pharmaceuticals and medical technology.Among Canaan\u2019s best recent investments are early bets on LendingClub Corp., which went public with a $5.4 billion valuation before beginning a long slide in its share price, and grocery-delivery startup Instacart Inc., which was valued recently at $3.4 billion.Canaan stands out in another way: Its partners, and the founders of the companies it has invested in, are noticeably more female than average in the male-dominated industry. Three out of eight of its managing partners are women, while it says about 25% of its companies in the past few funds have a female founder or chief executive.Write to Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-silicon-valley-the-big-venture-funds-keep-getting-bigger-1501002000", "keywords": ["startups,vc funds,venture capital,Canaan Partners,Instacart,LendingClub,LC,Amanda Outerbridge,retail,wholesale,etailing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,e-commerce,financial services,online service providers,investing,securities,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 12:33:00", "news_title": "Shifting Views on Health Law Challenge GOP", "content": "Senate GOP leaders didn\u2019t expect to find themselves in the situation they face this week on health care, moving to take up legislation to repeal or largely replace the Affordable Care Act without knowing that the votes are there even to open the debate. Obamacare had been unpopular for at least the past four years, opinion surveys shows, suggesting that their move to change the law would draw public support.But the Senate action comes amid increased public backing for the 2010 health law\u2014as well as for the idea that the government should play a role in helping people obtain health insurance. That is one reason that moving an overhaul of the law through Congress has been so balky for the GOP.Americans are paying attention. In a Bloomberg News poll this month, more than one-third of respondents said health care was the most important issue facing the country, nearly three times the share who picked the next item on the list, unemployment and jobs.Polls by several organizations show that Obamacare is now supported by a majority or plurality of Americans. Pew Research found that 54% of Americans approved of the law in February. It was the first time the ACA was favored by a majority of Americans since it became law in 2010. At about the same time, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling found more people describing the law as a good idea than a bad one, a reversal from prior surveys.A recent Journal/NBC News poll found that a majority of residents in counties that fueled President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election victory oppose a proposal that would lower premiums but also mean 22 million people would have no health insurance, a proxy for some measures under consideration by the GOP. The impact of that question was heightened by the fact that it was asked of people who live in counties in which support for Mr. Tump surged over the GOP\u2019s 2012 showing or which had supported then-President       Barack Obama       in 2012 before flipping to Mr. Trump last year.Attitudes about whether the government is responsible for making sure Americans have health insurance also have shifted over the years. Before the ACA was passed, a strong majority of Americans said covering people was the federal government\u2019s responsibility. Once the law passed, attitudes changed, and ensuring health coverage was no longer seen as a function of government. But since 2016, Pew Research data show the numbers have turned again, favoring a government role. The January number favoring the government\u2019s responsibility in providing health care, 60%, was the highest it had been in a decade.Write to Dante Chinni at Dante.Chinni@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shifting-views-on-health-law-challenge-gop-1501000387", "keywords": ["affordable care act,gop,health care,health law,obamacare,repeal,republicans,senate vote,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,life sciences,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 12:22:00", "news_title": "Hedge Funds Take Aim at Health Care REIT Merger", "content": "Two major investors of Sabra             Health Care REIT Inc.       are coming out against its proposed deal to acquire another health-care REIT, saying Sabra is overpaying for skilled nursing assets that are in bad shape.Hedge funds Eminence Capital LLC and Hudson Bay Capital Management LP said they plan to vote against Sabra\u2019s proposal to buy another real-estate investment trust,             Care Capital Properties Inc.,        CCP -0.51%       noting that Care Capital\u2019s portfolio of 305 skilled nursing facilities is struggling and will likely continue to worsen.\u201cI clearly disagree with their assessment,\u201d said       Richard Matros,        chief executive and chairman of the board at Irvine, Calif.-based Sabra. At the announcement of the deal in May 7, Sabra said the merger would create a $7.4 billion company that would make it investment-grade and provide greater access to debt markets. Sabra\u2019s shares have fallen by about 12% since the deal was announced.Eminence Capital currently has a 3.9% stake in Sabra, while Hudson Bay Capital has roughly a 3.4% stake.

Many health-care REITs were reducing their exposure to this asset class so they can focus on senior housing or medical office buildings.Before the Sabra-Care Capital transaction was announced, Sabra said it had been diversifying from skilled nursing facilities.\u201cIn its public filings, the company makes it clear that asset class diversification is an \u2018achievement.\u2019 We therefore have serious questions with respect to the motivation and rationale for this deal,\u201d Eminence Capital said in an open letter.The hedge funds said Signature Healthcare, a major tenant of Care Capital, is going through significant financial distress and would likely file for bankruptcy protection.Both hedge funds said that apart from strategic concerns, they believe Sabra is overpaying for Care Capital\u2019s assets, and that the 8.4% capitalization rate, a measure of yield, that Sabra said it is paying is more like 7% after adjusting for potential rent cuts.\u201cThey didn\u2019t even get a good deal. They grossly overpaid,\u201d said Hudson Bay Capital portfolio manager John Chen.The transaction would increase Sabra\u2019s revenue exposure to skilled nursing REITs from 50% to 73%, according to Sabra\u2019s filings.Sabra\u2019s Mr. Matros said the deal would diversify the firm\u2019s exposure to its major skilled nursing tenant Genesis, and that the transaction is accretive to earnings.\u201cCCP has good tenants,\u201d said Mr. Matros.

About half of that is new money, and half is existing investors in the 2019 bond who switched, according to one of the banks managing the deal.The new bond matures in August 2022 and will yield 4.625%. The 2019 bond is yielding around 3.2%, so investors will be paid a decent premium for participating in the swap.Greek bonds have been on a tear of late. Greece paid \u20ac102.60 per \u20ac100 face value of the 2019 bond. A year ago, the bond was trading below \u20ac90.Still, the sum raised is a token\u2014less than 1% of Greece\u2019s total debt\u2014and on its own not enough to forestall the need for more aid or other concessions from its eurozone rescuers. But the bond issuance was meant as a show of confidence and test of investors\u2019 appetite for its debt, two years after the country was teetering on the brink of collapse and eurozone exit. It is also a way to ease a big hump of debt repayments due in 2019.Athens\u2019 debt office is aiming to go ahead with more bond issues before the end of the country\u2019s third bailout in mid-2018.\u201cThey need to show the market that they can stand on their own feet,\u201d said Giuseppe di Mino, managing director at hedge fund Amber Capital, who expects another Greek debt sale toward the end of the year.Greek officials hope that this time the return to the markets will be consistent.Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said this Greece first attempt went better than expected and more will follow before Greece fully regains market access when its bailout expires.\u201cFrom now on we are focused on August 2018,\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos said in a televised statement. \u201cThere will be a second and a third [market access] to approach August 2018 with confidence and emerge from bailouts.\u201dPrevious bonds plunged in value a year later when Greece faced a big political crisis and came close to euro exit.

He works at Gensler, a design firm that\u2019s completed 10 food hall projects, including DeKalb Market Hall, which opened in June in downtown Brooklyn, N.Y.The number of food halls grew by 37% to 105 in 2016, and is predicted to double by 2019 in the U.S., according to commercial real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.Some are opting for a calmer look\u2014and sound\u2014to help battle what the trade calls \u201cdecision fatigue.\u201d When opening St. Roch Market, a New Orleans food hall, in 2015,       Will Donaldson       insisted the same signage be used for each vendor. Instead of music coming from individual stalls, he keeps a central music playlist to cut down on extra noise.An employee appears at each table to bring water and offer a clipboard with all of the offerings. Then visitors get up to find their food. Without a clear, streamlined guide, \u201cpeople can get confused and subconsciously shut down,\u201d says Mr. Donaldson, a former co-working space operator.Mr. Donaldson plans to open another St. Roch in Miami\u2019s Design District in 2018, with other projects in the works in Chicago and Nashville, Tenn. He plans to incorporate lessons learned from the New Orleans operation. To help patrons better navigate the space, he switched to wooden bar stools, instead of metal stools and lower chairs. They make less noise when they slide around the floor and are tall enough so visitors who are eating avoid getting bumped with bags, he says.Legacy Hall is a three-story food hall in Plano, Texas, due to open this fall within Legacy West, a 255-acre mixed-use project that\u2019s home to             J.C. Penney,       Toyota and FedEx Office headquarters.It\u2019s among the food halls avoiding potential overlap of offerings by insisting on preapproving menus.\u200bUno Immanivong, a Dallas-based chef who will open a yakitori and noodle bowl stall at Legacy, says vendors must submit menus ahead of time. Any changes go through an approval process. The agreement helps create boundaries, she says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn around to have the dumpling place sell vermicelli bowls.\u201dDevelopers are implementing plans that make turnover simpler, too. At Legacy Hall, vendors aren\u2019t asked to sign a commercial lease. Each side can break off the deal at any time, says       Randy DeWitt,        co-founder of Front Burner Restaurants, which helped create Legacy Hall. You can stay \u201cif the consumer loves you, and if not, you can just leave,\u201d he says.Operators of Brooklyn\u2019s DeKalb Market realized they needed more ability to switch out underperforming vendors by creating only \u201cbare-bones\u201d design, Mr. Carney says. \u201cWhat\u2019s key in their minds is how quickly they are able to switch vendors,\u201d he says.Some of the 40 stalls there offer just one or two main products on the menu, allowing more operators to squeeze into the subterranean space. Though time to catch a potential customer\u2019s eye is short and employees feel crammed in the kitchen, the crowds have made those challenges worthwhile so far, says restaurateur       Rob Newton,        who runs the Wilma Jean fried chicken stall. \u201cWe are all in a shared space together and have to find ways to coexist,\u201d he says.Veteran food-hall diners have come up with their own game plan to take advantage of everything before them. At the Workshop in Charleston, S.C.,       Jeff O\u2019Hara       and his colleagues at a recruiting firm take turns from visit to visit paying for a chips-and-guacamole appetizer, which helps them pass the time holding down a table as others pick up their food. And there are no hard feelings if a few co-workers need to sit elsewhere in the space.Another bit of advice from the food-hall veteran: First timers shouldn\u2019t jump in the longest line. Instead, scouting lunch dishes on social media can help you make a call on which stalls to visit without aimless wandering. \u201cAround 10 a.m. I watch their Instagram video,\u201d which shows various dishes, Mr. O\u2019Hara says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of enticing.\u201dAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Take Control at The Food Hall.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/take-control-at-the-food-hall-1500998926", "keywords": ["bar stools,dekalb market hall,fast casual,food halls,layout,legacy hall,st. roch,vendors,wilma jean,workshop,Cushman & Wakefield,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,real estate agents,brokers,real estate,construction,leisure,arts,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 12:06:00", "news_title": "For Amazon, an Open-Ended \u2018Last Tycoon\u2019", "content": "In September 1939, F. Scott Fitzgerald sent a letter to a magazine editor, seeking $15,000 to publish his next novel. \u201cI have figured it as a four months job\u2014three months for writing\u2014one month for revision,\u201d Fitzgerald wrote.The author was off in his estimate\u2014fatally so. Halfway through the novel, about a charismatic movie producer with high principles, the 44-year-old Fitzgerald died of a heart attack on Dec. 21, 1940.The incomplete book, published in 1941 as \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d is a tease for some scholars who say it had the potential to be Fitzgerald\u2019s best. But for TV writers, it offers a unique advantage: the freedom to construct their own story on the foundation built by Fitzgerald.\u201cWe had all the promise of the first half of that book, and yet limitless possibilities,\u201d says Billy Ray, the creator of a series based on the book, premiering July 28 on Amazon.Compare that with the baggage of Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Not only is that book complete, it is among the contenders for the Great American Novel. \u201cI think that has handcuffed people in the past,\u201d says Mr. Ray, whose writing credits include \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the Oscar-nominated screenplay for \u201cCaptain Phillips.\u201dAt the end of his life, Fitzgerald was living in Los Angeles, trying to climb out of debt by selling short stories and writing and revising movie scripts. \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d is set in mid-1930s Hollywood, at a fictional studio struggling to make hit movies. Fitzgerald based his main character, Monroe Stahr, on Irving Thalberg, a real-life MGM producer he admired. Stahr (played in the series by Matt Bomer) is a dashing executive with an artistic eye and failing health. He butts heads with his boss and father figure, Pat Brady (Kelsey Grammer), who is fixated on profit. Brady\u2019s daughter (Lily Collins) is in love with Stahr, but he falls for Kathleen (Dominique McElligott), who bears similarities to his late, beloved wife.Robert De Niro played the Stahr role in a 1976 movie adaptation directed by Elia Kazan that flopped.Fitzgerald, in summarizing the plot for the magazine editor (who, like others, turned him down) wrote, \u201cIt is an escape into a lavish, romantic past that perhaps will not come again into our time.\u201dTo help conjure a lavish and romantic atmosphere in the series, Amazon stacked the production with veterans of the heavily decorated period drama \u201cMad Men.\u201d They include actress Rosemarie DeWitt, costume designer Janie Bryant, makeup head Lana Grossman and executive producer and director Scott Hornbacher.The \u201cTycoon\u201d writers kept the core setting, characters and relationship dynamics from the novel and filled out that world with new elements, such as a Hooverville shantytown across the street from the studio. Another added storyline reflects money\u2019s perennial influence on the entertainment industry. Stahr rails against an emissary from the lucrative German market sent to Hollywood to revise or block any movie that \u201coffends the racial sensibilities\u201d of the Nazi regime. Drawing a comparison to the Chinese market\u2019s clout today, Mr. Ray says, \u201cI\u2019ve been in meetings for movies I\u2019ve worked on where the studio would say, \u2018The bad guy can\u2019t be Chinese, make him Russian.\u201dThe script for \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d was first developed for HBO but the network passed on it because, producers say, HBO decided to invest in a different period drama about the entertainment business. That was \u201cVinyl,\u201d which HBO canceled after one season. Overhauled for Amazon, \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d received a green light from Roy Price, a Fitzgerald fan and head of Amazon Studios, which also produced the recent jazz-age series \u201cZ: The Beginning of Everything,\u201d starring Christina Ricci as Fitzgerald\u2019s wife and muse, Zelda.The \u201cTycoon\u201d team worked with author and Fitzgerald expert A. Scott Berg as a consultant to keep them from straying too far from the novelist\u2019s blueprint. \u201cI considered myself the Fitzgerald cop,\u201d says Mr. Berg, who accompanied executive producer Christopher Keyser last month to an annual conference of Fitzgerald scholars in Minnesota to screen footage and discuss their approach.If \u201cThe Last Tycoon\u201d succeeds on TV and runs for many seasons, it can avoid an ironic fate. \u201cRight now the show is unfinished, too,\u201d Mr. Keyser points out. \u201cIf we air a single season, it\u2019ll be like the novel.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-amazon-an-open-ended-last-tycoon-1500998606", "keywords": ["amazon,f. scott fitzgerald,kelsey grammer,matt bomer,the great gatsby,the last tycoon,books,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,movies,television,radio,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 11:48:00", "news_title": "Linda Fairstein on James Taylor\u2019s \u2018Fire and Rain\u2019", "content": "Linda Fairstein,        70, is a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office and the author of 19 crime novels, including \u201cDeadfall\u201d (Dutton).

Here are four things to watch in the statement, which is scheduled for release at\u00a02 p.m. EDT\u00a0Wednesday.A big policy question these days is when the central bank will begin to slowly shrink the mountain of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it accumulated during and after the financial crisis. Officials have been saying they plan to start this year, but haven\u2019t specified when. They are likely to wait until September before announcing plans to begin the process. Watch the statement closely for any language tweaks that could signal when they intend to move.Price pressures have weakened lately, which could give the Fed reason to hold off on further interest-rate increases for a while. Inflation has undershot the Fed\u2019s 2% target for three consecutive months, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures price index.\u00a0Senior policy makers such as Fed governor       Lael Brainard,        Philadelphia Fed President       Patrick Harker,        Minneapolis Fed President       Neel Kashkari       and Dallas Fed President       Robert Kaplan       have voiced concern in recent weeks about pushing ahead with rate increases given the recent softening in inflation.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said after the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting that recent lower inflation readings had been driven significantly by one-off drops in certain price categories, like wireless telephone services and prescription drugs. Yet she struck a stronger note of caution in congressional testimony earlier this month, saying \u201cthere may be more going on, and we\u2019re watching inflation very carefully in light of low readings.\u201d Watch the statement for any tweaks in officials\u2019 language about inflation.While weak inflation is prompting concern, the job market has been going gangbusters\u00a0and unemployment was at a low 4.4% in June. That should offer some comfort to Fed officials who are counting on tight labor markets to eventually drive faster wage growth and inflation. The Fed\u2019s statement \u201cwill have to deal with the dichotomy between a resumption of moderate growth and continuing improvement in the labor market on one hand and ongoing softness in inflation on the other hand,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients last week.One factor that the central bank is unlikely to address directly in its statement is the timing of its next rate increase. Officials raised their benchmark federal-funds rate last month to a range between 1% and 1.25%, and penciled in one more rate increase this year. Given officials\u2019 concerns about low inflation, they aren\u2019t likely to raise rates at their next few meetings. Federal-funds futures, used to wager on the central bank\u2019s interest-rate moves, place a 96.9% probability that the Fed leaves the fed-funds rate unchanged this month, a 91.6% probability it will keep the rate where it is now in September, and an 87.9% chance the benchmark rate still will be unchanged in November, according to CME Group.Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weak-inflation-in-focus-at-feds-july-policy-meeting-1500997432", "keywords": ["fed,fed decision,federal reserve meeting,fed july meeting,fed meeting,fed preview,fed rates,fomc,fomc july meeting,fomc meeting,fomc preview,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,Robert Kaplan,Lael Brainard,Neel Kashkari,Patrick Harker,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 11:38:00", "news_title": "IPG Misses Earnings Estimates, Adding to Ad Industry Woes ", "content": "Interpublic Group of Co        IPG -3.25%      s. fell short of expectations on both earnings and revenue, attributing the results to political uncertainty and conservative spending from clients in industries such as consumer packaged goods.\u201cOur results in the quarter reflect the fact that macro uncertainty and political gridlock are affecting spend, particularly in the U.S., with clients demonstrating caution in terms of releasing budgets,\u201d IPG Chief Executive       Michael Roth       said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe don\u2019t see these as indicators of a broad-based economic downturn.\u201dIPG shares fell 15% to $21.72 in midmorning trading.The company, which owns ad and media agency giants McCann Worldgroup and IPG Mediabrands, reported second-quarter revenue of $1.88 billion, a 1.7% decline from a year earlier.

Omnicom CEO       John Wren       said that uncertainty around regulation, tax policy and health-care costs has caused \u201cmany companies to pause in terms of the investment that they are trying to make, and advertising and marketing is part of what suffers.\u201dDespite a tough second quarter, IPG still expects to meet its 3% to 4% organic growth target for the year, said Mr. Roth.

Mr. Kushner\u2014who was also set to speak on Tuesday with the House Intelligence Committee\u2014has faced questions over his Russian contacts, including a meeting last year with       Sergei\u00a0Gorkov,        the head of Vnesheconombank, a state-owned development bank.Dmitry Peskov,        Mr. Putin\u2019s press secretary, on Tuesday said Mr. Gorkov\u2019s visit to the U.S. was \u201cpart of a roadshow\u201d that had nothing to do with the Russian government, Russian news agencies reported.\u201cThese contacts did not require any authorization from the Kremlin, and naturally they were not carried out on behalf of the Kremlin,\u201d Russian news agencies reported Mr. Peskov as saying.Vnesheconombank was placed on a U.S. sanctions list in response to Russia\u2019s backing of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.

The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Mr. Putin ordered a hacking campaign to tilt the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. The U.S. president has called the investigation a \u201cwitch\u00a0hunt\u201d and denied any collaboration.Russia denies interfering in the elections, but now faces fresh U.S. sanctions. Congressional negotiators\u00a0reached a deal last week to advance a bill that would impose new restrictions on Russia, preventing Russian businesses in the energy and defense sectors from partnering with U.S. citizens and tightening credit restrictions on Russian entities.The White House on Sunday indicated Mr. Trump was likely to support the bill.The European Union has raised concerns over the U.S. legislation, saying it could have unintended consequences for European energy projects such as the development of new Russian export pipelines to Europe.Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for the European Commission, on Monday said the EU was \u201cactivating all diplomatic channels to address these concerns from these U.S. measures with our U.S. counterparts.\u201dRussia is a crucial energy supplier to Europe.\u00a0Russian Energy Minister       Alexander Novak       said on Monday that the U.S. sanctions under consideration were part of \u201cintensifying efforts to use unilateral, unjustified sanctions and economic limitations by a number of countries to limit and reduce real free-market competition.\u201dNew U.S. sanctions, Mr. Novak said, \u201care aimed at independent third parties who otherwise would have been willing and who want to work with more reliable and economically more justified suppliers.\u201d\u2014Laurence Norman  in Brussels  contributed to this article.Write to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-says-bank-officials-meeting-with-kushner-wasnt-on-kremlins-behalf-1500992469", "keywords": [" donald trump, jared kushner, kremlin, kushner,russia, trump, vladimir putin,Sergey Kislyak,Sergei\u00a0Gorkov,Vladimir Putin,Donald Trump,Jared Kushner,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,banking,development banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 11:23:00", "news_title": "Senate Poised for First Vote in Obamacare Repeal Effort ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Senate braced for a long-anticipated vote Tuesday afternoon on whether to take the first step in resuscitating its Republican health-care overhaul after weeks of delays, feuding within the GOP and the last-minute return to the chamber of one of its best-known lawmakers.Nearly a month after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell halted a vote on a GOP plan to dismantle and replace much of the Affordable Care Act, the Kentucky Republican said the chamber would vote Tuesday on whether to bring the bill up for consideration. Republican leaders delayed the vote earlier when it became clear that GOP defections would prevent the Senate from beginning debate on it through a so-called motion to proceed.A sustained campaign from Mr. McConnell and, in the last week, President       Donald Trump,        will be tested for its effectiveness in winning over enough GOP votes to at least clear the first procedural hurdle. The next step will be to see if there are 50 votes to pass any legislation. The Republicans hold 52 Senate seats, and no Democrats are expected to support the bill. Mr. McConnell can lose no more than two GOP votes; Vice President       Mike Pence       would cast a vote to break a 50-50 tie.\u201cBig day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter Tuesday morning.In a new twist Tuesday morning, Senate Republican leadership is pursuing a new and smaller repeal of the Affordable Care Act in an effort to secure votes that would allow for debate on a GOP health-overhaul bill, according to multiple Senate GOP aides.If the Senate votes to begin debate, and other versions of the GOP health-care bill fail in amendment votes, then Mr. McConnell would move to bring up what\u2019s being called the \u201clowest-common denominator\u201d plan.This scaled-down measure would repeal ACA requirements that many employers provide health coverage and a mandate that most people without health coverage must pay a penalty, Senate GOP aides said Tuesday. The bill would also repeal a medical device tax, they said. If that passes, then it would set up negotiations to secure a compromise between the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d plan passed by the Senate and the broader bill passed by the House in May.But it isn\u2019t clear such an approach would be backed by conservatives, who would be skeptical of where those negotiations would lead, aides said.The proposal that waters down a more robust repeal of the current health law has been closely guarded by Mr. McConnell, but will be discussed today at a lunch with GOP Senate lawmakers. If the measure secures enough votes to pass, it would allow Republicans to declare at least a partial victory on a vote that has sown such deep divisions among GOP senators that is has been unlikely a more robust overhaul would pass.If the procedural motion is cleared, the Senate would begin 20 hours of debate on the health-care bill. That could include some amendment votes, which wouldn\u2019t be considered part of the 20 hours. Later this week the Senate would conduct a long session of amendment votes, culminating with a vote on final passage.If Republicans balk Tuesday afternoon, Mr. McConnell would face the prospect of failing to even begin debate on a top Republican legislative priority while the party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. But it also could allow GOP leaders and Mr. Trump to move on to their next goal, a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, after months of health care dominating the legislative agenda.In one encouraging sign for GOP leaders, Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) said Monday night he would return to the Senate Tuesday for the vote. Mr. McCain, who was diagnosed last week with brain cancer, had been recovering from surgery in Arizona last week and is expected to vote with the GOP leadership, increasing the chances that Mr. McConnell can deliver a procedural victory.As of Tuesday morning, only one Republican senator,       Susan Collins       of Maine, was a firm opponent of beginning debate on the bill. Whether the bill advances Tuesday will depend on a handful of other GOP senators who remain undecided, including Mike Lee of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio,       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska,       Rand Paul       of Kentucky,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia, Dean Heller of Nevada and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.Hesitant Republicans have said they have many questions about which health-care measure they will be voting on this week, prompting Democrats to call on them to vote against proceeding without a better idea of the path ahead.\u201cWe are potentially one or two days away from a vote on a bill that would reorganize one sixth of the American economy, impacting tens of millions of American lives\u2014and no one knows what it is!\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 around here.\u201dWhen an earlier version of the Senate GOP plan stalled, Mr. McConnell said he was prepared to have the Senate cast a vote on a 2015 bill that simply repealed much of the ACAafter a two-year transition period.That idea has divided the Senate GOP conference, drawing acclaim from conservatives such as Mr. Paul, while siphoning support from centrist lawmakers, who fear that the uncertainty of repealing the law without a replacement in hand could disrupt the individual insurance market and alarm their constituents. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that such a plan would leave 32 million more people without insurance coverage by 2026.Mr. Paul said he would vote to begin debate if the 2015 repeal bill comes to the floor first but not if the procedural vote leads to consideration of the Senate GOP bill.\u201cI really hate their bill,\u201d Mr. Paul said Monday night of the Senate-drafted legislation. \u201cTheir bill is not repeal at all, and so I just don\u2019t support their bill.\u201dSenate Republicans are trying to pass their health-care bill using a process tied to the budget that enables them to pass legislation with a simple majority.The Republican health plan gets rid of the requirement that most people have health coverage or pay a penalty and ends the enhanced federal money to the 31 states that expanded Medicaid, a program for the low-income and disabled that has grown by about 16 million people since expansion provisions kicked in in 2014. It also imposes steep cuts to federal funding for the program.The proposal provides tax credits similar to those provided under the ACA, but it expands eligibility and makes the credits smaller. Insurers could again sell cheaper health plans with fewer benefits than under the ACA, and states could obtain waivers enabling them to roll back the current health law\u2019s regulation. Insurers could also charge older people more than they currently can under the law.Some Republicans said there was new momentum on the negotiations on the underlying Senate health-care bill. Mr. Portman said Monday night there had been progress on an effort heavily promoted by the Trump administration to help people moving out of the Medicaid-expansion program established by the ACA to afford buying their own health-care plans.\u201cWe\u2019d like to codify what is already there as a waiver,\u201d Mr. Portman said, noting there would likely be additional funding made available as well.

At the same time, tepid sales of sedans held down production in the U.S. and Canada, according to new data posted by WardsAuto.com.The data indicates one in five cars built in the North American Free Trade Agreement zone comes from Mexico, including hot new products from             General Motors Co.       and             Fiat Chrysler Automobiles        FCAU 1.54%       NV. That is up from the industry\u2019s reliance on Mexico during the financial crisis, when the U.S. car business received billions of dollars in bailouts aimed at preserving jobs and keeping domestic competitors afloat.Mr. Trump launched several attacks on Mexican car imports throughout his campaign and after his election, saying more auto-factory jobs should remain in the U.S. Since then, auto makers have committed to several initiatives, including a move by             Ford Motor Co.        F -1.86%       to scrap an assembly plant being built in Mexico and invest some of the money saved in a Michigan factory that will add jobs. GM and Fiat Chrysler have said they intend to invest billions of dollars to add jobs in factories in coming years, citing favorable policies related to tax reform and other issues as reason for optimism.The Trump administration in August will start new talks with Canada and Mexico on an overhaul to Nafta. The vehicle-manufacturing business\u2014including a sprawling supply base\u2014is a central negotiation point.The latest data from WardsAuto shows that U.S. light-vehicle manufacturing fell 5% during the first six months of this year from a year earlier, as auto makers shed workers or scheduled significant downtime to counter a slowdown in demand for sedans. A substantial chunk of America\u2019s automotive manufacturing footprint is devoted to production of family cars or compact cars, which aren\u2019t faring well as gasoline prices remain low and sport-utility vehicles grow in popularity.Separate U.S. trade data shows that the value of light-vehicle imports from Mexico to the U.S. ballooned 40% through May.United Auto Workers President       Dennis Williams       told reporters last week that the union is planning to launch a \u201cMade in America\u201d campaign later this year, an effort to support hundreds of thousands of members building vehicles or parts in U.S. factories. Mr. Williams is looking to follow the Trump administration\u2019s focus on American-made products and will use the effort to educate consumers on how to know whether a car is built in America.Finding those cars is getting harder.Pickups such as some versions of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram and Chevrolet Silverado, two of the best-selling vehicles in America, are built in Mexico.GM and Chrysler this year also started producing small crossover SUVs in Mexican plants; these are considered important vehicles for U.S. dealerships because of their growing popularity as consumers shift away from passenger cars.GM moved some production of a revamped version of its popular Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV to Mexico from plants in the U.S. and Canada. Over the next few years, the largest U.S. auto maker is expected to add other new models to factories south of the border.Most of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s increase comes from a decision to shift North American manufacturing of the Jeep Compass from the U.S. to Mexico. An all-new version of that small SUV is being built at FCA\u2019s plant in Toluca, Mexico, where year-to-date production is up 177%, according to WardsAuto.FCA said it is \u201cin the process of realigning its U.S. manufacturing operations to respond to a shift in demand from cars to trucks and SUVs,\u201d adding the company plans to ramp up production at U.S. plants over the next several months.Output at FCA\u2019s factory in Belvidere, Illinois, is down nearly 93% year to date, as production of the older Compass model has ended and two other models\u2014the Jeep Patriot and Dodge Dart\u2014were canceled. That plant has been retooled for production of the Jeep Cherokee midsize SUV, which began in June after being shifted from a Toledo facility.Corrections & Amplifications   FCA has canceled the Jeep Patriot and Dodge Dart and moved production of the Jeep Cherokee midsize SUV to its Belvidere, Illinois factory.

So did JFK, Sidney Poitier and Steve McQueen. And so should you, said Ilaria Urbinati, a stylist who tends to the looks of actors such as Donald Glover and Riz Ahmed: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to wear a tux, own it and do the bow tie. A [straight] tie comes off as, \u2018I\u2019m not really committing to this.\u2019\u201dTwo stars who might balk at that characterization: Christian Bale and Michael Strahan, who strung on straight ties with their tuxes at last year\u2019s Oscars. Ignore such red-carpet renegades, said Tyler Mitchell, owner of San Francisco department store Wilkes Bashford: \u201cYou\u2019ll see [a celebrity] every year wearing a laydown tie. I just don\u2019t think that makes it right.\u201d He reasons that the everyday neckwear undermines the formality. Most tuxedos, he points out, are very dark, either black or blue. In photographs, pairing a regular tie with one can leave you looking like you\u2019re just wearing a suit.Yet, in an age when ties in general are nearly an endangered species, a traditional bow tie can trigger pre-party anxiety among guys who are wary of appearing pathetically old-fashioned. Mr. Mitchell tells clients not to worry, and to derive reassurance from the fact that they are doing the correct thing. \u201cIt\u2019s way more appropriate to be wearing a bow tie,\u201d he said.As for what kind of bow, he advocates for black, preferably in satin to match the tuxedo lapel. Ms. Urbinati advised paying close attention to the tie\u2019s size. The wider the jacket lapel, the bigger the bow. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have a skinny little bow tie with a wide lapel,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s so wrong.\u201dEasy there, Poindexter. Not everything has to be so rigid. \u201cToo often, people want to be very, very prescriptive on what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Brice Pattison, fashion director at the Black Tux, a Los Angeles-based tuxedo- rental company. \u201cIf someone wanted to wear a black knit tie with a tuxedo and it\u2019s on the right guy, I think that\u2019s totally a cool move.\u201dOthers agree that penguin-suit imperatives have loosened considerably. Today, many wedding and gala invitations specify dress codes with open-to-interpretation descriptors such as \u201cfestive\u201d or \u201ccreative.\u201d Suddenly, even when the invite reads \u201cblack tie,\u201d it seems easy to break away from the formality of a bow. Though she personally doesn\u2019t favor straight ties with tuxedos, stylist Ms. Urbinati admitted that the look falls within the \u201cblack tie\u201d parameters: \u201cIt\u2019s not inappropriate,\u201d she said.Even if you go with a straight tie, it\u2019s often best to hang onto the debonair air of a bow tie. That typically means choosing black satin. Alternatively, try white or ivory, which sounds challenging, yet works because the hues \u201cstay within the formal palette,\u201d said Mr. Pattison.If you\u2019re of a mind to push the evening-wear envelope further, consider a microdot pattern or a slightly textured tie such as the aforementioned black knit. When played off a staid tuxedo, these subtle deviations from convention add character without attracting the bride\u2019s gimlet eye. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re a guest at a wedding, it\u2019s not your day, so be reserved,\u201d said Mr. Pattison. And whatever you do, don\u2019t eschew neckwear altogether.

Asking for a friend.\u201dAfter Burger King tweeted about a five-for-$4 deal, a woman asked Wendy\u2019s what it was firing back. \u201cEdible food,\u201d Wendy\u2019s answered.And when Hardee\u2019s came out with a four-items-for-$4 deal, mimicking Wendy\u2019s long-running four-for-$4 menu, Wendy\u2019s tweeted, \u201cWe usually prefer the original to a knock off, but hey, you do you.\u201dHardee\u2019s responded that just because Wendy\u2019s was the first doesn\u2019t mean it was the best.Wendy\u2019s pounced back. \u201cTell us the fourth person to walk on the moon without googling it,\u201d Wendy\u2019s tweeted.The young customers Wendy\u2019s is seeking to woo with its social media banter find it hilarious. The restaurants Wendy\u2019s targets? Not so much. Hardee\u2019s blocked Wendy\u2019s on Twitter. Neither McDonald\u2019s nor Burger King have responded to Wendy\u2019s tweets. All three chains declined to comment for this article.Wendy\u2019s tweets are part of a strategy to make the brand more appealing to young consumers, who have been migrating to places serving healthier fare than most fast-food chains. \u201cSince we changed our tone of voice, we\u2019ve seen a number of new consumers following us,\u201d said Wendy\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer       Kurt Kane.Wendy\u2019s said its Twitter following has risen nearly 80% in the last year to almost 2 million\u2014still well short of McDonald\u2019s nearly 3.5 million followers\u2014and that those followers are becoming new or more-frequent customers. The chain\u2019s brand-perception scores are up significantly among 18-to-21-year-olds in the past few months, according to brand-tracking firm YouGov BrandIndex. In the first quarter of the year, Wendy\u2019s notched its 17th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in North America.Companies ranging from             Whole Foods Market Inc.       to Old Spice have roasted followers as part of a strategy of engaging directly with consumers. Social-media watchers can\u2019t point to any that challenge competitors and consumers as much as Wendy\u2019s.The identities of Wendy\u2019s Twitter writers are a closely guarded secret. The company said they are a group of men and women in their 20s and 30s. Most have marketing or public-relations backgrounds. One is a stand-up comedian in his free time.The writers are careful not to be too mean, but the company says when it comes to defending its turf, it is within Wendy\u2019s right to do so.The day McDonald\u2019s announced its impending switch to fresh beef, dozens of people tweeted at Wendy\u2019s\u2014which uses fresh beef\u2014asking what it had to say. \u201cWe usually respond to a consumer who brings us into a conversation. We don\u2019t actively seek out these jabs,\u201d said the woman who oversees Wendy\u2019s social media team and who sometimes tweets herself.Few are safe from Wendy\u2019s twitterstream. In one exchange, a consumer asked Wendy\u2019s how it could keep beef fresh in transit\u2014and then applauded McDonald\u2019s breakfast. Wendy\u2019s said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring them into this just because you forgot refrigerators existed for a second there.\u201dA woman who tweeted that Wendy\u2019s food is trash was answered with: \u201cNo, your opinion is though.\u201dAwaiting Wendy\u2019s next smackdown has become a spectator sport for some.       Jason Yerex,        a 17-year-old in Port St. Lucie, Fla., asked Wendy\u2019s to roast him. Seizing on a photo of him wearing a backward-facing baseball cap, Wendy\u2019s tweeted: \u201cTurn your hat around, you aren\u2019t Bart Simpson, and it isn\u2019t 1997.\u201dMr. Yerex said McDonald\u2019s and Burger King didn\u2019t respond to his requests to make fun of him. When he asked             Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.       to roast him, the burrito maker replied, \u201cNo, that\u2019s mean.\u201dA Chipotle spokesman said: \u201cWe always try to engage with customers that reach out to us on social media, and generally like to take a high-road approach in those conversations.\u201dNo one has gotten more attention from an exchange with Wendy\u2019s than       Carter Wilkerson,        a 16-year-old from Reno, Nev. A fan of Wendy\u2019s Twitter roasts\u2014and its chicken nuggets\u2014he thought it would be fun to ask how many retweets he\u2019d need to get to secure a year\u2019s supply of free chicken nuggets. Wendy\u2019s response: 18 million. He tweeted back, \u201cConsider it done.\u201dThe challenge went viral within weeks of his April tweet. Mr. Wilkerson says he has been wrongly accused of being in partnership with Wendy\u2019s. The company says it had nothing to do with his nugget question. Although he is far from meeting Wendy\u2019s 18 million target, the chain still granted him a year\u2019s worth of free nuggets.His question was retweeted 3.6 million times, breaking the previous record held by       Ellen DeGeneres       for her 2014 Oscars \u201cselfie\u201d featuring Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and others, which was retweeted more than 3.4 million times.Mr. Wilkerson says his generation understands why Wendy\u2019s is doing what it\u2019s doing: \u201cWe find getting into fights on Twitter funny.\u201dTo match its newfound social-media sass, Wendy\u2019s has been upgrading its restaurants to look more modern and has rolled out items such as bacon queso sandwiches and fries.Wendy\u2019s executives review some tweets aimed at competitors before they go out and discuss posts afterward to make sure they\u2019re consistent with the tone it wants to convey. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had too many missteps,\u201d Mr. Kane said, declining to point to any specific tweets. \u201cBut comedy is always a trick.\u201dWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-want-snark-with-those-fries-no-one-is-safe-from-wendys-tweets-1500995026", "keywords": ["fast food tweets,mean tweets,twitter wars,wendy's tweets,McDonald's,MCD,Wendy's,WEN,Twitter,TWTR,page-one stories,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,online service providers,leisure,arts,hospitality,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 11:00:00", "news_title": "Hall of Famer Willie McCovey on His Loving Childhood Home in the Segregated South", "content": "Willie McCovey, 79, is a former first baseman for the San Francisco Giants who played in the major leagues from 1959 to 1980. He hit 521 career home runs and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. He spoke with       Marc Myers.The South of my youth in the 1940s was strictly segregated. I grew up in Mobile, Ala., and as long as we stayed in our neighborhood, we were fine. But you still had to deal with the indignities. I remember a white fellow in his 20s coming to our house and addressing my father as \u201cboy.\u201d That was hard to take.Our neighborhood was close-knit. My friends and I played sports year-round. But we didn\u2019t play much hardball early on. We played fast-pitch softball.My family\u2019s A-frame house was a 15-minute walk from town. It had a living room and not much of a bedroom. I was the seventh of 10 kids\u2014eight boys and two girls. Fortunately, we all weren\u2019t living at home at the same time. The older ones moved out as soon as they could, so six of us shared a room. We were crammed onto two convertible beds.My father, Frank, worked hard fixing tracks for the GM&O Railroad. He wasn\u2019t a large man, but he was strong\u2014and very quiet. When he spoke, we listened. At home, he never raised his voice. But if he had to talk to you about right and wrong, he\u2019d sit you down and you wouldn\u2019t forget it.My mother, Esther, was a loving woman and an incredible, understanding cook. I hated okra, so she\u2019d cook a separate dish for me, or she\u2019d pick out the okra pieces. She wasn\u2019t an \u201ceat it or else\u201d mom.All of us had our chores. Mine was feeding the chickens we raised out back. The oldest in the family was responsible for driving my father to work in our Buick Roadmaster. My father didn\u2019t drive.At night, we\u2019d gather around the radio to listen to a guy who re-created the play-by-play of major league baseball games by reading the ticker. With sound effects, he made it seem real.My friends and I played sports in the streets or empty fields. We played softball in a large local playground. Jesse Thomas was the director. I pitched and was a better pitcher than a first baseman. But I could hit the ball hard.In early 1954, when I was a junior, I dropped out of high school to help support my family. In addition to my paper route, I tried working as a bus boy in a whites-only restaurant, but I quit after a week. All the things that make you cringe was normal talk then. You took it or you walked away.I soon found work at a chicken place. I was responsible for washing the chicken parts before they were put out for people to buy.That December, I took the train to Los Angeles to visit my older brother, Wyatt. It was the first time I was away from Mobile.I started looking for a job. One day I went to an employment agency, but the line inside was long. It was so hot that I fainted. I was probably dehydrated.Failing to find a job that day was a blessing. Back at my brother\u2019s apartment, the phone rang. It was Jesse. He was a \u201cbird-dog\u201d who spotted baseball talent for a San Francisco Giants scout named       Alex Pompez.       He said he told Alex about me. Alex wanted me to report to Florida where the Giants were trying out players.All of the black players slept at one end of an old army barracks. On my first day, I did lousy. Alex came down and asked why I didn\u2019t hit. I said that I was nervous.Alex said, \u201cWell, they see something in you and they\u2019re giving you a chance.\u201d The next day I hit two home runs. The Giants signed me to their minor league system.In July 1959, I had just finished playing a double header in Phoenix for the Pacific Coast League when the general manger told me the Giants were calling me up to the big club. I had to be in San Francisco the next day for a game. I flew up on the first flight out.Horace Stoneham,        who owned the Giants, sent his driver to pick me up. I got to the ballpark just in time to get dressed.Bill Rigney       the manager, told me I was batting third, between       Willie Mays       and Orlando Cepeda. My first time at bat I hit a triple. Then I hit a single, another triple and a single. That day I made the team. They called me \u201cStretch\u201d because I was 6-foot-4.Today, I live in a split-level house in the Bay Area. I built it from scratch on an acre in the late 1970s. I have a good view of Mount Diablo and Redwood City across San Francisco Bay.Because of an old baseball knee injury, I spend most of my time in the bedroom watching the Baseball Channel on TV when I\u2019m not at Giants home games.My father never saw me play with the Giants. My mother did, though, in the 1960s. She didn\u2019t know much about the game.

Paradoxically, though, Halliburton executive chairman       David Lesar       noted that a \u201ctapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North America\u201d even as he sees stronger margins ahead.Schlumberger\u2019s executives said last week that its pressure-pumping equipment is in very high demand in the U.S. shale patch, but chief executive       Paal Kibsgaard       sounded a skeptical note. He said that U.S. land-based producers are \u201clargely driven by the U.S. equity investors who are encouraging, enabling and rewarding short term production growth in spite of marginal project economics.\u201d He also suggested that activity would moderate.The fact that these comments are being made with U.S. crude prices hovering around $46 a barrel would have been remarkable three years ago. Back then the conventional wisdom held that the break-even price for spending any money on shale formations was somewhere in the $60-$70 a barrel range.That number has come way down, much to the chagrin of producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and major non-OPEC power Russia that were scrambling to stabilize prices at a meeting in St. Petersburg. Much of it stems from innovation\u2014squeezing more oil out of each well. But part came at the expense of oil field services companies that saw margins collapse.

There are less underutilized assets sitting around, and that puts oil field services companies in a stronger position,\u201d says       Rob Thummel,        portfolio manager at energy-focused investment firm Tortoise Capital Advisors.In addition to services such as pressure pumping, other important costs for shale producers such as sand are rising. As employment streams back into the business, labor costs may also go up. Unless producers can innovate away the increased costs of services, materials and labor, or OPEC\u2019s discipline forces prices higher, this inflation will eat away at their margins and make them less likely to drill as many new wells.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coming-squeeze-for-shale-oil-drillers-1500994615", "keywords": [" david lesar, drilling rigs, halliburton, oil service companies, paal kibsgaard, rigs,schlumberger, shale,Schlumberger,SLB,Halliburton,HAL,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,support activities for oil,gas,natural gas,oil extraction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 10:46:00", "news_title": "Americans Pour Record Sums Into Home Improvements", "content": "A shortage of new single-family homes across the U.S. is pushing up prices and locking many buyers out of the market. The silver lining: a boom in renovations of existing homes.Americans are expected to pour a record $316 billion into home remodeling this year, up from $296 billion a year earlier, according to Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.The burst of renovations has been a boon for contractors as well as big home-improvement companies, which have enjoyed strong revenue growth even as most other retailers are struggling.It also reflects rising home prices and growing consumer confidence, as people are once again willing to invest in their homes, either through savings or by tapping home equity.\u201cWe turn away as much work as we do,\u201d said Bill Halliday, owner of Home Improvements of Vero Beach, in Florida. \u201cIt used to be you could call me and I could get somebody to you in a couple of days. Now I can get somebody to you in four or five weeks.\u201dAnalysts polled by FactSet expect             Lowe\u2019s Co      s. to post adjusted earnings on a per-share basis of $4.62 in its current fiscal year, up from $3.99 a year earlier.             Home Depot Inc.       is forecast to post earnings of $7.24 in its fiscal year, up from $6.45 a year prior. The earnings results would be the highest level recorded in data tracing back to 2004, according to FactSet.But economists caution that the current boom is unlike earlier ones in that it is largely a reflection of a broken housing market. Many Americans are electing to stay put rather than trade up because the inventory of affordable homes is so small.In all, there are about as many homes for sale in the U.S. today as there were in 1994, but there are 63 million more people, according to Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell. Ms. Gudell called the inventory shortage a crisis.Existing-home sales declined 1.8% in June from the previous month, driven by a shortage of inventory, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Home prices have continued to climb faster than incomes because demand is far outstripping supply. The S&PCoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index rose 5.6% in the 12 months ended in May, according to a Tuesday report, matching the April increase.The supply squeeze is bad news for the overall U.S. economy because renovations are less of an economic engine than new construction.\u201cThere\u2019s no inventory, that\u2019s what\u2019s really kicking the market in the teeth,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate firm Redfin. \u201cThe wound in the market is the lack of new construction of starter homes.\u201dThroughout much of the housing downturn and recovery Americans invested little in their homes, in part because they had lost value. At the bottom of the home-renovation market in 2009, Americans spent $222 billion on renovations, or about 30% less than today.The resurgence is being driven by several market trends. Rising home prices are boosting confidence and making people more willing to spend on big-ticket items like full kitchen remodels and additions. The average household expenditure on home renovations increased 57% in the last 12 months, according to HomeAdvisor, a website for homeowners and contractors.\u201cIt\u2019s slim pickings out there,\u201d said       Brad Hunter,        chief economist at HomeAdvisor. \u201cIf they do find something it\u2019s considerably more expensive than they expected it to be,\u201d forcing them to compromise on the size or location of the house, he said.Employment at building-material stores nudged up 0.8% in June from a year earlier, according to Labor Department figures. Sales at building-material and garden-equipment stores increased 5.1% last month from a year earlier, and in February, climbed to the highest level on record, according to U.S. Census Bureau data dating back to 1992.Adjusted for inflation, U.S. spending on home renovations remains below the peak in 2006, when rising home prices prompted millions of Americans to refinance their homes and pour that money into elaborate upgrades. Adjusted for inflation, home renovation spending that year was roughly equivalent to $334 billion, according to Harvard.Two big demographic groups in particular, baby boomers and millennials, are driving the latest home-improvement craze.Baby boomers are staying in their homes longer than previous generations, in part because they are in better health and in part because the competition for smaller homes is so fierce. Top on their renovation lists are accessibility features such as ramps, elevators and railings.According to a survey by Houzz, a home-renovation website, roughly 60% of boomers are planning to stay in their homes for the next five years and an additional 20% said they are undecided\u2014one of the reasons it is so difficult for buyers to trade up, according to Houzz, a home-renovation website.The millennials buying homes, meanwhile, are often investing in older properties that need a significant amount of work.\u201cThere are two 900-pound gorillas,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cThere\u2019s the baby boomer generation and the millennials are both having really dramatic impacts at the same time.\u201d\u2014Bowdeya Tweh contributed to this article.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com  and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'In Pricey Market, Homeowners Renovate.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-pour-record-sums-into-home-improvements-1500975001", "keywords": ["home improvements,home renovations,housing shortage,housing-supply crunch,renovation boom,single-family homes,u.s. housing market,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,living,lifestyle,real estate,property,social issues,welfare,social services,building construction,residential building construction,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 10:40:00", "news_title": "New Challenge to U.S. Power: Chinese Exceptionalism", "content": "BEIJING\u2014      Li Xiaopeng       once idolized the West. While a student, he broke through China\u2019s internet firewall to read news from abroad, revered the U.S. Constitution and saw the authoritarian Chinese government as destined to fade away.Now the 34-year-old urban consultant, who studied at both Cambridge and Harvard, thinks it\u2019s China that is ascendant and the U.S. that is terminally weakened by income inequality, divided government and a polarized society. He says so volubly to his more than 80,000 followers on social media.\u201cIn the end, China will supplant America to be the world\u2019s No. 1 strong country,\u201d he wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s homegrown version of             Twitter.President       Xi Jinping       is holding up China as a confident global power at a time when U.S. leadership seems uncertain. Increasingly, his government can count on swelling national pride among its own citizens.A generation after China\u2019s late reformist leader Deng Xiaoping exhorted his fellow citizens to \u201ckeep our light hidden and bide our time,\u201d Chinese exceptionalism is on the rise. While some Chinese still believe the country will need to embrace democracy to reach its full potential, many others are convinced the country has reached this point, not in spite of the government\u2019s crushing of pro-democracy protests in 1989, but because of it.Annual surveys by the Pew Research Center since 2010 show more than 80% of Chinese are satisfied with the direction of their country. Three-quarters of the Chinese surveyed by Pew last year see China playing a bigger role in global affairs than 10 years ago, and 60% view China\u2019s involvement in the global economy as positive.On his blog, between digressions on Socrates and Ming Dynasty economic policy, Mr. Li writes at length on the superiority of the Chinese political system. Unlike the U.S., where he says charisma is prized over professionalism and money is needed to win office, he argues that China promotes officials based on their performance in spurring economic growth and managing large cities and bureaucracies.\u201cAmong people in my generation, there aren\u2019t many of us now who think we should totally study the West,\u201d says Mr. Li. \u201cTo them, China is already a great country.\u201dThe sense that China is on the right track challenges a decades-old tenet of U.S. foreign policy, one that argued exposure to the West would lead Chinese to embrace Western values.In the wake of Brexit and       Donald Trump\u2019s       election, and amid global fears about terrorism, a generation of Chinese patriots like Mr. Li are projecting an assurance about China as a beacon of strength and stability in an uncertain world.President Xi\u2019s signature slogan, the \u201cChina Dream,\u201d appeals to Chinese who aspire to a middle-class lifestyle and cheer China\u2019s return to international prominence. On the global stage, Mr. Xi has portrayed China as an alternative to the West, with a unique political system and culture, and as a leader in areas including trade, inequality and climate change.\u201cWhat people are starting to feel is pride. It\u2019s the pride of being listened to, or forcing people to listen to you,\u201d says       Orville Schell,        director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cThe idea of greatness for China\u2014because they\u2019ve experienced weakness\u2014gravitates around the idea of power.\u201dChina\u2019s government exercises near-absolute authority over education, media and the internet. That, along with determined campaigns to quash dissent, give the Communist Party unparalleled power to frame public debate. As a result, patriotism and pro-government views are amplified. Criticisms tend to get drowned out.After communications professor Deng Xiangchao posted messages on Weibo in December lamenting the millions who died in Mao Zedong\u2019s political campaigns, he was hounded online as a \u201cpublic enemy,\u201d saw his account deleted and was fired by Shandong Jianzhu University for \u201cerroneous remarks.\u201dWriter       Lu Yang       protested the professor\u2019s treatment at the hands of \u201ca gang of ignorant internet goons\u201d in online posts. His Weibo account was also expunged. \u201cThe space for free speech in China grows smaller by the day,\u201d says Mr. Lu.A spokesman for Weibo said he wasn\u2019t clear on the circumstances surrounding the closure of accounts belonging to Deng Xiangchao and Lu Yang.More-aggressive forms of nationalism are usually directed at foreign countries seen as standing in China\u2019s way. After South Korea agreed to deploy a U.S. antimissile system as protection against North Korea, Beijing condemned the move as endangering Chinese security. Soon some Chinese began posting videos online showing themselves trampling goods from South Korean stores in China. A beef-noodle shop in Beijing advertised that it wouldn\u2019t serve South Koreans.Chinese businesses, students and tourists crisscross the globe in record numbers, and international news features prominently in the media. More than anything, Chinese say, their current patriotic sentiment is built on pride about how rapidly the country has emerged from poverty and how well its economy compares with others.In seven out of 10 European countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center, including the U.K. and Germany, China is now considered the world\u2019s leading economic power, according to data released in July. The gap in global popularity between the U.S. and China has also narrowed dramatically in recent years, with 47% of people now expressing a positive view of China, compared to 49% for the U.S., according to Pew.A record 328,547 Chinese students were enrolled in the U.S. in the 2015-2016 academic year, up 160% from six years prior, drawn to the quality of the higher education system and eager to bypass China\u2019s grueling college-entrance exams. In the past, most would stay on after graduating.

The country\u2019s return to the bond markets for the first time since 2014 is another sign the eurozone is faring better than many thought possible a few months ago. But it is also a reminder of how far Europe has to go.Greece on Tuesday priced \u20ac3 billion of new five-year bonds yielding 4.625% in a deal that also involves buying back debt due in 2019 that was sold during its last, brief period of market access. The order book was over \u20ac6.5 billion, said one of the banks managing the sale. The new debt is slightly cheaper and refinancing some of the existing bond makes sense to smooth out redemptions, which have been the flashpoint for Greek crises in recent years: the next hump is in 2019.But buyers of the new bonds will still need strong nerves. The startling gains in Greek assets in 2017, with bonds returning more than 17% and stocks up more than 30%\u2014reflect both the improved atmosphere in Europe and the high risk premia attached to Greece. After all, it is only two years since the country came to the brink of an exit from the eurozone. Greece has won positive outlooks from             Moody\u2019s Investors Service                   and S&P, but its ratings remain deep in \u201cjunk\u201d territory, limiting its ability to access markets consistently.There are glimmers of hope for the Greek economy, but the damage is deep. The economy has shrunk by more than 25% from its precrisis size. Unemployment has fallen by more than 5 percentage points from its peak, but is still above 21%. The International Monetary Fund believes Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable, but the eurozone has yet to commit fully to more debt relief.A true end to the Greek crisis is likely to require deeper eurozone integration, so that Greece\u2019s burden is shared in some way. More reform in Athens will also need to come. While the cyclical recovery, helped by extraordinarily loose monetary policy and relative political calm, means the currency bloc has moved down investors\u2019 list of worries, Greece\u2019s on-off crises have shown how quickly such comforts can evaporate.That has implications beyond Greece. Questions remain, for instance, over how markets will treat Italian government bonds once the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing comes to an end. While everything is well, Italian debt behaves like a high-yielding but safe government bond. But political risk can cause credit concerns to come to the fore quickly. That ambiguous status remains essentially unresolved.Greece shows how the eurozone has made forward strides in 2017.

In the meantime, authorities said more police would be deployed around the entrance.Muslims kept up a prayer protest called by Muslim leaders outside the compound even after police had dismantled all the equipment by the afternoon.The plaza in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is sacred to both Muslims and Jews. It is home to the Al Aqsa mosque and the site of an ancient Jewish temple whose Western Wall is still visible and holy for Jews.Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the plaza, but Jewish groups have been lobbying for that right. While Jews can visit, they aren\u2019t permitted to pray there.Waqf, the religious authority overseen by Jordan that administers the site, said it would review Israel\u2019s plan for security and make a decision later on whether to continue to boycott the compound.White House envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict       Jason Greenblatt       arrived in Israel on Monday to meet with Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       in a bid to calm tensions before flying to Amman, where he met with Jordanian officials.It was unclear whether the U.S. continued to mediate between Jordan and Israel. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv didn\u2019t respond to request for comment.Thousands of Jordanians took to the streets Friday in Amman to protest the detectors. Two days later, an Israeli security guard at the country\u2019s embassy compound there shot and killed two Jordanians after one of the men attacked the guard with a screwdriver.Jordan held the guard until Monday, when he returned to Israel following discussions between Israeli and Jordanian officials, including Mr. Netanyahu and Jordan\u2019s       King Abdullah II.In a statement Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister thanked both Mr. Greenblatt and senior White House adviser       Jared Kushner       for mediating efforts to bring home the Israeli guard and other Israeli embassy staff.\u201cWe had a situation in Jordan which was potentially something that could have gone very bad,\u201d David Friedman, U.S. ambassador to Israel, said Tuesday in a visit to the Israeli parliament. \u201cWith no fanfare but with a lot of hard work and behind the scenes discussions...we were able to defuse very quickly a situation.\u201dPalestinian Authority President       Mahmoud Abbas       had condemned the installation of the metal detectors and said he would cut ties with Israel until they\u2019re removed, although his office hasn\u2019t detailed the specifics of the suspension.A spokesman for the Authority said it would follow the lead of the Waqf in determining whether to encourage worshipers back and to restore contacts with Israel.Israel had to respect \u201cfreedom of worship,\u201d Rami Hamdallah, prime minister of the Palestinian Authority said in a statement Tuesday.\u2014Nuha Musleh in Jerusalem contributed to this article.Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-removes-metal-detectors-at-jerusalem-holy-site-1500970258", "keywords": ["political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,religion"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 10:13:00", "news_title": "N.J.

She faces a Friday deadline to finalize her ticket.Mr. Murphy\u2019s selection of an assemblywoman from northern New Jersey brings in someone with a long track record in state politics. Mr. Murphy, a former             Goldman Sachs                   executive from Monmouth County, has never held elected office. Ms. Oliver, 65 years old, has served in the state Assembly since 2004 and was Speaker of the chamber from 2010 through 2013.During her tenure as Speaker, Ms. Oliver worked with Senate President       Steve Sweeney       and Mr. Christie to pass legislation that reined in pension and health-care benefits for public workers.Ms. Oliver is the assistant administrator for Essex County, which is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations and serving as a liaison between the county\u2019s government and its elected officials, known as freeholders. She holds a master\u2019s in science degree from Columbia University, where she studied planning and administration.Recent polls show Mr. Murphy as the front-runner in the governor\u2019s race to replace Mr. Christie, who is prevented by term limits from running for reelection. A July Monmouth University Poll gave the Democrat a 27-point lead over Mrs. Guadagno, although 60% of respondents said they had no opinion on either candidate.Mr. Murphy, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Germany under President       Barack Obama,        has run on a progressive platform. He supports the creation of a state bank, curtailing standardized testing in public schools, implementing stricter gun control and boosting state funding for women\u2019s health-care programs.Mrs. Guadagno, a former federal prosecutor and sheriff from Monmouth County, is the first person to serve as lieutenant governor in New Jersey. The position was created through a 2005 ballot referendum held after two governors\u2014in a span of less than five years\u2014left their posts before the end of their terms.The Republican nominee has focused her campaign on lowering the state\u2019s property taxes, and has pledged to not seek reelection unless she is successful.

HBC 1.28%       and Chinese online-retail giant             JD.com Inc.,        JD 3.17%       have recently begun testing robotic \u201cpickers\u201d in their distribution centers. Some robotics companies say their machines can move gadgets, toys and consumer products 50% faster than human workers.Retailers and logistics companies are counting on the new advances to help them keep pace with explosive growth in online sales and pressure to ship faster. U.S. e-commerce revenues hit $390 billion last year, nearly twice as much as in 2011, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Sales are rising even faster in China, India and other developing countries.That is propelling a global hiring spree to find people to process those orders. U.S. warehouses added 262,000 jobs over the past five years, with nearly 950,000 people working in the sector, according to the Labor Department. Labor shortages are becoming more common, particularly during the holiday rush, and wages are climbing.Picking is the biggest labor cost in most e-commerce distribution centers, and among the least automated. Swapping in robots could cut the labor cost of fulfilling online orders by a fifth, said       Marc Wulfraat,        president of consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of units, those numbers can be very significant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a significant edge for whoever gets there first.\u201dUntil recently, robots had to be trained to identify and grab each item, which is impractical in a distribution center that might stock an ever-changing array of millions of products.Automation companies such as             Kuka AG        KU2 0.90%      , Dematic Corp. and             Honeywell International Inc.       unit Intelligrated, as well as startups like RightHand Robotics Inc. and IAM Robotics LLC are working on automating picking.In RightHand Robotics\u2019 Somerville, Mass., test facility, mechanical arms hunt around the clock through bins containing packages of baby wipes, jars of peanut butter and other products. Each attempt\u2014successful or not\u2014feeds into a database. The bigger that data set, the faster and more reliably the machines can pick, said       Yaro Tenzer,        the startup\u2019s co-founder.Hudson\u2019s Bay is testing RightHand\u2019s robots in a distribution center in Scarborough, Ontario.\u201cThis thing could run 24 hours a day,\u201d said       Erik Caldwell,        the retailer\u2019s senior vice president of supply chain and digital operations, at a conference in May. \u201cThey don\u2019t get sick; they don\u2019t smoke.\u201dJD.com is developing its own picking robots, which it started testing in a Shanghai distribution center in April. The company hopes to open a fully automated warehouse there by the end of next year, said Hui Cheng, head of JD.com\u2019s robotics-research center in Silicon Valley.Swisslog, a subsidiary of Kuka, sells picking robots that can be integrated into the company\u2019s other warehouse automation systems or purchased separately. The company sold its first unit in the U.S., to a large retailer, earlier this year, said A.K. Schultz, Swisslog\u2019s vice president for retail and e-commerce. Mr. Schultz declined to name the retailer.Previous waves of warehouse automation didn\u2019t lead to sudden mass layoffs, partly because order volumes have been growing so fast. And automated picking is still at least a year away from commercial use, robotics experts say. The main challenge lies in creating the enormous databases of 3D-rendered objects that robots need to determine the best way to grip new objects.Some companies hope to speed development by making some research public.

They imagine somebody shaking their finger and telling them what to do. That kind of advice is never helpful. Good advice is simply about sharing your perspective. When I started writing an advice column, I approached it with a sense of curiosity and a light heart, and I quickly realized that it was incredibly meaningful work. I was using stories to illuminate those deeper human truths that can so often be guiding lights for us. The big questions were always about love, sex and family. Will I ever be loved? How do I heal when bad things happen? The letters I got could be devastating. But there\u2019s something about being able to help others that\u2019s empowering. You shift from despair to hope. We are made stronger for our suffering, especially when we turn that into generosity, into helping others.\u201d\u2014Strayed is the author of four books, including Tiny Beautiful Things, and the co-host of the advice podcast Dear Sugar Radio.\u201cIn our business, the ability to give good advice consistently has a direct impact on our capacity for success. Our clients have their own unique careers and objectives. But even though they\u2019re on different journeys, they all want a career that provides them with creative fulfillment and happiness. Our job is to get them there. Sometimes they may not agree with our advice or want to hear it\u2014but it\u2019s still our responsibility to share that with them. Technology has disrupted the entertainment business since radio, but access to information\u2014especially via social media\u2014is so overwhelming now. The megaphone is bigger, the opinions louder than ever. It creates this confusing environment. A trusted source of advice is critical amid all the noise.\u201d\u2014Whitesell is a talent agent and co-CEO of WME/IMG.\u201cThere\u2019s a moment of incredible clarity when you hear the right advice. A light goes on in your head. I consider a few things when advising clients about collecting art, including their station in life and their ultimate goals for the collection\u2014whether they plan to give to the local museum, for instance. I always try to save them from making any catastrophic mistakes. If anything, I\u2019m probably too honest and direct at certain moments. Sometimes I\u2019ll say, \u2018Look, you\u2019re rich. You can have anything that you want, but this isn\u2019t something you should need that badly. Take a walk around the block.\u2019 Part of advice is protecting people from what they want. I feel good when the right object has found the right home. It\u2019s a little bit like arranging love when you\u2019ve made that match.\u201d\u2014Cappellazzo is a chairman at Sotheby\u2019s and an art adviser.\u201cI had the opportunity to work with Francis Ford Coppola very early in my career. He told me a story about the film Patton [which he co-wrote] that stuck with me. There\u2019s a scene where Patton stands in front of a flag addressing troops that you never see\u2014it\u2019s a scene that has become iconic in terms of cinema and culture. But Coppola had to fight the studio to keep it in because they just didn\u2019t understand it. He told me that the things you have to fight hardest for are the things you\u2019ll be remembered for because they\u2019re so different. I always thought that was an amazing piece of advice. But that was coming from Francis Ford Coppola! I\u2019ll readily admit that as a younger person I wasn\u2019t always good at accepting advice. Advice is the easiest thing to dispense and the hardest thing to absorb. Hopefully, with a bit of maturity, you can accept those things that might make a difference in your career and life.\u201d\u2014Ridley is a writer and director. His documentary, Let It Fall, will be rereleased later this year.\u201cThe most important thing to keep in mind when giving advice is an understanding of how the other person prefers to communicate. Some people like directness, while others might need you to change the tone of your voice, which might mean talking more softly or sweetly. If you approach someone in the wrong way, they\u2019re going to have a closed-off response, so it\u2019s necessary to remain sensitive to their needs. I think I\u2019m pretty good at giving and receiving advice\u2014although I bet I\u2019m pretty bad at it as well!\u2014but sometimes you have to take what\u2019s said with a grain of salt, because a piece of advice can be based on whatever mood a person is in that day, and it\u2019s always limited to an individual\u2019s own experience. Sometimes your gut reaction is an important one. It can be the best way to go.\u201d\u2014Olsen is an actress. She stars in Ingrid Goes West and Wind River. Both films are out this month.\u201cHow do you know when you should give advice and when to button your lip? You might give advice when you see someone in trouble, stranded out at sea, and it\u2019s clear they just need a little push. But then there are times when you feel like you shouldn\u2019t really interfere, that he or she needs to go through whatever it is to get to the other side, that it\u2019s part of the process. I definitely remember a musician I know saying, \u2018The older I get, the more comfortable I am giving people advice.\u2019 It does happen! I\u2019m touring with my hero Chick Corea this summer, and I\u2019m always happy to get his perspective on things. We can have really good talks about band leading, and he\u2019s coming at it from the position of a guy who has had 20 great bands. All those things I\u2019ve learned from different musicians add up.\u201d\u2014Fleck is a banjo player. His next album will be released in October.

There is also a sense of relief among mainstream politicians at having seen off challenges from parties hostile to the euro and the European Union in elections in the Netherlands and France.But if the eurozone\u2019s leaders were preparing to engage in a period of self-congratulation, the Washington, D.C. based Fund is out to spoil the party with a reminder of how much work remains to done before the threats to the currency area\u2019s survival are minimized.In its annual review of the eurozone\u2019s economic policies, the Fund warned it faces \u201csignificant downside risks,\u201d with government debt levels still too high and the banking sector still fragile and weighed down by bad loans.It also noted that the convergence in income levels that has long been at the heart of the EU project has stalled, and the gap between highly productive economies such as Germany, and less productive economies such as Italy is widening.The IMF warned that if the eurozone didn\u2019t address its economic problems, anti-euro political parties that have been rebuffed in 2017 will have another opportunity to gain power.\u201cInside the euro area, concerns about populist undercurrents and possible policy shifts toward euro skepticism remain extant,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cDoubts about the merits of integration in some camps, as well as concerns about high youth unemployment and increasing inequality, could be exacerbated by low growth and profound societal changes.\u201dThe Fund\u2019s board of directors, who represent the countries that own it, encouraged eurozone politicians to seize an opportunity to push through overhauls that are needed to boost productivity at a national level, as well as changes that will make the currency area more cohesive, such as a common fund to help tackle any future crises.\u201cDirectors concurred that the more favorable political and economic context provides an opportune moment to accelerate reforms at both the national and central levels and complete the euro area architecture,\u201d it said.The IMF\u2019s analysis of the eurozone\u2019s problems echoes that of French President       Emmanuel Macron,        who argues the creation of the currency area has deepened disparities, loading indebted nations with yet more debt and making competitive countries even more competitive. He is pressing German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to back a shared eurozone budget that could be used for a variety of reasons, including helping currency members in economic distress.The pickup in eurozone economic growth this year has been greeted with louder calls from Germany for an end to the stimulus programs launched by the European Central Bank since mid-2014. The IMF warned against responding to those voices, seeing inflation reaching the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2% as late as 2021.\u201cThe costs of a long period of inflation undershooting continue to exceed those of a temporary overshoot,\u201d it said. \u201cThe calls from some quarters for an exit from monetary accommodation are therefore premature.\u201dIn June, the ECB dropped a signal that it might further lower its key interest rates, a step the IMF welcomed. But the Fund said that any further change to policy \u201cshould be underpinned by a clear shift in the path of actual inflation or a much stronger assessment of the inflation outlook.\u201dIt also said that for eurozone inflation as a whole to return to target, some members of the currency area would have to accept prices rises above 2%, a reference to Germany, where economic growth has been strong and unemployment low.\u201cIn countries where the output gap is closed and wage growth is subdued, authorities could encourage faster wage and price growth in their public communication,\u201d the Fund said.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-warns-eurozone-against-complacency-sees-serious-threats-1500991201", "keywords": ["eurozone economy,eurozone growth,eurozone issues,imf,macron ,merkel,International Monetary Fund,European Central Bank,European Union,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 10:00:00", "news_title": "United Capital Buys Three Advisers With $758 Million Under Management", "content": "United Capital Financial Advisers LLC has acquired three wealth-advisory firms across the U.S., the latest sign of consolidation in the financial-advice industry.The Newport Beach, Calif.,-based firm said it has purchased Jensen Wealth Advisors, of Palm Desert, Calif.; Compass Wealth Advisors of Elkhart, Ind.; and Asset One LLC, which has offices in Colorado and Louisiana.

The tactics included hacking state election systems, stealing and leaking information from party committees and political strategists, and using social media and other outlets to disseminate negative stories about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.Mr. Trump has called the investigation, led by former FBI Director       Robert Mueller,        a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices were the subject of an FBI investigation overseen by       James Comey,        who last year stated at a news conference he had recommended against charging Mrs. Clinton criminally. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May, citing his handling of both the Clinton probe and the Russia investigation.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to push Mr. Sessions, a former Alabama senator and early backer of his campaign, to relaunch a criminal probe of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) &             Intel                   leakers!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.The president also suggested the FBI is under the control of people who are sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton.\u201cProblem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation,       Andrew McCabe,        got $700,000 from H for wife!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.In 2015, the political organization of Virginia Gov.       Terry McAuliffe,        an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President       Bill Clinton,        and the Virginia Democratic Party gave nearly $700,000 to the Virginia state Senate campaign of Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill McCabe.Mr. McCabe is the acting head of the FBI, as the Senate has yet to confirm Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to replace Mr. Comey, the veteran attorney and former Justice Department official Chris Wray.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday, the president first suggested that Mr. Sessions, whom he described in a tweet as \u201cbeleaguered,\u201d should be investigating Mrs. Clinton, not his campaign. His press secretary,       Sarah Huckabee Sanders,        reiterated during a briefing with reporters aboard Air Force One that the president is \u201cvery disappointed that Attorney General Sessions chose to recuse himself\u201d from the Russia investigation.Ms. Sanders also said that the president was not merely joking or tweeting for effect when he suggested a federal investigation of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI think that he would hope that the Department of Justice would look into any potential area where the law could have been broken,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump also tweeted about Tuesday\u2019s Senate vote on legislation to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, challenging Republicans in Congress to follow through on seven years of promises.\u201cBig day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!\u201d the president tweeted.He wrote in a follow-up tweet that Obamacare \u201cis torturing the American people. The Democrats have fooled the people long enough. Repeal or Repeal & Replace! I have pen in hand.\u201dMr. Trump also recognized Sen.       John McCain,        who is returning to Washington for Tuesday\u2019s scheduled vote just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor.\u201cSo great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John,\u201d the president tweeted. In 2015 Mr. Trump stirred one of the first controversies of his campaign by questioning whether the longtime senator and former POW is actually a hero because he was captured while serving in Vietnam.The president\u2019s seventh tweet in the 6 a.m. hour Tuesday returned to the subject of the Russia probe and touched on his son-in-law\u2019s closed testimony before Congress on Monday.\u201c      Jared Kushner       did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians.

Economists have said they are concerned that price growth that continues to outpace income growth won\u2019t be sustainable.If price growth continues to slow gradually rather than crashing that would be welcome news for the housing market.\u201cHousing is not repeating the bubble period of 2000 to 2006,\u201d said       David Blitzer,        managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices. He noted that price increases vary across the country unlike the earlier period, when rising prices were almost universal, the number of homes sold annually is 20% less today than in the earlier period and the months\u2019 supply is declining, not surging.To be sure, despite the flattening this month prices are still growing quickly and much faster than incomes. Home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Then prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005.Economists are concerned, however, about a handful of markets that have been seeing double digit or near-double digit growth. Seattle led the way in May with a 13.3% home-price increase and Portland reported a 8.9% year-over-year gain. Denver, which has been vying with Dallas for the third spot, reported a 7.9% annual increase in home prices.Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 1% in May before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.7% and the 20-city index increased 0.8% from April to May.After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.2% month over month, the 10-city remained stagnant and the 20-city index rose 0.1%.After seasonal adjustment, 14 of 20 cities saw prices rise in May.Existing home sales fell 1.8% in June from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.52 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Sales have essentially been flat since March, when home purchases reached the highest level since 2007.A number of indicators suggest demand is surging because of a strong economy and millennials entering the housing market in force for the first time, but there are simply not enough homes for people to buy.Write to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-price-growth-flattened-in-may-1500988629", "keywords": [" 10-city index, 20-city index, national home price index, s&p,case-shiller index, s&p case shiller, u.s. economic growth ,u.s. home prices,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 09:04:00", "news_title": "Financial-Sector Investor Aquiline Raises First Fund for Tech Deals", "content": "Aquiline Capital Partners completed raising capital for a new fund that aims to apply the firm\u2019s focus on the financial-services and insurance sectors to smaller, expanding companies.Aquiline Technology Growth Fund LP closed at $190 million, exceeding its $150 million target and nearly hitting its hard cap, said firm Chairman and Chief Executive       Jeff Greenberg.The new fund is the first Aquiline vehicle dedicated to investing in early-stage companies. The New York firm, which closed its third flagship fund last year with $1.1 billion, typically targets midmarket companies in financial-services and insurance, often where those industries intersect with the technology sector.Aquiline\u2019s desire to invest in a broader swath of companies, along with limited partner interest in early-stage technology deals and insurance technology, led the firm to start building its technology-growth unit late last year.\u201cWe believe that having a presence in that market is good for the firm as a whole, good for limited partners and portfolio companies, and good for our general knowledge and awareness in the sector,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg.Aquiline recruited Max Chee from venture-capital firm Millennium Technology Value Partners to lead the new unit, along with       Michael Cichowski,        a managing director at a family office who previously worked for growth-equity firm Edison Ventures.Aquiline\u2019s approach with the new fund \u201cis in some ways parallel to the way we operate in our main funds,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, the former chairman of             Marsh & McLennan Co      s. and the son of Hank Greenberg, the former chief executive of American Insurance Group Inc. Aquiline, which was founded in 2005, aims for what Mr. Greenberg called \u201cout of the limelight\u201d deals and targets companies that are in position to capitalize on the changes the finance and insurance sector are going through.The Aquiline Technology Growth fund makes minority investments of $3 million to $15 million in companies raising Series A funding up through the growth-equity stage. The firm expects the fund to invest in insurance technology, asset-management technology, benefits and retirement, and other sectors, according to a news release.The new fund has made two investments so far, leading a $6.6 million Series A financing in Carpe Data, which provides customer-data analytics for insurance companies; and investing in a home-warranty and concierge-repair company, whose name it hasn\u2019t made public.Mr. Chee said he expects to see strong deal flow in the insurance-technology sector, which saw a record $985 million in funding volume in the second quarter of this year, including $289 million in early-stage funding, according to a report from Willis Towers Watson. Mr. Chee also sees opportunities in the industry\u2019s adoption of data analytics as well as in distribution and middle- and back-office operations.Aquiline recently announced two exits for its midmarket investing strategy.

We know where to go.\u201dSo he\u2019s thrilled that this summer, New York cabbies got a new weapon in their war with Uber. Now, passengers using Curb, a ride-hailing app for taxis, can choose a fare-splitting option. In exchange for sharing the back seat with a fellow passenger matched by a routing algorithm, riders get a 40% discount.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very busy. We\u2019re going to take Uber out of New York City!\u201d Mr. Dah says.Perhaps. In a highly unscientific test I conducted last week pitting Curb against two other ride-sharing services\u2014Via and Uber\u2019s uberPOOL option\u2014Curb\u2019s rates were by far the highest.Testing the services on three routes during three different rush hours\u2014for a total of nine rides\u2014my average Curb fare, including taxes and surcharges, came to $12.25 compared with $5.44 with Via and $5.09 with uberPOOL.The problem: Unlike Via and uberPOOL, which always offer discounted fares, Curb only discounts the metered rate if your cabbie finds an additional passenger along your route. And I took three very lonely rides.Jason Gross,        vice president, head of mobile with Curb parent Verifone Transportation Systems, says the service, launched in June, should attract more riders as it gains traction.Meanwhile, Curb\u2019s revenue model\u2014a small surcharge per ride\u2014doesn\u2019t allow discounts for solo passengers. \u201cWe don\u2019t take 20 to 30% from the driver,\u201d he says.I had high hopes for Via, given its growing popularity. Since last summer, its New York City ridership more than tripled, to more than a million passengers a month.But I waited 22 minutes for my first ride. Chief Executive Officer and co-founder       Daniel Ramot       says the driver took a wrong turn on Lexington Avenue.\u201cUnfortunately, we still depend on human drivers who can do all sorts of things,\u201d he says.The average wait with Via, he says, is five to six minutes.My Via experience was wildly varied. In one test, I enjoyed a pristine Mercedes SUV chilled to perfection. For a trip down Ninth Avenue, however, the barefooted driver of a tiny             Volkswagen                   kept the AC off despite the scorching heat.Mr. Ramot says Via only works with the best drivers. \u201cThey are supposed to keep their shoes on,\u201d he notes.Via\u2019s best feature is its longstanding $5 flat rate ($5.44 with tax) for any weekday ride in Manhattan between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.It\u2019s not just simple for passengers, it\u2019s profitable for Via along busy corridors, Mr. Ramot says.Indeed, on a ride from East 86th Street to Grand Central Terminal, my car fetched and dropped eight passengers. That\u2019s $40 collected on a jaunt that would have earned a taxi about $13.Sorry, Uber haters. The service performed best on both fares and wait times, with an average wait of just 5 minutes compared with 11 minutes with Curb and 13 with Via. Uber also provided the sweetest drivers, not to mention, on one ride, a chatty fellow passenger who showered me with stock tips.Uber says 25% of its New York activity is on uberPOOL; it\u2019s the fastest-growing segment.The big drawback, of course, is Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. The moment you most need a ride\u2014during a subway meltdown, say\u2014increased demand can send rates sky-high. Uber says that while prices can increase, riders are notified when fares are higher than normal, and see the actual fare they will pay before they request a ride.You\u2019d do well to keep all three apps on your phone for just such an occasion.Mr. Dah, meanwhile, says there will be many more cabbies following his lead. \u201cWe pick up a shared ride, we make more money,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd everybody wants to make money now!\u201d\u2014anne.kadet@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Grading the City\u2019s Options for Sharing a Ride.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-new-nyc-taxi-app-stacks-up-against-uber-1500987601", "keywords": ["nyc cabbies,nyc taxis,ride-hailing apps,ride-sharing,transportation,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,retail,wholesale,etailing,taxi,limousine service,e-commerce,online service providers,road,rail transport,technology,sharing economy services,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 09:00:00", "news_title": "Lego Boost Review: Meet Your Child\u2019s New Coding Coach ", "content": "Learning programming is awesome when you\u2019re making Lego robots fart.\u201cUsually Legos cannot fart, so we made these Legos fart a lot,\u201d says Eleanor, 9 years old, who helped me code dance moves, jokes and simulated bodily functions into Lego Boost, a new take on the iconic bricks. \u201cAlso burp. Don\u2019t forget the burping,\u201d she adds.Making Lego bricks come to life is a big deal for children aged 7 to 12\u2014as well as for parents who want to teach them the basics of programming.The Lego Boost kit, which arrives in stores for $160 on Aug. 1, updates the beloved plastic bricks with simple motors and sensors that connect wirelessly to a tablet. In the box, you get the pieces that can make a rolling robot named Vernie, a cat, a rover, a factory or an electric guitar. (Just not all at once.) You create basic programs by dragging and dropping icons, little blocks of code, in a companion tablet app.With the assistance of junior reviewers Eleanor, Wes and Andrew, I found Lego Boost to be a hefty project for young children\u2014but a remarkably fun way to learn how to think like a programmer. It\u2019s an early contender for best toy of 2017.Andrew, 10, had Vernie built and zipping around the house in about four hours, with little assistance from me. \u201cEven though it is complicated, it\u2019s very cool how you get to build all these things,\u201d he says.Building the robot with Andrew began like all Lego projects: ripping open a box and then desperately attempting to not lose little bricks in the carpet. While most of the 847 pieces resemble the billions out there in the wild, Boost kits include a Move Hub. Inside is a computer, a Bluetooth wireless chip, motors and motion sensors. There\u2019s also a piece containing a color and distance sensor, and an additional motor piece.The other new part is an app for iPads and Android tablets. (Alas, it doesn\u2019t work on phones.) You start in an introductory lesson, building a simple truck. That teaches you the basics, including how to install six AAA batteries (not included) and how to make programs. Andrew assembled Vernie by following on-screen diagrams that look a lot like Lego\u2019s printed instruction books.About halfway through, the app paused the build and asked Andrew to assemble code to make Vernie come alive. \u201cMy neck is sore,\u201d said the robot, to Andrew\u2019s delight.Once Andrew gave Vernie his tank-tread legs, the app shifted more to coding, presenting a series of challenges. Andrew made the robot say \u201cHello\u201d when he shook its hand by combining two bits of code, an input from Vernie\u2019s tilt sensor and an output to the iPad\u2019s speaker.Encouraging children to code is a growing preoccupation of many toys and apps. It\u2019s a helpful activity, if done right. \u201cLearning to code when you just follow instructions won\u2019t teach you as much as if you are making something that is uniquely your own,\u201d says       Hadi Partovi,        a tech investor and CEO of the nonprofit Code.org, which offers courses for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.Amid a sea of lackluster apps with rote learning and thinly veiled shoot-em-up games, Mr. Partovi says Code.org partner apps like Tynker, Lightbot and Box Island encourage children to solve puzzles with code. And robots such as Dash and Dot and Sphero Sprk Edition help move children beyond glowing screens to programming physical objects.Lego Boost stands out from the pack because children build both the objects and the code to make them come alive, multiplying the opportunities for creativity. Lego executives say they don\u2019t consider Boost to be a \u201cteaching\u201d product. It isn\u2019t goal-oriented like educational programs, though children come away with coding fundamentals like sequencing and looping.Among my test crew, Boost also appealed because it\u2019s classic Lego\u2014a toy kazillions of young people understand intuitively. (A more complicated Lego kit called Mindstorms is often used to teach robotics to older students.) Lego encourages children to use the brainy new Boost components with their other creations. How about a dragon that walks? The app offers help to make one.When Eleanor and her brother Wes, 6, began programming the cat, one of the first exercises was to give it a Lego-brick bottle of milk, which it \u201cdrinks,\u201d triggering simulated feline flatulence. Later, Wes had a Eureka moment, figuring out how to make Vernie move forward and shout \u201cOMG\u201d when he clapped his hands.\u201cIn regular coding games you look at the screen to see the things happen, but in this coding game you look at the robot to see if you did it right,\u201d Wes says.The Boost coding experience is similar to a visual language called Scratch, developed at MIT. The code blocks are identified by icons and colors, not words. The Lego app communicates how to use it without any text or tutorials. You learn by doing.Lego says it has no plans to sell additional coding blocks as in-app purchases, though it does provide manual motor and sensor controls for the type of children who go to Harvard at 14.My testers were disappointed that the Boost pieces have limited lights and no speakers; noises only come from the tablet. But it didn\u2019t take them long to imagine uses for their robots. One common theme was pranks. \u201cI would get the cat and put it in a bush, and then as my mom or my dad was coming home, I would have the cat screaming,\u201d says Eleanor.One of my few complaints about the Boost app is that it doesn\u2019t offer any help for parents. There\u2019s no search function for code blocks, and since they don\u2019t come with explanatory text, it can be hard to help when a child gets frustrated. My advice: Take it slow. Lego Boost\u2019s capabilities go wide, and a child could just spend a week working out all the possibilities of one or two bits of code.Also note: The Move Hub\u2019s AAA batteries can die after a few hours of heavy use.At $160, Lego Boost is a big purchase. But if this makes you feel any better, a Lego Star Wars Death Star costs $500 and only features pretend droids.What impressed me most about Lego Boost was how much my testers say they enjoyed the coding aspect. Lego-obsessed Wes, who\u2019s slightly younger than Boost\u2019s advertised age, says coding is better than building because it\u2019s \u201cfaster and funner.\u201d I think there are plenty of engineers in Silicon Valley who\u2019d agree.Appeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Young Coders Bring Lego Bricks to Life.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-boost-review-meet-your-childs-new-coding-coach-1500987601", "keywords": ["code.org,coding,coding apps,coding basics,coding for children,coding for kids,coding games,computer programming,educational toys,learning to code,learn to code,lego boost,lego boost creative toolbox,lego boost kit,lego vernie the robot,personal technology,programming,ptech,scratch mit,vernie the robot,Lego,political,general news,computer science,living,lifestyle,sciences,humanities,reviews,dolls,toys,games,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 09:00:00", "news_title": "Boeing and Airbus Earnings: What to Watch", "content": "Airbus SE        EADSY 2.79%       and             Boeing Co.        BA 9.88%       have a combined order book of around 12,500 jetliners, and the challenge of converting those into cash. Investors have warmed to Boeing\u2019s conviction on boosting profit margins while Airbus may take longer to deliver. Here\u2019s what to watch when the largest U.S. exporter reports earnings before the market opens\u00a0Wednesday, followed a day later by its European rival.BY THE NUMBERS:\u00a0Boeing has been on a roll. The world\u2019s No. 1 plane maker by deliveries\u00a0has beaten expectations with the past three reports after its rare charge-driven loss in last year\u2019s June quarter. Analysts expect another beat-and-raise when it reports before the market\u2019s open\u00a0Wednesday, with projected profit of $1.54 billion and earnings per share of $2.31 following the year-ago $280 million deficit, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Sales are expected to slide 7% to $23.1 billion on a previously-flagged decline in commercial and military jet deliveries.Airbus has struggled to meet its jetliner delivery targets. The Toulouse, France-based company\u2019s closely watched adjusted earnings should fall to \u20ac833 million ($970 million) from \u20ac1.18 billion and earnings per share decline to \u20ac0.83 from \u20ac1.76.\u00a0Sales are expected to edge down to \u20ac16.2 billion from \u20ac16.6 billion.FIGHT(ER) CLUB: Boeing\u2019s combat jet outlook bounced off the ropes with a series of overseas orders over the past year, but it is back in a corner. The decision to sue Bombardier Inc. over alleged price dumping led Canada to suspend sales talks. Like peers, it faces uncertainty over the path and pace of Middle East deals, given Qatar-related unrest. Airbus faces the embarrassing decision by Austria to retire Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets early. But the European plane maker\u2019s future jet fighter ambitions were boosted when France and Germany this month said they were looking to develop a new aircraft in tandem.BRIDGE A WIDE GAP: Airline buyers, still interested in smaller planes, have had little appetite for well over a year for long-range airliners, fueling anxiety that jet makers may have to revisit production rates of their larger aircraft. Boeing last week added four 777 orders from an unidentified buyer to its backlog, having sold four of the big long-range planes to             United Continental Holdings Inc.       Still, analysts expect 777 production rates, already curtailed several times, may still have to be trimmed. Airbus had negative net orders for its A330 widebody in the first half after adjusting for cancellations, even after outlining plans to boost output.HOW ARE YOU PAYING? Airlines and lessors need to raise around $125 billion to fund commercial aircraft deliveries this year, rising to an estimated $175 billion by the end of the decade. New lenders, notably from Asia, have kept the market flush even as export credit support slammed shut, but an industry downturn or leasing company blowup could change that. Boeing has been quietly cultivating new sources backed by private insurers, and both plane makers may need more of the same to avoid falling back on additional customer financing. Airbus has been struggling to get European export credit agencies to open up taps that were closed off amid a probe into wrongdoing into prior financing applications.DIGITAL SNAP: Both companies rolled out high-profile pushes into servicing aircraft and connecting them to the Internet of Things, viewed as a more profitable business than production. Having outlined the potential, Airbus and Boeing still have to detail how they will measure the progress and success of an endeavor that risks antagonizing some of their own largest suppliers.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-and-airbus-earnings-what-to-watch-1500987602", "keywords": [" aircraft makers,earnings preview, plane makers,Boeing,BA,Airbus SE,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 08:54:00", "news_title": "IPO Backed by Morgan Stanley and One of Asia\u2019s Richest Men Gets Denied", "content": "Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange has rejected the application for a potentially multimillion-dollar listing involving one of Asia\u2019s richest men, as the city\u2014a hot spot for initial public offerings\u2014has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny.The exchange in June sent back the IPO application of AMTD Strategic Capital Group, which was filed the previous month, deeming it to be \u201csubstantially incomplete\u201d without elaborating on what it found lacking, according to a list posted on its website.The commercial-insurance brokerage firm was seeking to potentially raise about $200 million, according to reports. AMTD Strategic Capital is majority owned by AMTD Group, an Asian financial firm founded in 2003 whose other businesses include an investment bank. Among the group\u2019s owners are             CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.        0001 0.30%      , the Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by billionaire       Li Ka-shing,        and             Morgan Stanley\u2019s        MS -0.84%       private-equity arm.Such rejections are rare in Hong Kong: This was only the sixth time in four years that it has occurred, according to exchange data.AMTD and CK Hutchison didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.A spokesman for the exchange operator,             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.        0388 0.46%      , didn\u2019t offer any details beyond what it had posted online.In recent years, Hong Kong has been trying to strike a balance with its regulatory efforts as questions about the effectiveness of such measures have persisted. Its exchange operator earlier this year revived a debate over whether it should allow listings of companies with dual-class shareholding structures, a proposal the city\u2019s securities regulator shot down in 2015. Hong Kong lost the $25 billion listing of Chinese e-commerce titanAlibaba Group Holding Ltd.       to New York in 2014 in part because it wouldn\u2019t permit companies with that structure to list shares.Hong Kong IPOs have been dominated for some time by financial companies, contributing to the market\u2019s generation of more money than any other in 2015 and 2016, according to Dealogic data. However, so far this year the city has dropped to third, with IPOs valued at a collective $8.4 billion of IPOs. By comparison, $20.9 billion has been raised in New York and $11 billion in Shanghai.The Hong Kong exchange\u2019s statement on AMTD\u2019s thwarted IPO emerged in the wake of a selloff late last month of more than a dozen small-capitalization companies listed on the city\u2019s Growth Enterprise Market, home to many so-called penny stocks that trade for less than one Hong Kong dollar (13 U.S. cents). Some shares tumbled more than 90%.What caused the plunge remains unclear. However, in a speech earlier this month, the chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission said that the regulator had had a \u201cfundamental rethink\u201d about how it polices the markets and that it would take a more proactive approach to market intervention.       Ashley Alder       cited the reputational damage done by an \u201caccumulation of serious governance and misconduct issues,\u201d including the small-cap crash.In response,       Charles Li,        the exchange operator\u2019s CEO, wrote in a blog posting Sunday that officials should balance the desire for tougher regulation with preserving smooth operation of the market at large. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth getting a few extra dollars in revenue and allowing bad actors onto our market, which hurts the overall market reputation and diminishes our business,\u201d he wrote.There have also been questions about the sharing of regulatory responsibility between the exchange and the SFC. In his posting, Mr. Li said ensuring a violation-free market, even with the parallel work of the SFC, would be \u201cvery difficult.\u201dThe SFC didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.To be sure, sizable IPOs continue to be launched in Hong Kong and a flurry of activity is expected toward the end of 2017\u2014particularly among companies whose financial years ended in June, said a person familiar with the matter.Last week, Zhongyuan Bank Co. became the former British colony\u2019s third billion-dollar IPO of the year, with the large regional Chinese commercial lender raising some US$1.04 billion.Write to Ese Erheriene at ese.erheriene@wsj.com and Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ipo-backed-by-morgan-stanley-and-one-of-asias-richest-men-gets-denied-1500987244", "keywords": [" exchange,hong kong, ipo,pe exits, regulator, rules li ka-shing, tycoon,Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing,0388.HK,AMTD Strategic Capital Group,CK Hutchison Holdings,0001.HK,HK:0001,Morgan Stanley,MS,AMTD Group Company,Zhongyuan Bank,HK:1216,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,real estate,construction,financial services,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 08:31:00", "news_title": "Toyota Nears Technological Breakthrough in Electric-Car Batteries ", "content": "TOKYO\u2014            Toyota Motor Corp.

CHTR 0.22%       is investing in the Dolan family\u2019s data and television analytics company, forming a partnership to help the cable company harness the information from its millions of set-top boxes to better target local TV advertising.Charter, the second-largest cable operator in the U.S., is also investing an undisclosed amount in 605, which was formed after Dolan Family Ventures purchased Analytics Media Group in November.605, which already has access to set-top box data from 40 million households, will also have access to anonymized and aggregated data from Charter\u2019s set-top boxes. Data from set-top box logs combined with other licensed data sets allow 605 to help advertisers target audiences more narrowly than on broad age and gender categories, while also helping networks and TV distributors better leverage their ad inventory.The \u201cstrategic data partnership\u201d will help Charter better understand its audience and use its own data to sell TV commercials to local ad buyers.

The system \u201cfinally makes the data available to the masses of advertisers,\u201d he said.Refined ad targeting is considered somewhat of a Holy Grail in TV, with the thinking being that better targeting can translate to more premium ad rates. The advantage of set-top box data is that it reflects actual viewing, rather than extrapolating TV viewership estimates from a sample panel of U.S. households.In addition to helping find target audiences, 605 can also help brands test the effectiveness of different versions of a commercial when shown to similar audiences. Or, a network can derive more insights on who watches its shows and the types of promotional spots that best help lure a viewer back to watch the next episode of a show. Clients don\u2019t execute ad buys through 605.Terms of Charter\u2019s investment in 605 weren\u2019t disclosed, but Mr. Kline said it was a \u201csignificant investment\u201d and a \u201clarge commitment.\u201dMr. Kline and Charter\u2019s       James Blackley,        who runs engineering and information technology, will join 605\u2019s board, sitting alongside       Ms. Dolan       and             Madison Square Garden Co.

The \u201cC3\u201d and \u201cC7\u201d standard metrics (which refer to live and time-shifted viewing within three and seven days after a show aired) now include audiences from a range of digital platforms favored by mobile viewers, as Nielsen tries to modernize the definition of a \u201cTV\u201d rating. There\u2019s a slight caveat in that the rating will only include YouTube and Hulu TV programming in which the ads are the same as those that aired on TV. Digital viewing where the ads differ are captured in a separate \u201ctotal audience\u201d number that isn\u2019t used \u201cfor trade,\u201d but more for marketing purposes and for ad buyers to do their planning. Speaking of Hulu: The streaming company announced yesterday it has appointed Google veteran Kelly Campbell as its chief marketing officer.Much like the hive of media M&A activity recently, retail consolidation is heating up too. Luxury-fashion company Michael Kors has agreed to buy high-end shoe maker Jimmy Choo for $1.17 billion, The Wall Street Journal reports. Michael Kors has been under pressure from deep discounting in the luxury handbag industry and recently announced plans to close up to 125 of its retail stores. Jimmy Choo, which has also been struggling to grow sales and retain its position as a status symbol, was put on the block by owner JAB Holding in April. From a marketing perspective, despite their recent woes, both brands still have equity among consumers, but it remains to be seen whether a combination of the two will get cash registers ringing again.How\u2019s this for some drama? Snopes, the internet rumor debunking website, has launched a crowdfunding page asking for readers\u2019 financial support because it claims Proper Media, the vendor it uses for web hosting and to run ads on the site, has been withholding its revenue \u201cfor the last several months,\u201d the New York Times reports. Not only that, but one of the site\u2019s founders, David Mikkelson, says Proper Media won\u2019t relinquish control of the site, meaning Snopes can\u2019t even switch to a new vendor. Proper Media disputes that claim and says Mr. Mikkelson should be fired because of \u201cwasteful spending,\u201d according to the report. It gets more complicated: Proper Media says it isn\u2019t a vendor, but an owner of Snopes parent Bardav because Mr. Mikkelson\u2019s ex-wife sold her 50% share of the company to Proper Media\u2019s officers last year. Proper Media says one of its officers is supposed to sit on Bardav\u2019s board, but Mr. Mikkelson is having none of it. Stay tuned. The two parties, who are suing each other, are due to appear at a court hearing next week. Meanwhile, in the 22 hours since the GoFundMe campaign was launched, Snopes has raised more than $470,000.Ascential, the owner of the Cannes Lions advertising festival, posted a 7% lift in revenue from the year-earlier period to \u00a3222 million ($289 million) in the six months ended June 30.

Sales volumes were flat, after 4% growth in the first quarter.Back in April, when the company unveiled new targets to fend off PPG, management said \u201csignificant growth momentum\u201d would push operating profit \u20ac100 million higher this year. It is sticking to this target even though growth momentum is manifestly lacking. A hiring freeze is expected to pick up the slack.The more Akzo Nobel relies on cost-cutting, rather than underlying growth, to prop up its stand-alone strategy, the more it undermines its defense against PPG, which insinuated that the U.S. group would ax more jobs.Akzo Nobel\u2019s respected Chief Executive       Ton B\u00fcchner,        who guided the company through the takeover situation, resigned last week for health reasons; he also took leave of absence in 2012 due to poor health. His departure relieves him from having to scythe his way to increasingly unrealistic targets.The company\u2019s growth deficit also reinforces the strategic rationale for consolidation in the paint industry. PPG could resurrect its bid any time from December, when the mandatory cooling-off period expires. More likely is after next April, when Akzo Nobel Chairman       Antony Burgmans       retires. Activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which raised its stake to almost 10% after the PPG bid went away, remains on the war path for change.Akzo Nobel shares look like a one-way bet.

A successful bond exchange would put the bank a big step closer to securing the Lone Star deal.Novo Banco has offered to swap all of its senior bonds\u2014worth \u20ac8.3 billion in face value\u2014mostly at a substantial discount to par. The exchange includes billions of euros in zero-coupon notes that were issued at a deep discount in the months before Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo failed and bought by offshore companies that helped prop up the bank for years.As a sweetener, bondholders are being offered three-to-five-year fixed-term deposits for the proceeds from the exchanged bonds to boost their overall return. The fixed-term rates haven\u2019t been announced yet.The bond offer must raise at least \u20ac500 million as a condition of the Lone Star takeover.Novo Banco agreed earlier in 2017 to hand a 75% stake to Lone Star in exchange for a \u20ac1 billion capital injection. It is currently owned by a bank resolution fund that is mostly funded by a government loan.If the deal with Lone Star fails and it doesn\u2019t get the \u20ac1 billion capital injection that comes with it, Novo Banco has said it will be unable to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements and operate as a going concern. That means authorities could decide to resolve the bank, it says.Novo Banco was created after Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo collapsed in the summer of 2014 with heavy losses and a tangle of loans and investments in a broader group of Esp\u00edrito Santo companies.While Novo Banco was supposed to be a \u201cgood bank\u201d housing deposits and good loans from the defunct lender, and ready for a quick sale, its credit portfolio showed signs of serious strain immediately. That hurt its attractiveness to buyers and led the country\u2019s central bank to transfer \u20ac2 billion in senior debt off Novo Banco\u2019s balance sheet in December 2015 to boost its capital ratios. Bondholders including Pimco and             BlackRock Inc.       cried foul and sued.Pimco owns some of the bonds that are part of Tuesday\u2019s exchange offer. In May, the investment management firm and other bondholders wrote to the Portuguese central bank offering to skip the bond swap and discuss buying the bank.However, the exchange offer is expected to go ahead, as Pimco and others have been in settlement talks with Portuguese authorities about the \u20ac2 billion in transferred bonds.Novo Banco said the offer is based on market prices and is slightly above the average prices of 2016.

The filings aren\u2019t public yet.Taking those steps\u00a0could\u00a0put Varo\u2014which\u00a0now\u00a0partners with banks to provide services for its mobile banking application\u2014on the path to becoming a full-fledged, regulated\u00a0bank. That means it would\u00a0take deposits, pay interest, make loans in any state, and issue cards, all through smartphone apps.Unlike internet banks of the dot-com era, and in contrast to a wave of startup \u201cchallenger banks\u201d in Europe, fintech firms such as             LendingClub Corp.       and             PayPal Holdings Inc.,       have sought to avoid becoming U.S. banks themselves. They bill themselves as pure technology companies or online marketplaces for financial services.The reluctance has come both from regulators, who have in recent years been hesitant to experiment with new banking models, and from startups themselves, who fear the risks and costs of operating a bank. Investors generally value tech firms more highly than banks.But that is starting to change. Social Finance Inc., known as SoFi, is seeking to become a Utah industrial bank. A group of Silicon Valley venture-capital firms recently bought stakes in a New Jersey bank, CRB Group Inc., that partners with fintech software firms.Varo is going a step further, seeking a national banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as the ability to take deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Varo was founded in 2015, and initially has partnered with banks, including             The Bancorp Inc.,       to provide deposits and lending services.But Chief Executive and co-founder       Colin Walsh,        a veteran of Wells Fargo & Co. and             American Express Co.      , said that recent discussions with regulators led Varo to accelerate its plans and apply for its own charter now, before it has fully launched its services.Though new bank charters have been rare since the financial crisis, regulators say they are eager to encourage new entrants. Last week, acting OCC head       Keith Noreika       said \u201cthe federal banking system [needs] to be more inclusive,\u201d and that the agency was having discussions with interested firms.The approval process typically takes at least a couple of months, and will involve intensive review of the company\u2019s plans and financial condition.Becoming a bank makes Varo a more complex investment. Warburg Pincus, the private-equity firm that counts former U.S. Treasury Secretary       Timothy Geithner       as its president, can\u2019t own more than 24.9% of the bank to avoid being regulated as a bank holding company.So Varo, which raised over $27 million from Warburg last year, will seek to raise $160 million more from new investors to reduce Warburg\u2019s stake and to provide the bank with a capital base, Mr. Walsh said.Mr. Walsh said that Varo\u2019s aim is to provide a suite of app-based tools for customers\u2019 financial health, such as making a model of future cash flow and suggesting when to move money from checking to savings, pay off a credit card, take out small loans, or invest more in the market.\u201cWe want to be a full-service bank,\u201d he said.Varo Bank will be based in Utah, where it will also have a call center for customers.

Jeff Davis,        a Pentagon spokesman, said a Chinese J-10 jet fighter rapidly approached under the U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane, slowed down and then flew in front of the American pilot, triggering the plane\u2019s collision alarm system and forcing it to take evasive action.The Chinese plane came within 300 feet of the U.S. plane, which was flying in international airspace, according to another defense official.Capt.

China deploys a fierce array of censorship tools and methods\u2014throttling bandwidth, filtering words and images, using \u201cdeep packet inspection technology\u201d and employing armies of human censors and trolls\u2014to keep its Great Firewall in place. The one crack is a technology called VPN, or virtual private network, that circumvents the controls by connecting users to servers outside China.Now that is in doubt.Authorities have shut dozens of VPNs this year. This month, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology denied a Bloomberg report that it had ordered telecom carriers to bar all personal VPNs, such as those used by many small and midsize businesses. The ministry promised \u201cnormal operations\u201d for multinationals connecting to the global internet. Yet at least one carrier, Guangzhou Huoyun Information Technology Ltd., pulled foreign VPNs after receiving a letter ordering it to do so from the Ministry of Public Security, which runs the police forces.\u201cPlease give this high priority,\u201d the letter says.Could China, digitally speaking, go dark? For those looking for clues to China\u2019s political direction, the VPN is a good place to start.President Xi Jinping has taken Chinese politics back to pre-Internet days of Maoist orthodoxy, when the country sealed itself off from the global economy. His cardinal principle is \u201cinternet sovereignty.\u201d The question is whether his administration is ready to take that all the way to absolute digital control.\u201cThere\u2019s no question there is a camp that wants to block China off from the world,\u201d says       Duncan Clark,        a former             Morgan Stanley                   tech analyst and author of \u201cAlibaba: The House That Jack Built,\u201d an insider account of China\u2019s e-commerce revolution. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a camp that wants to sell the bricks to do it.\u201dTo be clear: Without VPNs, business in China takes a huge knock.Companies around the world are increasingly moving operations to the cloud, but that is hard to implement if VPN problems interfere with access. Smaller businesses rely on regular internet access for email and crucial business information. Chinese academics and researchers would be lost without Google Scholar, blocked with the rest of Google.In a recent member survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, four of five companies said blocks on sites like Google, Facebook and Twitter hurt their businesses.The American pro-democracy group Freedom House named China the worst abuser of internet freedoms of the 65 countries it ranked.\u2018There\u2019s no question there is a camp that wants to block China off from the world. And there\u2019s a camp that wants to sell the bricks to do it.\u2019The impact is practical as well as political. In a country that sets just about every record for internet usage\u2014730 million connections, at last count, and 460 million online shoppers\u2014line speeds rank 91st in the world, dramatically slowed down by blocks and filters. That ranking is according to the government-run China Daily. South Korea, which tops the list, is three times as fast.Here\u2019s the real shock: at a moment when China is making big bets on the Internet of Things, cloud computing, robotics and driverless cars, there are serious questions about whether the country will continue to allow its most innovative minds to communicate easily online with German scientists, or American academics, or Japanese engineers.Until now, access to VPNs has kept the Great Firewall from being too bothersome for China\u2019s elites. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of annoying,\u201d says       David Li,        a founder of the Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab, a startup incubator in a city that has become the technology-hardware capital of the world.The VPN, in other words, is a political safety valve. Remove it, and annoyance might turn to frustration, and frustration to anger. Wait then for an explosion.But in this hypersensitive political year\u2014a party congress crucial to Mr. Xi\u2019s political ambitions is coming this fall\u2014it is becoming apparent that the authorities are ready to take such risks.In cracking down hard on foreign movies and live-streaming apps in recent months, internet censors aren\u2019t just denying the public its favorite Korean soaps and the antics of figures like \u201cGourmet Sister Feng,\u201d who gobbles down live goldfish and lightbulbs. They are challenging the tolerance of millions of individuals for a censorship regime that has until now seemed far removed from the concerns of everyday life.Ban VPNs and almost everybody is a dissident. It would be \u201cone control too far for the creative, academic, scientific and business communities,\u201d says       James McGregor,        chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.That is why a blanket prohibition is unlikely.

Like many other office companies, it is being hurt by concerns over new supply and slowing rent and occupancy growth.Three other REITs besides SL Green had their compensation rejected by investors in the nonbinding say-on-pay votes, a large number given that there were only 29 no votes in the entire corporate world, according to       Jeremy Banoff,        a senior managing director with FPL Associates LP, a compensation-consulting firm that focuses on the real-estate industry.The other three REITs were             Whitestone REIT,       of Houston, and             Senior Housing Properties Trust                   and             Hospitality Properties Trust,       both of Newton, Mass. Executives of those three companies didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.The high number of rejections was surprising given that REITs in general do better than other companies in aligning compensation plans with investors, according to a recent FPL report. Just under 90% of REITs tie a large percent of compensation to total shareholder return, the report said. In the rest of the corporate world about 57% of companies do this, the report said.Overall, REITs are \u201cahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Banoff said.Yet in the past two years, SL Green eked out relatively slim victories on say-on-pay votes. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a longtime critic of SL Green\u2019s pay, said in a report that a no vote was warranted this year \u201cin light of the [compensation] committee\u2019s poor responsiveness to shareholder concerns following multiple consecutive years for low say-on-pay support.\u201dThis year, only 43% of SL Green\u2019s investors supported the company\u2019s compensation. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the chairman of SL Green\u2019s compensation committee,       John Alschuler Jr.      , said management was disappointed by the outcome and takes the opinion of its shareholders very seriously. But he also criticized the ISS report, calling parts of it \u201cvacuous intellectually.\u201dMr. Alschuler said Mr. Holliday\u2019s increase in base salary amounted to $300,000, which he described as a \u201crounding error\u201d given the size of the chief executive\u2019s total pay package.Partly because of SL Green\u2019s anemic share price, Mr. Holliday\u2019s total compensation in 2016 was 24.8% less than his 2015 package. Mr. Alschuler said his committee made changes in the 2016 plan that made it simpler, clearer and more performance-based than previous plans.Mr. Alschuler said Mr. Holliday asked for the higher base salary because much more of his compensation is now at risk. \u201cWe thought that was fair,\u201d he said.But Mr. Holliday\u2019s total compensation is more than triple the median remuneration of the largest 100 public REITs as calculated by FPL. His base salary increase gave him the second-highest base salary in the REIT industry.Critics also called attention to SL Green\u2019s award to Mr. Holliday of options worth more than $2 million, which he will automatically receive after one more year of employment.Mr. Alschuler said that SL Green is a \u201cfrugal company,\u201d given that its total overhead costs are low compared with comparable REITs. \u201cWhat ISS is saying is: You\u2019re a really frugal company, but we don\u2019t like how you\u2019re frugal.\u201dMr. Alschuler said some shareholders may have voted no because they were concerned Mr. Holliday and SL Green President       Andrew Mathias       were allowed to buy stakes in the company\u2019s high-profile development at One Vanderbilt in Midtown Manhattan. Some investors, he said, wrongly believe that might give Messrs. Holliday and Mathias incentives to favor One Vanderbilt over other office buildings SL Green owns.Mr. Alschuler said that concern isn\u2019t valid partly because the two executives also own a \u201cvery significant amount\u201d of stock in the whole company. Also, given the quality difference between One Vanderbilt and other buildings, the company couldn\u2019t face a situation where a tenant was deciding between the two.\u201cThere are no car buyers out there saying, should I buy a Bentley or a Chevy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different products designed for different price points.\u201dAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'At SL Green, a Rebuke Over Pay.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/office-giant-smacked-down-over-giant-pay-package-1500980402", "keywords": ["ceo pay,corporate governance,executive pay,real estate investment trusts,reit pay,reits,shareholder services,SL Green Realty,SLG,Marc Holliday,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,real estate,construction,financial services,industrial,office reits,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 07:00:00", "news_title": "America\u2019s Hottest Properties: Data Centers and Cell Towers ", "content": "E-commerce has been blamed for the struggles of retail real estate, but is proving to be a boon for owners of data centers and cell towers.As more people consume digital content and make purchases online, landlords and owners of data centers and cell towers that house cables and beam data to smartphones are looking to expand faster.Cell-tower operator REIT Crown Castle International Corp. on July 18 said it is making a $7.1 billion acquisition of Lightower Fiber Networks, a purchase that would double its fiber-optic footprint and expand its reach to Northeast markets.Data center owner and operator             Digital Realty Trust Inc.       said in June it would acquire competitor             DuPont Fabros Technology Inc.       in an all-stock deal valued at $7.6 billion. San Francisco-based Digital Realty said the transaction will strengthen its existing portfolio in Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley.The moves show how technology is creating numerous winners in real estate even as it disrupts traditional industries such as retailing. While mall owners face growing pressure from the rise of e-commerce, for example, the increase in web activity is fueling demand for wireless infrastructure and racks of telecommunication equipment that need to be stored somewhere.\u201cTechnology innovation has impacted a lot of the real-estate asset classes. Just look at today versus five years ago,\u201d said       Andrew Power,        chief financial officer of Digital Realty, who pointed to the disruption Airbnb Inc. has wrought on the hotel industry.Information technology firms and cloud-service companies such as Amazon Inc. and             Facebook                   are driving demand for data centers, while the growth of supply of data centers has been slow to catch up, he said.All of that is being reflected in share prices. Total returns from data centers were 22% in the first half of this year, up from the 4.9% return of all equity REITs, according to data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and the 8.8% return for the S&P 500-stock index.Total returns from infrastructure REITs, which include cell towers, were 22% over the same period.\u201cData centers are truly a growth real-estate sector. We\u2019re all using these electronic file cabinets,\u201d said       Joel Beam,        managing director and senior portfolio manager of real-estate strategies at asset management firm Salient Partners LP, which had increased its investments in data centers in recent months.Houston-based Crown Castle is focused on providing infrastructure to lease to wireless carriers such as             Verizon,AT&T                   and             T-Mobile                   in urban areas. Its latest all-cash deal is its biggest to date.Cell towers are the main platform of the digital economy, said Crown Castle Chief Executive       Jay Brown.\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to railroad tracks and toll roads,\u201d he said.Yet there are questions over how quickly advances in technology could shrink the amount of space necessary for storage and transmission of data, and whether there could be alternative uses for the highly specialized real estate. Data centers are typically windowless buildings with thick walls and other rigid infrastructure to protect from natural disasters. They are also huge consumers of power.\u201cYou wonder if all this stuff could eventually be stored on the head of a pin. I\u2019m not a tech expert,\u201d Mr. Beam said.Many real-estate investors say they typically go through a longer learning curve to understand the business of data centers and whether there are technology risks to this type of real estate.Executives at these REITs said they are fielding more queries about the possibility that advances in technology could make them obsolete, how long leases typically are\u2014around 10 to 15 years\u2014and whether there are high barriers to entry.\u201cOne of the biggest myths is that you can just set up a facility and expect customers to come,\u201d said Gary Wojtaszek, chief executive of CyrusOne, a Dallas-based data center REIT. It takes time to build relationships with customers, he said, adding there are both build-to-suit and speculative construction of data centers.Customer servers have been shrinking but there are more innovations and apps being created, data center landlords said.\u201cData growth has been exponential and more than offset the efficiencies that the cloud has enabled,\u201d said Laurel Durkay, associate portfolio manager of real-estate securities at asset manager Cohen & Steers. She expects data centers to see an annual growth in demand of 10% to 20% in the next five years.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see a world where a data center will be replaced by an iPhone,\u201d Digital Realty\u2019s Mr. Power said.Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-hottest-properties-data-centers-and-cell-towers-1500980401", "keywords": ["acquisitions,cell towers,data,data centers,information technology,internet,malls,real estate,real estate investment trusts,retail,smartphones,technology,telcommunications,wireless communication,Lightower Fiber Networks,Digital Realty Trust,DLR,Dupont Fabros Technology,DFT,National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts,REIT Crown Castle International,Gary Wojtaszek,Laurel Durkay,ownership changes,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,political,general news,property,sciences,humanities,telecommunications,computers,consumer electronics,networking,telecommunications equipment,mobile communications devices,personal electronics,wholesale,etailing,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,mobile telecommunications,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,computer services,business,consumer services,broadband equipment,cellular,mobile phones,construction,data warehousing,e-commerce,fiber optic equipment,financial services,handheld electronic devices,industrial,office reits,online service providers,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 07:00:00", "news_title": "Nielsen Adds YouTube and Hulu Skinny Bundles to Traditional TV Rating ", "content": "Nielsen said it has begun counting viewership on new streaming TV services offered by Hulu and YouTube toward the official ratings for shows, its latest step to modernize measurement standards as digital consumption increases.The standard ratings metrics for TV networks -- used as currencies in dealings with advertisers -- are \u201cC3\u201d and \u201cC7,\u201d referring to live and time-shifted viewing of programming within three and seven days of the initial telecast, respectively.Those metrics will now include viewing across desktops and mobile devices from \u201cskinny bundles\u201d offered by Hulu and YouTube -- slimmed-down packages of cable channels that stream live for a monthly fee, acting as a replacement for traditional cable service.Nielsen\u2019s ratings had already included digital viewing from Sling TV and             Sony\u2019s       PlayStation Vue, as well as TV apps such as \u201cCBS All Access.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time we see major digital distribution platforms like Hulu and YouTube coming into the TV ratings,\u201d said       Megan Clarken,        president of product leadership at Nielsen.\u201cWe started investing in this capability three years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are now more platforms that are becoming available for live streaming.\u201dThe Nielsen TV rating will only include Hulu and YouTube TV programming in which the ads that appear on digital platforms are the same as those that air on live TV.Nielsen calculates traditional TV ratings based on data gathered from a panel of thousands of households. But measuring viewing on mobile devices required new technology and partnerships with content providers and distributors.To be able to measure audiences across devices and streaming platforms, Nielsen has had to get media companies and streaming platforms to install software that reports viewing data across devices.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the Total Audience framework for the past three years, and it\u2019s been a process of building the platforms and distributing software,\u201d said Ms. Clarken.For TV networks, keeping the TV rating updated is vital, as it is the basis for their sale of commercial space to advertisers. The TV rating still leaves out other digital, on-demand viewing -- including programming where the digital ads differ from the TV ads. Nielsen captures that viewing in a separate \u201cTotal Audience\u201d metric that blends TV and digital viewing more holistically.Unlike C3 and C7, Total Audience products are not used \u201cfor trade,\u201d said Ms. Clarken. Rather, networks might use the viewing data to tout their audience size, and advertisers might use the metric to plan their ad distribution.Google\u2019s YouTube TV launched a few months ago, with a $35-a-month subscription for more than 50 live channels.

Silicon Valley startup Convoy is announcing it has raised $62 million in a funding round led by accelerator Y Combinator, bolstering earlier support from funds backed by       Bill Gates       and Barry Diller, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Erica E. Phillips writes, and providing money for the company to take its business model national. That would help Convoy pull away from the pack of startups that are looking to push into a sprawling U.S. freight transportation management market that some believe is ripe for digital disruption. Investors are buying that argument: Freight-booking startup Transfix this month raised $42 million, and Texas-based uShip in February received a $25 million investment from logistics giant DB Schenker. The startups don\u2019t have the scale to buy capacity at a discount to match existing freight brokers, but the new funding signals that the companies are in a hurry to get bigger.Foxconn Technology                   Group may put its new factory strategy into motion as soon as this week. The manufacturer of             Apple Inc.       is nearing a decision to invest in Wisconsin, the WSJ\u2019s Yoko Kubota and Takashi Mochizuki report, and is also looking at placing a plant in the Detroit area. The Taiwan-based contract manufacturing giant has said it is looking at seven states in the U.S., where it would invest $10 billion or more to make flat-panel screens and related equipment. The investment would be the latest by Asian manufacturers in the U.S. as President       Donald Trump       seeks to revive manufacturing in the country, and it could be a boon to areas in the Midwest that have lost factory jobs in recent years. An agreement would make Wisconsin an important node in global electronics supply chains, and authorities there say it would also push the state to boost education in the automation and robotics arenas that are prominent in Foxconn\u2019s manufacturing.South Korea\u2019s             Samsung Electronics Co.       Ltd. is extending its business into an unlikely new area. The company best known for its smartphones and televisions is moving into the medical field with sales of a lower-price version of the             Johnson & Johnson\u2019s       rheumatoid-arthritis drug Remicade, the WSJ\u2019s Timothy W. Martin and Jonathan D. Rockoff report. The move will boost Samsung\u2019s attempt to diversify beyond electronics and add new wrinkles to global pharmaceutical supply chains. The group\u2019s new biotechnology company plans to make near replicas of so-called branded biologic drugs, or \u201cbiosimilars,\u201d that are sold more cheaply than brand-name treatments. The new drug will be sold through             Merck                   & Co.\u2019s U.S. sales team. Pharmaceutical shipping has been growing in recent years, with new, sensitive drugs moving through highly-tailored logistics channels that include special handling and refrigeration. Cheaper alternative pharmaceuticals may lower the value of the shipments, but they also may push more goods through the medical distribution markets.A surge in international airfreight shipping this year isn\u2019t doing much to lift one of the biggest gateways in the U.S. over the long term. Rising competition from other airports and major shifts in the direction of imported goods has moved the business away from New York City\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, the WSJ\u2019s Melanie Grayce West writes, with a new report showing that JFK\u2019s cargo traffic has fallen by more than 20% in the past decade. That raises important questions over investment at an airport researchers say has seen employment tied to air-cargo fall by more than a quarter since 2004. The airport has invested about $10 million in infrastructure development in recent years, but analysts say bigger trends\u2014including growing trade from Asia and spreading networks by international carriers to other U.S. cities\u2014have moved attention from the once-iconic gateway. That leaves the airport weighing how much to invest if the business is in a structural decline.\u2018You can have the best app in the world but unless you can offer a significant amount of volume to the carriers you work with, you\u2019re not going to be able to get as good of rates with those carriers.\u2019Updated International Monetary Fund forecast for global trade growth in 2017, up from 3.8% forecast growth in April.Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell in June and prices jumped as strong demand overwhelmed a pinched supply.

On Monday, President Trump made a last-minute pitch to GOP senators to vote Tuesday to begin debate on a sweeping health-care law, adding to the pressures facing congressional Republicans at a critical moment. An unusually large number of GOP senators have signaled resistance to taking even the first procedural step to begin debate on overturning the Affordable Care Act. More than half a dozen have said they would block debate on different versions of the health-care bill, though it remains up in the air exactly how many may vote no. Late last night the ailing Sen. John McCain added to the drama by announcing that he would return to Washington to take part in today\u2019s scheduled vote to proceed with the consideration of legislation. The vote is pivotal in either derailing the GOP\u2019s health-care ambitions or inching them closer to reviving a bill that is still on shaky ground.China is girding for a crisis across its border with North Korea, bolstering its defenses along the 880-mile border and realigning forces in surrounding regions. The preparations coincide with repeated warnings by President Trump that he is weighing military action to halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program. Recent Chinese measures include establishing a new border-defense brigade and 24-hour video surveillance of the mountainous border, backed by aerial drones. Although technically allied with Pyongyang, Beijing wouldn\u2019t necessarily defend its regime but is determined to prevent a flood of North Koreans from entering northeastern China. Beijing also appears to be enhancing its capability to seize North Korean nuclear sites and occupy a swath of the country\u2019s northern territory if U.S. or South Korean forces start to advance toward the Chinese border.Google generates a lot of clicks. But they aren\u2019t free\u2014nor always cheap. Second-quarter results from parent company Alphabet were a good reminder of both. Google showed an unprecedented ability to generate economic activity out of its massive internet search engine. Paid clicks in the quarter surged 52% from a year earlier, which helped boost second-quarter revenue 21% to $26.01 billion. But that growth comes at a cost\u2014$5.1 billion in this case. That is what Google spent for the quarter in traffic acquisition, also a record. Alphabet said its fastest-growing segments\u2014mobile and YouTube advertising\u2014are less lucrative than desktop ads.

Potential entrants would only have to show proof of citizenship in their own country and verify in some way that U.S. authorities could corroborate that they have never been convicted of a crime.\u201d Madelyn Carter of Texas wrote: \u201cI hope, in this case, the victims who did not perish will recover and tell the police their stories (though that may be difficult since they may think if they tell the truth they\u2019ll be deported or go to prison) so we can better understand the push factors that are leading immigrants out of Latin America as well as the tactics of smugglers. Smuggling is a crime against the U.S., yes, but instead of building a wall that smugglers will still find a way through, we must figure out a better way to receive immigrants so stories like this never happen again.\u201d And Jim Hogan of Montana shared: \u201cSadly, such incidents are inevitable and will continue until Congress approves a complete overhaul of our immigration laws. It is highly unlikely that the current Congress will do so, given its focus on health care, tax reform and regulatory reform. One can only hope that once those issues are addressed a thorough immigration-reform bill can be prioritized. Such a bill, if drafted properly, could not only save lives, but also positively impact U.S. economic growth.\u201dThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.

LPL -1.52%       said it would invest an additional 7.8 trillion won ($7 billion) to churn out more smaller-size organic light-emitting-diode display panels used largely in premium smartphones, in a bid to challenge             Samsung                         Display\u2019s dominance in the market.Seoul-based LG Display has already said it would invest $6.5 billion in OLED production at its two factories in South Korea.The global OLED market is expected to reach $25.2 billion this year, according to research firm         IHS Markit,       up 63% from last year.Most of that growth is concentrated in smaller-size OLED panels, a sector dominated by         Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s       display-making affiliate, Samsung Display, which holds 97.1% market share by revenue.While LG Display holds a monopoly in the market for large-size OLED panels used in televisions, the company has stuck to older liquid-crystal display technology for smaller devices such as smartphones.The bulk of smartphones use LCD displays, but premium smartphones are switching to OLED, including         Apple Inc.,which will use OLED screens for its coming iPhone 8. That shift has pushed LG Display to jump into the fray for smaller-size OLEDs.OLED displays are thinner and more flexible, allowing phone makers to sell devices that are curved and sleeker in appearance.Advocates of the technology say OLED also offers better color contrast and energy efficiency.LG Display said Tuesday that its new OLED investment would be divided between large- and smaller-size OLED displays at its factory in Paju, near South Korea\u2019s border with North Korea.About two-thirds of the investment, or $4.5 billion, will go into the production of smaller-size OLEDs, while the remainder will be invested in large-size OLEDs.In addition to its investment in its home country, LG Display said it would start producing large-size OLEDs at its facility in Guangzhou, China, a plant previously used solely to make LCDs for televisions. The company didn\u2019t confirm the size of its investment in Guangzhou.Tuesday\u2019s announcement came after the company said it earned $720.5 million in operating profit for the three months ended June 30, a 22% decline from the previous quarter.The company earned $5.9 billion in revenue for the same period, a 6.1% slip from the previous three months.Write to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'LG Backs Small Displays.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lg-display-pours-7-billion-into-oled-panels-for-smartphones-1500977113", "keywords": [" iphone 8, lg display,oled, oled display panels, samsung, smartphones,LG Display,034220.SE,KR:034220,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,SSNLF,Apple,AAPL,KR:005930,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications equipment,mobile communications devices,personal electronics,audio,video equipment,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,cellular,mobile phones,consumer goods,computing,computer peripherals,computer hardware,computer display units,durable household products,handheld electronic devices,home electronics,appliances,smartphones,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 06:00:00", "news_title": "Coca-Cola Earnings: What to Watch ", "content": "Coca-Cola Co.

HON 0.90%       and Reddit Inc. are among employers that have ended or reduced remote-work arrangements recently as managers demand more collaboration, closer contact with customers\u2014and more control over the workday.Bringing workers back to the office isn\u2019t easy, managers say. Remote employees often set their own hours and ways of working, and bridle when faced with open-plan offices and set meeting schedules.A large majority of U.S. employers let staffers telecommute sometimes, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.Yet the portion of U.S. workers who performed all or some of their work at home fell to 22% last year, from 24% in 2015. Such workers spent an average of 3.1 hours a day toiling at home last year, down slightly from 2015, according to the Labor Department\u2019s American Time Use Survey.Coming back to the office can be \u201chonestly terrifying\u201d for remote workers, says Andrew Marder, a research analyst with Capterra Inc., a business-software review site owned by             Gartner Inc.Mr. Marder telecommuted for about three years while blogging about investing for the Motley Fool financial website. He was also a full-time caregiver for his newborn during part of that time, and juggled writing and parenting duties by working many evenings.Moving to an office role at Capterra in 2014, Mr. Marder had to get used to the lack of privacy at work and an hour-plus commute to Arlington, Va. As a telecommuter, he was used to working at any hour to meet deadlines. Once in the office, he struggled with prioritizing tasks and managing his time during work hours, frequently missing deadlines in the first months on the job.His manager, J.P. Medved, set weekly meetings to plan Mr. Marder\u2019s workflow, arranging his calendar and plotting everything from research phone calls to team meetings and deadlines. Mr. Medved says those changes improved Mr. Marder\u2019s ability to submit work on time.Bosses acknowledge that remote workers don\u2019t suffer from productivity problems. Research has found telecommuters who can work outside normal office hours and don\u2019t have to spend time commuting often are more productive than their cubicle-bound counterparts. Rather, managers want their teams within view and are willing to trade some efficiency for the serendipity that office-based conversations might yield.Companies tend to clamp down on telework during periods of turmoil and reinvention, says Ken Matos, vice president of research at Life Meets Work, a workplace consultancy.\u201cLeaders often say \u2018I like my co-located team better than my [remote] team, but the work gets done just as well,\u2019\u201d he adds.As a finance vice president at Tetra Pak International SA, George Benaroya observed waves of colleagues return to company workspaces when new leaders would take over divisions and rein in remote work.Office comebacks were often a letdown, recalls Mr. Benaroya, who left the company in 2012.\u00a0 Workers accustomed to personal space and sole use of their equipment at home had to adjust to cramped spaces, full parking lots and jammed printer queues.The formerly remote employees\u2019 egos were bruised, too: The top managers who made special time for them during office visits paid less attention once those workers were a regular presence, he says. Managers spent extra time hand-holding ex-home workers, leaving less time for other duties.\u201cYou lose efficiency,\u201d Mr. Benaroya says.Tetra Pak spokeswoman Carol Yang says the issues that Mr. Benaroya describe don\u2019t reflect the company\u2019s current situation.This spring IBM, long a promoter of remote work, offered thousands of work-from-home employees a choice to follow their position back to an office location or apply for a new role. Those who chose to do neither could leave the company.Marketing manager Dave Wilson spent a decade working from home in Nashua, N.H. With two young children home during work hours, distractions abounded and Mr. Wilson says he felt isolated from colleagues.So when his job was relocated to Raleigh, N.C., he took a position marketing the company\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence products at IBM\u2019s Littleton, Mass., campus.Mr. Wilson says he was eager to return to an office, a better fit for his \u201cwater-cooler guy\u201d personality.He relishes the verbal sparring of the office, too. During a recent meeting to critique IBM\u2019s e-commerce offerings, participants challenged one another and got in each other\u2019s faces to make their points\u2014when he attended similar meetings via conference call, people would disengage unless they were leading the conversation, he recalls.IBM\u2019s leaders want to provoke those creative tensions, and have spent $750 million to redevelop its workplaces around a new system of teamwork; the company has also trained 160,000 employees on working more nimbly.As former telecommuters arrive at IBM\u2019s Austin, Texas, location, Joni Saylor will help to integrate them into office culture. Ms. Saylor, a product design director who worked remotely for IBM until 2013, says telecommuters sometimes struggle to adjust to working in teams after operating on their own.Best Buy\u2019s work-from-home program gave 5,000 headquarters employees free rein to choose where they worked, a perk that complicated tasks like scheduling meetings, says Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman.\u201cThere was no control,\u201d he says. \u201cManagers didn\u2019t have the tools to do their jobs.\u201dThe company ended the policy in 2013. Workers now arrange time out of the office with their managers.The four years since the telework rollback have coincided with Best Buy\u2019s resurgence. Net income has more than doubled in the period and shares have climbed more than 200%, though the company is reluctant to draw a connection between those results and the end of remote work.\u201cObviously, there were lots of other things going on,\u201d Mr. Shelman says.Write to John Simons at John.Simons@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Employers Pull Plug on Remote Work.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-boss-wants-you-back-in-the-office-1500975001", "keywords": ["remote workers,telecommuting,Aetna,AET,Honeywell International,HON,Best Buy,BBY,International Business Machines,IBM,Reddit,Bank of America,BAC,Andrew Marder,Carol Yang,George Benaroya,Jeff Shelman,Joni Saylor,Ken Matos,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,career planning,general labor issues,aerospace products,parts,retail,wholesale,household goods,hardware stores,electronics,appliance stores,specialty stores,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,computer services,aerospace,defense,business,consumer services,financial services,industrial goods,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 05:30:00", "news_title": "Charlie Gard Case Highlights Broad Role of U.K. Courts", "content": "LONDON\u2014The high-profile battle in the British courts over the fate of       Charlie Gard,        a brain-damaged baby with an incurable genetic disorder, put a spotlight on the difficult role the U.K. judicial system often has to play when children\u2019s lives hang in the balance.Judges in the U.K. are regularly asked to decide whether doctors should end lifesaving care for grievously ill children. Given the secrecy of the family-court system, these cases traditionally get little attention.Over the past two years, Britain\u2019s High Court has weighed in on roughly 30 disputes over a child\u2019s medical care, according to a government agency that provides legal guardians for children in such cases. There have been 10 so far this year. In the majority of them, doctors have sought to remove life-sustaining treatment against parents\u2019 wishes.Most escape public notice because of court privacy rules. In recent weeks, a judge heard the case of another child suffering from a mitochondrial disorder similar to Charlie\u2019s, according to a lawyer with knowledge of the case. The judge\u2019s ruling hasn\u2019t been published.Charlie Gard\u2019s parents\u2019 legal fight to keep him on a ventilator and take him abroad for experimental therapy, against the opinion of his doctors, ended Monday when they dropped the case, saying his muscular damage was worse than feared and the treatment wouldn\u2019t help. The parents had raised over $1.7 million to fund the cost of travel and treatment in the U.S.The monthslong battle prompted reactions from President Donald Trump, the pope and pro-life groups, and touched off a debate about the role of courts in such matters.Decisions about limiting treatment for patients, especially the very young, involve complex ethical, moral, medical and legal questions. And they are becoming more common, due to advances in medical care that manage to keep more grievously sick children alive, though often with little chance of full recovery.Dominic Wilkinson,        a professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, said that the approach to conflict between doctors and parents differs from country to country. \u201cThe U.K., though, is relatively unusual in the number of cases that it has dealt with in this way and in the preparedness of the courts to make decisions that are contrary to the wishes of the parents,\u201d he said.U.K. judges often use balance sheets\u2014though they didn\u2019t in Charlie\u2019s case\u2014to weigh the benefits and burdens of continuing life support when calculating what is in a child\u2019s best interests. In the U.K., where the National Health Service is straining for resources, the use of funds, space and staff is also often an issue in deliberations.In June last year, a judge used the balance-sheet process before ruling that a two-and-a-half-year-old, paralyzed and unresponsive after a traffic accident, should have his respirator removed, against the wishes of his mother, and receive only palliative care.When the court was hearing the case, the child had suffered three bouts of respirator-related pneumonia as well as urinary-tract infections. Doctors testified it was only a matter of time before a lung infection killed him.The child\u2019s mother argued that those grim facts needed to be balanced against the fact that the child wasn\u2019t in pain and that there was a chance for modest improvements.\u201cThe test to be applied by the courts in such cases is simply this: What is in the best interests of the child at the particular time in question, having regard to his welfare in the widest sense, not just medical, but social and psychological?\u201d wrote an appellate judge who reviewed the case.Usually, end-of-life decisions for hundreds of very sick children each year are made in intensive-care units by parents, doctors and medical ethicists.\u2018The U.K., though, is relatively unusual...in the preparedness of the courts to make decisions that are contrary to the wishes of the parents.\u2019Medical advances have led to discussions about whether a treatment is reasonable and \u201cthat\u2019s where arguments can start,\u201d says       Michael Vloeberghs,        a pediatric neurosurgeon at Nottingham University Hospital, who has appeared as an expert witness in withdrawal-of-treatment cases.Guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, a national group of pediatricians, says a child\u2019s best interests should always trump the costs, which \u201care an irrelevant consideration if a particular treatment clearly cannot provide overall benefit and is not in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201dBut the professional body also acknowledges that the tough financial climate means \u201coffering expensive treatment inevitably uses funds that may be better used elsewhere.\u201d\u201cThe drive is ultimately where will the funding come from,\u201d Dr. Vloeberghs said.In 2014, parents of       Ashya King,        a 5-year-old boy with brain cancer, took him from a British hospital without informing clinicians and traveled to\u00a0Spain, where they were arrested. A U.K. Court ordered their release and let the parents take the boy to Prague for\u00a0proton\u00a0therapy not offered by the National Health Service for his illness at the time. Ashya returned to school after treatment in Prague, according to U.K. media reports. The therapy he received is now becoming available in British hospitals.Before Charlie\u2019s case, one of the few others to receive significant public attention was that of a disabled 11-month-old,       Charlotte Wyatt,        in 2004.The judge in Charlotte\u2019s case said that in reaching his view that the baby girl shouldn\u2019t receive artificial ventilation or similar aggressive treatment \u201cin the event of a disagreement\u201d between the parents and the hospital, he had \u201cof course been informed by the medical evidence as to the prospects and cost of her aggressive treatment.\u201dIn Charlie\u2019s case, the hospital treating him, Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, considered providing him with an experimental nucleoside therapy funded by the National Health Service but decided not to do so after the child suffered a series of seizures and doctors decided the treatment would no longer help him.In the U.S., clinicians also regularly evaluate the burdens and benefits of keeping patients on life-support. But doctors, often fearing litigation, tend to continue treatment if a patient\u2019s family wish them to do so, according to U.S. medical ethicists.\u201cVery few doctors are going to take an action that is going to open them up to a career-ending lawsuit,\u201d said a medical ethicist in the U.S. who asked not to be named.In an earlier legal hearing in Charlie\u2019s case, a British medical expert in his condition argued that the culture in the U.K. was different from the U.S., \u201cwhere anything would be tried.\u201dKathy Plakovic,        a palliative care nurse practitioner at Edward Hospital in Naperville, Ill., said that \u201cthings go on a lot longer\u201d often in the U.S. \u201cWe get very deep into medical care and life support goes on and on and on,\u201d even when it isn\u2019t going to make a difference.\u201cWe exhaust all options,\u201d particularly in the treatment of children, she said.Write to Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Courts Struggle Over Ill Children\u2019s Fates.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-gards-case-highlights-balancing-act-facing-u-k-courts-1500975002", "keywords": ["britain,charlie gard,court,parents,treatment,Charlie Gard,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 05:30:00", "news_title": "Afghan President Speaks About \u2018The World\u2019s Most Difficult Job\u2019", "content": "Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently sat down for an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Here are edited excerpts:Q: Statistics suggest a country that is unraveling. The Taliban have gained territory. What are you doing to reassure people you have the situation under control?A. A generational change has been brought into the leadership of the minister of defense. The finances of the ministry have been completely overhauled. This was the ministry that was known for its massive corruption. Now, lack of compliance is an exception.Transition was premised on the engagement of Pakistan, and Taliban, with peace. Instead, they unleashed a total war on us. Have we suffered casualties? Massive. But this is a transnational war. This year the Afghan army has been at its best. Are we in the middle of war? Absolutely. What would you have asked Churchill as a measure of his success in 1944?I went to Pakistan; I engaged in peace. If a hand extended is not shaken, what are you supposed to do?Q: If Pakistan doesn\u2019t change, what is the solution for peace? How much can you rely on China or the U.S. to help?A: My central objective is, turn Afghanistan\u2019s location into a greater asset. Central Asia is becoming Afghanistan\u2019s major trading partner. The vision of connectivity is really important. It offers Pakistan an alternative. It really needs to understand that Afghanistan is going to be key to its potential prosperity and connectivity.Q: What are you doing to reassure all political factions that the next elections will happen, and that they will also generate a real contest?A: The election commission has announced a firm date. I would have wanted the date of the election much sooner, and if I were managing it, it would have taken place sooner. But I\u2019m deferring to the due processes and we\u2019re insisting on full consultation. Why did the election not take place earlier? We were fighting a war for our survival and we could not do two things simultaneously. The election of 2018 and the presidential election of 2019, is a must. Full attention is focused on both.Q: A number of coalitions have formed against you, including members of your government. These groups are accusing you of autocracy and concentrating power among Pashtuns. What are you doing to reassure people that your government is inclusive and how much of a threat are these factions?A:  First of all, decision-making has never been this collective in our history. Is there any ministry in Afghanistan that is exclusively of one ethnic group, or one main group? Are these decisions made in secret? Are they made in an open process? The high councils, every single one of them, are inter-ministerial. What is really required is investigative journalism, is to differentiate between fact and fiction, propaganda and reality.Is there anyone that can claim that the system of governance we inherited satisfied either the Afghan people or our international partners. My entire life has been guided by a sense of equality, equality for loved ones. After the May 31st attack on us, the tragedy of May 31st, I\u2019ve seen at least 7,000 residents of Kabul. Please ask them were they treated with courtesy and attention.I have no disrespect for the political elite of Afghanistan that is a product of post 9/11, but I am asking for accountability, responsibility. We need to build constitutional authority with rule of law, as the key focus.Q: What are you doing to convince the public that you are serious about prosecuting high-level corruption?A:  Corruption was the system. We\u2019re not dealing with an aberration. The movement towards accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, is really taking place. On the other hand, we need to face our history. Every system has a breaking point. You\u2019ve seen how much reaction there is to reform.So, I would be the last one to say either that I am satisfied or that the job is done. But I think the judgment needs to be made on comparative grounds. And vis a vis the obstacles and the need to keep the political consensus. Balancing is the critical issue. And during the election campaign, I said exactly that.Every global leader that I have seen has at least agreed on one point: I do have the world\u2019s most difficult job. But I hope to make it easier for my successor.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghan-president-speaks-about-the-worlds-most-difficult-job-1500975004", "keywords": ["afghanistan, afghan politics, corruption in afghanistan, taliban, taliban violence, un, united nations,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 05:30:00", "news_title": "Meet the Bank Customers Pushing for a Better Deposit Deal", "content": "Consumers are giving banks a pass when it comes to shopping for higher interest rates on deposit accounts. Businesses, on the other hand, are becoming more demanding.With short-term interest rates on the rise, corporate depositors are seeking bigger payouts for their deposits, and big banks have started capitulating.The reason: Small rate increases are often worth just pennies to many consumers, but they can translate into meaningful dollars on large corporate deposits of millions or even billions of dollars.And companies have greater leverage with banks since in many cases they also bring in lucrative investment banking and trading business.\u201cThe jig is up,\u201d said       James Gilligan,        assistant treasurer at Kansas City, Mo.-based power company             Great Plains Energy Inc.       He said many companies, including his, have negotiated better deposit pricing with banks where they also borrow. Treasurers who have the flexibility to move their money are also seeking out higher rates.The pressure from corporate depositors is pushing up banks\u2019 costs just as they are beginning to benefit from lending money in the U.S. at higher rates. The Federal Reserve has increased short-term rates twice so far this year, and may do so again.While bank stocks ripped higher after last year\u2019s presidential election, their shares have been losing ground. Though second-quarter earnings reports were stronger than expected, investors were still spooked by banks\u2019 cautious outlooks for future interest income. The KBW             Nasdaq                   Bank index is down 1.5% since banks began reporting\u00a0on July 14, while the S&P 500 index is up 0.9%.Across the largest U.S. banks, the average interest paid jumped by about a third in the second quarter to 0.34% from 0.26% a year ago, according to Autonomous Research\u2014the highest level\u00a0in four years. Bankers said business depositors are behind the rise.While demand for higher rates has been \u201ceffectively at zero\u201d from individual consumers, banks are grappling with \u201chot money from corporates\u201d that are more likely to decamp for higher rates elsewhere,       William Demchak,        chief executive of Pittsburgh-based             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.,       told analysts earlier this month.Companies\u2019 success in getting higher rates is based largely on the size of their cash hoard and the amount of other business they do with a bank. The higher the cash balances and fees a company pays, the more likely it is to get an increase, either from its current bank or from a new one.\u201cThe way we approach pricing these days is, we defend our turf,\u201d says Tayfun Tuzun, chief financial officer at             Fifth Third Bancorp,       the Cincinnati-based bank. Mr. Tuzun said U.S. banks are also being pressured by competition from overseas banks that want to build their deposits. Some are willing to pay 1.25% or 1.3%, he said, while a typical corporate deposit rate for a large account in the U.S. currently is about 0.9% to 1%.By contrast, the average retail savings rate was 0.18% at large banks in the second quarter, according to analysts at Jefferies Group LLC.Banks use deposits from both retail and corporate customers to fund loans. They aim to pay depositors a rate that\u2019s lower than the one they collect on loans. As the gap between the rates increases, banks\u2019 profits grow.For years after the financial crisis, rates were stuck at historic lows and loan demand remained tepid, so banks didn\u2019t care as much about gathering deposits. Sometimes they even charged corporate customers who wanted to keep their deposits at the bank.In recent years, lending has picked up, making a growing deposit base more attractive.Banks have also come under increasing pressure to retain deposits amid regulators\u2019 renewed focus on ensuring banks have enough cash on hand to survive any sudden crisis.\u2018The higher the rate becomes, the more attractive it is to worry about where the money sits.\u2019But gathering deposits is starting to become more costly as the Fed moves short-term rates higher. Deposit rates are tied to short-term rates, but banks generally keep deposit rates low for as long as possible.More corporate customers say that day is now passing. \u201cA year ago, it was not worth the time it takes to make a phone call\u201d and push for a higher rate, said       Jeff Glenzer,        vice president at the Association for Financial Professionals, an industry group for corporate treasurers. \u201cThe higher the rate becomes, the more attractive it is to worry about where the money sits.\u201dActivity so far has mostly been among companies that operate without a lot of debt, such as many technology, real-estate and health-care firms.Banks have responded to the new push by trying to attract or retain deposits without raising rates, specifically by offering expanded discounts, or \u201cearnings credits,\u201d on other fees instead.Most banks are already awash in more deposits than they need, causing some analysts to predict they\u2019ll be stingy on corporate deposit rates, especially with loan growth softening in recent months.Some deposits can also be costly to banks, in terms of capital reserved against them.\u201cWe\u2019ll use pricing to start relationships,\u201d said       Darren King,        CFO of             M&T Bank Corp.      , based in Buffalo, N.Y. \u201cBut over time, relationships need to work for both us and the customer.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-bank-customers-pushing-for-a-better-deposit-deal-1500975003", "keywords": ["bank deposits,banking,corporate deposit rate,deposit accounts,interest income,interest rates,retail savings rate ,Great Plains Energy,GXP,Tayfun Tuzun,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,energy,electricity,gas utilities,credit,electric utilities,financial services,utilities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 05:30:00", "news_title": "Afghan Leader Struggles to Build Working State Amid Dysfunction", "content": "KABUL\u2014On a recent Sunday morning, Afghan President       Ashraf Ghani       spent hours inside the fortresslike presidential palace mulling plans to expand the capital\u2019s water supply and install fiber-optic cable in a remote region, scrutinizing grainy slides projected on a meeting-room wall.Outside, new two-story blast walls and checkpoints have further restricted access to Kabul\u2019s diplomatic enclave after a May truck bomb near the German embassy killed over 150 people, prompting an exodus of diplomats.Mr. Ghani faces growing opposition in his fragile unity government and Taliban insurgents are inflicting mounting casualties on civilians and security forces. But he says he is determined to stay focused on building the machinery of a functioning state in a country plagued by chaos and corruption.\u201cMy task is to create a system that my successor can run,\u201d Mr. Ghani said in an interview. \u201cThe new generation demands a different voice, accountability and responsibility.\u201dMr. Ghani invited reporters with The Wall Street Journal to observe his daily routine one day earlier this month. Over nearly 14 hours, Mr. Ghani immersed himself in the minutiae of governance and showed his impatience with the pace of progress nearly three years into his five-year term.During a series of meetings, the 66-year-old former World Bank official and ex-finance minister berated a senior United Nations envoy over plans to fund parliamentary elections and threatened to fire about half a dozen senior government officials for incompetence.Critics say Mr. Ghani is mired in details and missing the big picture, including deteriorating security and rising ethnic tension. The Taliban claimed responsibility for a Monday bomb attack on a minibus carrying government workers in Kabul, which killed at least 31 people.His long-promised plan to revamp the country\u2019s armed forces is still under review. Meanwhile, U.S. airstrikes have quadrupled in recent months, to levels last seen in 2012, in an effort to keep the Taliban at bay.Weeks after May\u2019s truck bombing, leading members of Afghanistan\u2019s three main ethnic minorities announced a new coalition against Mr. Ghani, who is a Pashtun, the country\u2019s largest ethnic group. Coalition members include Afghanistan\u2019s acting foreign minister and the exiled vice president, who is under investigation for kidnap and rape.The Afghan state \u201cis collapsing on itself,\u201d said       Mohammad Mohaqiq,        a senior government official who helped start the coalition.Mr. Ghani argues that providing effective public services, stamping out corruption and imposing order and discipline on the bureaucracy, far from being a distraction, are critical to tackling Afghanistan\u2019s security challenges. That view is a central thesis of a book he co-wrote, titled \u201cFixing Failed States.\u201dMr. Ghani stuck to his schedule the day of the truck bomb even though it shattered palace windows, rushing to find a room to meet a visiting foreign dignitary and complaining when an economic council meeting was canceled, said an aide, describing Mr. Ghani\u2019s ability to focus.The president dismisses his opponents, saying they are motivated by a fear of losing out in a transparent system. \u201cYou think people that lose hundreds of millions in contracts are going to come praising us?\u201d he asked.Mr. Ghani, who gave up U.S. citizenship to run for president in 2009,\u00a0said his efforts to build a competent bureaucracy have persuaded foreign backers, predominantly the U.S., to stick with Afghanistan after 16 years of war.The Trump administration is weighing sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, and Washington and its allies have pledged more than $15 billion in reconstruction aid over the next four years.\u201cWinning our foundational partnership with the United States has been fundamental,\u201d Mr.\u00a0Ghani\u00a0said. \u201cThis has taken intense work.\u201dA veteran Western diplomat in Kabul said Mr. Ghani\u2019s pro-American stance was welcome in Washington, but that concerns remain.\u201cThe risk is that he will anger so many political factions that he may not limp his way to the 2019 presidential elections,\u201d the diplomat said.Mr. Ghani describes himself as a workaholic who skips both lunch and dinner and eschews lavish official entertaining. Aides describe him as an energetic but intimidating presence, with a propensity to lose his temper and fire officials on the spot.On the day Journal reporters observed him, Mr. Ghani met with foreign ambassadors, the U.N. and Afghan officials in the afternoon to review plans for next year\u2019s parliamentary elections.After participants had spoken, Mr. Ghani turned to the deputy head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Pernille Dahler Kardel.\u201cWith enormous respect, it seems that the discussion has not moved very far. You are still raising the issues that you were raising six months ago,\u201d he said, demanding to know the amount and type of funding available.Ms. Kardel in a written statement to the Journal said that \u201cdecisions have been taken that will allow funding to flow\u201d without providing details.He then turned to officials with Afghanistan\u2019s election commission, demanding to know its plan for holding the elections on time next July 7.\u201cYou must have worked backwards!\u201d he exclaimed.In the evening, Mr. Ghani oversaw a meeting of the National Procurement Council which, at his insistence, reviews every government contract valued at more than $1 million. There were more than a dozen items, including deals to build walls at remote military bases and acquire three armored vehicles for a ministry.Two officials who had failed to provide requested documents for a contract to provide vaccinations to Afghans attending the annual pilgrimage to Mecca hung their heads after Mr. Ghani demanded to know which one was at fault.\u201cWho was responsible for the vaccinations? Please?\u201d Mr. Ghani shouted. \u201cRight now go to the office, and within two hours bring the document! Otherwise, you are suspended tomorrow. Understood?\u201dThe officials fled. Mr. Ghani\u2019s office said they returned the next day with the documents and the contract was approved.As the clock ticked toward 10 p.m., Mr. Ghani turned on officials from the national electric company for failing to fulfill a contract in time. \u201cI want written resignations from you,\u201d he exclaimed.U.S. officials who attend the weekly council said it was a standard Sunday night for the president.Afterward, a modest Afghan dinner was offered in the dining room, but Mr. Ghani didn\u2019t join. He smiled, thanked everyone for attending and left the room.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.comAppeared in the July 26, 2017, print edition as 'Afghan President\u2019s Daily Battles.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-casualties-mount-afghan-leader-stresses-everyday-task-of-governing-1500975005", "keywords": ["afghanistan, afghan politics, afghan president, ghani,Ashraf Ghani,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,terrorism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 05:07:00", "news_title": "SoftBank Tries to Grab the Ride-Hailing Market   ", "content": "Japan\u2019s richest man,       Masayoshi Son,        is flashing his wallet again to get the front seat in the ride-hailing market. Even embattled Uber is on his radar\u2014            SoftBank,        9984 0.74%       the Japanese tech giant controlled by the flamboyant Mr. Son, has approached the company about taking a multibillion-dollar stake, The Wall Street Journal has reported.SoftBank is certainly spreading its bets. Even if a deal with Uber doesn\u2019t come off, it has already sunk billions of dollars into pretty much every major ride-hailing firm out there, from China to Brazil. On Monday, it joined up with Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to invest $2 billion in Grab, Uber\u2019s rival in Southeast Asia. Back in May, SoftBank pumped $5 billion into Didi itself.The logic behind SoftBank\u2019s spending spree appears to be that if it bets on everything, it\u2019s bound to back an eventual winner in the ride-hailing market. Fair enough. But every time SoftBank invests, it drives up valuations in this still-young sector. Its investment in Grab this week, for example, valued that company at $6 billion, twice what it was worth at a previous fundraising September last year. The top five ride-hailing firms are together now worth more than $130 billion, according to CB Insights. That\u2019s already more than the $108 billion turnover the taxi industry generates globally, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.In other words, SoftBank may struggle to achieve a high return on its ride-hailing investment soon. To justify the high valuations for companies now, they may have to achieve a genuine revolution in consumer behavior, such that people give up car ownership altogether and rely on the likes of Uber and Didi. That might just be feasible in a country like China, where car ownership levels are still low. But such change seems unlikely in auto-loving countries like the U.S. any time soon.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-tries-to-grab-the-ride-hailing-market-1500973667", "keywords": ["grab, masayoshi son, ride-hailing,softbank, uber,vc analysis,SoftBank Group,9984.TO,JP:9984,Didi Chuxing,Masayoshi Son,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,etailing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,e-commerce,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-25 03:00:00", "news_title": "Freight-Booking Startup Convoy Raises $62 Million ", "content": "Digital freight-booking startup Convoy raised $62 million in a funding round led by Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, money the company said it plans to use to expand nationally.Convoy runs a website and mobile application where retailers and other shippers can book trucks to move their goods. The startup says it can pair shippers and carriers faster than traditional freight brokerages where agents arrange transportation by phone and email.The Series B round, which was led by Y Combinator\u2019s Continuity Fund and included investments from funds managed by       Bill Gates       and       Barry Diller,       \u00a0will go toward expanding nationally and adding more shippers and trucking companies to its platform.That growth would help Convoy stand out from a pack of startups that are attempting to use technology to gain a foothold in what reserach group Armstrong & Associates estimates to be a $62 billion domestic-transportation management market. Another freight-booking service, New York-based Transfix, said earlier this month it raised $42 million, and Austin-based uShip in February received a $25 million investment from DB Schenker, one of the world\u2019s biggest logistics companies.The startups are trying to push their way into a highly fragmented business that includes several multibillion-dollar freight brokers, including             C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.,Hub Group Inc.       and             XPO Logistics Inc.,       as well as online truck freight exchanges, or load boards, that match up loads with available trucks. Startups hope to make up that gap by reducing back-end costs, but the largest brokerages are working on technology of their own, said Evan Armstrong of Armstrong & Associates.\u201cYou can have the best app in the world but unless you can offer a significant amount of volume to the carriers you work with, you\u2019re not going to be able to get as good of rates with those carriers,\u201d he said.Mr. Armstrong said technology firms could partner with larger players, along the lines of the deal between DB Schenker and uShip.Convoy says it plans to grow on its own. The company works with more than 300 small and medium-sized shippers, and also moves freight for large consumer-products companies like             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   NV and             Unilever                   PLC.\u201cThis investment is about taking that to a national scale, doubling down on the technology,\u201d said       Dan Lewis,        Convoy\u2019s founder.Write to Erica E.

We Still Don\u2019t Know", "content": "Scrutinizing the ownership of         HNA Group               always brings to mind Winston Churchill\u2019s well-worn description of Russia as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.The acquisitive Chinese company, which owns a nearly 10% stake in             Deutsche Bank                   and is trying to buy White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge Capital, says it is trying to be more transparent. On Monday it disclosed new details about its shareholders, listing 15 individuals and entities it says are its ultimate owners.Revealing so much detail about ownership is unusual for a privately held mainland Chinese company. But HNA is an active global acquirer, and its disclosure hardly quells the questions around the group.The main change is that a charitable foundation based in New York, Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation Inc., is now HNA\u2019s largest beneficial owner, with a stake of nearly 30%. That stake was transferred to the charity by       Bharat Bhise,        CEO of Bravia Capital, and former HNA owner       Guan Jun.       Not much was known about Guan Jun, and not much is known about the charity, either, except that it was set up late last year. Nor has much light been shed on the evolving and convoluted structure through which the charity and the other beneficial owners actually own their stakes.Those in Beijing wondering why HNA has been so keen to move its money abroad by buying assets overseas are unlikely to be appeased by learning its biggest shareholder is based in the U.S. The Chinese government is already investigating debt levels at HNA and four other companies that have made big overseas transactions.Nor will those who deal with HNA outside China be much better informed. They include regulators in the U.S. and Europe looking into the SkyBridge and Deutsche Bank deals, as well as Western investment banks already wary of working with HNA. The way HNA funds its acquisitions also remains opaque.One practical effect of all this is that HNA\u2019s overseas deal making is likely to remain stalled. Even if the names of HNA\u2019s owners are now clearer, business partners and regulators will need time to become comfortable with their backgrounds and motives. HNA\u2019s declaration of openness hasn\u2019t unpeeled the mystery around the group.
