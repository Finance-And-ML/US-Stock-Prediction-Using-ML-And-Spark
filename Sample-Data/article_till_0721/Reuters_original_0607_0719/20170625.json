Australia has made it clear it wants tech companies to do much more to give intelligence and law enforcement agencies access to encrypted communications. “I will raise the need to address ongoing challenges posed by terrorists and criminals using encryption,” Australian Attorney General Senator Brandis said in a joint statement. “These discussions will focus on the need to cooperate with service providers to ensure reasonable assistance is provided to law enforcement and security agencies.” Tech firms such as Apple (AAPL.O)  and Facebook (FB.O), which owns encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, have been criticized in the United Kingdom and United States for not doing enough to crackdown on so-called dark spaces where extremists can communicate. Industry involvement in thwarting the encryption of terrorist messaging will be a priority for Australia at the gathering, Senator Brandis said.

It was borderline unfair. The reigning National League Player of the Week pitched his third consecutive masterpiece, and Wilmer Flores capped an eighth-inning uprising with a run-scoring double, delivering the New York Mets a 5-2 victory over the Giants.  When he's on, he's as good as anybody in the game,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said of deGrom, who completed eight innings for a third consecutive start.  And he was on today.  Jay Bruce broke a 1-1 tie in the eighth with an RBI double for the Mets, who won a second straight in San Francisco after having opened a 10-game trip with four consecutive losses against the Los Angeles Dodgers.  I said this before: He had that outing when he struggled (June 6 at Texas) and he's come back after that, made the necessary adjustments and he's been lights out,  Bruce said of deGrom.  That's what an ace does.  The loss was the Giants' 50th of the year, making them the first team to reach the half-century mark this season.  It is hard to believe,  Bochy said of the 50 losses.  I don't know if anybody saw this coming. Hard to make sense of it. It can be embarrassing.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at GiantsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchThe teams were knotted at 1 after solo homers by Flores and Brandon Belt were the lone blemishes against deGrom and the Giants' Johnny Cueto. Right-hander Sam Dyson replaced Cueto to start the eighth, and Curtis Granderson greeted him with a triple to get the game-winning rally in motion. After Asdrubal Cabrera walked and Yoenis Cespedes struck out, Bruce smacked a Steven Okert pitch into right field to plate Granderson with the go-ahead run. One out later, Flores sliced a double to right off the Giants' third pitcher of the inning, right-hander George Kontos, to make it 3-1. Dyson (1-7) was charged with the loss, his first since joining the Giants. The Mets tacked on two insurance runs in the ninth, the first coming when Michael Conforto, pinch hitting for deGrom, singled in Jose Reyes, who had opened the inning with a triple off right-hander Kyle Crick. A two-out wild pitch by Crick allowed Conforto to score, increasing the New York lead to 5-1. It was more than deGrom (7-3) needed.  That's what I want to do every time out there,  he said of the eight-inning effort.  That's what I expect of myself.  In a pitching rematch of Game 2 of the 2015 World Series, a game Cueto won for the Kansas City Royals, deGrom limited the Giants to four hits in eight innings while running his record to 3-0 with a 0.72 ERA in his last three starts. He walked one and struck out seven.  You figured it would be a low-scoring game with those two guys going,  Bochy said of deGrom and Cueto.  The (Giants) bullpen struggled tonight.  Right-hander Addison Reed surrendered a two-out, run-scoring single to Brandon Crawford in the bottom of the ninth before wrapping up the win. Cueto did not get a decision after allowing one run and five hits in seven innings. He walked three and struck out three.  Thank God,  he blurted out afterward.  I think I'm in rhythm now.  Flores' homer, his seventh of the season, opened the scoring in the fourth inning. He finished with two hits and two RBIs for the Mets, who had five of their 10 hits go for extra bases. Cabrera contributed a double and a single for New York. Belt's home run, his 14th, led off the seventh and drew the Giants even at 1-1. Buster Posey had a pair of singles for San Francisco, which has lost 11 of its last 12 overall and nine of its last 10 at home. NOTES: The Mets have hit 23 home runs in their last 13 games and 42 in the month of June. Their franchise record for homers in a month is 45, set in August 2015 and tied in August 2016. ...

Ryu, who is bidding for her second LPGA title this year and fourth of her career, finds herself at 16-under 126 to claim the 36-hole record at the tournament. The 26-year-old South Korean capped her impressive bogey-free round with back-to-back birdies, finishing with 10 on the day to claim comfortable lead over Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn and American Stacy Lewis at Pinnacle Country Club.  It was so much fun,  Ryu told reporters after her round.    “I made a really long putt at 8, 17, and then I boost up and the shot was getting better and better. At the back nine, I was able to make some more short birdies, and then pretty much made all of them. So happy with my round today.” Ryu resides third in the Rolex world rankings and is .489 average ranking points behind No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn, who isn't playing this week. If Ryu wins, the battle for No. 1 likely will come down to fractions of a point in Monday's release of the new rankings. Ryu's performance on Saturday bested the previous course record of 62, set by Angela Park and Jane Park in 2008 and matched last year by Lydia Ko and Ayako Uehara. Both Jutanugarn and Lewis each followed their opening-round 66s with seven birdies against one bogey to finish with a 65 on Saturday. Lewis capped her round with back-to-back birdies at the par-3 17th and par-5 18th to send the crowd into a frenzy.  Kinda felt like I was struggling a little bit coming in, so that's why the last two birdies were extremely important to me,” Lewis said. “I felt like I got the momentum back and can hopefully post another good one tomorrow.” South Korean's Amy Yang shot a 65 to sit in fourth place at 10-under, one stroke ahead of the four-way contingent of countrywoman Inbee Park (65), Australian Minjee Lee (65), Indian Aditi Ashok (64) and Norwegian Suzann Pettersen (66).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-women-idUSKBN19G02Z"},

That was certainly the case on Saturday afternoon as Javier Baez drove in three runs in the Cubs' 5-3 win over the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. There were thousands of Cubs fans in the stands, but the decibel level went up in the ninth inning as the crowd reacted to an otherwise routine pinch-hitting appearance by Anthony Rizzo, who grew up less than one hour from Marlins Park.  I didn't even realize we were doing that for him,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said of the noise given in support of Rizzo, who is normally a starter at first base.  I was looking around, 'Did somebody walk in the door? Is it A-Rod and J-Lo?'  Nope, Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez weren't causing a scene. It was just Rizzo, who lined out to shortstop. Even so, it was still a great day for the Cubs. Baez, who led all Cubs hitters with a .302 batting average in May, delivered a tiebreaking, two-run double in the sixth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MarlinsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchJon Lester (5-4) picked up the win and has now defeated 29 of the 30 teams in the majors. The only exception is the Boston Red Sox, a team he played for and has never faced. Facing Miami for the fifth time on Saturday, Lester pitched seven innings and allowed four hits, one walk and three runs as the Cubs (38-36) took a 2-1 lead in the weekend series that concludes Sunday. Lester retired 18 of the last 20 batters he faced. Carl Edwards then pitched a scoreless eighth and Wade Davis did the same in the ninth for his 15th save of the year. Miami (33-40) was led by J.T. Realmuto, who cranked a three-run homer, his seventh long ball of the season.  He should be under consideration for the All-Star Game,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Realmuto.  But, as a manager, you see that there is more to his game.  Mattingly also had a comment on the pro-Cubs crowd.  It's not a great situation,  he said.  I don't think it has anything to do with how we play. But it would be nice to have a packed crowd with Marlins fans so that Cubs fans or Mets fans can't get tickets. But that's not the case.  Marlins starter Justin Nicolino allowed seven hits and three runs (two earned) in four innings, escaping with a no-decision. Reliever Nick Wittgren (1-1) took the loss, allowing two runs in one inning. Chicago got to Nicolino right away. Leadoff batter Jon Jay, a former University of Miami standout, singled in the first and advanced to second when center fielder Christian Yelich bobbled the ball. Jay moved to third on Wilson Contreras' single and scored on a two-out, opposite-field hit by Ian Happ. Miami grabbed the lead back in the bottom of the first. After Giancarlo Stanton walked and Yelich singled, Realmuto lofted his three-run homer to left.  I hung a curveball,  Lester said.  We were careful with Stanton on a 3-2 curveball, walked him. Then we had the lefty (Yelich), and I didn't make my pitch.  After Realmuto's homer, Lester retired the next 13 batters consecutively. That gave Chicago's offense an opportunity to rally, and the Cubs tied the score 3-3 with two runs in the fourth. Addison Russell singled, advanced on a Happ sacrifice bunt and scored on Baez's single to left. Albert Almora, a Miami native, capped the inning with an RBI opposite-field double. The Cubs took a 5-3 lead in the sixth as the first three batters in the inning all got hits. Russell doubled, Happ singled and Baez had his two-run double off the wall in right. All five of Chicago's RBIs came on opposite-field hits, which pleased Maddon. Happ, who has eight hits in the series so far, seems particularly adept at going the other way.  I'm just trying to get these guys to realize that there is more than one side to a baseball field,  Maddon said of Happ and the other young Cubs hitters.  As we do that, we will hit better in situations. That's the key to being able to drive in runs.

The advocacy group filed an amended complaint seeking to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting Iraqis from anywhere in the United States while a federal judge weighs the case of the Iraqis in Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith on Thursday ordered a stay in the Michigan Iraqis' deportation for at least two weeks while he decides whether he has jurisdiction. The ACLU, which had sued to block the Michigan deportations, asked Goldsmith to rule by Monday on expanding his order to cover the more than 1,400 Iraqis facing expulsion across the United States. The immigration agency has indicated it might start those deportations as soon as Tuesday, the ACLU said.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said the agency was reviewing the judge's order.  The agency intends to comply with the terms of the order, while determining the appropriate next steps,  she said in an email. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU said in its filing that those being deported could face persecution or torture because many were Chaldean Catholics or Iraqi Kurds and that both groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. The ACLU also filed a motion asking the judge to extend his order nationwide to ensure that people who could face persecution, torture or death in Iraq are not deported. The arrests of the Iraqis in Michigan were part of a sweep by immigration authorities who detained about 199 Iraqi immigrants around the country. They had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes.  The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's revised temporary travel ban.  The U.S. government has argued that the district court does not have jurisdiction over the case since only immigration courts can decide deportation issues.

Abe has proposed amending the constitution's war-renouncing Article 9 by 2020 to officially recognize Japan's Self-Defense Forces as its military.  Such a change could draw fire from China and South Korea,  where bitter memories of Japan's past military aggression persist. They would likely see the change as a step toward the re-emergence of Japan as a military power. Abe had been expected to wait until next year before seeking legislators' approval of the change. He would need to win the support of two-thirds of members of both houses of parliament and a majority of votes in a referendum.

Three people were killed and eight wounded when an explosive detonated in a women's restroom at the Andino shopping center on June 17. Four men and four women, members of The People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP) rebel group, were captured - half in Bogota and half in El Espinal in Tolima province, national police director Jorge Nieto told journalists. Those arrested will be arraigned on charges including homicide and terrorism, he said. The MRP, who have only been publicly known since late 2015, are being investigated for involvement in another 14 attacks, Nieto said.  The interdisciplinary team continues with the investigation to clarify the different terrorist actions and individualize and identify both the material and intellectual perpetrators of these acts,  Nieto said. The device, placed behind a toilet bowl, went off last Saturday afternoon amid busy Father's Day weekend shopping. Fatal victims of the bombing were 23-year-old French woman Julie Huynh, who had been volunteering in a poor area of the city, and Colombian citizens Ana Maria Gutierrez, 27, and Lady Paola Jaimes Ovalle, 31. Bogota, once the site of frequent car bombs and kidnappings, has grown safer over the past decade as the police and military increased surveillance and put more armed officials on the streets. Purses and bags were once checked at the entrance to shopping malls, but the practice has been scaled back in recent years. Bomb dogs still typically check cars at parking facilities in the capital. A peace accord signed last year with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's biggest guerrilla group, further raised hopes bomb attacks might be a thing of the past. But the country's second-largest insurgent group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), in February detonated a bomb outside a bull-fighting ring in Bogotá's center, injuring dozens of police.

Kendricks, the Olympic bronze medallist, took much pleasure from topping the six-metre barrier for the first time.  It's a career point,  the American said.  Every great jumper in history had at least one six metres jump.  To be a part of that club, to be an elite top 20 in the history in the event is really cool to me.  Harrison, recovering from a broken hand, already had a wild card berth to London as the 2016 Diamond League champion. But she wanted the title and a chance to run.

Brian Dozier's home run leading off the eighth inning broke a tie, and Chris Gimenez added a solo shot in the ninth as the Minnesota Twins beat Cleveland 4-2 on Saturday at Progressive Field. Dozier's homer, his 13th, came on a 3-2 pitch from Cleveland closer Cody Allen (0-3). Gimenez's homer, his fourth, came off Zach McAllister. Taylor Rogers (4-1) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to get the win. Brandon Kintzler pitched a scoreless ninth for his 20th save. Cleveland starter Corey Kluber was sensational, striking out 13 in seven innings, allowing two unearned runs, three hits and two walks. Kluber has not allowed an earned run in his last 21 innings. The two unearned runs Kluber allowed came in the first inning, thanks to two Indians errors. Dozier hit Kluber's first pitch of the game on the ground to second baseman Jason Kipnis, who threw wildly to first for an error. Joe Mauer walked, and Robbie Grossman doubled down the right-field line, scoring Dozier and sending Mauer to third. Mauer then scored on a wild pickoff throw to third by catcher Yan Gomes, giving Minnesota a 2-0 lead. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at IndiansMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch We took advantage of their mistakes right out of the chute,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  That was a shame,  said Francona of the first inning.  They not only got two runs, but it probably cost (Kluber) pitching the eighth inning. The runs were important, but that cost him an inning.  Kluber was removed from the game after seven innings and 106 pitches.  I was kind of disappointed in the way I handled the next two batters after the error,  Kluber said. The Twins were grateful for the two gift runs.  You know it's going to be a battle anytime Kluber is out there,  Twins starter Kyle Gibson said.  To get that 2-0 lead was huge because you never know when you are going to get runs off Kluber.  Gibson held Cleveland scoreless on one hit through the first three innings. But with one out in the fourth, Jose Ramirez drove a 3-2 pitch over the right field wall for his 12th home run, cutting the Twins' lead to 2-1. After the first inning Kluber started striking out hitters in bunches. In one stretch in the middle innings, he struck out nine of 12 batters.  Kluber was ridiculous. I think he struck out 38 guys,  Gimenez joked.  He has a wipeout breaking ball that he throws harder than I throw my fastball.  Dozier's tiebreaking homer in the eighth inning came after the Indians scored a run in the seventh inning to tie the game at 2. Gomes led off with a single against reliever Matt Belisle. Bradley Zimmer flied out for the first out, but Austin Jackson singled to left, moving Gomes to second. Francisco Lindor hit a ground ball to first baseman Kennys Vargas, who threw to shortstop Jorge Polanco at second for the force on Jackson. But Polanco's return throw to first was wild, allowing Gomes to score the tying run.  There wasn't much chance of completing that double play, so I would have rather we held the ball there, and kept the guy at third,  Molitor said. Rogers relieved Belisle and gave up an infield single to shortstop by Kipnis, with Lindor moving to second. But Rogers retired Ramirez on a groundout to end the inning.  Rogers got some big outs at a big time in the game against some good hitters,  Molitor said. Gibson pitched 4 2/3 innings, giving up one run on four hits, with one strikeout and four walks.

I will resign from the Organization of American States the day that free, fair and transparent national elections are held without impediments,  Almagro said in a video message posted on Twitter.  I offer my position in exchange for freedom in Venezuela.   President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday that if Almagro, an outspoken critic of his government, resigned he would consider reversing a decision to withdraw Venezuela from the 34-nation OAS bloc. At its annual general assembly in Mexico this week, the OAS failed to reach consensus on a resolution about Venezuela, where 75 people have died in three months of protests.  Demonstrators are demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the once-wealthy OPEC nation, racked by rising poverty and a deepening economic and political crisis. Countries in the region have lambasted Maduro over Venezuela's situation, but they have no evident means of forcing a political transition to happen. Despite low approval ratings and the increasingly dire humanitarian situation, Maduro faces few short-term threats to his hold on power.  The next presidential election is not scheduled until late next year, and military officers have until now ignored opposition calls that they urge Maduro to resign. Demonstrators Dispersed Demonstrators clash with riot security forces while rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's Government in front of an Air Force base in Caracas, Venezuela, June 24, 2017.Ivan AlvaradoAlmagro conditioned his resignation offer on a long list of demands, including the release of political prisoners such as high-profile politician Leopoldo Lopez, and a guarantee of Supreme Court independence. Maduro offered no immediate response to Almagro's offer on Saturday. But he has called the OAS chief  immoral  in the past and considers the regional group a puppet of Washington intent on toppling his government.  Security forces on Saturday used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators.

Maduro, during a speech to commemorate independence day, again accused the opposition of sowing chaos to lay the groundwork for a coup against him.   Desperation, hatred, and fury thrive among the enemies of the fatherland,  said Maduro, flanked by ministers and military top brass, describing the OAS's inability to produce a statement on Venezuela as a victory for the country. The opposition wants Maduro to bring forward next year's presidential election.  Instead, the president has called for the election of a constitutional assembly on July 30 to draft a new constitution. The opposition has said it will boycott the vote, calling it a rigged process to help the unpopular government stay in power.

Nearby stand the foundations of a railway meant to connect Tavan Tolgoi to China to the south. The unfinished line would enable cash-strapped, landlocked Mongolia to sell more coal at higher prices to its biggest customer, which could also finance the project. But despite the obvious economic benefits, the project has become a casualty of the ambivalence Mongolians feel about China's growing influence. Those feelings loom large over a Mongolian presidential election on Monday.  It's been left here for two years without any work,  said the governor of Tsogttsetsii district, Orgodol Badarch, pointing to a gravel surface where the rails should have been laid, stretching into the distance for more than 200 km (124 miles).   I'm not sure, but it may have to be rebuilt completely.  Voters will choose between an investment-friendly candidate and a populist  resource nationalist  rival in an election that is a referendum on both economic policy and China's role. China's share of Mongolia's foreign trade was 68.5 percent from January to May this year, up from 1.5 percent in 1989. China took 90.5 percent of Mongolia's exports from January to May.  China wants Mongolia's coal and copper, and has the cash to build the infrastructure to get it - if Mongolia allows it. Julian Dierkes, specialist in Mongolian politics at the University of British Columbia, said there was a lot of nationalist language in the party manifestos.  Most of this must be thinking of Mongolia as united, but also, in part, united against China, even if that is not explicit,  he said. Miyeegombo Enkhbold, standing for the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), is  open to foreign investment from all countries, that of course includes investment from China , a party official told Reuters.  The reality for today is we have the supply, China has the demand,  he said, while adding that Mongolia had to diversify and  reduce inappropriate dependence  on one country. Enkhbold's main challenger, from the Democratic Party, is a former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga, who has voiced suspicion about China's aims in a country that was under Chinese domination for centuries, until it gained independence in 1921. Battulga said in an emailed statement on Thursday that China  is and must be a great partner of ours , but added that  rail and transportation for any country is both a national security and an economic issue .  FILE PHOTO: A truck transports coals to the Chinese border in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence Edwards The resources will finish in 40 to 50 years and there will definitely be conflict between the Mongolians and the Chinese,  Battulga said in a 2014 television interview. Polling is not permitted during election campaigning, but in a March survey, 24.3 percent said the MPP could best solve problems compared with 10.6 percent for the Democratic Party. Politics of Rail Mongolia's economy has more than doubled in size since 2010, but some regions have seen little benefit and lack running water and reliable electricity. While growing trade has brought jobs to Tsogttsetsii, poor transport means Mongolian coal is sold at a discount. Deliveries to China earned $66 a ton in April, half the price of shipments from Australia. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a part of half-paved road that spans 225 kilometers from the Ukhaa Khudag and Tavan Tolgoi coal mines to the China-Mongolia border, in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence EdwardsThe railway track from Tsogttsetsii was meant to have been laid in 2014, but financing dried up. A tentative 2015 pact with China's Shenhua Group and Japan's Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) to develop the mine and the railway was blocked by parliament. Progress was not helped by disputes over the gauge.  Battulga, transport minister from 2008 to 2012, had favored the wider Russian tracks, arguing that the international standard would leave Mongolia dependent on China. He recently said he'd go along with whatever parliament decided. A century ago, Chinese warlords used railways to help colonize Inner Mongolia, and some Mongolian nationalists argue a cross-border link could help facilitate a Chinese invasion. Though driven by Chinese demand, and by a billion-dollar deal to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold deposit now run by Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L), Mongolia's 2011-2013 mining boom encouraged politicians to think about ways to minimize dependence on China, and they drew up plans for rail links to the Russian Far East.       Parliamentarians also passed legislation blocking investment by foreign state-owned firms, aimed at blocking plans by the China Aluminium Corporation (2600.HK)(601600.SS) to acquire the Mongolia-based SouthGobi Resources (SGQ.TO).   But Mongolia can't be choosy. The government has been forced to implement austerity measures to secure a $5.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in May. Ultimately, economic growth may hold more allure for voters than nationalism, said Sumati Luvsanvandev, head of the Sant Maral Foundation polling group.  Anti-China sentiment cannot bring support to Battulga. They are interested in economic prosperity,  he said of voters.   They may be suspicious, but they're also quite pragmatic.

The Nationals were 12-for-18 with runners in scoring position, had five doubles and two homers and forced the Reds to throw 206 pitches in eight innings. Washington began the day leading the league with a team batting average of .276 and league-best 114 homers. The Nationals scored 23 runs on April 30 against the New York Mets in a game that Ross started at home on a Sunday afternoon.  I haven't noticed that,  Washington center fielder Michael A.

There are not a lot of soft places to fall (in that lineup).  Washington scored a record 62 runs in the first four starts of the year for Ross (4-3), who gave up just one run on six hits in seven innings Saturday.

In this game, at this level, you never really know.

I just didn't pitch well today. That's all I can say.  Ryan Zimmerman began the festivities with a two-run double in the first to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. Washington then scored six in the second to grab an 8-0 advantage and send Bailey to the showers. Turner had an RBI single, Murphy had a three-run double and Anthony Rendon and Matt Wieters had RBI singles in the inning. Wieters had an RBI single in the fourth and later scored on an error to make it 10-0. Taylor added a two-run homer later in the fourth to make it 12-0. Murphy had a sacrifice fly in the fifth for a 13-0 lead. The Reds broke the shutout with a solo homer in the sixth by Patrick Kivlehan against Ross.

Fernandez' run, confirmed by a spokesman, comes a little over a week after she formed a new center-left party independent of Peronism, the Argentina's dominant political movement that she has belonged to for decades. While Fernandez enjoys strong support from many who consider her a champion of the poor, her break with Peronism divides the opposition and could help Macri's coalition make a strong showing in October.

Brandon Phillips, 35, homered for the third straight game and 42-year-old R.A. Dickey pitched seven strong innings to help the Braves extend their winning streak to four with a 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at SunTrust Park. Phillips was 2-for-4 and scored two runs, but it was his two-run homer that landed in the back of the left-field bullpen, his seventh, in the third inning that was the decider. Phillips was wearing special cleats with the name of his son, Micah, who celebrated his fourth birthday on Sunday.  It feels good to come home and play in front of my family and friends and just be with my babies all the time,  said Phillips, an Atlanta native who was acquired from Cincinnati in February. Dickey (6-5) gave up his only run in the first but settled down to complete seven innings, allowing five hits and one walk with six strikeouts. He retired the minimum from the second through fifth innings. Of the 99 pitches he threw, 71 were for strikes. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at BravesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch He was getting ahead of guys, working it both ways, more left to right than up and down, then the shadows creep in the middle of the game,  Milwaukee third baseman Travis Shaw said.  Throwing consistent strikes like that makes it tough.  Dickey has won four straight decisions at SunTrust Park and is 3-0 with an 0.86 in his last three starts there, with 20 strikeouts. He has now thrown seven innings in back-to-back games to help the weary Atlanta bullpen.  It wasn't maybe as good movement as I've had the last three games,  Dickey said.  I had a good enough one to be able to change speeds with and it was in the strike zone a large percentage of the game. Those things add up to a pretty good outing.  Jim Johnson worked a scoreless ninth inning, striking out two, for his 15th save. Atlanta (36-38) has won seven of its last eight and pulled within two games of .500 for the first time since April 29. Milwaukee's Matt Garza (3-4) pitched six innings and allowed three runs and seven hits with four strikeouts. The Brewers scored a run in the first inning. Keon Broxton and Domingo Santana singled and advanced on a double steal. Shaw walked to load the bases. Broxton scored on a fielder's choice and Dickey struck out Jett Bandy to end the threat.  We had a nice rally in the first inning but we didn't really generate anything after that, no scoring opportunities after that,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. The Braves tied it in the bottom of the inning. Phillips and Matt Adams singled and Phillips scored on an RBI single by Tyler Flowers. Atlanta added two more when Phillips delivered a two-run homer in the third inning when Garza left a changeup too high in the zone.  He just left something middle in, trying to go down and away,  Counsell said.  Matt's stuff got better as the game went along. He put up three zeros after home run. He ended up giving us a quality start, but not enough offense today.  Milwaukee (40-37) threatened in the eighth when reliever Jose Ramirez walked pinch hitter Eric Sogard. After retiring Broxton on a fly to center, Atlanta went to left-hander Sam Freeman, who struck out Eric Thames and Santana. NOTES: Milwaukee OF Nick Franklin was ejected in the first inning. Franklin, who was not in the starting lineup, could be heard blasting the umpires for allowing Atlanta an excessive amount of time to determine whether it would challenge a call on a pickoff play at first base. Home-plate umpire Ben May yelled back at Franklin,  I heard you.  But Franklin got the thumb from crew chief Jerry Meals, who was working second base.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Baltimore manager Buck Showalter wanted to see his starting pitching step up and Dylan Bundy responded, pitching seven solid innings as the Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 on Saturday at Tropicana Field.  It's an example of why we think so much of him makeup-wise. He gives up that three spot and just goes on about his business, doesn't implode and gets us deep into the game,  Showalter said after Bundy gave up two home runs on back-to-back pitches to tie the score in the third inning. The Rays (40-37) had bounced back to tie the score, but the Orioles (36-38) rallied with two outs in the seventh for four runs to break it open. Tampa Bay reliever Jumbo Diaz was one strike from getting out of a two-on, no-out jam, but the strike didn't come. Instead, Mark Trumbo hit a two-run double for a 5-3 lead and the next pitch was a two-run homer by Trey Mancini, putting the Orioles up 7-3. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at RaysBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch I don't think anybody hits a prettier line drive over the infield than Mark does,  Showalter said.  It's fun to watch when he squares it up. That was a big knock and some add-on runs as well.  The loss went to reliever Jose Alvarado (0-3), who faced one batter to open the seventh and walked him, setting up what was the go-ahead run. Baltimore had allowed at least five runs in 20 straight games, the first time any major league team has done that since the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies. The streak ended thanks to seven solid innings from Bundy (8-6). The Orioles jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the second inning against Rays rookie Jake Faria, who had allowed three earned runs in his first three major league starts. Faria hit Mancini and gave up a two-run homer to Welington Castillo. Baltimore added a solo home run in the third from Adam Jones. It bounced off the top of the wall in straightaway center, just above the reach of a leaping Mallex Smith.  They're a really good hitting team -- the two home runs they hit, those are mistakes that a good hitting team is not supposed to miss,  Faria said.  I've just got to work on execution, trying not to be too fine but not leaving pitches over the middle.  Tampa Bay needed just two pitches to tie it up in the bottom of the third. After a two-out walk to Smith, Corey Dickerson hit a two-run homer down the right-field line and Evan Longoria hit the next pitch for a solo shot, tying the score 3-3. The Rays have gone back-to-back 10 times this season, the most in the majors and already a team season record less than halfway through the year. Faria had his fourth straight quality start to open his career, giving up three runs and five hits in six innings, but he failed to win for the first time.  You go six, but the goal here is to go into the seventh, past the seventh,  Faria said.  Ultimately, if you don't come with the W, as a team, that's not really where we want to be.  Bundy was also sharp, pitching seven innings and holding the Rays to five hits and three runs. NOTES: The Rays made a long-awaited move at catcher, activating C Wilson Ramos from the 60-day disabled list and designating C Derek Norris for assignment. Ramos, recovering from ACL surgery last year, made his Rays debut batting sixth but went 0-for-3. ...

Spieth, who has led since the opening round in a campaign for his first win since the AT&T; Pebble Beach tournament in February, had three birdies over his last four holes for a four-under 66 to squeeze ahead of fellow American Boo Weekley. The closing charge by Spieth followed back-to-back bogeys from the 13th and put him at 12-under-par 198, while Weekley made five birdies in a bogey-free back nine including the last two holes to shoot 65 for an 11-under total. Three shots off the pace was American Daniel Berger (66), with C.T.

That was a loud roar and those are really fun to experience.  Spieth heard some other roars, notably at the par-five sixth where he holed out a chip shot for birdie and at the short par-four 15th where his tee shot settled in a greenside bunker and his sand shot stopped a couple of inches from making two for an eagle.

Franklin Barreto, Matt Olson and Jaycob Brugman hit their first career home runs -- marking the first time three teammates in the American or National League have accomplished the feat in a game -- to lead the A's in a 10-2 rout of the Chicago White Sox on Saturday afternoon.  That's pretty amazing, pretty amazing,  Brugman said.  Not only was that my first home run, but it was the first of two other guys that are really close to me. I couldn't be happier to share the day with those guys.  They're the second set of three teammates to hit their first major league home runs in a game since the Kansas City Packers' John Potts, Duke Kenworthy and Art Kruger did so in the Federal League on April 26, 1914, according to STATS and SABR HR Log.  I think everybody kind of looked around and said, 'Wow, I can't remember that ever happening before,'  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  We're not walking encyclopedias, but apparently it never has. Good feeling.  Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at White SoxOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchJames Shields allowed the three home runs in the first three innings. Olson hit a two-run shot in the first inning, Brugman connected for a solo shot in the second and Barreto drove a two-run shot in the third inning in his major league debut after he was called up from Triple-A Nashville earlier in the day.  These guys have fed off each other all the way through the system,  Melvin said.  They know each other really well and have won together. More the merrier at this point. For Barreto to come off a plane this morning and think he's not in the lineup and next thing he is in the lineup and do what he did is pretty amazing.  A's rookie Daniel Gossett (1-2) gave up two unearned runs in six innings, earning his first major league victory in his third career start.  As a pitcher, selfishly I reap the benefits of it because I can go out there and pitch a little more confident,  Gossett said.  To see Barreto get his first hit and other guys get their first home runs, it's really special for them and I'm glad I was part of it.  Shields (1-1) allowed six runs and seven hits before he exited with two on and no outs in the fourth inning. He was making his second start since coming off the disabled list for a strained right lat. His highlight was notching his 2,000th career strikeout to end the second inning.  I wasn't hitting my location with my fastball,  Shields said.  We're taxing the bullpen right now and the starters need to do a better job of going deeper in the game. I definitely didn't do my job today, going deep into the game, and that's something I've always prided myself on.  Olson added a two-run home run off Jake Petricka in the seventh for a 10-2 lead.  They said something about it was the first time it has happened in a while,  Olson said about the trio hitting their first home runs.  It's awesome to be able to share that moment with guys that I already built relationships with.  The A's have won two straight after ending a four-game losing streak while the White Sox have dropped five of their last six.  He didn't use that (breaking ball) as effectively as he did in Toronto,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said about Shields.  We were watching the game as it was developing and thought, man, if he starts to use his breaking ball a little bit more effectively it will help his fastball, the look of the fastball. He just never got to it. He got into a little trouble, left a couple pitches out over the plate that they got.  Melky Cabrera's single scored a run in the third and Tim Anderson's sacrifice fly in the fourth added another to cut the lead to 6-2. Both runs were unearned due to errors. Oakland committed three errors. The A's added two runs in the fifth on a single by Adam Rosales and a walk with the bases loaded. NOTES: The A's placed INF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) on the 10-day disabled list before Saturday's game against the White Sox. ... INF Franklin Barreto, the A's top prospect, was recalled from Triple-A Nashville to take Pinder's place. Barreto started at second base and batted seventh in the lineup after INF Jed Lowrie was scratched before the game. Lowrie twisted his right knee on Friday, manager Bob Melvin said. ... White Sox LHP Carlos Rodon (left biceps bursitis) is nearing a return from the disabled list. Manager Rick Renteria said Rodon will possibly make his next start with the White Sox after throwing 93 pitches Friday in a rehab outing at Triple-A Charlotte. Rodon doesn't need another rehab start, Renteria said. Rodon has been on the DL all season. ... The White Sox retired LHP Mark Buehrle's number in a pregame ceremony.

Renteria was also soon ejected. He has been ejected 10 times as a manager, including four times this season. ... RHP Nate Jones (right elbow neuritis) received clearance to throw. He felt good throwing Saturday, Renteria said. He has been on the DL since May 1. ... INF Tyler Saladino (back spasms) was cleared for activity and took ground balls.

Nearby stand the foundations of a railway meant to connect Tavan Tolgoi to China to the south. The unfinished line would enable cash-strapped, landlocked Mongolia to sell more coal at higher prices to its biggest customer, which could also finance the project. But despite the obvious economic benefits, the project has become a casualty of the ambivalence Mongolians feel about China's growing influence. Those feelings loom large over a Mongolian presidential election on Monday.  It's been left here for two years without any work,  said the governor of Tsogttsetsii district, Orgodol Badarch, pointing to a gravel surface where the rails should have been laid, stretching into the distance for more than 200 km (124 miles).   I'm not sure, but it may have to be rebuilt completely.  Voters will choose between an investment-friendly candidate and a populist  resource nationalist  rival in an election that is a referendum on both economic policy and China's role. China's share of Mongolia's foreign trade was 68.5 percent from January to May this year, up from 1.5 percent in 1989. China took 90.5 percent of Mongolia's exports from January to May.  China wants Mongolia's coal and copper, and has the cash to build the infrastructure to get it - if Mongolia allows it. Julian Dierkes, specialist in Mongolian politics at the University of British Columbia, said there was a lot of nationalist language in the party manifestos.  Most of this must be thinking of Mongolia as united, but also, in part, united against China, even if that is not explicit,  he said. Miyeegombo Enkhbold, standing for the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), is  open to foreign investment from all countries, that of course includes investment from China , a party official told Reuters.  The reality for today is we have the supply, China has the demand,  he said, while adding that Mongolia had to diversify and  reduce inappropriate dependence  on one country. Enkhbold's main challenger, from the Democratic Party, is a former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga, who has voiced suspicion about China's aims in a country that was under Chinese domination for centuries, until it gained independence in 1921. Battulga said in an emailed statement on Thursday that China  is and must be a great partner of ours , but added that  rail and transportation for any country is both a national security and an economic issue .  FILE PHOTO: A truck transports coals to the Chinese border in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence Edwards The resources will finish in 40 to 50 years and there will definitely be conflict between the Mongolians and the Chinese,  Battulga said in a 2014 television interview. Polling is not permitted during election campaigning, but in a March survey, 24.3 percent said the MPP could best solve problems compared with 10.6 percent for the Democratic Party. Politics of Rail Mongolia's economy has more than doubled in size since 2010, but some regions have seen little benefit and lack running water and reliable electricity. While growing trade has brought jobs to Tsogttsetsii, poor transport means Mongolian coal is sold at a discount. Deliveries to China earned $66 a ton in April, half the price of shipments from Australia. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a part of half-paved road that spans 225 kilometers from the Ukhaa Khudag and Tavan Tolgoi coal mines to the China-Mongolia border, in Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, June 12, 2017.Terrence EdwardsThe railway track from Tsogttsetsii was meant to have been laid in 2014, but financing dried up. A tentative 2015 pact with China's Shenhua Group and Japan's Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) to develop the mine and the railway was blocked by parliament. Progress was not helped by disputes over the gauge.  Battulga, transport minister from 2008 to 2012, had favored the wider Russian tracks, arguing that the international standard would leave Mongolia dependent on China. He recently said he'd go along with whatever parliament decided. A century ago, Chinese warlords used railways to help colonize Inner Mongolia, and some Mongolian nationalists argue a cross-border link could help facilitate a Chinese invasion. Though driven by Chinese demand, and by a billion-dollar deal to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold deposit now run by Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L), Mongolia's 2011-2013 mining boom encouraged politicians to think about ways to minimize dependence on China, and they drew up plans for rail links to the Russian Far East.       Parliamentarians also passed legislation blocking investment by foreign state-owned firms, aimed at blocking plans by the China Aluminium Corporation (2600.HK)(601600.SS) to acquire the Mongolia-based SouthGobi Resources (SGQ.TO).   But Mongolia can't be choosy. The government has been forced to implement austerity measures to secure a $5.5 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in May. Ultimately, economic growth may hold more allure for voters than nationalism, said Sumati Luvsanvandev, head of the Sant Maral Foundation polling group.  Anti-China sentiment cannot bring support to Battulga. They are interested in economic prosperity,  he said of voters.   They may be suspicious, but they're also quite pragmatic.

It was great to see those boys actually sailing a little bit better … these guys just sailed well and we’re just excited about the battle ahead,  New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling said following the rare defeat.

But although the New Zealanders got away, the U.S. champions recovered well and fought their way back into the race, finding the speed which had evaded them in previous encounters. At one stage comeback specialist Spithill managed to get a lead over Burling, but he was out-duelled and infringed the Kiwi  cat , incurring another penalty and allowing them to fly into the line on their space-age catamaran in front of a packed grandstand in Bermuda's purpose-built America's Cup Village. But in the second race there were no such errors and Spithill, who was wearing a bandage on his wrist after injuring it during a hard week's training, got away at the start. Burling and his crew fought hard to get back into the race and at one stage got a lead, only to be overtaken and ultimately left trailing in the wake of the U.S. boat as it screamed into the finish, to loud cheers from many Bermudan supporters.

The Blue Jays challenged the call, but umpire Joe West's safe call was not overturned after a 2-minute, 16-second delay. Eric Hosmer homered, his ninth, to start the fourth inning and put Kansas City up a run. Vargas had a runner on base every inning before working a 1-2-3 sixth. Pillar and Darwin Barney singled leading off Toronto's fifth, but Luke Maile popped up a sacrifice bunt attempt that Salvador Perez caught. Bautista rolled into a double play to end the inning. The Blue Jays tied it in top of the seventh when Pillar homered with two out. The Royals regained the lead in the bottom of the inning when Alex Gordon's first triple of the year scored Escobar.  Scored two runs, two solo home runs,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  That's the frustrating part of this. We need to pick it up; you know right now we're going a little bit backwards. We climbed close. We don't want to go that other direction.  Marco Estrada (4-6) took the loss, giving up three runs on five hits and four walks before being pulled after 117 pitches and seven innings.  Vargas, he's been tough this year,  Estrada said.  These things are going to happen, so, yeah, I felt pretty good out there. I was relaxed and made a lot of good pitches, but we still lost.  Kelvin Herrera picked up his 18th save, working around a two-out single to Tulowitzki and striking out two. The Royals moved to 37-36, their first time above .500 this year after losing 20 of their first 30 games.  I didn't realize that,  Vargas said.  It's great. Hopefully we just keep stringing them together and keep pushing ourselves further and further over that mark.  The Blue Jays (35-39) dropped to four games below .500.  It was nice to see Marco pitch well,  Tulowitzki said.  I think he's definitely headed in the right direction. Bottom line, try to win a game tomorrow and go back home. I think we have only one road series before the All-Star break. Play good at home and get ourselves back into this thing.  NOTES: LF Steve Pearce returned to the Blue Jays lineup after being sidelined the previous two days with a bruised right knee. ... Closer Roberto Osuna is dealing with anxiety and was unavailable to pitch Friday when the Blue Jays' bullpen allowed four runs with two out in the ninth in a 5-4 loss. ...

The advance in the central Souq al-Hout neighborhood was the latest step in the slow progress of the self-styled Libyan National Army commanded by Khalifa Haftar, which has been waging a campaign against Islamists and other opponents in Libya's second city for more than three years. In unusually heavy fighting in Benghazi over the past two days at least 13 men from the LNA were killed and 37 wounded, a medical official said. Many of those who died were killed by land mines, a military source said. Along with Sabri, Souq al-Hout was one of the final holdouts of the LNA's rivals. Since 2014, shifting alliances have been battling for power. The LNA and an eastern-based government have rejected a U.N.-backed government that has been in the capital, Tripoli, since last year.  Saturday's advance came after the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), an anti-Haftar armed group that includes fighters who retreated from Benghazi and have since tried and failed to advance again toward the city, said it was prepared to disband and be integrated into national security forces.

May, prime minister for less than a year, has been badly damaged by her failure to win a parliamentary majority in a June 8 election and is still working to persuade a small northern Irish party to support her Conservatives in government.   Hammond was sidelined for months by May during the election campaign and had been widely expected to be fired after the vote. But the party's poor showing has propelled him back into the spotlight. Citing some members of May's top team, or cabinet, the Sunday Times said Hammond should be appointed as a caretaker prime minister to see the country through until 2019 when it officially leaves the European Union.  Brexit minister David Davis should be named as his deputy, the newspaper quoted sources as saying.   I think Philip is the only plausible candidate for a couple of years, with DD (David Davis) running Brexit,  the paper quoted a serving minister as saying.   He is a more credible caretaker than the current prime minister. The PM's brand is so damaged it is painful. The calculation that people are beginning to make is that she is so inadequate we can't wait two years with her in place.  A former cabinet colleague was quoted by the paper as saying that Hammond believed he could do the job. Not all cabinet members were in agreement however, with some backing Davis and others favoring Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  A spokesman for May's Downing Street office declined to comment.

After the 2010 season as a Chicago Cubs minor leaguer, Bibens-Dirkx figured he might as well get work playing baseball in the offseason. So, he headed to the winter league in Venezuela and began not only getting experience but also learning how to pitch effectively. It took nearly seven more years for the experience of his offseason employment in Latin America to pay off in a major league setting, but it did Saturday when Bibens-Dirkx allowed a run and five hits in seven effective innings for the Texas Rangers in an 8-1 victory over the New York Yankees.  More experience for one,  Bibens-Dirkx said.  It's better pay than in the minor leagues. You make literally nothing, half the time you pay to play. It was a little boost. I was going to have go get a job anyway, might as well go do baseball.  In the winter leagues in front of festive crowds, Bibens-Dirkx made 63 starts and won a pair of championship rings. He began going there five years into a professional career that started when he was a 16th-round pick by the Seattle Mariners in 2006. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at YankeesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchIt was those experiences that made pitching in Yankee Stadium for the first time easy to handle and it showed for someone who including winter leagues and independent baseball has pitched for 21 teams. Bibens-Dirkx (3-0) tied his career high for distance and did it on another big stage against a divisional leader. Nearly two weeks after allowing one run and three hits in seven innings against the National League East-leading Washington Nationals, Bibens-Dirkx was equally as effective.  It is remarkable,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said.  When you think about that, 12 years of experience and he's been all over the place. He's pitched in a number of different places where some guys wouldn't want to go to try to hone their craft. For him to be as calm as he is out on the mound, I really think he draws off of that experience.  In his estimation, Bibens-Dirkx only made two mistakes. The first was a four-pitch walk to Mason Williams to begin his fourth career start. It occurred after the Rangers scored a run in a 16-minute inning off Luis Cessa (0-2), and the 32-year-old right-hander said it was from not loosening up better while his teammates were batting. The second was a 1-1 pitch to slugger Aaron Judge with one out in the sixth. The pitch turned into a 439-foot homer over the left-center field fence.  I'll remember the home run. Aaron Judge is a very large human being and he's very strong,  Bibens-Dirkx said. After Judge's major league-leading 26th home run, Bibens-Dirkx quickly finished the sixth with two groundouts and was even quicker in the seventh. He gave up a single to Didi Gregorius but two pitches later was in the dugout accepting congratulations from his teammates after Tyler Austin bounced into a double play and Ronald Torreyes flied out.  It just seemed like he stayed off the barrel of the bat with some sliders changeups and cutters,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We weren't really able to square him up today.  By then the Rangers held a 4-1 lead on an RBI single in the first by Elvis Andrus, a two-run homer by Carlos Gomez in the fourth and a solo homer by Robinson Chirinos in the seventh. Texas then broke it open in the ninth against struggling reliever Tyler Clippard and did not need a save situation. Gomez scored on a wild pitch, Shin-Soo Choo ripped a two-run double and Andrus capped the scoring. Judge's 26th homer was the lone highlight for the Yankees, who lost for the ninth time in 11 games. Cessa yielded three runs and three hits in five innings but Clippard permitted four more runs, making it 11 earned runs allowed in his last seven appearances.  He's really in a funk and we've got to get him out of it,  Girardi said. NOTES: Texas RHP Yu Darvish played catch Saturday morning and reiterated he expects to make his next scheduled start after feeling tightness in his triceps on Friday. ... New York 3B Chase Headley missed his third straight game with back spasms. ... LHP Cole Hamels will be activated by Texas from the disabled list for Monday's start in Cleveland. ... 1B Tyler Austin became the fifth player to start a game at first base for the Yankees after being recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ...

Both sides reaffirm that they will strive for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,  a consensus document released by the official Xinhua news agency said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had said on Thursday that the United States pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea, during his meeting with top Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs. China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui met Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during the talks. Yang later met with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, where they also discussed North Korea, Xinhua reported. The consensus document also highlighted the need to fully and strictly hold to U.N. Security Council resolutions and push for dialogue and negotiation, which has long been China's position on the issue. Military-to-military exchanges should also be upgraded and mechanisms of notification established in order to cut the risks of  judgment errors  between the Chinese and U.S. militaries, the statement also said.

A day last week's talks, President Donald Trump said China's efforts to use its leverage with North Korea had failed, raising fresh doubts about his administration’s strategy for countering the threat from North Korea. The death of American university student Otto Warmbier earlier this week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, further complicated Trump’s approach to North Korea. China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has been accused of not fully enforcing existing U.N. sanctions on its neighbor, and has resisted some tougher measures.  Washington has considered further  secondary sanctions  against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with North Korea, which China opposes.

Ainslie has signed up to a framework agreement with the U.S. and other teams which would mean the event is held every two years in catamarans similar to those being raced in Bermuda. But things could change if New Zealand triumph as the winners decide the format of the next cup and the Kiwis are the only team not to have signed up to the deal.  Sailing - America's Cup finals - Hamilton, Bermuda - June 24, 2017. Sailor Ben Ainslie speaks during an interview with Reuters during the America's Cup finals.Mike SegarNew Zealand lead the U.S. team 4-1 in the first-to-seven final and a win for them would mean that they have the right to change the type of boat used, as well as the venue and the timing of the next event, which has raised alarm bells for some teams that face losing sponsorship if there is uncertainty.   I don't have the fears that suddenly we'll go to New Zealand ...and it'll take the Cup back to the Dark Ages,  a tanned and bearded Ainslie said. Challenger in Waiting? Ainslie, often viewed as a voice of reason in a sport dominated by big personalities, did not rule himself out as the  challenger of record  for the 36th America's Cup, a key part of the process for the trophy, which dates back to 1851 when it was won off the south coast of England by the schooner  America . He does, however, feel that the competition would be better sticking with its current format, including the foiling 50-foot catamarans, which have provided exciting high-speed racing with plenty of lead changes and drama.   I think the foiling multihulls have proven to be great for the spectators and the sailors love them and that would be a shame to move away from that.  he said.  Regardless of who wins, Ainslie is calling for a quick decision on the format to keep the momentum from Bermuda and is a strong advocate of the World Series lead-up event, which has boosted support for fans and broadcasters. Ainslie and his team are going back through the lessons learned from their first tilt at the America's Cup.  Looking back we needed to take more time to make key decisions in our strategy. This time around I'm much more confident that having the financing in place and a core team that puts us in a much stronger position,  he said.

British officials have conducted tests on some 600 high-rise buildings across England after fire ravaged the Grenfell social tower block in west London on June 14, killing at least 79 people in the capital's most deadly blaze since World War Two. The Department for Communities said 34 apartment blocks had failed tests in 17 parts of the country, from London in the southeast to Manchester in the north and Plymouth on the southwest coast.  Prime Minister Theresa May, who was forced to apologize for the government's initial slow response to the tragedy, said the authorities were now racing to establish what needed to be done.   In some cases it's possible to take mitigating action,  she told Sky news.  In others it's been necessary for people to move out on a temporary basis and that is what happened in Camden last night.  Some 4,000 residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, were told to vacate their apartments on Friday after the Fire Brigade ruled that their blocks were unsafe.  Emerging into the streets on a hot night, residents clutched children, pets and small amounts of clothing and food to try to find a bed in a local hotel or with family or friends. Many were directed to inflatable beds laid out on the floor of the local sports hall.  Related CoverageUK firefighters battle blaze at low-rise building in east London I know it's difficult but Grenfell changes everything,  Georgia Gould, Leader of Camden Council, said in a statement.  I don't believe we can take any risks with our residents' safety.  May said the local authority would be given all the means necessary to make sure people had somewhere to stay.  Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door-to-door. Not all residents agreed to go, as they felt the evacuation was an over-reaction.

You don't get everyone to leave this quickly.  Several local councils said they were removing cladding from the facades of buildings that had failed the tests. In Camden, however, the London Fire Brigade found a number of faults, including concern about cladding, faulty fire doors and holes in compartment walls that could help a fire to spread.      Gould, the Camden council's leader, said it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated.  Slideshow (16 Images)Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was working with local authorities and fire services to address any problems that had been found.   We are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole; and we have issued interim safety guidance,  he said.  Police investigating the cause of the 24-story Grenfell Tower blaze have said the fire started in a fridge but spread rapidly due to external cladding on the building, trapping residents in their beds as they slept.  The cladding has since failed all safety checks and prompted a nationwide review of the materials used on everything from hospitals to hotels and apartment blocks. The fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at the record of May's Conservative Party in government following cuts to local authority budgets designed to lower the national deficit. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, one of the richest boroughs in Europe.  Battling to save her position after losing her majority in a June 8 election, May has promised to do everything she can to protect those residents who survived the fire and to improve the quality and safety of public housing in Britain. British police have said they are considering bringing manslaughter charges over the Grenfell fire.

The e-commerce giant would need to add a large network of specialized grocery distribution warehouses, former AmazonFresh employees and logistics experts said. This is something Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other competitors have already done. Whole Foods, with a relatively small distribution footprint of its own, does little to change the picture for Amazon, they said. Amazon has a little more than 3 million square feet of U.S. warehousing dedicated to its existing AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry grocery programs - a tenth of the warehouse space Wal-Mart has for specialized food distribution, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.  AmazonFresh really was for lack of a better word an after-thought,  said Brittain Ladd, who until March was a senior manager for the grocery delivery program, which launched in 2007. One key to Amazon's success in general retail sales has been its speed in delivering products to consumers, facilitated by warehouses located strategically throughout the United States. As of 2016, the company had about 100 million square feet of space in its fulfillment and data centers, some of it outfitted with state-of-the-art robotics to boost efficiency. Facilities for distributing fresh food are far more complicated than ordinary warehouses. A single facility can need a half dozen or more temperature settings to house products from Popsicles to berries. Some require certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and extra care must be taken to keep shelves clean and prevent pests from contaminating food. Whole Foods has over 1 million square feet of warehouse space for distribution to its markets, and a chunk of its inventory goes straight from suppliers to stores, MWPVL said.  The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol It's a peanut. It's nothing,  MWPVL President Marc Wulfraat said of Whole Foods' distribution.  If Amazon wants to become a dominant grocery company in a short period of time, then there would be an investment required, and it would be big.  Amazon, which did not return requests for comment, has not detailed its plans for Whole Foods. 12 or More Grocery Warehouses Needed Amazon's fulfillment expenses jumped 31 percent in 2016 - a bit faster than in prior years and faster than its retail sales growth - to $17.6 billion, according to its annual regulatory filing. Industry experts estimate the company would have to add a dozen or more grocery warehouses, particularly if it wanted to supply Whole Food stores in addition to homes. The cost to do that is unclear. They said Amazon would likely continue to rely on United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI.O) to supply Whole Foods with hard-to-source products, but would probably aim to cut costs and handle more of the distribution for conventional items. Even using Whole Foods stores to provide food for delivering  to nearby urban shoppers would have hard limits, since many outlets lack the floor space to handle thousands of online orders.  It’s a space issue for stuff coming through. It’s a labor issue for people tripping over each other,  said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. There would also be a risk that  the quality starts to go down because the e-commerce orders are getting better product.

The Red Sea islands accord has become politically sensitive for Sisi. He counts on Saudi Arabia as a key ally, but street protests broke out over the agreement last year among Egyptians angered over the concession. Egypt's parliament last week backed the deal handing control of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Saudi Arabia, but it has also become the subject of a legal tussle between different courts over jurisdiction.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ratified the maritime demarcation agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  the cabinet said in a statement. The announcement was made just as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends and on the eve of Eid al-Fitr festivities, a major public holiday when Egyptians are busy preparing to spend time with their families. The presidency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Government lawyer Rafiq Sharif told Reuters the decree was now law and the two uninhabited islands were under Saudi sovereignty.  All court decisions on the agreement were temporarily suspended this week by the head of the constitutional court, until it makes a ruling on which institution had the final say. Parliamentary leaders and government lawyers say the House of Representatives is the only entity allowed to rule on sovereignty. But in June last year the country's highest administrative court ruled Egypt's sovereignty must stand. Sisi's government announced the maritime agreement last year with Saudi Arabia, an ally which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt. The Egyptian and Saudi governments said the islands are Saudi but have been subject to Egyptian protection. FILE PHOTO: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi delivers a statement at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France November 26, 2014.Philippe Wojazer/File PhotoSaudi Arabia had helped Sisi since he toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, and legal wrangling over the Red Sea deal was a source of tensions between the two countries. National Pride After last year's administrative court ruling, Saudi Arabia temporarily halted fuel shipments to Egypt, part of its aid deal. At the time, both sides denied any political fallout was involved and relations have since improved.  The transfer has been a long time coming; Riyadh has made it clear they expect the islands and Cairo agreed,  said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at American think tank Atlantic Council.  But considering the amount of opposition to the transfer, the speed at which it happened is instructive. It shows Sisi's administration doesn't feel there is much of a risk to be taken.  Still, Egyptians are increasingly critical over the state of the country's economy after years of political upheaval and a devaluation, tax rises and subsidy cuts introduced by Sisi's government. The islands issue touched a patriotic nerve, bringing thousands of protesters to the streets in April chanting  people want the fall of the regime , a slogan little heard since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Those rallies were one of the first signals the former general no longer enjoyed the broad public support that let him round up thousands of opponents after he seized power.  Now that the president has ratified it, the agreement is a law,  said Khaled Ali, chief lawyer defending the case for the islands being Egyptian and a former presidential candidate.  So we will continue the legal battle to show that it is unconstitutional and void.

It was nothing more than an inconvenience, though, as Croatian Cilic broke in the seventh game of the decider and powered to victory, sealing it with a second-serve ace. Cilic, set to move to a career-high ranking of six, will now have the chance to win the title in more orthodox fashion than in 2012 when his opponent, Argentina's David Nalbandian, was defaulted for injuring the leg of a line judge when kicking out at a hoarding in anger.  A title is a title,  he joked.  They still say 17 titles. They don't say 16 and a half. But it's great to be back in the final for a third time, playing great tennis.

Dismissed as a left-wing no-hoper before elections on June 8, Corbyn attracted a surge of support from 18-24 year-olds that helped his Labour Party deny Prime Minister Theresa May a parliamentary majority. The 68-year old's popularity at Worthy Farm in south-west England could be measured by the number of pro-Corbyn banners on display and Corbyn T-shirts. They easily outnumbered those for the biggest names on the musical bill - Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran - and the chant  Oh, Jeremy Corbyn  rang round the world's biggest greenfield festival. Appearing between British singer-songwriter Craig David and U.S. rap act Run The Jewels, Corbyn - who promised during campaigning to abolish tuition fees -  said he was proud to have led Labour into an election that delivered the biggest increase in the party's support since 1945.  But what was even more inspiring was the number of young people who got involved for the very first time because they were fed up with being denigrated, fed up with being told they don't matter (and) fed up with being told they never participate,  he said to cheers from the crowd.  And that politics that got out of the box isn't going back into the box.  Corbyn, invited to speak on the famous stage by festival founder Michael Eavis, said Glastonbury was about people coming together in support of causes like environmentalism.

Even if it wasn't the youth 'what won it', the engagement among young people has shot up,  he said.  If it can be sustained, it's a sea change in British politics because it means that all parties will have to take their views into account.   An undercurrent of politics also swirled around the Other Stage, where former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher ended his set by asking the crowd to join in a rendition of  Don't Look Back in Anger  in memory of the victims of recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, and the Grenfell Tower fire. Pollster Ipsos Mori said week that age had been a bigger dividing factor on June 8 than in any election since it began keeping records in 1979, with the biggest rise in turnout coming from the young, although they were still far less likely to vote than the old.

Portugal's all-time leading scorer swept the ball home in the 33rd minute, his 75th goal for his country, and Bernardo Silva added the second four minutes later.  A solo effort from Andre Silva, his eighth goal in 11 appearances, in the 80th minute and a stoppage-time goal from substitute Nani completed the scoring.      It was a typically efficient performance from Portugal who never looked in real danger despite a sluggish start. However, it was not all good news as Bernardo Silva went off injured at halftime, while a needless and reckless challenge from Pepe, with his side 2-0 up, earned the controversial central defender his second yellow card of the tournament, ruling him out of Wednesday's semi-final.  It was an odd game - we were in control, but they started creating problems, and if it had got back to 2-1, it could have got complicated,  said Portugal coach Fernando Santos. New Zealand goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic, who helped Unterhaching win promotion from the German fourth division last season, kept the score down with a superb second-half display. The Oceania champions were far from disgraced but have now competed in the tournament four times without winning a game and have an overall record of 11 defeats and a draw in 12 matches.

Portugal topped Group A with seven points from three games, ahead of Mexico on goal difference after the CONCACAF champions beat hosts Russia 2-1. New Zealand finished bottom of the group after losing all three games. Ronaldo had already headed against the crossbar before firing Portugal ahead after Danilo went tumbling under a challenge from two defenders and the referee pointed to the spot without asking for a video replay. Bernardo Silva turned Eliseu's low cross into the net four minutes later, although he suffered a knock on the ankle in the process.     Marinovic made impressive saves to deny Ronaldo, Andre Silva and Nani but was powerless stop Andre Silva when he collected the ball on the halfway line, ran at two defenders who backed off, and fired his shot into the far corner.

(Reuters) - A Tennessee jury on Friday found a former Vanderbilt University football player guilty of raping an unconscious female student in a teammate's dormitory room in 2013. The Nashville jury found Brandon Banks, 23, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery after deliberating for about 15 hours over two days. The case stoked simmering concern about sexual assault on college campuses by athletes. Banks faces at least 15 years in prison, Assistant District Attorney Roger Moore told media. Sentencing will be Aug. 18.  We are very satisfied with their verdict,  Moore said. Defense attorney Mark Scruggs did not respond to a request to comment. He was quoted by The Tennessean newspaper as saying that Banks was  shocked but understands that this is only the first part of this process. There's a lot more to do from here on.  Teammates Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey, two of the four former Vanderbilt football players charged in the case along with Banks, were found guilty when tried together in January 2015 but a mistrial was declared.  Batey was later retried, convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Vandenburg was found guilty in June 2016 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. A fourth player, Jaborian “Tip” McKenzie, who testified against his three teammates, has yet to stand trial in the case. The players used cell phones to record their crimes, and those videos - shown to the jurors in all the trials – played crucial roles in the prosecution’s case. Vandenburg and the victim, who had been dating, met for drinks at a bar popular with Vanderbilt students. Both had been drinking prior to meeting, according to testimony. Vandenburg tried to take the victim, who was unconscious, to her apartment, but could not get in. He then took her back to his dormitory, where the other three men charged in the case helped cart her to his room, which was the site of the attacks, prosecutors said.  The victim, who has not been named, testified against all three men for their roles in the rapes. Banks testified in his own defense and said he was intimidated by the other players and participated because he was scared of retribution that night and later on the football field.

On the surface the 28-year-old has the A-game for the All England Club's lawns -- a mighty serve, bludgeoning groundstrokes and, for a such a tall man, nimble court coverage. Yet he has never got past the quarter-finals and last year faltered from two sets up against Roger Federer, squandering three match points in an epic last-eight clash. With the grasscourt season in full swing, though, there are signs that Croatian Cilic, who will rise to a career-high ranking of six on Monday, has rediscovered the killer instinct that saw him sweep to the 2014 U.S. Open title when he beat Federer in the semis before overpowering Japan's Kei Nishikori. At Queen's Club on Saturday, where he won the title in 2012, Cilic reached the final of the Aegon Championships with an impressive 6-3 5-7 6-4 defeat of Gilles Muller, who had been on a seven-match winning streak on grass. With coach Jonas Bjorkman sitting courtside, Cilic clearly meant business, with observers remarking how  fired up  he was throughout the contest -- not something that has always been associated with the Monte Carlo-based giant.  I'm being a little bit more motivated, and that is driving me a little bit more to be aggressive on the court, which is extremely important in my own sense,  Cilic said. Some of his statistics this week have been remarkable. He won 50 of his 51 first-serve points during his first two rounds at Queen's -- either with unreturnable deliveries or, when the ball did come back, punishing forehands. Against Muller he served 20 aces and dropped only four points on first serve, making that 10 for the week. His conversion of break points (two of 13) was disappointing but proof that Cilic's return game, against one of the game's best servers, is also in fine fettle. Swede Bjorkman, a fine exponent of grasscourt tennis, has even encouraged Cilic to play more doubles to make him more confident at the net, and that paid dividends at Queen's where Cilic and Marcin Matkowski reached the doubles final. Confidence Under Pressure  That was a goal,  Bjorkman says.  To get a bit more comfortable up there. It's one thing doing it in practice but playing competitive doubles helps you have that confidence to do it when the pressure is on.  With his run to the Queen's final after losing in the semis on the grass of Den Bosch last week, Cilic will have only the  big five  ahead of him in the ATP rankings. But he wants more.  The target is top five,  he said.  All those top-five guys are definitely amazing players so to even be close is a great challenge and big motivation.  I know I can match them, but during the course of the year, it was difficult for me to keep it up. But I think I'm getting closer to that consistency level. That's the biggest step.

The decision, confirmed by three U.S. officials, would break with longstanding protocol at the State Department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the Trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights.  Tillerson overruled his own staff’s assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in Asia and the Middle East who wanted to keep Iraq and Myanmar on the list, said the officials, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations. Tillerson also rejected an internal State Department proposal to add Afghanistan to the list, the three U.S. officials said. One official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the Pentagon to avoid complicating  assistance to the Iraqi and Afghan militaries, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamist militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving U.S. military aid, training and U.S.-made weapons unless the White House issues a waiver. Human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting, which was expected to be announced on Tuesday, the officials said, as part of the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. A State Department official said the TIP report's contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department  does not discuss details of internal deliberations.  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that  no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  in order for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume. In the lead-up to Tuesday's report, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which researches the issue and helps shape U.S. policy on it, along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in Asia and the Middle East concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list, the officials said. Officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last-minute changes. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference after talks with Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs at the State Department in Washington, U.S. June 21, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBetraying Children Human Rights Watch said removing Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list would be a  completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses.  The decision also would put the Trump administration at odds with the United Nations, which continues to list the Myanmar military, along with seven ethnic armed groups, on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers.  What's particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the U.N. in Burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited  by the Myanmar military, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Rights groups have long accused Myanmar of using child soldiers. Bordering both China and India, Myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the United States at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by China, which has sought closer relations with its neighbor. Iraq, which has received more than $2 billion in U.S. arms and training over the last three years, was added to the State Department’s  Child Soldier Prevention Act List  in 2016. However, the flow of U.S. assistance has continued. Former President Barack Obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly, including last year to Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and others out of 10 countries on the list. Last year's State Department report said some militias of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Shi'ite Muslim factions with ties to the Iraqi government and backed by Iran,  recruited and used child soldiers.  The report said that despite the PMF being funded by the government, Baghdad struggled to control all of its factions.  The government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the PMF and PMF-affiliated militias.      Human Rights Watch said in January that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one Iraqi refugee camp since last spring.     The broader TIP report, the first of Trump's presidency, is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his  America First  approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments, especially strategically important ones, for human rights violations at home. The Obama administration, while more vocal about political repression around the world, also faced criticism from human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers that decisions on annual human trafficking rankings had become increasingly politicized.

David Vallenilla, 22, was shot at close range by a military police sergeant on Thursday, apparently with rubber bullets, as youths tried to pull down the fence around an air force base in Caracas and threw rocks at officials who had fired tear gas from inside. Maduro's critics said the killing was further evidence of abuse by security forces after protests since April by demonstrators demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the South American country amid a deepening economic and political crisis. At least 75 people have been killed in the protests so far, according to an official count on Friday. The victims include Vallenilla and another youth killed on Monday near the same base. In both incidents, soldiers were caught on camera with guns pointing at the protesters.   I want to speak to my former colleague of the Caracas Metro, Nicolas Maduro, you know that we worked together, I'm Supervisor Vallenilla ... I was your boss,  said the slain protester's father, also named David Vallenilla, referring to the years when Maduro worked as a bus driver.  I want to make sure this is resolved Nicolas, please, he wasn't a criminal, he was a graduating student ... please friend,  the elder Vallenilla told reporters outside a morgue as tears streamed down his face.  You met him when he was little.  Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the link between Vallenilla and Maduro. Maduro, who makes frequent reference to his former job as a bus driver to highlight his working-class roots, calls the protests an effort to violently remove him from office with the backing of ideological adversaries in Washington. However, the president condemned the latest  painful  deaths and ordered a newly promoted general to make sure that  nobody else falls.  Speaking at a Friday event where he gave new positions to several military officials, Maduro said,  The use of firearms is prohibited and I ratify the prohibition.

Barricades Opposition leaders have vowed to remain in the streets to demonstrate against what many are now calling a dictatorship and to demand a solution to economic crisis that has created chronic shortages of staple goods and left millions struggling to eat. Slideshow (13 Images)The crisis has brought strong words from world leaders and diplomatic efforts to build dialogue between Maduro and his critics. At Maduro's insistence, Venezuela is due to elect a new popular assembly next month to rewrite the constitution. Critics say Maduro will use it to consolidate power and keep adversaries in jail. Around Caracas on Friday, demonstrators burned tires and blocked roads while chanting slogans that included  No To Dictatorship  and  Murderer, Maduro  to protest Vallenilla's death.  We don't have weapons, the only option we have is to shut down the country,  said Joselyn Almeida who walked out of her office with colleagues to join around 100 people in blocking a main avenue in the upscale district of Las Mercedes. Officials say the recent wave of street protests across Venezuela, often resulting in vandalism, have arbitrarily restricted free transit and commerce and even prevented ambulances from reaching hospitals. A group of demonstrators on Friday returned to the spot where Vallenilla was killed. They set three trucks on fire and pushed one of them against the fence of the air base, which they later partially tore down. Opposition leaders said the demonstrators were not part of the broader protest and insisted the incident was staged by the government to tarnish the protest movement.

The British driver dominated the practice sessions on Baku's street circuit last year before clipping the barriers during qualifying and starting the race 10th on the grid, ultimately finishing fifth. However, his strong showing on Saturday – coupled with an underwhelming fourth-placed qualification by rival Sebastian Vettel, of Ferrari – opens the door for Hamilton to win his fourth Grand Prix of the season. Hamilton currently sits second in the drivers' championship standings, but cut Vettel's lead to 12 points after winning the Canadian Grand Prix earlier this month and could overhaul him in Sunday's race.

His two-run double with two-out in the ninth gave the Royals a 5-4 victory over the Blue Jays. The Royals had been 0-29 when trailing after eight innings this season before Merrifield's double. RHP Jake Junis allowed two runs on six hits, two walks, a wild pitch and a balk over 6 1/3 innings in a no-decision.  I thought Jake threw the ball well,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  The fourth inning there, kind of got himself into a little bit of trouble. A walk, and a wild pitch, didn't help his cause.  But, six-and-a-third strong innings kept us in the ball game and gave us a chance to win the ballgame.  RHP Neftali Feliz, who was released Monday by the Brewers, was signed by the Royals and added to their bullpen. Feliz was 1-5 with a 6.00 ERA in 23 relief appearances with Milwaukee. He went 8-for-9 in save situations, but lost the closer's job. Manager Ned Yost said initially he would use Feliz in low pressure situations since he has not pitched in nine days. He gave up a run on a homer in one inning on June 13, his final Brewers' appearance. Before that on June 11, he faced four Arizona batters and retired none, giving up two hits, including a home run, and walking two. The Royals are confident pitching coach Dave Eiland can fix Feliz mechanically.  It's not a risk, a low risk, high reward type of thing,  Yost said on picking up Feliz. He said Feliz is healthy and still possesses a 97 mile per hour fastball. LHP Danny Duffy will start Saturday for Triple-A Omaha to begin a minor league release assignment. He is on the disabled list with an oblique strain. Manager Ned Yost said they need to build up Duffy's pitch count to around 90 before bringing him back.

He is hitting .451 in that stretch since June 5 with six doubles, four home runs and a dozen RBIs. RHP Chris Young, who has been struggling since being an essential part of the Royals' 2015 World Series pitching staff, was designated for assignment. Young went 11-6 with a 3.06 in 2015 and was 1-0 with a 2.87 ERA in four postseason appearances, including two starts. He was the winning pitcher against the Mets in the World Series opener. Since then Young is 3-9 with a 6.52 ERA, allowing 86 earned runs in 118 2/3 innings.  It was hard, but it was the right thing to do,  Royals general manager Dayton Moore said of releasing Young.

Ramirez has reached safely in his last 24 home games, the longest active streak in the American League and second-longest in the AL this season. 2B Dustin Pedroia, who missed the three games in Kansas City after getting hit in the back with a pitch in Houston last Sunday, was a late addition to the starting lineup with Josh Rutledge nursing a sore hip.

He responded by going 0-1 with a 2.35 ERA with 23 strikeouts and only four walks in 15 1-3 innings at Triple-A Reno, where his final eight appearances were scoreless. De La Rosa was called up Friday and came on in the seventh inning to strike out Aaron Altherr, the only hitter he faced.

It was nice to see.  1B Paul Goldschmidt continues to help his all-star candidacy. He leads the NL with 64 RBIs -- a category he last led in 2013, with 125 RBIs -- and also leads in on-base percentage. Over his last 16 games, he is hitting .433 (26-for-60) with six doubles, five homers and 21 RBIs. He's also reached base safely in a club-record 39 consecutive games at Chase Field. RHP J.J. Hoover allowed only one run in his last seven appearances, the latest of which was one-third of an inning Thursday at Colorado, but still was placed on the 10-day disabled list Friday with right shoulder inflammation. He is 1-0 with a 4.18 ERA in 23 2-3 innings this season.  It's something that's been nagging and bothering him. He's been trying to grind through it, but we figured it was the best thing for him at this moment, to let him get ahead of things,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  It's going to be a little time down to rest the shoulder and get some strength back.  There is no immediate timetable for the former Reds pitcher's return. OF Jeremy Hazelbaker was optioned to Triple-A Reno after the Friday night's loss, despite his .318 batting average. The Diamondbacks said a corresponding move would be made Saturday. Hazelbaker, a former Cardinals outfielder, struck out as a pinch-hitter with the Diamondbacks down 2-0 to the Phillies in the eighth inning.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6O29XQAU"},

The Cubs' first-round pick in 2015 -- taken ninth overall out of the University of Cincinnati -- Happ was moved up to third in the batting order on Friday. Last month, Happ became the first Cubs player in 34 years to homer in both his first road game and first home game. He was also the first Cubs player since at least 1913 to score at least one run in seven of his first eight career games.

Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill.  We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.   This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,  Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. Related CoverageFactbox: Where Republican U.S. senators stand on healthcare billThat could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010.

Four Conservatives Oppose Bill On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Slideshow (3 Images)Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.   It's not that they're opposed,  he said.  They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that.  Trump said getting approval would require traveling a  very, very narrow path  but that  I think we're going to get there.   It's going to be a good bill,  Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday.   For the House of Representatives' version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders.  Trump later criticized the House bill privately as  mean  and this week called for a health plan  with heart.  He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.

It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. March organizers said the ban was effectively legitimizing what they called the hate crimes of groups like Alperen Hearths, and urged the governor to reverse the decision. The governor's emphasis on public order and safety was an effort to distort the image of a planned peaceful march, they said in an online statement headlined:  We are Marching, Get Used to It. We are Here, Not Going Away . The gay pride parade in Istanbul -- a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq -- has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organizers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan.   While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded an external forensic audit of the debt last year following revelations about the previously hidden loans granted to three state-owned companies in 2013 and 2014. Discovery of the unapproved credits to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM) led the IMF and Western donors to halt budget support to Mozambique, triggering the collapse of the local currency and debt defaults as well as hitting economic growth. In a 57-page summary of the audit, risk management firm Kroll Inc said officials in the southern African country had given inconsistent answers about how $500 million earmarked for the tuna fishing company had been spent.  Gaps remain in understanding how exactly the USD 2 billion was spent, despite considerable efforts to close this gap,  the audit summary said.  Until the inconsistencies are resolved, and satisfactory documentation is provided, at least USD 500 million of expenditure of a potentially sensitive nature remains unaudited and unexplained.  Explanations on how the $500 million was spent included that the money was integrated into the national budget and that it was used to purchase military equipment, Kroll said. The Mozambique attorney general's office acknowledged the findings of the audit and said it would work with the international community to resolve the issues raised. The audit showed Credit Suisse and Russia's VTB Capital -- lead arrangers for the loans -- were paid a total of $199.7 million in fees. Kroll also found there was no evidence provided that any assessment took place before the signing of three government guarantees with a combined value of $1 billion and potential conflict of interest issues were identified. The state-owned companies also lack some basic infrastructure necessary for their operations, the audit showed.  Proindicus does not have an operational satellite package, EMATUM does not currently have permits for the fishing vessels, and MAM has only recently obtained access to a shipyard in Maputo that is undergoing an upgrade to enable the maintenance of vessels,  the audit said. The IMF said it would visit Mozambique from July 10-19 to discuss concerns raised by the debt audit.  The publication of these documents constitutes an important step towards greater transparency regarding the loans,  the Fund said in a statement.  However, information gaps remain, in particular on the use of the loan proceeds. An IMF staff mission will visit Mozambique ... to discuss the results of the audit with the authorities and possible follow-up actions.

The 13-point list of demands from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE include closing the Al Jazeera satellite television network, curbing relations with Iran, shutting a Turkish base in Doha and paying reparations. The demands are apparently aimed at dismantling Qatar's two-decade-old interventionist foreign policy, which has reflected the clout generated by its vast natural gas and oil wealth but incensed conservative Arab peers over its alleged support for Islamists they regard as mortal threats to their dynastic rule. Doha said it is reviewing the list of demands and that a formal response will be made by the foreign ministry and delivered to Kuwait, but added that the demands are not reasonable or actionable.   The alternative is not escalation, the alternative is parting of ways, because it is very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping,  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told reporters.  He said diplomacy with Qatar remained a priority, but added that mediation efforts to resolve the dispute had been undermined by the public disclosure of the demands.  The mediators' ability to shuttle between the parties and try and reach a common ground has been compromised by this leak,  he said.  Their success is very dependent on their ability to move but not in the public space.  Gargash said that if Qatar fails to comply within the 10-day timeline set out in the ultimatum, it will be isolated. But he did not make clear what more could be done since the four Arab nations have already cut diplomatic relations with Doha and severed most commercial ties. The most powerful Middle Eastern country to stand with Qatar in the dispute has been Turkey, which has rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Doha as a sign of support. Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived in Doha since the worst crisis among Gulf Arab states for years erupted on June 5.  Gargash said the Turkish deployment was a  meaningless escalation  and he hoped Ankara would act in a  reasonable way .  We hope that Turkey prioritizes the interest of the Turkish state and not partisan ideology,  Gargash said.  Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party, and Qatar have been the main backers of the Muslim Brotherhood movement that challenges Arab rulers.  Kuwait is helping mediate the dispute as is the United States, for which it has posed a challenging test since Qatar hosts a base housing the headquarters of U.S. air power in the Middle East as well as 11,000 troops. The Sunni Muslim Arab group that imposed the sanctions on Qatar accuse it of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their Shi'ite Muslim enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian rulers. The uncompromising positions adopted by both sides leave little prospect for a quick end to the crisis. The sanctions have disrupted Qatar's main import routes by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But Qatar so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative channels and says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges.

Twice Wimbledon champion Kvitova, playing in just her second tournament of the year, was 6-1 1-0  up at the Edgbaston Priory Club when her Czech compatriot pulled out. Kvitova will face Australian Ashleigh Barty who upset Spain's Garbine Muguruza 3-6 6-4 6-3 in the other semi. Kvitova is looking in impressive shape after her absence from the sport following a hand injury caused by a knife attack during an attempted robbery at her home in December. She returned to action in the French Open, going out in the second round, but she has been confident and sharp on her favorite surface. Kvitova won Wimbledon in 2011 and again in 2014 and she is clearly buzzing with anticipation for the return to the All England Club which she has called her  home .  I couldn't have imagined to have a better comeback than I am having now. Paris was a bit weird and strange, and I couldn't play the best over there,  she said.   I am happy that I am able to show good tennis here. I played four matches already, so it's a good record and good preparation for the final.

I am not feeling any pain, and that's the best news.  Safarova was the latest player to withdraw in the latter stages of the WTA event. On Friday, American Coco Vandeweghe retired with an ankle injury in her quarter-final against Muguruza. Slideshow (3 Images)In another last-eight game Barty also had a walkover, with Italian Camila Giorgi retiring with a leg injury in the first set.  The Australian, ranked 77th in the world, then made the most of the opportunity as she beat the 2016 French Open champion and 2015 Wimbledon finalist Muguruza to earn a chance to win a second WTA title. The match turned when Barty broke at 2-2 in the second set after the Spaniard had looked comfortable.  I didn't really get a look in on her serve in the first set and once I knew I was in with a shot it was a little bit of a different story,  said Barty. Muguruza saved two match points in the final set as she battled hard but after recovering from her first set reverse, the Australian, who has also played national level cricket in her homeland, looked in command by making great use of the slice.  For me it is important to use my slice on the grass and I love coming out here, slicing away and getting a bit of purchase on the ball and I was able to do that and it was really pleasing  she said.

The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have gained significant ground in the battle for Raqqa, the operational base for Islamic State over the past three years and a symbol of its self-proclaimed caliphate. Senior SDF figures predict Raqqa could fall within months. That would be a severe blow to Islamic State, which has plotted shooting and bomb attacks around the world from Raqqa, a city of about 300,000 before the militants seized it.  The 83 Islamic State prisoners were transported to the headquarters of the Raqqa City Council in the village of Ain Issa, north of Raqqa, in an amnesty coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  One by one, they stepped down from buses, the youngest 14 years old.

Sweets were handed out on trays in the sweltering heat, in what officials hoped would be the start of a new chapter in the men's lives. Speakers forecast a brighter future for Syria, which has been locked in a multi-sided civil war for six years involving regional powers and a U.S.-led coalition whose air strikes put Islamic State on the defensive.

We are giving these men a second chance.  On the street outside the council, he told the Islamic State members, some of whom had surrendered, that they would be integrated into society and given a chance to attend schools. Speeches were followed by applause from all sides. The men walked past council members and shook their hands, before tasting freedom and reuniting with their families.

There were no opportunities before they arrived,  he said. The amnesty may be one small step towards easing tensions that run deep in Raqqa after three years of ruthless Islamic State occupation, followed by war.  Council officials acknowledge they face huge challenges in rebuilding a city with a traumatized population and devastated infrastructure. Abdel Rahman Kalas, 43, worked in the Islamic State department that imposed taxes on Raqqa citizens.  I have seven children,  he said, as former militants walked away after the ceremony to face the uncertainty that hangs over Raqqa.  I had no choice but to cooperate. They paid me $115 a month.

Reconciliation is the term the government uses for local deals with rebels for them to either disarm and accept its rule or to leave with small arms for other insurgent areas.   They have been released after promising not to do anything against the nation's security or stability,  Justice Minister Hisham al-Shaar was quoted as saying by the official SANA news agency.   He said most of the prisoners were from Damascus but there were others from across Syria, indicating the release was not linked to a particular deal regarding one rebel-held area.  SANA did not report what the freed detainees had been put in prison for, but some of those released told Reuters they were arrested for actions they took against the government.  Syria's opposition says reconciliation deals are forced on areas after prolonged sieges and intense bombardment. The United Nations has warned they may be used to force people from their homes.  President Bashar al-Assad has said he sees them as a way to reduce fighting in Syria and bring to an end the six-year conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made millions homeless.

The FIA stewards said in a statement that twice Formula One world champion Alonso had another 25-place grid penalty added to his previous sanction of 15 grid places after changing his car's Honda engine for a seventh time this season. Drivers are permitted to use a maximum of four engines per season. In a separate statement, the FIA said Alonso's team mate Vandoorne has had his grid penalty extended to 30 places after the same offense. Vandoorne's use of a seventh Turbo Charger (TC) and seventh Motor Generator Unit Heat during the third practice session means he drops 15 grid positions, added to the 15-place penalty he incurred earlier in the week.

It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. March organizers said the ban was effectively legitimizing what they called the hate crimes of groups like Alperen Hearths, and urged the governor to reverse the decision. The governor's emphasis on public order and safety was an effort to distort the image of a planned peaceful march, they said in an online statement headlined:  We are Marching, Get Used to It. We are Here, Not Going Away . The gay pride parade in Istanbul -- a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq -- has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organizers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan.   While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.

The excessive rigidity of Brazil's labor legislation is creating an enormous burden for citizens, who end up paying more for the goods and services they buy, said Roberto Setubal, the co-chairman of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA. Speaking at an event sponsored by XP Investimentos SA, Setubal said political turmoil is unlikely to ease in coming months, posing challenges to President Michel Temer's ambitious economic reform agenda. Successful policymaking has so far help mitigate those risks, he said.  People need to understand that reforming an outdated labor code is good for business but, ultimately, for consumers, who are overburdened by market inefficiencies,  Setubal said at the event. His remarks underscore how political problems are delaying efforts by Brazilian business leaders to regain competitiveness in the face of a bloated state structure and rigid industry rules. Temer wants to pass a pension and tax code reforms, aside from the labor plan.

The state, ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has decided to write off debts up to 150,000 rupees ($2,326) for 8.9 million farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Saturday. The state will settle farmers' loans with banks, making 90 percent of farmers eligible for fresh borrowing, Fadnavis said. Earlier this month, the state had announced that it would write off loans of all farmers after striking farmers cut milk and vegetable supplies to cities like Mumbai. Modi, who had promised to double farmers' incomes over five years, remains a popular leader three years into his term. But unrest has flared in states ruled by his party, catching regional leaders flat-footed. In the central state of Madhya Pradesh five farmers were shot dead during protests earlier this month. India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh in April decided to waive $5.6 billion of farm loans, while northern state of Punjab earlier this week decided to write off $1.5 billion of loans to farmers. Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. Economists at Merrill Lynch estimate that states will end up writing off debts equivalent to 2 percent of GDP - the bulk of all outstanding loans to farmers.

The Noida International Airport near New Delhi will be built from scratch in phases and is expected to cater to 30-50 million passengers per year (MPPA) over the next 10-15 years, the civil aviation ministry said in a statement. Air travel in India, one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, has boomed in the last decade as it opened up to competition, ticket prices were slashed and the number of people wealthy enough to travel swelled. Air traffic in New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport is expected to reach up to 91 MPPA in next three years and touch its peak handling capacity of 109 MPPA by 2024, the statement said, highlighting the need for a second airport near the capital city.  We have granted in-principle approval for a greenfield airport at Jewar (Greater Noida) to cater to the growing flying requirements of NCR,  Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said in a tweet. NCR, or the National Capital Region, encompasses Delhi and several surrounding districts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan states. The new airport in Greater Noida in northern Uttar Pradesh state, will be 72 kms (about 45 miles) away from New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. The 3,000 hectare (7,400 acre) airport will have one runway in its initial phase, adding three more in subsequent phases. The state government along with Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority will bear the land procurement cost. Contracts for this public-private partnership project will be awarded after competitive bidding, the statement said. Most of India's 40 largest airports will exceed their design capacity within a decade based on projected growth rates, consultancy CAPA estimates, with Mumbai and Chennai fast approaching saturation. India's government plans to open 50 disused airports by 2020, and has given approval for 18 greenfield airports. Delays in acquiring land, as well as the inability of debt-laden domestic airport operators such as GMR Group and GVK to invest, have stymied expansion proposals.

The emails, dating from 2014 and seen by Reuters, were between Deborah French, Arconic's UK sales manager, and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for the refurbishment contract at Grenfell Tower in London, where 79 people died in a blaze last week.     When asked about the emails, Arconic said in a statement that it had known the panels would be used at Grenfell Tower but that it was not its role to decide what was or was not compliant with local building regulations.      The company manufactures three main types of Reynobond panel-- one with a polyethylene (PE) core, one with a fire retardant core and another with a non-combustible core, according to its website.     Diagrams in a 2016 Arconic brochure for its Reynobond panels describe how PE core panels are suitable up to 10 meters in height. Panels with a fire resistant core -- the FR model -- can be used up to 30 meters, while above that height, panels with the non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used, the brochure says.     Grenfell Tower is more than 60 meters tall.     The brochure also issued a blunt warning that cladding can be a fire risk.       When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly,  the brochure said.        As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material.    Nonetheless, between May and July 2014, French, who was based at Arconic's factory in Merxheim, France, responded to requests from the companies involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower on the availability of samples of five different types of Reynobond aluminum-covered panels, all of which were only available in the combustible PE and FR versions, according to Arconic brochures.     In the end, Arconic said on Friday, the company provided PE panels.    While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts,  the company said in an emailed statement in response to the Reuters enquiry.  The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire are devastating, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragedy ... We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,  the statement said.       French did not respond to requests for comment.     Arconic, which was known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, declined to say if it knew how tall the tower was and the emails seen by Reuters do not specifically refer to its height. They do, however, refer to  Grenfell Tower  and mention other high rise projects where paneling has been used when discussing the appearance that was being sought for Grenfell Tower.      Arconic also knew the quantity of panels being supplied and thus the total exterior coverage. A source at one of the companies involved in the process said Arconic had  full involvement  throughout the contract bidding process. Omnis Exteriors, which cut the Arconic tiles to shape and supplied them to the cladding contractor, said it was not responsible for the choice of panel.  CEP played no part in the selection of Reynobond PE and simply fulfilled the order as directed by the design and build team,  the company said in a statement on Saturday, referring to CEP Architectural Facades Ltd, the Omnis unit which fulfilled the contract. Harley Facades Ltd., the company which installed the panels, Rydon Group, the overall contractor on the 2014-2016 Grenfell refurbishment, and the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns the tower block all declined to comment.     Rydon previously said in a statement that its work on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was intended to give the building better heat and sound insulation, complied with all building regulations. Harley said last week it was  not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower .     In the emails, French and representatives of Harley and Rydon also discuss the choice of panel models and colors and how they were inching towards securing the contract with the local authority.      Harris did not respond to requests for comment.     On Sunday, British finance minister Philip Hammond said the type of panels used, which are cheaper than non-combustible panels, were banned for use in high rise buildings in Britain, as they are in Europe and the United States. Omnis said combustible Reynobond PE material was safe to use on high rise buildings if the insulation material usually put behind the panels was made of incombustible material such as mineral fiber. Some safety experts say the regulations are not black and white. The UK uses a 'principles-based' approach to regulation which puts an onus on companies to operate safely, based on common understanding of risks and the technology available. This differs to the highly specific 'rules-based' approach to regulation taken in the United States.  Supporters of the principles-based approach say it avoids the emergence of loopholes and means companies have to take account of new information on risks immediately, rather than wait for a new regulation to be drafted. The fatal fire was started by a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer in one of the apartments, London police said on Friday.

The Noida International Airport near New Delhi will be built from scratch in phases and is expected to cater to 30-50 million passengers per year (MPPA) over the next 10-15 years, the civil aviation ministry said in a statement. Air travel in India, one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, has boomed in the last decade as it opened up to competition, ticket prices were slashed and the number of people wealthy enough to travel swelled. Air traffic in New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport is expected to reach up to 91 MPPA in next three years and touch its peak handling capacity of 109 MPPA by 2024, the statement said, highlighting the need for a second airport near the capital city.  We have granted in-principle approval for a greenfield airport at Jewar (Greater Noida) to cater to the growing flying requirements of NCR,  Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said in a tweet. NCR, or the National Capital Region, encompasses Delhi and several surrounding districts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan states. The new airport in Greater Noida in northern Uttar Pradesh state, will be 72 kms (about 45 miles) away from New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. The 3,000 hectare (7,400 acre) airport will have one runway in its initial phase, adding three more in subsequent phases. The state government along with Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority will bear the land procurement cost. Contracts for this public-private partnership project will be awarded after competitive bidding, the statement said. Most of India's 40 largest airports will exceed their design capacity within a decade based on projected growth rates, consultancy CAPA estimates, with Mumbai and Chennai fast approaching saturation. India's government plans to open 50 disused airports by 2020, and has given approval for 18 greenfield airports. Delays in acquiring land, as well as the inability of debt-laden domestic airport operators such as GMR Group and GVK to invest, have stymied expansion proposals.

The e-commerce giant would need to add a large network of specialized grocery distribution warehouses, former AmazonFresh employees and logistics experts said. This is something Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other competitors have already done. Whole Foods, with a relatively small distribution footprint of its own, does little to change the picture for Amazon, they said. Amazon has a little more than 3 million square feet of U.S. warehousing dedicated to its existing AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry grocery programs - a tenth of the warehouse space Wal-Mart has for specialized food distribution, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.  AmazonFresh really was for lack of a better word an after-thought,  said Brittain Ladd, who until March was a senior manager for the grocery delivery program, which launched in 2007. One key to Amazon's success in general retail sales has been its speed in delivering products to consumers, facilitated by warehouses located strategically throughout the United States. As of 2016, the company had about 100 million square feet of space in its fulfillment and data centers, some of it outfitted with state-of-the-art robotics to boost efficiency. Facilities for distributing fresh food are far more complicated than ordinary warehouses. A single facility can need a half dozen or more temperature settings to house products from Popsicles to berries. Some require certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and extra care must be taken to keep shelves clean and prevent pests from contaminating food. Whole Foods has over 1 million square feet of warehouse space for distribution to its markets, and a chunk of its inventory goes straight from suppliers to stores, MWPVL said.  It's a peanut. It's nothing,  MWPVL President Marc Wulfraat said of Whole Foods' distribution.  If Amazon wants to become a dominant grocery company in a short period of time, then there would be an investment required, and it would be big.  Amazon, which did not return requests for comment, has not detailed its plans for Whole Foods. 12 or More Grocery Warehouses Needed Amazon's fulfillment expenses jumped 31 percent in 2016 - a bit faster than in prior years and faster than its retail sales growth - to $17.6 billion, according to its annual regulatory filing. Industry experts estimate the company would have to add a dozen or more grocery warehouses, particularly if it wanted to supply Whole Food stores in addition to homes. The cost to do that is unclear. They said Amazon would likely continue to rely on United Natural Foods Inc to supply Whole Foods with hard-to-source products, but would probably aim to cut costs and handle more of the distribution for conventional items. Even using Whole Foods stores to provide food for delivering to nearby urban shoppers would have hard limits, since many outlets lack the floor space to handle thousands of online orders.  It’s a space issue for stuff coming through. It’s a labor issue for people tripping over each other,  said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. There would also be a risk that  the quality starts to go down because the e-commerce orders are getting better product.

The emails, dating from 2014 and seen by Reuters, were between Deborah French, Arconic's UK sales manager, and executives at the contractors involved in the bidding process for the refurbishment contract at Grenfell Tower in London, where 79 people died in a blaze last week. When asked about the emails, Arconic said in a statement that it had known the panels would be used at Grenfell Tower but that it was not its role to decide what was or was not compliant with local building regulations. The company manufactures three main types of Reynobond panel -- one with a polyethylene (PE) core, one with a fire retardant core and another with a non-combustible core, according to its website. Diagrams in a 2016 Arconic brochure for its Reynobond panels describe how PE core panels are suitable up to 10 metres in height. Panels with a fire resistant core -- the FR model -- can be used up to 30 metres, while above that height, panels with the non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used, the brochure says. Grenfell Tower is more than 60 metres tall. The brochure also issued a blunt warning that cladding can be a fire risk.  When conceiving a building, it is crucial to choose the adapted products in order to avoid the fire to spread to the whole building. Especially when it comes to facades and roofs, the fire can spread extremely rapidly,  the brochure said.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material.  Nonetheless, between May and July 2014, French, who was based at Arconic's factory in Merxheim, France, responded to requests from the companies involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower on the availability of samples of five different types of Reynobond aluminium-covered panels, all of which were only available in the combustible PE and FR versions, according to Arconic brochures. In the end, Arconic said on Friday, the company provided PE panels.  While we publish general usage guidelines, regulations and codes vary by country and need to be determined by the local building code experts,  the company said in an emailed statement in response to the Reuters enquiry.  The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire are devastating, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragedy ... We will fully support the authorities as they investigate this tragedy,  the statement said. French did not respond to requests for comment. Arconic, which was known as Alcoa Inc until 2016, declined to say if it knew how tall the tower was and the emails seen by Reuters do not specifically refer to its height. They do, however, refer to  Grenfell Tower  and mention other high rise projects where panelling has been used when discussing the appearance that was being sought for Grenfell Tower. Arconic also knew the quantity of panels being supplied and thus the total exterior coverage. A source at one of the companies involved in the process said Arconic had  full involvement  throughout the contract bidding process. Omnis Exteriors, Arconic's UK distributor, Harley Facades Ltd., the company which installed the panels, Rydon Group, the overall contractor on the 2014-2016 Grenfell refurbishment, and the local authority which owns the tower block all declined to comment. Rydon and Omnis have previously said in statements that their work on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was intended to give the building better heat and sound insulation, complied with all building regulations. Harley said last week it was  not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower . In the emails, French and representatives of Harley, Omnis and Rydon also discuss the choice of panel models and colours and how they were inching towards securing the contract with the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC). Harris did not respond to requests for comment. RBKC declined to comment. At the weekend, British finance minister Philip Hammond said the type of panels used, which are cheaper than non-combustible panels, were banned for use in high rise buildings in Britain, as they are in Europe and the United States. Safety experts say the regulations are not black and white as they consider the overall safety of a project, taking account of how the safety measures taken interact. This 'principles-based' approach is different to the highly specific 'rules-based' approach to regulation taken in the United States. The fatal fire was started by a faulty Hotpoint fridge-freezer in one of the apartments, London police said on Friday. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said insulation on the building, and the cladding panels, had failed safety tests carried out after the disaster. The police investigation was considering the possibility of manslaughter and criminal offences in respect of the fire.

It will be the second year running that Istanbul's LGBT march, described in the past as the biggest in the Muslim world, has been blocked by city authorities. The ultra-nationalist Alperen Hearths group threatened last week to prevent the march if authorities did not act, and the governor's office said on Saturday that it took its decision out of concern for the security of marchers, tourists and residents. The organisers of the march said they would discuss their response later on Saturday. The gay pride parade in Istanbul - a city seen as a relative safe haven by members of the gay community from elsewhere in the Middle East, including refugees from Syria and Iraq - has usually been a peaceful event. But two years ago police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse participants, after organisers said they had been refused permission because it coincided with the holy month of Ramadan. While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.

Minnesota posted a 5-0 victory in the opener of the three-game set after losing four straight home games to the Indians last week and eight of the first 10 meetings. Second baseman Brian Dozier went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and shortstop Jorge Polanco hit a two-run homer on Friday as the Twins survived without slugging third baseman Miguel Sano (sinus infection).

Experts on Islamist groups see no clear successor but regard Iyad al-Obaidi and Ayad al-Jumaili as the leading contenders, though neither would be likely to assume Baghdadi's title of  caliph , or overall commander of Muslims. Russia's defense ministry said last week Baghdadi may have been killed in an air strike in Syria and Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian parliamentarian on Friday as saying the likelihood that he had been killed was close to 100 percent. But armed groups fighting in the region and many regional officials are skeptical about the reports.   We don't have any concrete evidence on whether or not he's dead either,  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the international coalition battling Islamic State, told a Pentagon briefing.  Obaidi, who is in his 50s, has been serving as war minister. Jumaili, in his late 40s, is head of the group's Amniya security agency. In April Iraqi state TV said Jumaili had been killed, but that was not confirmed.  Related CoverageU.S.-led coalition unsure if Islamic State's Baghdadi dead or aliveBoth joined the Sunni Salafist insurgency in Iraq in 2003, following the U.S.-led invasion which Saddam and empowered Iraq's Shi'ite majority. They have been Baghdadi's top aides since air strikes in 2016 killed his then deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, his Chechen war minister Abu Omar al-Shishani and his Syrian chief propagandist, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.  Jumaili recognizes Obaidi as his senior but there is no clear successor and, depending on conditions, it can be either of the two (who succeeds Baghdadi),  said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises several Middle East governments on IS affairs. Baghdadi awarded himself the title of caliph - the chief Muslim civil and religious ruler, regarded as the successor of the Prophet Mohammad - in 2014. Obaidi or Jumaili would be unlikely to become caliph because they lack religious standing and Islamic State has lost much of its territory.  No  Land to Rule   They don't belong to the Prophet Mohammad's lineage. The group has no longer 'a land to rule' or 'Ardh al-Tamkeen'. And none is well versed in Islamic theology,  said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, another Iraqi expert on the extremist group.   A caliph has to have an Ardh al-Tamkeen, which he rules in  accordance with Islamic law. Failing that, the successor will just be recognized as the emir,  said Hashimi.  Emir is Arabic for prince, and is a title that jihadists often use to describe their leaders.  By contrast, Baghdadi, born as Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai' in 1971, comes from a family of preachers and studied Islamic law in Baghdad.  The appointment of the new leader would require the approval of an eight-member shoura council, an advisory body to the caliph. But its members would be unlikely to meet for security reasons so would make their opinion known through couriers.  Six members of the council are Iraqis, one Jordanian and one  Saudi, and all are veterans of the Sunni salafist insurgency. A ninth member, the group's Bahraini chief cleric, Turki al-Bin’ali, was killed in an air strike in Syria on May 31. In Washington, two U.S. intelligence officials said they believed Islamic State had moved most of its leaders to al-Mayadin in Syria'a Euphrates Valley, southeast of the group's besieged capital there, Raqqa. Among the operations moved to al-Mayadin, about 80 km (50 miles) west of the Iraqi border, were its online propaganda operation and its limited command and control of attacks in Europe and elsewhere, they said.

The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday adopted a China-led resolution on  The Contribution of Development to the Enjoyment of All Human Rights, the first time it had adopted a resolution on development issues, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The resolution was co-sponsored by more than 70 countries, Xinhua reported.  For a long time, the international rights process and conversation has been monopolized by Western governments,  the People's Daily said in a Saturday editorial.  Some people from the West often use the pretense of human rights to export their own values and even to use them to meddle in other countries' internal affairs,  it added. Overview of the United Nations Human Rights Council is seen in Geneva, Switzerland June 6, 2017.Denis Balibouse The inclusion of the concept of 'development promoting human rights' into the international human rights system signifies a major shift in the global human rights conversation,  the paper said. China has long faced criticism over its poor human rights record from international bodies and Western governments, which speak out against stifling of civil society, as well as censorship and detention of rights lawyers and activists. Beijing regularly rejects foreign criticism, saying that the definition of rights used by the West is too narrow and ignores the effort China has made on poverty alleviation and securing the rights to education and freedom from hunger. In the face of regular pressure from the U.N. rights council, China has sought to gain the support of other U.N. members, often developing nations, on rights issues to redress what it sees as shortfalls in the current system. Last week, Greece blocked a European Union statement to the council criticizing China's human rights record, a decision EU diplomats said undermined efforts to confront Beijing's latest crackdown on dissent. China has previously refused to allow in some U.N.-appointed envoys and others who were allowed to visit have complained of government interference with their work, though the government pledged to cooperate with the body in September last year.

LeJ's Al Alami faction said in a statement it was targeting minority Shi'ite Muslims and threatened more attacks over Pakistanis fighting against Sunni militants in Syria's civil war. Video footage after the attack showed civilians dragging bleeding victims outside to waiting ambulances in the chaos that came when the bombs exploded before the sundown meal breaking the daily Ramadan fast.  We have received 50 bodies so far, and 250 were wounded,  said Sabir Hussain, medical superintendent of Parachinar Hospital. Sixty of the seriously wounded had been transferred to the larger city of Peshawar, he added. LeJ Al Alami, which has previously partnered with Middle East-based Islamic State to carry out attacks in Pakistan, said it has previously  warned the Shia community of Parachinar ... to stop staining your hands with the blood of Sunnis in Syria . It repeated the demand in the statement, saying that  otherwise in the coming days you will face such hate-fueled and deadly attacks that you will not be able to stand them . Hundreds of Pakistanis - many of them Shi'ites believed recruited by Iran - have gone to fight in Syria to defend the government of Tehran's ally, President Bashar al-Assad.  Assad's government is also supported by Russian air strikes and fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, against an array of Sunni rebels backed by Turkey and Arab states. The United States, Turkey, Arab and European powers are also participating in a coalition bombing Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim militant group. The market bombings in Parachinar late on Friday afternoon came on a particularly deadly day for Pakistan as both Sunni and Shia Muslims prepared to mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Another bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta killed 13 people and a drive-by shooting killed four police officers in the southern megacity of Karachi on Friday. Both of those attacks were claimed by another militant group, the Jamaat ur Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban. Islamic State also claimed the Quetta attack through a messaging network. It had not commented on the Parachinar attack by Saturday afternoon. Sunni-majority Pakistan also has a sizeable Shi'ite minority and has sought to avoid being dragged into sectarian strife that is rife in Syria and also the recent rift between Qatar and Saudia Arabia-led Sunni states that have cut off ties with Doha in part over its relations with Iran. Pakistan's military said late Friday it had tightened security across the country, including at the Afghan border, following the attacks.  Enemy trying to mar festive mood of nation through such coward acts. Shall fail against resilience of Pakistan,  Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was quoted as saying in a tweet from the chief military spokesman.

The deployment last January to practice winter warfare and cross-country skiing, and to participate in joint exercises, marked the first foreign troops to be stationed in the NATO member country since the end of World War Two.

Some 330 Marines will be stationed in Norway until the end of 2018, the government said on Wednesday, doubling the length of what was initially billed as a one-year trial period.  The deployment last January to practice winter warfare and cross-country skiing, and to participate in joint exercises, marked the first foreign troops to be stationed in the NATO member country since the end of World War Two.  We consider that this step contradicts Norwegian policy of not deploying foreign military bases in the country in times of peace,  the Russian embassy wrote in an statement to Reuters.

Norway has downplayed the significance of the deployment, emphasizing the training element and denying that the arrival of Marines was an act directed against Russia. The U.S. troops are stationed some 1,500 km (900 miles) from the Russian border.  A high level of regular allied presence creates a stabilizing state of normality in times of peace, which contributes to deterrence and defence,  Norwegian Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a June 21 statement. The center-right minority government's decision received broad support from Norwegian opposition parties, but was criticized by the far left.

The UAE is part of a Saudi-led Arab alliance that intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to roll back Iran-allied Houthi forces that drove Hadi into exile. His government has since regained a presence in the south based in Aden but the Houthis still hold most of the north including the capital Sanaa. Reports of secret prisons where detainees are abused relate to areas of the south where UAE forces and its allies have also swooped against al Qaeda militants, who have exploited the war to try to carve out areas of control and influence. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch reported that it had documented the cases of 49 people, including four children, whom it said were arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared in Aden and Hadramout over the last year. Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed bin Daghr said he had set up a six-member committee headed by the justice minister to investigate  human rights allegations in liberated areas .  The committee starts work from today and sends its report to the prime minister within 15 days,  the order, dated June 22, said. The committee's duties were to investigate the abuse allegations, ways to respond to them and to put forth mechanisms to deal with any such issues in the future. The HRW report said that at least 38 of those held appear to have been arrested by security forces backed by the UAE.  You don't effectively fight extremist groups like al Qaeda or ISIS (Islamic State) by disappearing dozens of young men and constantly adding to the number of families with 'missing' loved ones in Yemen,  Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. It also said that at least two of 11 informal prisons identified by researchers are run by the UAE, while the others are run by UAE-backed Yemeni security forces. On Friday, the UAE Foreign Ministry denied running any secret prisons in Yemen and called the accusations  an attempt to sully the reputation of the alliance that had intervened to save the Yemeni people .  This issue is in the hands of the legitimate Yemeni authorities, while the coalition forces provide the necessary training for Yemeni cadres in line with the best legal practices,  the ministry said in a statement.

PNG has been hit hard by a slump in oil and gas prices and a 2016 drought that crippled farming and brought production at its largest copper mine to a halt. The country’s credit rating was downgraded to B2 by Moody’s in April last year, reflecting ongoing balance of payments pressures that have been compounded by the slump in global commodity prices. Despite that, Prime Minister Peter O’Neill is in a strong position to retain power, although experts say elections in the South Pacific nation are hugely unpredictable. “You have to treat this as 111 separate elections because what matters to the voters in most areas is incredibly local issues - what services are getting sent to them from their local member,” said Jonathan Pryke, a research fellow in the Lowy Institute's Melanesia program. (There are 111 seats in the PNG parliament.) Despite its mineral wealth, which includes Exxon Mobil's $20 billion LNG plant, most of Papua New Guinea's nearly eight million people live at subsistence level on islands, atolls and in remote mountain villages. A total of 3332 candidates - including 165 women - from 44 political parties will contest the election.  O'Neill, who came to power in 2012 promising to rein in corruption, has faced allegations he authorized millions of dollars in fraudulent payments to a leading law firm. In 2014, an anti-corruption watchdog issued an order for his arrest over the incident, which O'Neill denies. He refused to comply and stripped the watchdog of funding. Opposition politicians have harshly criticized the prime minister over his economic management, which has been marked by deficit spending. O’Neill finished up campaigning on Friday by visiting remote villages in his home district of Ialibu-Pangia in Southern Highlands Province. “We still have some weeks of voting and formation of Government, and I call on all candidates and members of the public to continue to maintain the same calm and peaceful approach to voting,” he said in a statement. Violence and corruption, most notably vote-buying, have been a feature of elections in Papua New Guinea since it gained independence from Australia in 1975. Australia is working closely with PNG to support the election, seconding experts from the Australian Electoral Commission and deploying 200 defense force personnel in Port Moresby, the capital.  It has also deployed military aircraft to deliver election materials to remote communities.  Electoral observers from Commonwealth nations are in the country to observe the election.   The official result is due by July 24.  Reporting by Harry Pearl; Editing by Eric Meijer","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-papua-election-idUSKBN19F07O"},

Pham Minh Hoang, a 61-year-old activist and mathematics lecturer, had dual French and Vietnamese citizenship before Vietnam canceled his citizenship without giving a reason, a move that drew criticism from human rights groups.  Despite sweeping reforms to the economy and growing openness to social change, the Communist Party retains tight media censorship and tolerates no criticism. Dozens of bloggers and activists are serving sentences for crimes against the state. Hoang's wife, Le Thi Kieu Oanh, said police came to their house in Ho Chi Minh city on Friday asking to carry out a regular check on their household registration but later forced Hoang to leave with them and said they would deport him the next day.  My husband refused to go but three to four police officers used violence to drag him out and locked me inside the house... They also parked a signal-jammer car right in front of our house,  Oanh said. The French embassy in Vietnam said France regretted the Vietnamese authorities decision to revoke Hoang's Vietnamese nationality and to deport him.  Freedom of expression and of opinion, notably on the Internet, are both guaranteed by the international covenant on civil and political rights to which Vietnam is a party. France calls on Vietnamese authorities to ensure compliance with these commitments , the embassy said in a statement sent to Reuters. Ho Chi Minh police said they could not provide any information on the case. Hoang was sentenced to three years in jail for attempted subversion in 2011 but was released after 17 months and served three years under house arrest. He frequently posts blogs criticizing the Vietnamese government. Oanh said the couple were informed on June 1 by the French consul-general that Hoang's Vietnamese citizenship was being annulled with a month for him to leave the country, but they refused to comply.  It's Hoang's ideal to stay in Vietnam to raise a voice and contribute to building freedom and democracy,  Oanh said.  After the signal-jammer car left I called the consul general and he just said he acknowledged the situation. What they would do after that, I don't know,  she added. She said the French embassy and consulate in Vietnam were  waiting for guidance from the French foreign ministry because  Hoang's Vietnamese and French passports have expired. Vietnam's foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang last week defended the decision to revoke Hoang's citizenship, saying it was  conducted in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law.  Hoang is a member of California-based Viet Tan, a group Vietnam considers a terrorist organization.  The French government should not take part in the Hanoi regime's brazen exile of a well-known human rights activist,  Viet Tan said in a statement.

An even better sight was watching Ronald Torreyes deliver the game-winning hit. Tanaka pitched eight scoreless innings during his first major league appearance against Darvish and Torreyes singled with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning, lifting the Yankees to a 2-1 win over the Texas Rangers. Although Tanaka took a no-decision and is winless in his last eight starts since May 9, he looked more like the pitcher who tossed a three-hitter at Fenway Park while opposing Chris Sale on April 27 than the pitcher who began the game with a 6.34 ERA.  Everything,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of what was working for Tanaka. Tanaka allowed three hits, threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters and retired 16 straight at one point from the third to the eighth. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at YankeesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchDarvish was even better, though he exited after the seventh because of triceps tightness. Darvish said he began feeling it in the fourth inning but said he should be able to make his next start. Before exiting, Darvish tied a season high with 10 strikeouts and allowed two hits. Two of his strikeouts were to slugger Aaron Judge, who struck out on a 72 mph curveball in the first and a 95 mph fastball in the seventh.  They were two brilliant Japanese pitchers that had faced off before, been stars in the Japanese league and they're stars here,  Texas manager Jeff Banister said. It was the 15th game in major league history involving two pitchers from Japan. Seven of those games have involved the Yankees and three occurred against Darvish, who opposed Hiroki Kuroda in 2012 and 2013.  We both pitched great,  Darvish said through an interpreter.  So there may be something, but I was trying to focus on my pitching.  While it was the first time Darvish and Tanaka faced each other in the majors, it was the fifth overall matchup. They opposed each other four times in Japan, and in the last meeting on July 20, 2011, both pitchers went the distance.  It was amazing,  Yankees reliever Chasen Shreve said.  We were waiting for it and we know he has it, so it was great to see.  After Tanaka and Darvish were finished, the Yankees won for only the second time in 10 games when Torreyes lined a 98 mph fastball from Matt Bush (3-2) up the middle. It was the first career game-ending hit for the infielder, who raised his arms, dropped his helmet and was lifted by a teammate after reaching first base.  Super happy to able to get a hit in that inning,  Torreyes said through an interpreter.  It's great.  Before Torreyes won it, the Rangers were two outs from getting a 1-0 victory when Elvis Andrus scored on a passed ball by Gary Sanchez while Adrian Beltre struck out against Aroldis Chapman. Instead, Brett Gardner tied it by hitting a 2-1 fastball from Bush into the right-field seats. After Gardner's 14th home run, Aaron Judge chopped a single up the middle just out of shortstop Andrus' range. The Yankees were unable to get the winning run as Bush struck out Matt Holliday but won the game after Shreve (2-1) worked out of a bases-loaded jam by getting Andrus on a popup after striking out Joey Gallo with two on. The game was delayed one hour and 42 minutes, but it was worth the wait for the 39,602 fans at Yankee Stadium and fans watching in Japan 13 hours ahead of New York's time zone. NOTES: Texas LHP Cole Hamels (oblique) threw a bullpen session before the game and could start Monday in Cleveland. ... Yankees 3B Chase Headley (back spasms) missed his second straight game and is unlikely to play Saturday. ...

Emirates Team New Zealand are seeking to wrest the cup from holders Oracle Team USA and with it the rights to decide when the event is next held, its timing and the type of boats used. This is all dictated by the ancient  Deed of Gift  which stipulates the trophy first won in 1851 by the U.S. schooner  America  was to be  a perpetual challenge cup for friendly competition between nations  and allows the winner to take all. However, the history of the cup has been anything but friendly at times, riddled with costly legal feuds, bitter personal battles and a stop-start reputation which has made it  hard to attract tens of millions of dollars needed in sponsorship and broadcasters willing to pay for rights.  From a sponsor's perspective, you don't have any certainty at all ... the defender decides virtually everything,  Jaguar Land Rover's [TAMOJL.UL] Experiential Marketing Director Mark Cameron said on Friday of the firm's support for Britain's Land Rover BAR team, led by British sailor Ben Ainslie. That could all change if the U.S. holders are able to turn around a 3-0 Kiwi lead in the first-to-seven competition on Bermuda's Great Sound when racing resumes this weekend. The team led by Oracle boss Larry Ellison signed up to a  framework agreement  with four of the other challengers this year which would mean the cup being held every two years in foiling catamarans as in Bermuda and a series of match races along the lines of Formula One around the world. This would please many sponsors, but not everyone liked the idea with some saying it was not true to the spirit of the cup and New Zealand boycotted the agreement. The New Zealand camp have not said so far what they will do if they win the cup back. Whose Cup Is It Anyway? Bermuda offered big financial incentives to have the America's Cup held on the small mid-Atlantic island and is keen to make sure that it gets repeat business. Painted on bus shelters along the island's narrow, winding roads is the official slogan  America's Cup, Bermuda's Legacy, Our Moment , with posters depicting a smiling boy from the island saying  America's Cup is Zico's Cup . But not everyone agrees, with  America's Cup is Larry's (Ellison's) Cup  in graffiti on one bus stop. If the U.S. team manage to keep the cup, there is speculation among other teams that the 36th edition could end up in Chicago rather than Bermuda, with races in places including Britain, France, Japan and Sweden.  But if the Kiwis win, the expectation is that it will move to Auckland, although there are also some suggestions that it could also be held in Dubai, where the main New Zealand sponsor Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] is based. While an Auckland cup would be more expensive for some sponsors and create challenges for televising the event in some countries, sponsors such as Land Rover which supports Britain's BAR team do not see it as a deal breaker.  We are clear that we want to compete in the next America's Cup,  Land Rover's Cameron said, adding that his preference was for it to be governed by the framework agreement, with an established class of boats and a  World Series  racing circuit.  We would have to see the details ... but on the basis of location its not a game changer. We would be competing in Auckland,  Cameron told Reuters by telephone.

And for the third time, Tigers right-handed starter Michael Fulmer was on the wrong end of the zeroes.  All I know is I've had just one scoreless outing this year and obviously that needs to change,  Fulmer said after the Padres scored the game's only run on one of the two hits he allowed -- a second-inning RBI double by catcher Austin Hedges -- as San Diego won 1-0 in the opener of a three-game interleague series at Petco Park.  The way things are going, that's just not good enough,  Fulmer said of his outing after Padres starter Luis Perdomo (2-4) and two relievers combined on a three-hit shutout to hand Detroit its seventh consecutive loss. That was one more hit than the Padres had. But timing is everything.  A walk and a hanging slider,  continued Fulmer.  One inning. There is not much you can do.  Actually, Fulmer (6-6, 3.29 ERA) thought he could have done better. Cory Spangenberg drew a leadoff walk to open the second and reached second on Erick Aybar's groundout to second on a run-and-hit play. Hedges, who hadn't played since being run over by Anthony Rizzo at Wrigley Field on Monday night, doubled to right-center on a two-out, 1-2 slider, driving Spangenberg home. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at PadresDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch I was looking for a mistake and he gave it to me,  said Hedges.  I knew the pitcher was up next,  said Fulmer.  That's why I threw him a slider. I meant to bounce it and I just left it up. I wasn't trying to throw it for a strike. You've got to have a better pitch than that. Unfortunately, one of the few bad ones cost me.  Meanwhile, Perdomo made more mistakes early than Fulmer, but settled down and didn't allow a run for the first time this season in his 13th start. Perdomo allowed two hits and five walks with six strikeouts in six innings as his ERA fell from 4.97 to 4.56. Perdomo didn't allow a hit until Andrew Romine's single leading off the fifth. But he did issue four walks in the first four innings with a pair of inning-ending double plays easing the workload. Padres manager Andy Green and Perdomo credited Hedges for helping the young pitcher settle down and make several midgame adjustments.  I don't think Perdomo gets through the first two innings if not for Austin,  said Green.  It was good to see Austin back in there. He does a great job for the entire ball club. The hit was huge. But Perdomo did a great job of adjusting as the game went on and a lot of that was Austin.   I trust in Austin a lot,  said Perdomo.  Early, I was out of control ... my mechanics. I made some adjustments that kept me in the game.  What adjustments?  I let him be nasty,  said Hedges.  I stopped worrying about setting up on the corners. His stuff was great, but his command wasn't there. So we just set up in the middle to let his pitches move.  Detroit's best opportunity against Perdomo came in the top of the sixth. Alex Avila opened the inning with a single and stole second after Miguel Cabrera lined out to center. But Perdomo struck out J.D. Martinez for the second time and retired former Padre Justin Upton on a grounder to first. Perdomo was followed by left-handers Ryan Buchter and Brad Hand and right-handed closer Brandon Maurer, who picked up his 14th save. The three Padres relievers had five strikeouts against one hit in three innings. Buchter struck out two Tigers in a perfect inning. Hand had two strikeouts after giving up a leadoff double in the eighth. Maurer had one in a perfect ninth. Tigers pinch-hitter John Hicks doubled to lead off the eighth but was stranded when Hand struck out Ian Kinsler -- on a disputed check-swing call by first base umpire Jordan Baker -- and pinch-hitter Nicholas Castellanos before retiring Cabrera on a grounder to short. Detroit manager Brad Ausmus was ejected by Baker for arguing the call.  It was probably because of my emotion concerning the call he made,  said Ausmus.  I wasn't real happy with the call on the check swing. I didn't think Ian went and still don't think he went after watching the replay.  I felt real good about having the leadoff hitter on second. Then Kinsler is out on a supposed swing and now it's a different story.  Baker was involved in another call in the Tigers' ninth. The umpire called Upton safe at first on a one-out grounder to short. But Green appealed the call and Upton was ruled out. Maurer then retired Dixon Machado on a fly to center to complete San Diego's fourth shutout of the season. The Padres' only other hit was a single by Spangenberg in the fourth. Spangenberg reached base in all three plate appearances on two walks and the single and also stole a base. NOTES: The Padres placed 2B-3B Yangervis Solarte (left oblique strain) and RHP Miguel Diaz (forearm strain) on the 10-day disabled list Friday and recalled C-1B Hector Sanchez and 2B Carlos Asuaje from Triple-A El Paso. Sanchez had been at El Paso on a rehab assignment while on the disabled list. He had been out since May 7 with a foot contusion . . . Detroit released RHP Francisco Rodriguez and placed OF Alex Presley on the seven-day concussion disabled list. The Tigers recalled RHP Bruce Rondon from Triple-A Toledo and purchased the contract of OF Matt den Dekker from Toledo. 3B Nicholas Castellanos was a late scratch from the Tigers' starting lineup Friday night (due to lower back tightness) with Dixon Machado starting at third.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED6O1D2G62"},

Felix Hernandez pitched six strong innings in his first start since April 25 and the Seattle Mariners hit three home runs to defeat the Houston Astros 13-3 Friday night at Safeco Field. Hernandez (3-2), who had been on the disabled list with inflammation in his pitching shoulder, allowed eight hits and three runs. He walked one and struck out six.  I was going crazy on the DL, but I knew I'd be back,  Hernandez said.  I was just trying to have a good game. We scored a lot of runs, which was good for me.  Mike Zunino hit a three-run homer for Seattle, which won its season-high sixth straight game. Ben Gamel and Kyle Seager added solo shots.  King's Court  in the left-field corner, a group of fans who wear yellow  King Felix  T-shirts and hold up  K  signs and chant whenever Hernandez reaches a two-strike count, was overflowing Friday for the right-hander's first appearance at home since April 19. The court, which normally fills two sections, consumed four. Related CoverageHouston Astros - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch  It's a blast playing behind that guy,  Gamel said.  Everything he brings to the table and the atmosphere ... it's huge having Felix back.  Hernandez was staked to a six-run lead in the third inning and cruised from there. Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman hit solo home runs for Houston, which had its four-game winning streak snapped.  It's a big series,  said Hernandez, referring to the matchup between the top two teams in the American League West -- even though the Astros have an 11 1/2-game lead.  It's a good start to win this game.  Altuve hit a two-out homer, his 11th of the season, in the first. Bregman led off the fifth with his homer to straightaway center field, his eighth.  Both home runs were pretty good pitches,  Hernandez said.  Just got to tip my hat to them.  The Mariners tied it in the second as Seager led off with a single, moved to second on a single by Danny Valencia and scored on Jarrod Dyson's double down the right-field line. Seattle loaded the bases in the third as Seager was hit by a pitch after singles by Gamel and Nelson Cruz. Mitch Haniger hit a run-scoring single up the middle, then Valencia grounded a two-run single to left just past diving Astros third baseman Bregman. An out later, Zunino hit the first pitch from Houston starter Joe Musgrove 402 feet over the bullpens in left field for a three-run homer, his 10th of the season, making it 7-1. The Astros got one run back in the fourth as Carlos Correa led off with a single and later scored on a run-scoring single by Marwin Gonzalez. But the Mariners continued to batter Musgrove in the fourth, knocking him out. Gamel led off with a homer to left field, his fourth of the season. Two outs later, Seager homered to right, his eighth, giving the Mariners a 9-2 lead. After a walk to Haniger and a single by Valencia, Musgrove's night was done. Musgrove (4-7) had his worst start of the season. He allowed nine runs on 12 hits in 3 2/3 innings, with one walk and four strikeouts, and was tagged for three home runs.  He really made a lot of mistakes in the strike zone and they made him pay for it,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  They did a good job of putting some good at-bats together and we couldn't stop them.

Instead, they exploded, with their bats making the loudest statement of the night. Yoenis Cespedes highlighted a six-run second inning with a two-run homer, helping the Mets brush aside a Cabrera trade demand and a four-game losing streak with an 11-4 victory over the staggering San Francisco Giants.  Very impressed,  Mets manager Terry Collins said after his team's 20-hit attack.  I'm not worried about the attitude of my club. Today was an unfortunate situation. We'll get through it.  Cespedes, Cabrera, Wilmer Flores, Michael Conforto and Lucas Duda had three hits apiece for the Mets, whose hit total equaled the club's season high, set twice previously. Cabrera's big offensive game, which included two runs scored, came shortly after he made his intentions known to reporters that he was planning to request a trade. The second-year Met was unhappy to find out he'd be starting the game at second base in his return from the disabled list, having lost his shortstop spot to Jose Reyes.  I just want to talk about the game,  Cabrera said afterward. He had plenty to talk about, including two flares to right field that dropped for hits in his first two at-bats off the DL. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at GiantsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch I got a couple to fall in right field. Then I hit one hard to shortstop and he made the play. This game is crazy,  he said.  We have a good hitting team. We can do this.  Cabrera fielded four grounders flawlessly and teamed with Reyes on a double play, none of which surprised Collins.  I know he can play second base,  the manager said.  I understand he's not happy playing there. But he's a professional. There were no lingering effects (of the pregame demands).  Duda also homered for the Mets, who were coming off a four-game sweep against the Los Angeles Dodgers and began the night a season-worst 10 games below .500. The two homers gave the Mets 22 in their last 12 games. The Mets teed off on Giants left-hander Ty Blach (4-5), who was facing New York for the first time.  Tonight he was off,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  He couldn't get out of that inning.  Winning pitcher Seth Lugo helped get the big second inning rolling with an RBI double that plated Duda with the run that broke a 1-1 tie. Cespedes' homer, his ninth of the season, made it 5-1 four batters later. It was his fifth home run in seven games against the Giants since the start of last season. Flores, Conforto and Travis d'Arnaud followed with successive doubles, completing the six-run uprising. Duda's homer, his 13th, came against the Giants fourth pitcher, left-hander Josh Osich, in the seventh inning and completed New York's scoring. Cespedes, who also doubled in a three-run sixth inning, finished with three RBIs, and Flores and Conforto had two apiece for the Mets, who had lost eight of their previous 10 games.  That three-spot kind of knocked us out of it,  Bochy said of the Mets' tack-on that increased their lead to 10-1.  When you get down that much in this part, it's tough sledding.  Lugo (2-1) won for the second time in three starts, allowing four runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out two. Gorkys Hernandez had a two-run single in a three-run sixth inning for the Giants, who lost for the 10th time in their last 11 games. Denard Span, Joe Panik and Austin Slater had two hits apiece for the Giants, who were coming off a 1-7 trip on which their pitchers posted a 7.94 ERA. Blach left for a pinch hitter after having surrendered seven runs and 11 hits in three laborious innings during which he threw 80 pitches. He walked one and did not record a strikeout. The career-high 11 hits allowed increased Blach's total in June to a major league-leading 44. Teammate Matt Cain had been tied for the lead at the start of the day with 36. NOTES: The Mets' 20 hits were their most ever at AT&T; Park. The 11 runs tied their previous high in the stadium's 18-year history. ... The Mets also had 20 hits at Philadelphia on April 11 and at Atlanta on May 3. ... The Mets' top six hitting performances this season have all come on the road. ...

Park went out in 31, including a stretch of six consecutive birdies interrupted by her only bogey of the day, and added three more birdies on the back despite hitting just eight of 13 fairways.  My play was best with putter today, very good,  Park said. Three players are two shots back of Park, including So Yeon Ryu, Mel Reid and Ally McDonald.  I went to see Ian Baker-Finch and he told me -- he actually make me really comfortable to do putting, like he gave me a lot of confidence like just trust yourself,  Ryu said.   Also, I played with Nick Price, which it was really a pleasure to play with him. He also told me like your putting stroke is so smooth and you're really great, so after that I got extra confidence.  Reid, also a rookie, birdied five of her first seven holes. A hole-in-one at the par-three 11th moved her to eight under, but she made bogey on two of the final seven holes.  As soon as I hit it I thought, oh, it's got a chance,  Reid said of her hole-in-one.  It just pitched a little longer than we thought. But yeah, I mean, a hole-in-one, I hit a good shot into there. I just hit a little 9-iron, so I think it was 135. I just tried to play a 130 shot and it pitched about seven behind it and came back.  Reid's 65 is her low round of the year and comes after she missed the cut in her last three starts. Ryu played bogey-free golf while notching six birdies. McDonald finished with seven birdies and a bogey while playing in front of her parents, grandparents and several family friends.  There are few places that my family can get to with the schedule and with my grandparents wanting to watch me,  McDonald said.  I'm happy they could all be here, and hopefully I can play well for them.  Stacy Lewis, the 2014 champion, was part of a group that included Juli Inkster, Moriya Jutanugarn, Felicity Johnson and Katherine Kirk at 5 under. Defending champion Lydia Kos shot a one-under 70.

Alex Wood suffocated the Colorado Rockies to improve his record to a sterling 8-0 but was bummed when manager Dave Roberts called it a night for him after six innings. Wood allowed three hits, two of them soft, and struck out seven as the Dodgers won their eighth straight, 6-1, Friday night.  I had an at-bat in the sixth so I thought I was going back out,  said Wood, who lowered his ERA to 1.86.  I didn't even know I was up to 98 pitches.  Being 8-0 is nice, for sure. But you always go out there wanting to give your team a chance to win. I tried to attack the strike zone all night. My changeup was working well.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at DodgersColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchRoberts said,  He had a great three-pitch mix. They didn't get many good swings. When your starters have had some recent injuries, you look at the long view more than the short one.  Justin Turner had three hits to improve his average to .392 and Yasiel Puig crushed a 445-foot solo home run in the fourth inning to extend the Dodgers' streak of consecutive games with a home run to 15. Shortstop Corey Seager had two hits, scored a run and had an RBI but left the game after two innings after tweaking his right hamstring. It was a precautionary move. He will have an MRI exam on Saturday. Roberts said he probably wouldn't play Saturday.  It doesn't feel bad,  Seager said.  It tightened up like a cramp. I've had a bunch of these before and played through them, but you can also make it worse by playing. I'll get it checked out but I feel pretty confident.  The Dodgers are exuding confidence. They have won 14 of their last 15, the eight-game win streak is their longest since 2013, they've won nine straight at home and have the best home record in the majors at 30-10. They also tied a franchise record by scoring six runs or more in their seventh straight game. The win moved Los Angeles' lead in the NL West to a season-high 2 1/2 games over the Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Rockies started Kyle Freeland (8-5) was touched for 10 hits and three walks in six innings as the Rockies dropped their third straight. Colorado has used a rotation loaded with rookies to post one of the best records in the NL, but its starters have allowed 24 runs in the last three games. Manager Bud Black is aware that Freeland and other starters don't have a foundation of a lot of innings, but he isn't concerned.  You'd like to be eight or nine deep in starters, and that's where I think we are,  Black said.  Reinforcements are coming.  Jon Gray, out since April with a broken foot, is scheduled to return shortly. Tyler Anderson returned this week after being on the DL with a knee injury and may start Sunday. Chad Bettis is also throwing simulated games after being sidelined all season with testicular cancer.

Leiter kept Arizona off-balance by effectively mixing his pitches over six shutout innings in his starting debut, and Maikel Franco and Tommy Joseph homered in the late innings to help the last-place Philadelphia Phillies cool off the Diamondbacks in a 6-1 win on Friday night. Arizona, coming off a 7-1 road trip, had won nine of 10 overall and 11 of 12 at Chase Field only to generate almost no offense against Leiter (1-0), whose first 12 career appearances came in relief.  He's always been under the radar, one of those guys that people have always doubted, but his mentality and the way he prepares and gets ready for this, he's second to none,  said Joseph, a Leiter teammate in both the majors and minors.  They're one of (the) best offenses in baseball, (but) he kept them off-balance and was in command of the strike zone.  The son of Mark Leiter and the nephew of Al Leiter -- both former major league pitchers -- the 26-year-old Leiter wasn't overpowering, with a fastball that topped out in the low 90s, but he constantly forced the Diamondbacks to chase cut fastballs, change-ups and a dominating split-finger fastball down in the strike zone. It probably made fans wonder why he labored with six minor league teams before finally reaching the majors at age 26. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at DiamondbacksPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch He made it look easy, used all of his pitches and pitched ahead all but one inning,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He had a good changeup he threw behind in the count, the splitter was his go-to pitch and he made a lot of hitters look bad on a good-hitting team.  Leiter couldn't have pitched much better for a team that had won only two of its previous 15 games, striking out five and walking one before giving way to his bullpen after throwing 81 pitches, 51 for strikes.  It says a lot about what kind of pitcher he is, first major league start and he comes up and does that. It (Chase Field) is known as a hitters' ballpark, and it means he's pretty strong between the ears,  Joseph said. The Phillies, winning successive games for the first time since June 5-6, didn't generate much offense themselves until the final two innings, but they turned Freddy Galvis' one-out triple in the first off starter Patrick Corbin into a run, then added a key insurance run when Franco hit his ninth homer of the season -- a line drive to right field off Jorge De La Rosa on a 3-0 pitch in the eighth. Galvis' second homer in four games against Arizona this season proved important in the bottom off the inning when Daniel Descalso's first triple of the season scored Rey Fuentes, who began the inning with a single. But reliever Joaquin Benoit recovered to strand Descalso at third, getting David Peralta on a line drive to short and striking out Jake Lamb around a walk to Paul Goldschmidt.  You're going to have those days,  catcher Chris Iannetta said of only the second Diamondbacks loss at home since May 14.  (We'll) brush this one off and come back tomorrow. It's not the end of the world.  Philadelphia, winning its fifth in a row at Chase Field since 2015, broke it open with a four-run ninth against T.J. McFarland that included Joseph's two-run homer into the swimming pool in right field, his 12th of the season.  There was a lot of good stuff out there,  Mackanin said, including Leiter's first major league hit, a single in the second inning. The Diamondbacks had scored 26 runs in their previous two games, but didn't give Corbin (6-7) any support as he allowed only one run over 6 1/3 innings despite giving up eight hits.  The first two innings I threw a lot of pitches but then I settled down,  Corbin said.  (There were) a lot of ground balls, some that got through, but some that didn't.  Pat Neshek followed Leiter -- whose father was in the stands to see his son's starting debut -- with a scoreless seventh inning, and Hector Neris pitched the ninth in a non-save situation. The Leiters are the 15th father-son combination in major league history to pitch for the same team. The Diamondbacks, coming off a franchise-best 7-1 road trip to Detroit, Philadelphia and Colorado, had a couple of chances early to get to Leiter, only to have the rookie pitch out of trouble. The Phillies played without their hottest hitter of late, second baseman Howie Kendrick, who was scratched with left hamstring tightness less than an hour before game time. Kendrick, out more than a month earlier this season with an oblique injury, doubled as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. NOTES: Phoenix Suns first-round draft pick Josh Jackson and Arizona Cardinals first-round pick Haason Reddick threw out ceremonial first pitches. ... RHP Randall Delgado (1-1) will make a spot start for Arizona on Sunday, in part to give RHP Taijuan Walker some extra rest. ... The D-backs placed RHP J.J. Hoover on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation and brought up RHP Rubby De La Rosa from Triple-A Reno, where he was 0-1 with a 2.35 ERA with 23 strikeouts in 15 1/3 innings. He was 4-5 for Arizona last season while being limited to 13 appearances by right elbow inflammation. ...

Cabrera was the team’s starting shortstop when he was put on the disabled list with a sprained left thumb less than two weeks ago, but was unhappy to learn on Friday that he had been moved to second prior to New York’s game against San Francisco.  Personally, I'm not really happy with that move,  Cabrera told reporters prior to the contest.     If they have that plan, they should have told me before I came over here.

Merrifield delivered his first career walk-off hit with a two-run double as the Kansas City Royals rallied from a four-run deficit to top the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 on Friday night. All four runs in the ninth inning were scored with two outs.  The tying run is on third, just hit the ball hard and if it happens to get in the gap or over the fence, that's a bonus,  Merrifield said of what he was thinking.  In that situation, you're just trying to get that run in from third.  Merrifield doubled with one out in the eighth, but did not score.  I felt like I had good at-bats all night, so it was nice to come through when it mattered,  he said. He was the seventh man to bat in the ninth.  I counted out in my head if it worked out, I was going to get to hit and I had confidence in our guys to get the job done and they did,  Merrifield said.  I had a chance and took advantage of it.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RoyalsToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchAlcides Escobar singled home Salvador Perez with the first run of the inning and Alex Gordon singled home Brandon Moss, who had walked, with the second run.  I had him (Moss) 1-2,  Toronto reliever Ryan Tepera said.  Just kept battling and battling. Mixed it up with a fastball and a slider, and he just kept battling and we ended up walking him. That was the key point of the inning really.  Merrifield greeted Jason Grilli with a double to left to score Escobar and Gordon.  I was just hoping Salvy was not going to run out on the field too soon,  Moss said.  Esky scored and Salvy was already on his way out and I said, 'wait, wait, wait. We gotta make sure Gordy gets around, too.' That was a great at-bat by him. He got a pitch and didn't miss it.  The victory moved the Royals (36-36) to .500 for the first time since they were 6-6 on April 16. Joakim Soria (4-2) got the victory and Aaron Loup (2-1) took the loss. Blue Jays left-hander J.A. Happ limited the Royals to four hits and one run in 6 2/3 innings while striking out five and walking none. He left with a 2-1 lead.  The bullpen's been great for us,  Happ said.  This shouldn't be an issue. This was just one of those nights and it didn't go our way, but we're going to have to bounce back.  Troy Tulowitzki doubled home Kendrys Morales with the first Toronto run in the fourth inning and scored on a Jake Junis wild pitch. Toronto added two runs in the ninth with run-producing singles by Josh Donaldson and Justin Smoak. The Royals chased Happ in the seventh, which Lorenzo Cain led off with a double. Eric Hosmer reached on Ryan Goins' fielding error. Perez laced a single to left, scoring Cain with still nobody out. Happ rebounded to retire Mike Moustakas on an infield pop-up and struck out Moss. Danny Barnes was brought in to face Escobar, who flied out to center.  Just getting ahead, getting strike one,  Happ said.  I feel like I've been getting better at that. That helps me control the count a lot better and be able to throw the other pitches off of that. So, that was a plus tonight.   Just trying to stay out of the middle as much as I can and just trying to stick that ball to each side and just use everything. I feel like Russ did a good job back there tonight, kind of being on point with what we wanted to do. And, I feel like it is getting better.  Royals rookie Junis was pulled after 6 1/3 innings, allowing two runs, six hits and two walks while striking out four. The Blue Jays scored two runs on one hit, a hit batter and a wild pitch in the fourth inning. Junis hit Morales with a pitch to start the inning. Tulowitzki doubled to the right-center gap, scoring Morales. Dwight Smith Jr. flied out to deep center to get Tulowitzki to third. After walking Kevin Pillar, Junis uncorked a wild pitch with Goins batting, allowing Tulowitzki to score. Happ retired the first 10 batters he faced before Jorge Bonifacio doubled to left with one out in the fourth, but he was stranded at third base. The only other Kansas City baserunner the first five innings was Moss' opposite-field single with two out in the fifth. Jose Bautista and Russell Martin singled with two outs in the third, but Junis struck out Donaldson to end the inning.

LOUIS -- The majority of a sellout crowd of 47,112 believed that Seung Hwan Oh got John Jaso to swing at a 2-2 breaking ball for the third out of the top of the ninth inning Friday night. Only he didn't. Jaso held up and the pitch was ruled a ball. On the next pitch, Jaso made Oh pay for not putting him away, ripping a tie-breaking homer that gave the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the fifth homer this year for Jaso, who entered the game as part of a double-switch in the eighth inning.  I definitely held up on that swing,  Jaso said.  You don't let the anxiety of two strikes get to your head. He threw everything -- cutters, fastballs, splits.  Oh (1-4) left a changeup over the plate's middle and Jaso drilled it 406 feet to right-center, completing Pittsburgh's comeback from a 3-2 deficit with five outs remaining. The Pirates (34-40) passed St. Louis (33-39) by a percentage point for third place in the National League Central, five games back of first place Milwaukee. Pittsburgh snapped a seven-game losing streak in Busch Stadium, dating back to last July. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CardinalsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch We felt like we were going to win sometime this weekend,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  Might as well get it done tonight.  It appeared that Pittsburgh would taste defeat again under the Gateway Arch when rookie second baseman Paul DeJong rifled a solo homer with one out in the seventh to right-center, giving the Cardinals a one-run lead. But the Pirates spoiled Adam Wainwright's hopes for his eighth win by touching Trevor Rosenthal for the tying run in the eighth. David Freese grounded a two-out RBI single to right, scoring Adam Frazier. Pittsburgh then preserved the tie behind ace reliever Felipe Rivero and right fielder Gregory Polanco's third terrific catch in as many innings. Inserted with runners at the corners and one out in the St. Louis half of the eighth, Rivero (3-1) got Aledmys Diaz to line out to third. Then DeJong lofted the first pitch he saw from Rivero into right-center for a potential go-ahead hit. However, Polanco got a good jump on the ball and made a sliding grab to keep the score equalized.  He's a plus defender,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of Polanco.  He made a couple of nice plays.  Rivero then worked around a leadoff walk to Eric Fryer in the ninth to polish off the victory. While the Pirates played an errorless game, St. Louis' seventh error in three games cost it a run in the fourth. DeJong turned an ordinary chopper from Josh Bell into a two-base throwing error with one out, moving Freese to third. Andrew McCutchen's infield out evened the score at 2. It was the seventh unearned run the Cardinals have allowed as a result of the miscues.  He was trying to make more out of that play than was there,  Matheny said of DeJong.  He had to rush his throw and it caught (first baseman Matt) Carpenter off-guard.  Homers kicked off the scoring in the second inning. Pittsburgh's Josh Bell laced a solo shot down the right-field line, but Jose Martinez countered with a liner that cleared the left-field wall two pitches after Jedd Gyorko drew a leadoff walk. Most of the game was dominated by good starting pitching. Wainwright, who allowed 20 runs in his previous three starts, checked the Pirates on two hits in seven innings. He allowed just one earned run, walking two and whiffing five. Pittsburgh righty Jameson Taillon worked six innings in his third start since returning from the disabled list after undergoing surgery for testicular cancer last month. Taillon allowed four hits and two runs, walking two and fanning seven. He and his teammates got to savor a win, thanks to Jaso's patience and his stroke.  I'm not sure he knew how big the situation was,  Taillon said of Jaso.  He's so mellow. I don't know if he ever feels the pressure.

Fowler is optimistic that he'll be able to return to the lineup Saturday night. ...

He didn't live up to his end of the bargain, but the A's will certainly live with his performance. Cotton (5-7) threw five shutout innings, scattering three hits in Oakland's 3-0 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday night before leaving the game at the start of the sixth inning because of a blister on his right (throwing) thumb.  I was cruising until the fifth and the sixth and then this happened,  Cotton said, pointing to the blister.  It was kind of a bummer that I couldn't at least finish the sixth inning.  Cotton has been dealing with a blister for some time, and A's manager Bob Melvin said  it doesn't seem to be a big issue  and he's hopeful the right-hander makes his next start. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at White SoxOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchThe win snapped a four-game losing streak for the A's (33-42) as Khris Davis listened to Melvin's pregame message of jumping out to an early lead. On the first pitch he saw from Mike Pelfrey in the top of the first, Davis launched his 19th home run of the season, a 429-foot, two-run blast to center field.  (Melvin) told me he wanted to give me a kiss for some reason because we jumped out to an early lead,  Davis said with a laugh.  I think I agree with that, that it was important to jump out and score first. Just keeping an aggressive mindset early on.  Davis went 2-for-3 and also had a walk and stolen base. The early lead gave Cotton some confidence as he notched his first win in a night game this season.  Yeah, I told KD he took coaching very well today,  Melvin said.  Any time he makes the manager look good he gets to play again tomorrow. We needed to get on the board first, the way things had been going on the road for us. And Jharel kind of took that and ran with it, and obviously when he had to come out we had some rested guys in the bullpen today and they did a good job after it.  Matt Joyce also hit a home run for the A's, blasting a solo shot to right-center field in the fourth inning against Pelfrey (3-6), who dropped to 0-5 in his career against Oakland. He threw 106 pitches in only 4 2/3 innings.  For six or seven lefties, I did a terrible job of commanding the inside of the plate with the fastball,  said Pelfrey, who was 3-1 in his previous six starts coming in.  (I was) probably fortunate to get out of it with three runs like I did.  Melvin said that Oakland's bullpen was  terrific  in throwing four shutout innings. Closer Santiago Casilla made it interesting in the ninth, though, allowing the tying run to come to the plate, but Matt Davidson flied out to deep center field to end the game.  They did a great job from Liam (Hendriks) coming in and finishing my inning for me to (Sean) Doolittle coming in and throwing up zeros and especially (Ryan) Madson, a guy I talk to a lot, and of course Casilla, just closing the game out for us and giving us the first 'W' of the road series, which is pretty good,  Cotton said. Davidson had two hits for the White Sox (32-40), who have lost four of five. White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson and manager Rick Renteria were ejected by home plate umpire Jim Wolf in the bottom of the fifth inning. Anderson was tagged out by A's catcher Bruce Maxwell on a tapper that he thought was foul. Renteria came out to argue Anderson's ejection and he was tossed for the third time this season and second time in a week.  It happened kind of quick,  Renteria said.  I started walking out and I was too late obviously. But I mean things like that happen. In the heat of the battle, your emotions are flying high so it happens.  NOTES: Oakland SS Chad Pinder left the game after the fifth inning with a strained left hamstring. Manager Bob Melvin said it  could be a little bit. ... Usually those things aren't one day. . ... White Sox starter Mike Pelfrey had not given up a home run since May 26 -- he had gone five appearances and 21 innings without allowing a long ball. ... Khris Davis' home run for Oakland was only his third in June after hitting 10 in April and six in May, but he is hitting .294 in the month compared with a .186 average in May. ...

Brandon Phillips had a home run and a double, while fielding gems by third baseman Johan Camargo and shortstop Dansby Swanson were instrumental in helping the Braves survive a near-bullpen meltdown to hang on for a 5-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night at SunTrust Park. Atlanta has won six of its last seven games.  The game came down to they made some defensive plays, some excellent defensive plays at the end of the game,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. Phillips was 2-for-5, scored twice and drove in a pair of runs to pace the Atlanta attack. The second baseman showed no signs of the groin issue that caused him to leave Thursday night's game early. But it was Atlanta's defense in the late innings that saved the day. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at BravesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta appeared to be in control with a 5-1 lead after six innings when the Brewers' bats took advantage of some shaky relief work. Milwaukee scored a run against Sam Freeman in the seventh on Domingo Santana's RBI single. The Brewers scored twice in the eighth on a sharp two-run double by Orlando Arcia. After Lewis Brinson was hit by a pitch to put runners at first and second, the Braves escaped disaster when pinch hitter Jesus Aguilar ripped a grounder to third base that Camargo was able to backhand and turn into a double play. Arodys Vizcaino pitched the ninth inning for the Braves and earned his first save, but it didn't come without drama. Eric Thames led off with a double, but was retired at third when he tried to advance on Santana's ground ball. The hard-hit grounder was fielded by Swanson, who turned and threw accurately to get the sliding Thames.  That play Dansby made - I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like that,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  That ball's up the middle and you go to third base. To have the guts to make that play is the biggest thing to me. The conviction -- there wasn't any hesitation.  Swanson said:  It kind of went through my head before happened, really. It's just kind of crazy how you can process something before it happens and when it does happen, it just kind of becomes a reaction.  Vizcaino retired Travis Shaw on a fly ball to the warning track, which allowed Santana to move to second base. The game ended when Swanson dove to catch Manny Pina's line drive.  The ball Aguilar hit was a great double play and the ball that Domingo hit, that's a really nice play,  Counsell said.  Most shortstops are throwing that ball to first base.  Winning pitcher Mike Foltynewicz (5-5) suffered from a high pitch count and lasted only five innings. The right-hander allowed one run on four hits and three walks, with nine strikeouts. It is the fourth time in his last five starts that Foltynewicz has allowed two or fewer runs. Losing pitcher Jimmy Nelson (5-4) worked five innings and allowed four runs on six hits and three walks. He struck out eight. It was Nelson's first loss since May 23. The Braves scored twice in the first inning. Phillips hit the first pitch he saw from Nelson into the first row of seats in the left-field stands for his sixth home run. Nick Markakis walked, went to third on Matt Adams' single and scored on a ground ball. Tyler Flowers hit a double-play ball to second, which Eric Sogard flipped to second, only to have shortstop Orlando Arcia drop the exchange, which allowed the run to score. The Brewers made it 2-1 in the fourth when Keon Broxton hit a solo home run, his 12th, to straightaway center field. Rain began to fall, heavy at times, during the fifth inning, but the Braves were able to score two more times. Phillips doubled home a run and scored when Flowers drove an opposite-field single to right.

Under Brazilian law, any criminal charges against a sitting president must be approved by two-thirds of the lower house of Congress in order for the Supreme Court to put a leader on trial. Top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot is expected to charge Temer with receiving bribes early next week. The president is also facing accusations of racketeering and obstruction of justice.  Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of all accusations. The investigation is hampering the president's ability to push his economic reforms through Congress.  Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters this week, on condition of anonymity so they could speak freely, that they will set aside work on those proposed labor law reforms if forced to vote on criminal charges against Temer.  They also said they will not even consider advancing work on pension reforms until changes to the labor law are passed. Temer is being investigated in connection with a political graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker. Company executives said in plea-bargain testimony that the president took nearly $5 million in bribes in return for help resolving tax matters, for freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters.  Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, also made a recording of a conversation he had with Temer earlier this year. In it the president appears to condone paying off a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Lawyers defending Temer were trying to dismiss the use of the recording in the investigation, saying it was manipulated. But police said on Friday after finishing an analysis of the audio files and the equipment used by Joesley Batista to record the president that they were valid. Lawmakers in Temer's alliance say they have the one-third of lower-house votes required to block any charges against Temer. Out of 513 deputies, leaders in the alliance said this week they have between 250 and 300 votes.   But they also told Reuters they widely expected Janot to use the strategy of dragging out the charges against Temer in an effort to wear down lawmakers with multiple votes.  Those ballots will be deeply unpopular with Brazilian voters who overwhelmingly believe Temer is corrupt, according to opinion polls. It also gives more time for possible new corruption revelations to surface against Temer, said another key lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity, potentially eroding his support in the house.

He had a lot of 3-2 counts, but he got big outs and five zeroes.  Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer (6-6) pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up five runs (four earned) and eight hits with four strikeouts and one walk. Mejia and relievers Tyler Duffey, Taylor Rogers and Trevor Hildenberger combined on a four-hitter. It was Mejia's second consecutive start against Cleveland. In his last start against the Indians on June 17 in Minnesota, Mejia was the losing pitcher in a 6-2 Cleveland win. In that game, Mejia pitched 4 2/3 innings, giving up two runs.  This time I tried to prepare and had a better game plan,  Mejia said. Leading 4-0, the Twins added an insurance run in the seventh inning. With two outs and nobody on, Byron Buxton reached on a bunt single and went to second when Bauer threw wildly to first on the play. Dozier followed with a single to right field, giving Minnesota a 5-0 lead and knocking Bauer out of the game. It was Bauer's fourth start against Minnesota this year. In his first three, he was 3-0 with a 3.26 ERA. Bauer retired the side in order in the first inning, two on strikeouts. But the Twins sent eight men to the plate in the second inning, and half of them scored. Max Kepler led off the inning by bouncing a double off the right field wall. Kepler went to third on a flyout to deep right by Eduardo Escobar. Eddie Rosario followed with a single to right field, scoring Kepler with the first run of the game. Polanco worked the count to 3-2, then pounded a pitch over the right field wall for his third home run, pushing the lead to 3-0.  Jorge fouled off some tough fastballs, then took advantage of a fastball Bauer left over the plate,  Molitor said of the home run. Jason Castro drew a walk and Buxton blasted a line drive that was caught in left field by Daniel Robertson for the second out. But Dozier doubled over the head of center fielder Austin Jackson, scoring Castro to make it 4-0.  He threw too many pitches that were catching too much of the plate. Most of them were fastballs,  Indians manager Terry Francona said of Bauer. In the fourth inning, the Indians loaded the bases with one out. Erik Gonzalez struck out with the bases loaded for the second time in three innings, and Francisco Lindor lined out to end the inning without a run being scored.  It seemed like we had baserunners in every inning the first five innings and good chances. We weren't able to do anything with it,  said Francona, whose team was 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position.
