He wrote about the meeting in a company newsletter and spoke about it in a television interview Tuesday.The two leaders spoke during a state dinner for the world leaders and their spouses.The White House official said Mr. Trump spoke with many leaders during the dinner and said the president \u201cspoke briefly\u201d with Mr. Putin, who was seated next to first lady Melania Trump, toward the end of the evening.Mr. Bremmer said the two spoke for about an hour, joined by Mr. Putin\u2019s translator.The White House official said Messrs. Trump and Putin used the Russian translator because the American translator accompanying Mr. Trump spoke only English and Japanese. Mr. Trump had been seated next to Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe.\u201cThe insinuation that the White House has tried to \u2018hide\u2019 a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cIt is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president\u2019s duties, to interact with world leaders.\u201dIn the meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Putin on what the intelligence community says was an extensive campaign by the Russian government to meddle in last year\u2019s election. Mr. Trump told him that Americans are upset about Russia\u2019s actions and want them to stop, Mr. Tillerson told reporters in a briefing. Mr. Putin denied that Russia played a role, and the two leaders agreed not to \u201crelitigate\u201d the past, Mr. Tillerson said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was also in the meeting, told reporters afterward that Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s contention that Russia didn\u2019t interfere in the campaign.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bremmer said he learned about the second Trump-Putin talk from participants at the dinner, which was attended only by world leaders and their spouses.Mr. Bremmer said the participants described the talk as \u201cvery animated\u201d and \u201cvery friendly.\u201dMr. Trump said it was already known that he would be attending a dinner with the Russian president and 18 other world leaders. \u201cFake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \u2018sick,\u2019\u201d he tweeted Tuesday evening. \u201cAll G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!\u201dThe dinner was closed to the news media, and White House officials hadn\u2019t provided details of the president\u2019s interactions during the event before Tuesday.The news that Mr. Trump had a talk with Mr. Putin that the White House didn\u2019t initially disclose comes as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow in that effort.Mr. Trump has expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 consensus that Russia sought to meddle in the election, saying days before his meeting with Mr. Putin, \u201cNobody knows for sure.\u201d He has repeatedly denied any collusion by his campaign.Since his meeting with Mr. Putin, the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has released an email chain showing that he helped arrange a meeting last June to discuss allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.       In that email chain, the younger Mr. Trump was told that the information was gathered as part of a Russian government effort to help his father.Also on Tuesday, the White House announced its intent to formally nominate       Jon Huntsman      \u2014former governor of Utah and ambassador to Singapore under President George H.W.

Mr. McConnell still plans to hold a vote on a 2015 version of a bill repealing the ACA, even though he lacks the numbers to pass it.The Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee,\u00a0announced Tuesday it would recruit and fund primary challenges against GOP senators who move to block that vote.\u201cWe will seek to identify, recruit and fund conservative challengers against Republican senators who vote against repeal,\u201d said Ken Cuccinnelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund.\u201cIf they won\u2019t keep their word and if they can\u2019t find the courage to repeal a liberal takeover of our health-care system\u2026they should be replaced by someone who will,\u201d he added.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies had previously sought to inflict damage on GOP senators who didn\u2019t support the proposed health-care legislation in the Senate. Last month, one group launched an ad attacking Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.) after he voiced opposition to the bill. The ads were pulled after Mr. McConnell complained to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that it was an \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d thing to do, according to a GOP operative with knowledge of the discussion.The midterm map of Senate elections is heavily tilted in the GOP\u2019s direction, with more vulnerable Democrats than Republicans up for re-election.Still, said Rick Tyler, a GOP strategist who was an adviser to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, the party\u2019s brand is taking a beating. \u201cYou have to demonstrate as a majority party that you can govern and get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Republican brand is just so damaged because I don\u2019t know anyone who can tell me what it means to be a Republican anymore.\u2019\u2019\u201cNot\u00a0being able to deliver on that promise [to repeal the ACA] would do serious and long-lasting damage to the credibility of Republicans,\u201d Mr. Cruz\u00a0said last week.One thing that could blunt the political fallout over the health-care bill is that the proposed changes to the ACA weren\u2019t popular among many of Mr. Trump\u2019s own voters, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.The poll, which focused on counties that voted for Mr. Trump, found that only 12% said that the GOP bill passed by the House to repeal and replace the Obama-era health law was a good idea, while 41% said it was a bad idea. Among people in those counties who said they voted for Mr. Trump, 25% said the GOP bill, which was similar to the Senate bill in major respects, was a good idea.The Trump administration had kept an arms-length approach to the Senate health-care negotiations, intervening on occasion to support provisions they thought could build support for the bill, according the lawmakers and officials. The president\u2019s interactions were largely private, after he had intervened more publicly in the House legislative push.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former presidential rivals, including Sen.       Marco Rubio       of Florida, praised what they said was a strategic decision by the president to involve himself selectively after receiving advice from the Senate.But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters warned that voters\u2019 patience with the party is growing thin. \u201cThe unhappiness is growing so strong that it is conceivable the Democrats could take the House in 2018,\u201d said former House Speaker       Newt Gingrich.       He said the GOP should focus on advancing more attainable goals such as cutting taxes or making incremental health-policy changes.\u201cWe can\u2019t eat the whole elephant but we can take one bite at a time,\u201d he said of the Republican Party in an interview. \u201cWe have a team that cannot do anything complicated, cannot do anything fast, and cannot communicate.

That means a major source of the coverage gains under the ACA is likely to remain intact for the foreseeable future, a boon for hospitals, doctors and officials in states that chose to expand the program.The bill would have \u201cended Medicaid as we know it,\u201d said John Jurenko, vice president of government relations at NYC Health & Hospitals, which runs New York City\u2019s 11 public hospitals. That relief was temporary, he said, as he considered the continuing uncertainty. \u201cI was very happy for a few minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be vigilant.\u201dFor insurers, the results are mixed. They fought to kill a provision in the latest Senate bill that they said would have blown up the ACA\u2019s marketplaces, but they supported Republicans\u2019 efforts to kill the law\u2019s tax on health-insurance plans.Insurers said they still face major uncertainty about how the ACA will be administered going forward. \u201cWe have to make business decisions here, and it\u2019s like, \u2018is it going to be A or B?\u2019\u201d said       John Baackes,        chief executive of L.A. Care Health Plan, which offers exchange coverage as well as Medicaid. \u201cYou can\u2019t operate that way.\u201dThe impact will likely play out differently in different places, depending on state policies and market realities.Companies are now calling for fast efforts to provide more certainty and stability in the marketplaces, which are strained in several states as insurers are pulling back and seeking large rate increases for next year. In an estimated 38 counties across Nevada, Indiana and Ohio, no insurer has yet agreed to offer coverage through an exchange next year.Most immediately, companies offering health plans in the ACA\u2019s exchanges are concerned key federal payments that help reduce health-care costs for low-income enrollees may now be halted, as President Donald Trump has threatened in the past. The Senate bill would have locked them in for 2018 and 2019. The president raised their alarm with a tweet\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0suggesting, \u201clet ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!\u201d\u201cIf he wants to destroy Obamacare, all he has to do is stop\u201d the payments, said       Jerry Dworak,        chief executive of Montana Health Co-op, a nonprofit offering marketplace plans in Montana and Idaho. \u201cThat would probably end it right there. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s bluffing.\u201dMontana Health Co-op proposed only about a 4% rate increase on marketplace plans in its home state for next year, Mr. Dworak said, but that would have to increase by around 20 percentage points if the cost-sharing payments ceased.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said that,\u00a0\u201cwith open enrollment for 2018 only three months away, our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them,\u201d and the cost-sharing payments must have \u201ccertain funding.\u201d The group also said it supported federal and state moves to \u201cstabilize insurance markets in the short term.\u201dInsurers said they also need firmer direction about the future enforcement of the ACA\u2019s individual mandate for people to have insurance. Many insurers fear consumers will assume because of Republican efforts that the requirement is no longer being enforced, even though no law repealing it has passed, leading younger, healthier people to avoid marketplace plans.\u201cI\u2019d like to see clarity\u201d around the mandate, said Diane P. Holder, chief executive of UPMC Health Plan in Pittsburgh.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) had previously raised the prospect of working with Democrats on efforts to stabilize the marketplaces, and pressure for that outcome from the health-care industry and states is likely to rapidly grow.A group of governors, including Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, Nevada\u2019s Brian Sandoval and Pennsylvania\u2019s       Tom Wolf,        said in a statement\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that \u201cthe best next step is for both parties to come together and do what we can all agree on: fix our unstable insurance markets.\u201dHospital executives said they, too, are worried about seeing more patients losing coverage if the insurance marketplaces aren\u2019t stabilized. Seeing more uninsured would strain hospital finances, said Robin Wittenstein, CEO of hospital operator Denver Health, who was in Washington\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to lobby Congress as the Senate\u2019s legislative agenda rapidly shifted. \u201cIt would have a devastating effect,\u201d she said.In addition to funding for the cost-sharing payments, insurers would like to see funding for reinsurance to help manage the risk of covering costlier, sicker enrollees, and other steps.Pamela Morris, chief executive of CareSource, a nonprofit that offers exchange plans in four states, said her company is considering offering plans in some counties in Indiana and Ohio that currently lack a marketplace insurer for 2018. Locking in the cost-sharing payments and a reinsurance program would \u201cmake it a win-win for us\u201d to offer plans in those counties, she said. \u201cThat would seal the deal.\u201dMeanwhile, states are increasingly taking their own initiatives to bolster exchanges\u2014reflecting the reality that the ACA has played out very differently in different places. In the states facing possible bare counties with no exchange insurers, officials are\u00a0wooing companies to stick around. Other states\u2019 marketplaces are in steadier condition.\u201cEvery state out there is realizing that the worst scenario is a collapse of your individual markets,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, Washington state\u2019s insurance commissioner, who, like officials in many states, is working on a proposal to get a federal waiver to tweak aspects of the ACA. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit back and wait for bad things to happen.\u201dAlaska, which had been facing large rate increases and retains only one insurer in its exchange, recently won federal approval for an effort built around a reinsurance setup. Iowa is seeking a nod from federal officials for a more ambitious program that would rewrite large portions of the ACA in the state. Several other states are considering or moving forward on similar efforts.\u201cWe will see a difference in states,\u201d said Gary Cohen, a vice president at Blue Shield of California, a state that boasts an exchange that has been far more stable than many others. \u201cThe Obama administration took a more rigid view and were less welcoming to those state initiatives than the Trump administration has indicated it will be.\u201d\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Insurers Brace for New Uncertainty.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 20:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-see-new-uncertainty-after-gop-bills-collapse-1500407769", "news_title": "Health Insurers Brace for New Uncertainty After GOP Bill\u2019s Collapse ", "keywords": " affordable care act,health insurance, obamacare, senate gop health overhaul,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Discovery Communications Inc.        DISCB 0.56%       is in talks to combine with             Scripps Networks Interactive Inc.,        SNI 14.73%       people familiar with the situation said, a deal that would unite two media companies trying to chart a course in a cable-TV industry being upended by digital consumption.Terms of the deal talks couldn\u2019t be learned. Discovery Communications is worth about $15 billion, including its preferred stocks, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Scripps has an $8.8 billion market valuation.There is no guarantee that the two sides will reach a deal. It is also possible that another bidder for Scripps could emerge.Scripps shares were up 13% in after-hours tradingBoth media companies specialize in nonfiction cable programming. Discovery owns brands such as its namesake Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC, while Scripps has a portfolio including HGTV, Cooking Channel and Food Network.The companies have discussed tying up before. In 2014, they abandoned talks about a merger and one issue at the time was that the family that controls Scripps wasn\u2019t ready to sell.Discovery, based in Silver Spring, Md., posted revenue of $6.5 billion last year, while Scripps brought in $3.4 billion in revenue. The two companies, like other midsize cable TV companies that don\u2019t own broadcast or sports networks, are trying to figure out where they fit in a shifting media landscape.Traditional cable is under pressure from streaming services like             Netflix,       which are luring away subscribers. Cable channels are vying to be part of \u201cskinny\u201d online TV bundles from Sling TV, Hulu, YouTube and others.The biggest cable-network owners have an advantage in those negotiations.Together, Discovery and Scripps could be in position to offer their own subscription web-TV bundle of nonfiction programming. Both companies also are banking on their expertise in food, travel and cooking programs to translate well to young consumers on Facebook and Snapchat.There is also a simple logic to getting bigger at a time when distributors in pay television have done their own deals and may have more leverage in channel-carriage negotiations. Cable networks get a slice of consumers\u2019 monthly bills based on rates hashed out with the providers. In recent years,             AT&T Inc.       has purchased DirecTV and             Charter Communications Inc.       has merged with Time Warner Cable.It is far from certain that a Discovery-Scripps merger would resolve some of the structural problems they and other media companies face in the TV world, including the gradual movement of eyeballs\u2014and advertisers\u2014to digital platforms that are perceived to allow more sophisticated audience targeting.Discovery has struggled with soft advertising growth in the U.S., amid ratings pressures on its channels, though it turned in a solid performance at the advance TV ad sales season this spring. Cord-cutting has partially offset gains the company has made in revenue from cable TV subscriptions. Last year overall revenue grew 2%.Under Chief Executive       David Zaslav,        Discovery has pursued international expansion as aggressively as any U.S. media company. International revenues now make up about 46% of total revenue. Scripps has less overseas exposure and could benefit from the tie-up in that respect.Discovery bought the European sport broadcaster Eurosport in 2015, and has bought rights to the Olympics and some soccer games. Those investments and fluctuations in foreign currency have weighed on financial results, at times.Cable mogul       John Malone       had a 28.2% voting stake in Discovery, as of the most recent proxy filing.Scripps has an unusual governance structure that can be a significant factor in completing a deal. When the last of founder Edward W. Scripps\u2019 grandchildren died in 2012, a family trust was ended and shares were distributed to a host of family beneficiaries.Those people collectively control 91.8% of voting shares. When significant company matters arise, they hold a special meeting beforehand to determine, by majority vote, how the family will vote.Scripps has been resilient compared with some other media companies in a tough ratings environment. U.S. ad revenues increased 10% last year. Networks like HGTV and DIY, with mostly live viewership, haven\u2019t suffered as much from time-shifting. Scripps is also known for having a female-skewing audience on its networks, something that analysts say appeals to certain segments of marketers.In 2016, Scripps\u2019 total revenue grew 12.7% to $3.4 billion, while profit increased 11% to $674 million.A Discovery-Scripps merger would be the biggest media deal since AT&T Inc.\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of             Time Warner Inc.last October, a deal that is undergoing regulatory review.Year to date, media M&A only accounts for $32.7 billion in deal volume globally, according to data provider Dealogic.

Andrew Cuomo       and Mayor       Bill de Blasio       should pony up more for the transit agency, according to the Siena College poll released\u00a0Tuesday, and said neither leader is handling the transit system well.The calls for more cash come from across the board. Seventy-two percent of polled voters want the state to invest more money in the MTA\u201483% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans.Seventy-six percent of those polled want the city to put more money into the MTA, including 81% of Democrats and 63% of Republicans.\u201cPeople understand you can\u2019t substantively fix the problems on public transit without an infusion of money,\u201d said       John Raskin,        the director of public-transit advocacy group the Riders Alliance, which has pushed this issue.The poll comes as Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is up for re-election next year, and Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is on the ballot in November.More people hold the governor accountable for managing the MTA, the poll showed.Mr. Cuomo has the highest number of appointees to the MTA board, selects its leader, and holds sway over its budget. The state is responsible for much of the MTA\u2019s funding, which includes about $15 billion in operating costs and a $32.5 billion five-year capital program.Voters are unimpressed with how both the mayor and the governor are addressing the subways, which are facing a\u00a0surge in delays, overcrowding, and other problems.A plurality of those polled, 33%, said Mr. Cuomo is doing a fair job running the MTA, consistent with another poll this month. At 32%, a plurality said Mr. de Blasio is doing a poor job with the MTA.\u00a0Some 32%, a plurality, rated the MTA\u2019s handling of mass transit \u201cfair.\u201dThe poll of 793 New York state voters took place between July 9 and July 13. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.Joseph Lhota,        the new chairman of the MTA, said in an interview Tuesday that the MTA\u2019s low marks are \u201cabsolutely not acceptable to me. I\u2019ve been charged with making the system better, and I will.\u201dMr. Lhota said he agreed that greater investment would help. \u201cI think we need to have additional resources to deal with putting the system back into a state of good repair,\u201d he said.Republicans are seizing on the low marks ahead of the elections.\u201cNobody\u2019s more of a fiscal conservative\u2026than I am, but this a dire situation that needs to be addressed,\u201d said Assemblywoman       Nicole Malliotakis,        a Republican running against Mr. de Blasio. She said the city should contribute more to the MTA.A spokesman for the de Blasio campaign, Dan Levitan, said Ms. Malliotakis has had the opportunity to fight for transit funding as a legislator. \u201cHer brand of\u2026slashing government at all costs is failing New Yorkers,\u201d he said.Ed Cox,        chairman of the state GOP, said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s handling of infrastructure will likely be front-and-center for a Republican running against him next year.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo,       Richard Azzopardi,        said: \u201cThis governor provided the MTA with $6.6 billion this year, and pledged an additional $1 billion next year, while the last Republican administration couldn\u2019t be bothered to spend one red cent in capital funding for five straight years\u2014helping to create the mess that we\u2019re fixing.\u201dAustin Finan,        a spokesman for the mayor, said: \u201cThe MTA is the responsibility of the state. At a time when we face uncertainty from Washington, we must concentrate our resources on the things we control,\u00a0like public housing, paving roads and fixing bridges and building schools.\u201dSiena hasn\u2019t previously asked voters about MTA funding, said pollster       Steven Greenberg,        but it isn\u2019t unusual for people to tell pollsters they want more funds for issues of concern.Nicole Gelinas,        a fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, said more money isn\u2019t the answer.

With a separate bloc of Republicans saying Monday night they wouldn\u2019t support a broader health bill, that made two major GOP health efforts thwarted by internal party opposition in less than 24 hours.Mr. McConnell said the decision to hold the vote next week was made at the request of President       Donald Trump       and Vice President       Mike Pence.       Mr. Trump said Tuesday he wanted Republicans to focus on winning more Senate seats in 2018, and a political-action committee said it would seek primary challenges against GOP senators who block that vote.\u201cAs of today we just simply do not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing law,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. Three senators also said they would oppose the straight repeal measure, one more than what Mr. McConnell could afford to lose.The impasse reflects the changing calculus for the GOP: Though the party made political hay by campaigning against and voting repeatedly to repeal the law while       Barack Obama       was president, now that Mr. Trump is in office and promising to sign the bill, the situation is politically fraught. Republicans had struggled for weeks to craft a bill that would preserve the ACA\u2019s most popular elements while also curbing Medicaid spending and lowering insurance premiums.With Senate Republicans having trouble agreeing on a new health-care system, Mr. McConnell had turned late Monday night to a fallback option: repeating a vote on a bill passed by the Senate in 2015, later vetoed by Mr. Obama, to repeal much of the law without setting up new ways to bolster insurance coverage. About 20 million Americans have gained coverage under the ACA.Of the 52 current GOP senators, 49 had voted for the 2015 repeal bill. But many senators made it clear that a repeal of the law known as Obamacare threatened to alarm their constituents and destabilize the insurance market.\u201cTo just say, \u2018Repeal and trust us\u2014we\u2019re going to fix it in a couple years,\u2019 that\u2019s not going to provide comfort to the anxiety that a lot of Alaskan families are feeling right now,\u201d GOP Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska told reporters. \u201cThere is enough chaos and uncertainty already.\u201dBy midday Tuesday, GOP Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia and Ms. Murkowski all said they would oppose a procedural motion necessary to begin consideration of a repeal bill, depriving it of the support needed to advance. Mr. McConnell couldn\u2019t lose more than two GOP votes at any point in the process.Mr. Trump, who on Monday night had thrown his weight behind Mr. McConnell\u2019s bid to hold a repeal-only vote, modified his approach Tuesday, saying the ACA, if untouched, would collapse under its own weight.At a lunch in the White House, he said his plan was now \u201cto let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we\u2019re probably in that position where we\u2019ll let Obamacare fail. We\u2019re not going to own it.\u201dDemocrats said the ACA insurance exchanges, while fragile in some states, weren\u2019t headed for collapse. They also said the president was trying to undermine the health-care system rather than seeking bipartisan cooperation.\u201cHe wants to throw up his hands rather than roll up his sleeves to work with us to solve the problem,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters. \u201cWe Democrats have held the door to bipartisanship open to our Republican colleagues for months. It\u2019s time for the Republicans to walk through it.\u201dThe ACA widened health coverage by expanding Medicaid and setting up subsidies for people to buy health coverage on the exchanges, paid for by taxes on medical companies and higher earners. While the law has been viewed unfavorably by most Republican voters and donors, certain provisions, including a regulation that prevents insurers from charging more or refusing to cover patients with costly medical conditions, have proved popular. Many GOP governors also have welcomed the law\u2019s expanded Medicaid funding for their states.Some conservatives who had criticized the Senate-crafted bill for not doing enough to undo the ACA applauded Mr. McConnell\u2019s pivot to call for a vote on a straight repeal.\u201cThose Republicans who promised to repeal Obamacare ought to vote the same way they voted in 2015,\u201d Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015, then you need to go back home and you need to explain to Republicans why you\u2019re no longer for repealing Obamacare.\u201dOther Republicans said that path would be irresponsible and generate anxiety for both the markets and their constituents. \u201cI did not come to Washington to hurt people,\u201d Ms. Capito said in a statement. \u201cI cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.\u201dMs. Capito and Ms. Murkowski both voted for the 2015 repeal bill; Ms. Collins voted against it.Republicans grappled Tuesday with the increasing likelihood that they would be unable to pass substantive legislation overhauling the ACA without Democratic support. GOP leaders have warned their rank-and-file that taking no action on health care could end up being a political liability and open the party to criticism for failing to fulfill a longstanding promise despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.\u201cYou\u2019ll see real anger,\u201d said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that focuses on fiscal and tax issues. \u201cI think the Republican Party has huge problems if they don\u2019t repeal Obamacare. They have a huge integrity problem.\u201dFrom the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, GOP leaders faced a core challenge: Any replacement health plan that satisfied GOP conservatives was likely to be opposed by the party\u2019s centrists, and vice versa.It\u2019s a challenge they haven\u2019t overcome. Mr. McConnell abandoned the Senate GOP health bill Monday night when defections by GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas left him short of the votes needed for passage, after Ms. Collins and Mr. Paul had already said they would vote no.Turning to a repeal bill was plan B.\u2014Siobhan Hughes, Louise Radnofsky, Stephanie Armour and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Stares Down Loss on Health.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-health-law-repeal-plan-faces-immediate-obstacles-1500394299", "news_title": "GOP Stares Down Loss on Health-Care Bill", "keywords": "political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014China\u2019s already formidable internet censors have demonstrated a new strength\u2014the ability to delete images in one-on-one chats as they are being transmitted, making them disappear before receivers see them.The ability is part of a broader technology push by Beijing\u2019s censors to step up surveillance and get ahead of activists and others communicating online in China.Displays of this new image-filtering capability kicked into high gear last week as Chinese dissident       Liu Xiaobo      lay dying from liver cancer and politically minded Chinese tried to pay tribute to him, according to activists and a new research report.Wu Yangwei,        a friend of the long-jailed Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said he used popular messaging app WeChat to send friends a photo of a haggard Mr. Liu embracing his wife. Mr. Wu believed the transmissions were successful, but he said his friends never saw them.\u201cSometimes you can get around censors by rotating the photo,\u201d said Mr. Wu, a writer better known by his pen name,       Ye Du.       \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t always work.\u201dThere were disruptions on Tuesday to another popular messaging app, Facebook Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp, with many China-based users saying they were unable to send photos and videos without the use of software that circumvents Chinese internet controls. Text messages appeared to be largely unaffected.WhatsApp, which employs encryption that allows users to have secure conversations, is one of the few foreign messaging apps that has gone unblocked in China. Supporters of Mr. Liu had been using it to exchange information and images of the Nobel laureate in recent days.WhatsApp made no technical changes that would limit its service in China, a person familiar with the matter said.Chinese internet censorship first concentrated on the development of word-screening software to root out politically objectionable content. As a result, internet users over the past couple of years turned to sending photos to evade cyber police. In response, censors upped their game by demonstrating the ability to purge images from group chats and public posts.In a new report, researchers from the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab said they observed that WeChat expanded its image censorship to one-to-one chats for the first time, in the wake of Mr. Liu\u2019s death on Thursday.Citizen Lab, a human-rights research group known for its studies of Internet censorship and surveillance, said it is investigating how WeChat is able to filter the images. Since the images are blocked mid-transit, the speed is too fast for human intervention. The rapid blocking suggests an algorithm is at work, Citizen Lab researcher Lotus Ruan said.Though activists said they noticed image censoring over the past year, Ms. Ruan said Citizen Lab didn\u2019t detect this kind of targeted, person-to-person image blocking when it was investigating Chinese censorship in the spring.Tencent Holdings Ltd., the Chinese internet company that operates WeChat, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Online-content companies are required to strictly censor their platforms, a front-line defense that is augmented by police forces dedicated to internet monitoring.The requirement of companies to censor online content is written into governent regulations.Because WhatsApp is a foreign service, China can\u2019t order it to implement fine-toothed censorship at the level of individual messages. Instead, to stop the transmission of certain images on WhatsApp, censors have to disrupt the sending of images for all users in China.The use of enhanced image filtering comes as Chinese authorities move to step up surveillance by using new data-driven technologies. Security cameras with facial-recognition software are being deployed in Chinese cities to catch jaywalkers and track criminal suspects. Local governments are rolling out \u201csocial credit\u201d systems that catalog the digital lives of its citizens, including their internet history and bill payments.A high-stakes leadership shuffle in the fall that is likely to see Chinese President Xi Jinping further consolidate his power could also help explain the evolution in censorship. Internet controls tend to tighten significantly in the run-up to major political events in China.These capabilities are closing a censorship gap that Chinese activists and ordinary internet users have counted on\u2014that the sheer mass of messages was too much for censors to handle.\u201cIf you hire a million network police, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to filter 1.4 billion people\u2019s messages,\u201d said       Bao Pu,        a Hong Kong-based publisher of political books that are banned on the mainland. \u201cBut if you have a machine doing it, it can instantly block everything. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a billion messages or 10 billion.\u201dCitizen Lab researchers said an increase in image censoring was noticeable as part of a broader clampdown on messages about Mr. Liu. The researchers said they documented 19 images blocked in one-to-one chats, including a cartoon of an empty chair, in addition to images blocked in group chats. Mr. Liu was famously represented by an empty chair at the 2010 ceremony where he was awarded his Nobel Peace Prize while in prison in China.In tests conducted by The Wall Street Journal, some images of Mr. Liu were blocked in private WeChat messages, including a widely circulated one of him and his wife and another one overlaid with information about a vigil in Hong Kong. Some other photos transmitted successfully.Activists said that they have noticed more frequent image blocks on WeChat over the past year and that there are signs the censorship is automated: One image will be blocked while a similar one in a different color scheme will go through.Citizen Lab researcher Jeffrey Knockel said slight changes to an image or its metadata allow it to slip through the filter, while other modified pictures get blocked. That suggests WeChat is filtering based on certain data, or \u201chash,\u201d of the image, he said.\u2014Alyssa Abkowitz  and Josh Chin  contributed to this article.Write to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Beijing\u2019s Censors Target Chat Images.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-stopchat-censors-can-now-erase-images-mid-transmission-1500363950", "news_title": "China\u2019s Stopchat: Censors Can Now Erase Images Mid-Transmission ", "keywords": "chinese censors ,chinese internet censors ,liu xiaobo ,the great firewall ,wechat,Facebook,WeChat,political,general news,censorship,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,communications software,computing,instant messaging programs,online service providers,mobile applications software,technology"}, {"content": "International Business Machines Corp.        IBM -4.20%       on Tuesday reported falling quarterly profit and sales, adding to doubts about Chief Executive       Ginni Rometty\u2019s       lengthy effort to reinvent the 106-year-old technology giant.The 4.7% drop in second-quarter revenue, to $19.3 billion, marked the 21st consecutive quarter of declining sales at IBM. Profit margins also narrowed across all business units, including the divisions for its main cloud computing and Watson-artificial intelligence operations\u2014two areas Ms. Rometty is counting on to propel the company\u2019s turnaround. Profit fell 6.9% from a year earlier.Ms. Rometty highlighted new features and clients for IBM\u2019s cloud services, the business of hosting and managing customers\u2019 computing operations in its data centers. \u201cWe strengthened our position as the enterprise cloud leader,\u201d she said in a press release. The company said cloud revenue rose 15% from a year earlier to $3.9 billion. But IBM includes in that tally sales from various divisions, and revenue slipped 5% in the technology services and cloud platforms segment, which is its largest.Earnings results exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. Still, revenue came in below forecasts, and shares in Big Blue slid more than 3% after-hours Tuesday, extending a roughly 8% drop this year through Tuesday\u2019s close. In contrast, the S&P 500\u2019s has gained nearly 9% during the same period.IBM\u2019s legacy businesses selling hardware, software, and services for traditional corporate computing facilities have been slowing as companies embrace cloud computing. Ms. Rometty, who became CEO in January 2012, has placed big bets on markets IBM calls \u201cstrategic initiatives\u201d\u2014including cloud computing as well as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity\u2014where it believes it can achieve faster growth and higher margins.The company has struggled to keep those new businesses growing at a pace that outweighs the decline in its old ones. Its revamp had seemed to gain momentum last year, with profit rising in the fourth quarter. But profit started dropping again in the first quarter, and the latest result puts pressure on Ms. Rometty to boost results in the second half of this year to make good on IBM\u2019s full-year forecast.\u201cThe strategic imperative story is still one they\u2019re touting, but it has not led to an improvement in the overall revenue growth rate of the company,\u201d said analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research.Martin Schroeter,        chief financial officer, said IBM \u201cfinished the first half spot-on where we said we would. We positioned ourselves to have the second half that we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver.\u201dThe company on Tuesday reiterated its annual forecast, calling for adjusted earnings\u2014which omit items including acquisition- and retirement-related charges\u2014of at least $13.80 a share and free cash flow to be flat relative to last year.The Armonk, N.Y., computing giant said revenue in its strategic-initiative areas rose 7% in the quarter, down from 12% growth in the first quarter. The company said such revenue accounted for 43% of its total over the past 12 months. Mr. Schroeter said he expects a strategic-imperative growth rate between 10% and 11% for 2017 as new signings take effect and new hardware drives broader sales.Revenue at the division that includes Watson services focused on the health care and finance markets fell 2.5% from last year\u2019s second quarter to $4.56 billion.Profit margins have been eroding despite the growth in purportedly higher-margin businesses. Gross margins continued to narrow across all business units, though by less than in the first quarter.Declining gross margins challenge the notion that IBM\u2019s investments in areas like artificial intelligence and cloud computing can pay off.\u201cThe narrative is becoming tedious\u2014a lot of investment in next-gen tech with little revenue impact and with increasing dependence on cost take-outs or below-the-line items to manage EPS,\u201d wrote Mark Moskowitz of Barclays Bank PLC in recent note.Ms. Rometty is now midway through her sixth year as CEO, and IBM\u2019s stock has fallen roughly 17% during her tenure. In May, she lost some support from one of IBM\u2019s most important backers, when       Warren Buffett,        chairman of             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,       who had been IBM\u2019s largest investor, revealed that he had sold about a third Berkshire\u2019s stake.Ms. Rometty will turn 60 on July 29, the age at which her predecessors,       Samuel Palmisano       and       Louis Gerstner,        both retired.However there are no signs she is planning to move on. An IBM spokesman noted that its board had awarded Ms. Rometty stock options that don\u2019t vest until 2019, and said that, while the 60-year-old retirement age has been a tradition of IBM CEOs, \u201cit\u2019s not a rule, and there is no policy on age 60.\u201dWrite to Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'IBM\u2019s Revamp Sputters as Sales Fall Yet Again.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-revenue-decline-continues-to-pressure-bottom-line-1500411024", "news_title": "IBM Revenue Decline Continues to Pressure Bottom Line", "keywords": "cloud computing,earnings, profit, quarter, results, revenue, sales, watson,International Business Machines,IBM,Ginni Rometty,Warren Buffett,financial performance,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,computer services,business,consumer services,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014As the Trump administration prepares for its first formal economic talks with China here Wednesday, Chinese officials highlighted their ability to quell trade tensions with the new American president, while some U.S. business groups expressed concern their government might not push Beijing hard enough.After Donald Trump\u2019s November election, \u201cmany kept their fingers crossed, worrying that China-U.S. trade relations would enter a stormy\u2026winter and even run the risk of a trade war,\u201d Chinese Vice Premier       Wang Yang       told a luncheon of business executives here Tuesday.But Mr. Trump has since dropped his threats to impose drastic penalties against Chinese imports\u2014an across-the-board tariff, or a formal charge of currency manipulation\u2014and has so far focused on small market-opening agreements, instead.Both sides will likely discuss Wednesday a new list of specific sectors where they can announce new China market access for U.S. firms. The first round in the new \u201cU.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue,\u201d will be led by Mr. Wang and two top Trump economic aides: Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       and Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin.\u201cOur economic teams have built mutual trust\u2026featuring mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\u201d Mr. Wang said.U.S. business groups, which had originally braced for the hostilities Mr. Wang referred to, are now growing worried the Trump administration may not press China hard enough for broad reforms they consider necessary to pry China\u2019s economy open.\u201cMuch more needs to be done,\u201d       Thomas Donohue,        president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said at the outset of the luncheon hosted by his organization.In advance of this week\u2019s talks, the group submitted a report to Trump officials praising them for \u201ca good start,\u201d but adding \u201cadditional near-term outcomes need to be more far-reaching in scope and benefit.\u201dMany executives say they\u2019re prodding the administration to craft a broader, strategic approach to addressing Chinese structural barriers, rather than the \u201ctransactional\u201d case-by-case tack taken so far, which, they say, may benefit specific companies without addressing deeper concerns U.S. companies have with opaque Chinese regulations and industrial policies.Business groups have also expressed disappointment in the limited gains from a handful of market-opening measures in agriculture and finance announced in May as an early down payment in the new \u201ceconomic dialogue.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tone on China changed markedly as he hosted Chinese President       Xi Jinping       at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April. At the time, Mr. Trump noted the friendship he struck up with his counterpart, and suggested that he would cut China some slack on trade issues in exchange for Mr. Xi\u2019s cooperation reining in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.Mr. Trump has since expressed disappointment in Beijing\u2019s handling of Pyongyang, and has threatened to impose tariffs on steel imports to fight China\u2019s massive overcapacity in that sector.

He was told that a Russian lawyer he was meeting would provide allegedly incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton, offered as part of the Russian government\u2019s support of his father\u2019s candidacy.In an email to the younger Mr. Trump dated June 3, 2016, a British publicist said that a top Russian prosecutor had \u201coffered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201dDonald Trump Jr. said no useful information came out of the meeting. He said he didn\u2019t tell his father, President Donald Trump, about the meeting because it was \u201csuch a nothing.\u201dDonald Trump Jr. said he agreed to hold the meeting because he thought the email was interesting. \u201cSomeone sends me an email\u2014I can\u2019t help what someone sends me. You know, I read it, I responded accordingly.\u201dJared KushnerJared Kushner disclosed the meeting earlier this year in a required form to obtain a security clearance, according to a statement by his attorney,       Jamie Gorelick.\u201cMr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr.,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said.Two previously disclosed meetings Mr. Kushner held with key Russians\u2014the head of a state-run bank that has faced U.S. sanctions and       Sergei Kislyak,        the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014had already drawn the interest of agents conducting a counterintelligence investigation to determine the extent of those contacts. Mr. Kushner agreed earlier this year to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the first White House official to do so.Paul ManafortPaul Manafort was the third Trump campaign representative present at the meeting. Mr. Manafort resigned about two months later amid reports of his connection to pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine. Investigators are examining whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for foreign interests violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related laws.Mr. Manafort\u2019s spokesman has said he is taking the \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to respond to guidance from federal authorities about his FARA disclosures.Natalia VeselnitskayaIn the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, raised the issue of the Magnitsky Act, which placed sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers.Ms. Veselnitskaya said she met with Donald Trump Jr. in her capacity as a private attorney, and has no ties to the Russian government. \u201cThe purpose of my brief meeting with Mr. Trump, Jr. was to explain the facts of my client\u2019s position,\u201d she said. She said she has also met with members of Congress to discuss the Magnitsky Act on behalf of her clients.Donald Trump Jr. said she also spoke about information on Russia-connected individuals allegedly funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but he said her statements were \u201cvague, ambiguous and made no sense\u201d and she offered no evidence.Ms. Veselnitskaya denied she offered such information. Ms. Veselnitskaya said in an interview with NBC she didn\u2019t take the meeting with the intent of supplying \u201cdamaging\u201d information on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said.Ms. Veselnitskaya has extensive links to the Kremlin and has met regularly with Russian authorities, including Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika. She counts among her clients state-owned companies and family members of top government officials, and her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region.Anatoli SamochornovMr. Samochornov, a former State Department contractor, attended the meeting to serve as an interpreter for Ms. Veselnitskaya. Mr. Samochornov has declined to discuss the meeting, saying he signed a nondisclosure agreement in his role as an interpreter.Rinat AkhmetshinMr. Akhmetshin is a Russian-born lobbyist whose latest work against sanctions on Moscow has drawn congressional scrutiny and allegations of ties to Russian intelligence. He has lately led an uphill battle against the Magnitsky Act. He has worked as a lobbyist and public-relations consultant in Washington for more than a decade. His early clients included Russians who were trying to burnish their image in the U.S.Ike KaveladzeMr. Kaveladze, who serves as vice president at the Crocus Group\u2014a company run by Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, who helped arrange the 2016 meeting\u2014was asked by Mr. Agalarov to attend as an interpreter for the Russian lawyer, according to Scott Balber, a lawyer who represents Messrs. Kaveladze and Agalarov. But the lawyer, Ms. Veselnitskaya, brought her own interpreter, and Mr. Kaveladze \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall saying a single word at the meeting,\u201d Mr. Balber said.Mr. Kaveladze was unaware of what would be discussed at the meeting until moments before, when he met Ms. Veselnitskaya and was told \u201ca little bit about this Magnitsky Act,\u201d Mr. Balber said. He recalls the meeting only discussing the Magnitsky Act, his lawyer said.Rob GoldstoneMr. Goldstone, a publicist, said he was asked by Emin Agalarov\u2014a pop singer and son of Aras Agalarov\u2014to help set up the eventual meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides. Mr. Goldstone\u2019s emails to Donald Trump Jr. setting up the meeting offered the clearest evidence yet that a member of the candidate\u2019s inner circle was informed about Russia\u2019s efforts to help their campaign.\u201cI reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and he agreed to squeeze us into a very tight meeting schedule,\u201d said Mr. Goldstone. \u201cAt the meeting, the Russian attorney presented a few very general remarks regarding campaign funding and then quickly turned the topic to that of the Magnitsky Act and the banned U.S. adoption of Russian children\u2014at which point the meeting was halted by Don Jr. and we left.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-who-attendees-at-june-2016-meeting-in-trump-tower-with-russian-lawyer-1500420137", "news_title": "Who\u2019s Who: Attendees at June 2016 Meeting in Trump Tower With Russian Lawyer", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated Tuesday as the dollar and government-bond yields came under fresh pressure.The day\u2019s moves came after Senate Republicans\u2019 latest plan to vote on a measure dismantling the Affordable Care Act was derailed.

Ms. Peirce, a researcher at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, was previously chosen during the Obama administration two years ago to fill a Republican seat at the SEC. Her nomination ran aground at the time after Democratic senators raised objections to her as well as their own party\u2019s choice to fill a commissioner slot reserved for Democrats.President Donald Trump will nominate her again. Her move to the SEC, which has five commissioners when it is at full strength, would make it easier for Chairman       Jay Clayton       to carry out an agenda focused on reducing regulatory burdens for public companies.The White House didn\u2019t announce a pick Tuesday to fill a vacant Democratic commissioner\u2019s seat. The Senate typically considers such nominees in pairs, with one Democrat and one Republican moving through the Senate confirmation process together. The lack of a Democratic pick could mean that senators won\u2019t immediately act upon Ms. Peirce\u2019s nomination.Ms. Peirce, who was an SEC staff attorney before working for Republican senators on Capitol Hill, has attacked curbs on banks\u2019 betting with their own money, tighter oversight of money-market mutual funds and other regulations. She has criticized a governing panel known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, charged with detecting risks that could lead to another crisis, as \u201ccareless\u201d and more likely to smother the financial industry.Ms. Peirce declined to comment. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.Ms. Peirce, if confirmed, would add to the ranks of Trump administration appointees hailing from George Mason, a school known for its conservative faculty and research critical of federal regulation. She coedited a book this year titled \u201cReframing Financial Regulation: Enhancing Stability and Protecting Consumers.\u201d She edited another book in 2012 that argued the Dodd-Frank financial law was a flawed response to the 2008 financial crisis.A Yale-educated attorney, Ms. Peirce worked at the SEC from 2000 to 2008 before taking a job as counsel to Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, the panel set to weigh in on her nomination.At the SEC, she initially worked in a division responsible for overseeing mutual funds and helped with a 2003 report that laid the groundwork for the SEC\u2019s oversight of hedge funds\u2014though she didn\u2019t personally embrace those recommendations. She has subsequently suggested hedge-fund registration is a mistake because it diverts limited SEC resources away from protecting less-sophisticated investors. At the SEC, she also worked for former Commissioner Paul Atkins, a Republican lawyer and regulatory expert who last year advised Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team on financial regulation.J.W. Verret, a colleague of Ms. Peirce\u2019s who teaches at George Mason\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School, said her reputation as a deregulator shouldn\u2019t obscure how seriously she takes the SEC\u2019s mission to protect investors and help promote capital raising.\u201cShe worked at the commission for a long time, and that speaks to her respect for the agency,\u201d Mr. Verret said.If confirmed, Ms. Peirce would join Michael Piwowar as the second Republican commissioner to have worked for the Senate Banking Committee.

They are pushing up the prices.\u201dSupply in the U.S. is already severely constrained. The number of homes on the market has fallen year-over-year for 24 consecutive months, according to the Realtors association, making the most-recent spring selling season one of the most competitive on record.Builders, squeezed by labor shortages, zoning restrictions and a lack of available lots in prime locations, haven\u2019t been able to construct enough homes to keep up with demand. U.S. starts for new homes and apartment units are still at just 60% of their 50-year averages, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia.Those factors have fueled price increases in coastal markets that could be hard to sustain, especially if foreigners ultimately pull back, economists said.Average home prices in San Francisco have more than doubled since 2009, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which track home prices across the U.S., though recently the market has slowed as prices have risen beyond what most buyers can afford.Economists said other cities that are still experiencing significant home-price appreciation\u2014including New York, Seattle and Miami\u2014could have similar slowdowns.Across the U.S., home prices rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April, according to Case-Shiller. Home prices hit a record in September and price growth has accelerated in almost every month since.The recent surge in foreign buying was driven largely by Canadians flocking south to escape their own overheated real-estate markets. U.S. home prices are starting to look like a bargain compared with Vancouver and Toronto, where prices rose nearly 30% in the year ended in March. The gains slowed to a 6% year-over-year increase in June.\u201cThere\u2019s the flashing red exit sign going \u2018It\u2019s time to get out now,\u2019\u201d said Brent Leathwood, a broker in Florida who said he is seeing an uptick in Canadian buying.The real-estate boom up north also helps give Canadians the cash to invest in vacation properties to the south. Mr. Leathwood said he recently worked with a couple who flew down from Vancouver.\u201cThey\u2019re shocked at what $300,000 or $400,000 will buy them,\u201d he said. In Florida they can get a detached single-family house in that price range, while in Canada even an 800-square-foot condo is roughly twice that much, he said.Foreign buyers tend to purchase more expensive homes than their local counterparts. The median price for a home purchased by a foreigner was more than $300,000, compared with roughly $235,000 for all existing homes sold in the U.S., according to the National Association of Realtors.After dipping in 2016 to nearly $9 billion in sales, transactions involving Canadians this year more than doubled to $19 billion, a new high.\u201cGiven the price appreciation that has occurred in those two cities, they have money to spend,\u201d Mr. Yun said.Foreign buyers continue to make up a small share of the U.S. market overall, but in some places they are a significant enough force to help explain why prices are rising so rapidly.Purchases by foreigners accounted for 10% of U.S. existing-home sales by dollar volume in the year ended in March, up from 8% in 2016.Foreign buyers are disproportionately concentrated in a handful of states, with Florida, Texas and California together making up 46% of foreign buying activity, the report said.Still, Mr. Yun said, the major factor driving rapid price gains is a lack of new-home construction that is leading to a dearth of supply.\u201cThe way to assure more affordable homes is to build more and not to limit the demand. The better approach would be to increase construction,\u201d he said.Chinese buyers remained the largest purchasers of U.S. homes by dollar volume, with $31.7 billion worth of purchases in the year, followed by Canadians, Britons, Mexicans and Indians. The bulk of buyers from China, India and Mexico had recently moved to the U.S., while Canadians and Britons were mostly buying second homes.Kerry Lynn, a broker in New York City, said she is seeing more Canadians buying investment properties because they see Manhattan prices as a relative bargain.\u201cThey\u2019re completely priced out of Vancouver,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying Toronto is getting way more expensive, too.\u201dWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Foreigners Pump Up Home Prices in U.S..'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-jump-in-foreign-buying-adds-to-home-price-pressures-1500397264", "news_title": "Foreign Buyers Pump Up U.S. Home Prices ", "keywords": " canadian, chinese, foreign buyers, home prices,house prices, overseas buyers, realtors, record,Lawrence Yun,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "A Hong Kong court has disqualified four opposition legislators for failing to take the oath of office, though the president of the Legislative Council accepted the oaths in October. The decision means that pro-democracy legislators no longer have sufficient votes to block legislation, which may allow Beijing and its local supporters to pass laws to restrict civil liberties.Over the past two decades, many of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy legislators have used the oath-taking ceremony to stage protests, for instance, by changing the words. The council president allowed them to take the oath again. But in November China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) reinterpreted the territory\u2019s constitution, the Basic Law, to prevent two legislators from retaking the oath.Hong Kong\u2019s government used that decision to bring a case against the four disqualified last week. The judge cited the NPC\u2019s requirement that legislators \u201csincerely believe\u201d in the oath. And he found that the manner of the oath-taking\u2014including the tone and speed of their speech, the holding of an umbrella, and comments made at the ceremony\u2014showed they did not.This sets a precedent for challenging other legislators\u2019 sincerity. Chinese officials state that the purpose of the NPC decision was to bar \u201cseparatists,\u201d a category that they suggest could include those who argue for expanding or even merely maintaining the high degree of autonomy guaranteed by Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law.The government could disqualify more legislators for their public statements, although Hong Kong Chief Executive       Carrie Lam       says she has no plans to do so. Electoral officials prevented some candidates from running in September\u2019s election because their support for the Basic Law was deemed insincere.The number of opposition legislators is already limited by rules that minimize the number of directly elected seats. Reducing the opposition even more may allow the government to pass legislation to criminalize calls for self-determination. It tried to do so in 2003 but withdrew the bills after mass protests and defections by pro-government lawmakers. In May China\u2019s third-ranking Politburo member,       Zhang Dejiang,        said Beijing would strengthen its control over Hong Kong and called on the territory to pass antisubversion laws.The disqualified legislators can appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, and by-elections for the six empty seats could become a referendum on the antisubversion laws. But all signs point to Beijing\u2019s determination to coerce the Hong Kong executive and judiciary to tame the opposition.

Cap and trade is projected to increase gas prices by 24 to 73 cents a gallon by 2031. Manufacturers, refiners and other employers in lower-income areas will also have to spend millions to upgrade their equipment or buy carbon permits.Mr. Brown wooed Republicans by offering to extend a partial sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment and waive a rural fee for fire prevention. He drew support from the state Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and Farm Bureau. Former Republican Governors       Pete Wilson       and       Arnold Schwarzenegger       lent their support, for whatever it\u2019s worth nowadays. California\u2019s cap and trade will have a de minimis effect on climate change since the state accounts for less than 1% of global emissions.The seven Assembly Republicans who gave Mr. Brown a bipartisan supermajority let six Democrats\u2014four of whom could face difficult re-election bids in 2018\u2014off the hook. Republicans will now have a harder time using cap and trade as an issue next fall.They\u2019ve also handed Democrats billions more to spend on patronage. State auctions for permits are expected to raise $2 billion this year and up to $4 billion in 2020. One-quarter of the revenues will go toward Mr. Brown\u2019s L.A. to San Francisco choo-choo, which is running on empty. Democrats intend to spend the rest on electric-car rebates, housing subsidies and green pork.The Governor is taking a victory lap, and he should thank Republicans who are so beaten down in the minority that they now confuse surrender with victory.Appeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-climate-cap-and-spend-1500419481", "news_title": "California\u2019s Climate Cap and Spend", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans killed their own health-care bill on Monday evening, and some are quietly expressing relief: The nightmare of a hard decision is finally over, and now on to supposedly more crowd-pleasing items like tax reform. But this self-inflicted fiasco is one of the great political failures in recent U.S. history, and the damage will echo for years.The proximate cause of death was       Mike Lee       of Utah and       Jerry Moran       of Kansas linking arms and becoming the third and fourth public opponents. The previous two public holdouts were       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could lose only two GOP Senators. But this defeat had many authors, some of whom are pictured nearby and all of whom hope to evade accountability for preserving the ObamaCare status quo.But this wasn\u2019t the inevitable result of some tide of progressive history. These were choices made by individuals to put their narrow political and ideological preferences ahead of practical legislative progress. The GOP\u2019s liabilities now include a broken promise to voters; wasting seven months of a new Administration in order to not solve manifest health-care problems; less of a claim to be a governing party; and the harm that these abdications will wreak on the rest of the Republican agenda and maybe their hold on Congress.The ObamaCare Republicans come from both the conservative and moderate wings, but all of these Senators campaigned for nearly a decade on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Now they finally have a President willing to sign literally any bill that lands on his desk, but in the clutch they choked. Some wouldn\u2019t even allow a debate on the floor and the chance to offer amendments.The ObamaCare Republicans ran on fiscal discipline but they rejected the best chance for entitlement reform in a generation. They campaigned against deficits\u2014and some like Mr. Moran and Nevada\u2019s       Dean Heller       have endorsed a balanced-budget amendment\u2014yet they dismissed a $1.022 trillion spending cut. They denounced ObamaCare\u2019s $701 billion in tax increases but then panicked over repealing \u201ctax cuts for the rich.\u201dConservatives like       Ted Cruz       and most GOP Senators played constructive roles, but a question for the ages is which cargo cult Messrs. Lee and Paul have joined. They pose as free-market purists but reject progress toward a freer market. Their claim that the bill didn\u2019t do enough to reduce insurance premiums is risible given that Mr. Cruz\u2019s deregulation amendment was adopted and the alternative is ObamaCare\u2019s even higher rates and fewer choices.Mr. Lee opposed the first draft of the bill in part because it \u201cincluded hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the affluent.\u201d He opposed the new version for \u201cnot repealing all of the ObamaCare taxes.\u201dMessrs. Lee and Paul will try to absolve themselves by voting to move to a debate about straight repeal with no replacement, but no one should believe the ruse. They want to vote against anything that can pass lest they have to take responsibility. By the way, Mr. Lee\u2019s stunt of holding hands with Mr. Moran so neither was the deciding killer vote is a political-evasion classic on par with       Arlen Specter       voting \u201cnot proved\u201d on       Bill Clinton\u2019s       impeachment.The same applies to the centrists who behind the scenes formed a death panel for the bill. No concession was ever satisfactory, and their demands watered down reform. Yet they wouldn\u2019t defend their own compromises, or even try to rebut the media-Democratic caricature of the bill as a human-rights violation.West Virginia\u2019s       Shelley Moore Capito       came out against the bill with a statement that began: \u201cAs I have said before, I did not come to Washington to hurt people.\u201d Does she honestly think so little of her colleagues, and the party she chose to affiliate with, to insult them so casually? This moral grandstanding would be more persuasive if Ms. Capito hadn\u2019t pledged to \u201cturn the tide from a Washington that tells us who our doctors are and delivers a lower quality of care\u201d at the 2016 GOP convention.The moderates will now say that failure can be redeemed with bipartisanship, and watching them beg to be rescued by Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be instructive, not least for exposing the futility of a good-faith health deal.       Mr. Schumer       will offer to enshrine ObamaCare and bail out the insurance companies in return for Democratic votes. If such a bill did pass the Senate, it would put the House in a bind and make Speaker Nancy       Pelosi       more likely.Mr. McConnell       says he will hold the repeal-only vote, and Americans should understand that any Senator who votes against moving to the floor is voting to preserve ObamaCare. If the moderates really want a bipartisan solution, they will vote for repeal with a delayed replacement fuse and then try to persuade Democrats. But they don\u2019t want that amount of political responsibility.If the ObamaCare Republicans now get primary opponents, they have earned them. In two weeks nobody will recall this or that grievance about the Senate bill, but GOP voters will wonder about the bill of goods they were sold.The damage to the GOP\u2019s political image will radiate in ways that are hard to predict. If Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to fulfill a core commitment to voters\u2014whether repeal and replace, or simply to reduce the burden of government\u2014then what is the point of electing Republicans? \u201cSorry, it was too hard\u201d isn\u2019t a winning 2018 message, and botching health reform will add to the betrayal narrative that has so inflamed conservative politics. In this case the critics will have a point.Perhaps this Congress can recover with a rewrite of the tax code. But failure tends to compound, and this show of dysfunction will make Senators even edgier about taking difficult votes.The coming days will see more than a few liberal tributes to the invincibility of the entitlement state, and how Republicans miscalculated by declining to accommodate ObamaCare. Entitlements by their nature are hard to reform once they\u2019ve gained a constituency, but what these odes will omit is how close Republicans came. They had the power to reverse the march toward single-payer health care, and most wanted to use it but were blocked by a few feckless deserters.The ObamaCare Republicans are betting voters won\u2019t remember, but implosions this consequential take a long time to forget.Appeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-obamacare-republicans-1500419426", "news_title": "The ObamaCare Republicans", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The Mexican peso rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than a year, highlighting the reversal in several postelection trades as President       Donald Trump\u2019s       policy agenda stalls.The peso has rebounded from a steep postelection fall and is up almost 19% this year at $0.057224, its highest level since May 2016. That means one dollar buys roughly 17.48 pesos.The currency\u2019s latest surge came after a U.S. roadmap for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement fell short of Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist campaign rhetoric, easing fears that a new deal would hurt Mexico\u2019s export-dependent economy.The peso\u2019s rally has been one of several sharp turnarounds that have played out in financial markets over the past few months, as political wrangling has made it increasingly unlikely that the administration will push through market-boosting policies such as tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending.The dollar hit a new 9\u00bd-month low Tuesday and has fallen 6.5% this year, based on the WSJ Dollar Index, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a gradual pace amid uneven U.S. economic data and falling expectations of fiscal stimulus.Investors have moderated bets on industrial stocks, which would benefit from infrastructure spending, while pouring money into large-capitalization technology stocks that have produced better-than-average returns since the financial crisis. Signs of improving global growth are boosting emerging markets, which many believed would suffer if the White House implemented harsher trade terms.Tuesday\u2019s moves came after some Republican senators declined to back efforts to overhaul health care, the latest blow to the party\u2019s top legislative priority. The failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act is \u201cjust the last straw,\u201d said       Andy Ji,        Asian currency and rates strategist at             Commonwealth Bank of Australia                   in Singapore. \u201cThe health-care bill is just a small part of the big puzzle.\u201dBets on a surge in growth and inflation under the new administration have also unwound as \u00a0disappointing inflation data in the U.S. and the prospect of tighter monetary policy in other developed economies have fed declines in the U.S. currency.U.S. inflation was flat in June compared with the previous month, and consistently low inflation readings could give Fed officials a reason to hesitate before raising interest rates again. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking foreign investors.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled Tuesday at 2.263%, down from 2.446% at the end of last year.\u201cThe U.S. is having difficulty passing its agenda,\u201d said       Alvise Marino,        a currency strategist at             Credit Suisse.       \u201cAdd that to a pretty dovish Fed, and you get a poor picture for the dollar overall.\u201dA narrowing gap between rates in the U.S. and abroad may also be detrimental to the dollar. The Bank of Canada raised rates for the first time in seven years last week, while top officials at the European Central Bank and Bank of England have hinted they could also begin to tighten monetary policy in the near term. The ECB is set to deliver its next policy decision Thursday.At the same time, abating political risk and an expected decline in Mexican inflation will likely benefit the peso, said       Juan Carlos Rodado,        director of Latin American research at             Natixis.       \u201cIn January, it looked like the world was going to fall apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nothing happened.\u201dWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Peso Moves Higher as Trump Trades Fade.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peso-rises-as-trumps-agenda-stumbles-1500415460", "news_title": "Peso Rises as Trump\u2019s Agenda Stumbles ", "keywords": "mexican peso,nafta,Federal Reserve,Donald Trump,Andy Ji,Alvise Marino,Juan Carlos Rodado,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "The GOP\u2019s inability to scrap ObamaCare this week means, among other things, that President Trump will end his first six months in office without a major legislative accomplishment. And one question is how much his supporters care.Recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling gives the president a 40% job-approval rating among all voters, while 55% disapprove. In counties Mr. Trump won last year, however, voters still back him by 50% to 46%. Similar results come from a Washington Post/ABC News survey released Sunday, which found that the president\u2019s approval rating had slid to 36% from 42% in April, while his disapproval rating had climbed five points to 58%. Yet among Republican voters over the same period, Mr. Trump\u2019s favorability has barely budged and remains above 80%.Moreover, these polling results reflect voter sentiment since news broke that Donald Trump Jr. met during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on       Hillary Clinton      \u2014the latest development in the Kremlin \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative that has saturated cable news for months. According to the Post/ABC poll, 41% of all voters believe that the Trump campaign helped Russia try to influence the election, but that belief is shared by fewer than 1 in 10 Republican voters. The average Trump supporter\u2019s concern about Russia roughly matches his concern about the president\u2019s unreleased tax returns or witching-hour tweets.Six months into the Trump presidency, the media by and large remain unable or unwilling to understand what drives his blue-collar supporters. Journalists continue to prioritize their own political concerns and play down those of the nearly 63 million people who pulled the lever for him in November. In her new book, \u201cWhite Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America,\u201d       Joan C. Williams       writes that \u201cduring an era when wealthy white Americans have learned to sympathetically imagine the lives of the poor, people of color, and LGBTQ people, the white working class has been insulted or ignored during precisely the period when their economic fortunes tanked.\u201dIn an essay on the rising rate of premature deaths from suicide, opioids and alcohol poisoning primarily among less-educated whites,       Carol Graham       of the Brookings Institution observes that \u201cpoor blacks and Hispanics are much more optimistic about their futures than are poor whites and, in turn, mortality rates have not increased the same way among minorities.\u201d She adds, \u201cA critical factor is the plight of the white blue-collar worker, for whom hopes for making it to a stable, middle-class life have largely disappeared. Due in large part to technology-driven growth, blue-collar jobs in the traditional primary and secondary industries\u2014such as coal mines and car factories\u2014are gradually disappearing.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s ability to appeal to these voters is the reason he won and the reason his base isn\u2019t abandoning him, with or without a significant legislative victory at the six-month mark.       Emily Ekins,        a Cato Institute scholar who is part of a politically diverse team of academics and pollsters in the process of analyzing the 2016 election, told me on Monday that Trump supporters are less concerned about his policy agenda and more interested in having someone who understands them occupy the Oval Office. The president\u2019s relentless rhetoric about the \u201ccosts\u201d of illegal immigration and free trade, his attacks on outsourcing, and this week\u2019s White House \u201cMade in America\u201d stunt are all of a piece.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of evidence to support the idea that Trump\u2019s main appeal was validating the fears and concerns of a certain segment of Americans who felt they were being ignored by elites in the media, elites in politics, elite Republicans,\u201d said Ms. Ekins. \u201cMy reading of the data is that he\u2019s not on a timer or a clock. And it\u2019s not clear to me that his supporters are waiting for him to achieve X, Y and Z policy goals. That\u2019s an example of the press imposing their expectations on voters.\u201dThis is of little comfort to Republicans in Congress. Unlike the president, GOP lawmakers must face voters next year and desperately want some legislative victories to campaign on. For them, a president this far underwater in national polls is cause for concern, given that the party in control of the White House usually drops seats in midterm elections. What the president\u2019s fans and foes alike want to see is economic growth and job creation, and a Bloomberg poll released Monday showed that a plurality of voters approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in both categories. For now, Mr. Trump can count on his base. The bigger question might be how long he can count on his caucus.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-presidents-base-vs-the-republican-party-1500419237", "news_title": "The President\u2019s Base vs. the Republican Party", "keywords": "donald trump,gop,republican caucus,republican party,trump base,trump voters,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "If ObamaCare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid were measured merely by growth in enrollment and spending, California\u2019s Medi-Cal program would rank as a huge success. Since 2012, Medi-Cal has added six million beneficiaries, primarily able-bodied adults of working age. Covering them last year brought California nearly $20 billion in additional federal funds. If Medi-Cal were a state, its population of 14 million would make it the fifth-largest in the U.S. The program\u2019s $103 billion budget is about three times the size of Illinois\u2019s general fund.But despite the surge in enrollment and spending\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014Medi-Cal has failed to fulfill its stated goal of improving health-care access for the indigent and disabled. A recent report from the Santa Clara County Civil Grand Jury highlighted the conundrum many of the state\u2019s Medicaid enrollees face: \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Medi-Cal, but Can You Get Medical Care?\u201dBy extending Medi-Cal to younger, healthier people\u2014many of whom could be better served by the kind of bare-bones private insurance that ObamaCare outlawed\u2014California has made it harder for those who most need low-cost care to get it.Medicaid operates as an open-ended entitlement, meaning the federal government covers a predetermined share of state spending, regardless of the total cost. Traditionally, the feds have matched California\u2019s outlays dollar for dollar. States where the per capita income is lower receive a more generous match. Nevada, for example, receives about two federal dollars for each one it spends.ObamaCare encouraged states to expand Medicaid so that it covers people with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line\u2014in other words, up to $16,400 for an individual. After the Supreme Court struck down ObamaCare\u2019s mandated expansion, the federal government induced states to sign up by initially assuming 100% of the cost for these people. That will slip to 90% in 2020, though it\u2019s still a bargain for most states.Imagine if Amazon gave you money back whenever you bought things on its site\u2014and you got more money back the more you spent: You\u2019d buy things you don\u2019t need, and things that might be purchased for less elsewhere. That\u2019s what has happened, in effect, with Medi-Cal, which covers everything from acupuncture to chiropractic care to vision.But good luck getting a doctor\u2019s appointment. Last week a group of Medi-Cal beneficiaries sued the state for creating \u201ca separate and unequal system of healthcare, one for the insurance program with the largest proportion of Latinos (Medi-Cal), and one for the other principal insurance plans, whose recipients are disproportionately white.\u201d One plaintiff had her gallbladder removed in Mexico after she spent more than a year trying to find a surgeon who would treat her. The doctor in Mexico had warned she was at risk of death if she put off the surgery, so her family paid for it out of pocket.The problem is that Medi-Cal reimburses providers at between a third to half of the rate that private insurers pay. Doctors complain they lose money on each Medi-Cal patient they see. That\u2019s why only 55% of primary-care physicians accept new Medi-Cal patients, according to a recent study from the California Health Care Foundation. When physicians were asked why they cap the number of Medi-Cal patients they see, 78% cited the program\u2019s low payments.This poses a particularly acute problem in places with large Medicaid populations like Fresno County, where half of residents are in Medi-Cal. Farther north, the UC Davis Medical Center terminated its managed-care contract with Medi-Cal two years ago because of low payments. The Santa Clara grand-jury report says that \u201chalf of the primary-care physicians in the Bay Area do not treat new Medi-Cal patients; most cite low reimbursements, time-consuming paperwork, and payment delays.\u201d In effect, Medi-Cal rations care by underpaying providers.The shortage of doctors accepting Medi-Cal, together with the surge in enrollment, brings patients to the emergency room instead. ER visits by Medi-Cal patients rose 75% over the past five years, according to California\u2019s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The Santa Clara report says that in the first three quarters of 2016, Medi-Cal enrollees in the county were more than twice as likely as the privately insured to visit the ER for outpatient care.\u201cThe biggest financial and administrative problem we have is Medi-Cal patients who could have been seen by a primary care physician flooding ERs,\u201d says       Donald Cornforth,        chief medical officer at Adventist Health Bakersfield.Before ObamaCare, Dr. Cornforth says, many indigent residents would seek treatment at low-cost rural community health centers or clinics along the Mexican border. Now Medi-Cal patients with minor maladies are inundating ERs, where they get free care and take up beds needed for patients who require urgent treatment. He says a sister hospital had so many Medi-Cal patients streaming in during flu season that it had to erect a tent outside the hospital.This is a tremendous waste of resources, since a visit to the ER costs five times as much as an appointment with a primary-care physician. But California has little reason to care, since Washington pays most of the bill. At the same time, hospitals are losing money on many of these new Medi-Cal patients because the government\u2019s low payments often don\u2019t cover the cost of care.It\u2019s worth recalling that liberals claimed ObamaCare would reduce ER visits\u2014and thus health-care spending\u2014since newly insured patients would go to a primary-care physician instead. That hasn\u2019t happened. In California and elsewhere, Medicaid provides Potemkin coverage at a high cost to taxpayers. Democrats denounce as cruel any GOP plan to put the program on a fixed budget.

You were trained not to do something like that.\u201dThe voice belonged to Theodore \u201cDutch\u201d Van Kirk, navigator of the Enola Gay, the U.S. B-29 that in 1945 dropped the world\u2019s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the crew of that plane as ominous talk of atomic warfare is suddenly in the air. The provocative actions and boastful threats out of North Korea\u2014last week its official government news agency referred to a \u201cplan for reducing the U.S. into ashes\u201d\u2014have rekindled the specter of the once all but inconceivable: atomic strikes.North Korea\u2019s chest-thumping notwithstanding, I can tell you one thing for a fact: The men who actually dropped that first atomic bomb didn\u2019t preen and they didn\u2019t brag. There was an air of solemnity to them about the task they had been asked to carry out.In the spring of 1999 I went on a vacation trip to Branson, Mo., with Van Kirk and two of his oldest friends and Enola Gay crewmates:       Paul Tibbets,        the pilot, and       Tom Ferebee,        the bombardier. It was the last reunion they would have; all three men have since died. I was with Van Kirk in his room when I asked whether he and the crew had celebrated their role in the end of the war.\u201cI don\u2019t think that people back then were as demonstrative as they are today,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we certainly were trained not to be that way on our missions. Think about the era we grew up in.       Babe Ruth       would hit a home run and he would run around the bases, and that would be it. You didn\u2019t show much. You took pride in being disciplined.\u201dThere may, understandably, have been drunken joy in Times Square and around the U.S. after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and then of Nagasaki brought World War II to an end. The dropping of the bombs was later selected by the Associated Press as the No. 1 news story of the 20th century. But no one, before or since, had seen what the men in those B-29s witnessed, and they were in no mood to laugh or dance.\u201cI would hate to think about someone in my family being down there,\u201d the bombardier, Ferebee, told me. \u201cParts of buildings were coming up the stem of the bomb\u2014you could tell that something strange was going on, because you could see parts of the city, pieces of the buildings, like they were being sucked up toward us.\u201dHe had done his somber job flawlessly, but he didn\u2019t feel particularly heroic. As a boy in North Carolina, he said, \u201cI wanted to play baseball. That was my dream. I went down to Florida with the St. Louis Cardinals for spring training in 1939. .\u00a0.\u00a0. I wasn\u2019t good enough, yet. And then the war came. .\u00a0.\u00a0. I would rather have helped the Cardinals win a World Series. That\u2019s all I ever wanted.\u201dIn Branson we would go to dinner in chain restaurants and the other customers would have no idea who the three elderly men were\u2014or what their country once asked of them. Tibbets, who invited me to come on the trip, had been consistent since the end of the war in publicly saying he slept well because he knew how many lives, American and Japanese, his mission had saved by at last bringing the conflict to a close and preventing a land invasion of Japan.But in quiet moments, he said he fully understood the anguish of people who disagreed with him. \u201cI had a different relationship to that day than they do,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make them wrong. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s wrong or what\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m right. .\u00a0.\u00a0.

The U.S. buys about half of Venezuela\u2019s exports, providing a key source of cash as shipments to allies like China are largely used to repay existing loans.\u201cWe will do our best to try to avoid, of course, the negative impact on the U.S., as much as possible, but we also will not shy away from having impacts as needed if it\u2019s in our international security interests,\u201d the official said.Earlier in Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s government issued a firm rebuke of President       Donald Trump       after he threatened to put sanctions on the country unless Mr. Maduro abandoned his plans for a new assembly. Foreign Minister       Samuel Moncada       accused the U.S. of seeking to topple the embattled Maduro regime by backing the antigovernment protests that have rocked the South American country over the last three months, costing more than 90 lives. He said Venezuela would evaluate its relations with the U.S., though the countries haven\u2019t exchanged ambassadors since 2010.\u2018[Mr. Maduro is] a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.\u2019\u201cThis is a dark day for relations, not only between Venezuela and the U.S., but between Latin America and the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Moncada said. \u201cUnfortunately, in the most powerful country in the world we have a president who likes humiliating his neighbors, coercing them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with Venezuela, he won\u2019t be able to.\u201dMr. Trump, in a three-paragraph statement Monday, called Mr. Maduro \u201ca bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.\u201d He urged the Venezuela government to drop the assembly plans and allow general elections. If it doesn\u2019t, he said, \u201cthe U.S. will take strong and swift economic actions.\u201dAmid a crippling recession and months of deadly protests, more than 7.5 million Venezuelans on Sunday voted in an unofficial plebiscite and overwhelmingly opposed the constituent assembly. Mr. Maduro has dismissed the referendum as a nonbinding internal consultation by the opposition, expressing scorn that some observers say could push the country into a new phase of political crisis.\u201cThe levels of violence and civilian deaths are increasing exponentially and could sink Venezuela to permanent failed-state status,\u201d said Moises Rendon, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.The Trump administration\u2019s sanction threats are designed to restore democracy to the country, according to the senior U.S. official. \u201cThe Maduro regime, which the vote on Sunday has deemed to be invalid and illegitimate, cannot be allowed to continue to go on this path to being a full dictator,\u201d the official said.U.S. lawmakers and administration officials are divided over exactly how the U.S. should sanction Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. But on Tuesday top lawmakers from both parties on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the U.S. should work with other countries and the United Nations to pressure Caracas to stop the constituent assembly. They also said administration should take \u201cadditional meaningful actions\u201d if Mr. Maduro moves ahead with his plan.U.S. lawmakers are divided over U.S. sanctions against Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.

An oil embargo, he said, would give Mr. Maduro \u201ca perfect excuse to blame the U.S. for the crisis.\u201dMessrs. Na\u00edm and Rendon advocate ratcheting up the pressure on Caracas by expanding the U.S. sanctions list to target a broader list of individuals who are either in Mr. Maduro\u2019s regime or facilitating it through narco-trafficking and money laundering.\u2018The challenge for the U.S. is to do this in a way that is productive and constructive, as opposed to the U.S. then being used by the Maduro regime as a tool to justify their actions.\u2019U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       outlined such a strategy last month in a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cWe are working with Treasury to develop a very robust list of individuals,\u201d he said, adding that the administration was wary of giving the Venezuelan president political succor.\u201cThe challenge for the U.S. is to do this in a way that is productive and constructive, as opposed to the U.S. then being used by the Maduro regime as a tool to justify their actions,\u201d he said.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Considers Venezuela Sanctions.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 19:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-fires-back-at-trump-1500399945", "news_title": "U.S. Prepared to Sanction Venezuela, Including Possible Ban on Oil Imports", "keywords": "venezuela assembly, venezuela constitution, venezuela opposition, venezuela sanctions,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,Samuel Moncada,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "From \u201cMinimum wage and restaurant hygiene violation: Evidence from food establishments in Seattle,\u201d a working paper by       Subir K.

He has posed a fair question that requires an answer.Here\u2019s my crack at an explanation: Campaigning is one thing, governing another. Opposing is not the same as legislating. Republicans had seven years to coalesce around a replacement for       Obama      Care, and they wasted them. The bill they passed in 2015 was for show; they knew that President Obama would veto it and that they would not have to take responsibility for its consequences. Republicans are a majority party, but they have yet to prove that they are a governing party.After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s effort to broker a compromise collapsed Monday evening, the president tweeted that \u201cRepublicans should just REPEAL failing Obamacare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate.\u201d In a burst of enthusiastic fantasy, he added that \u201cDems will join in!\u201dNo, they won\u2019t, and some Republicans won\u2019t either. Just hours after       Mr. McConnell       declared his intention to bring the bill the House passed earlier this year to the floor and then move the 2015 bill as the first amendment, Republican Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine,       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska announced their opposition, refusing to repeal ObamaCare without simultaneously replacing it.\u201cI did not come to Washington to hurt people,\u201d Ms. Capito said. \u201cI cannot vote to repeal ObamaCare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.\u201dAlthough these three senators were out in front, I doubt they were speaking only for themselves. In 2015 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the ObamaCare repeal plan passed by the Senate would result in lost insurance coverage for 22 million Americans if enacted. Republicans are already concerned about the coverage losses their current proposals would produce. Why would they back repeal legislation that would do no better while throwing the entire health-care sector into turmoil until they were able to agree on a replacement?There is a way forward, and Mr. McConnell has pointed to it. Republicans and Democrats could sit down together to negotiate much-needed fixes to ObamaCare\u2019s troubled health-insurance exchanges. With even a modicum of goodwill on both sides, this would not be \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201dAlong with bipartisanship, Mr. McConnell should do what he promised\u2014return the Senate to regular order. Explaining his decision to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the       McConnell bill,        Kansas Sen.       Jerry Moran       criticized the \u201cclosed-door process\u201d that had produced the bill and called on his party\u2019s leaders to \u201cstart fresh with an open legislative process.\u201d I suspect the American people would welcome this shift.This episode reveals some larger truths. One is that the Republican coalition disagrees on fundamentals. Small-government conservatives want to reduce spending and cut regulations as a matter of principle, and they are willing to accept the human and political consequences. Others\u2014for whom Sen. Capito spoke\u2014focus on the needs of their constituents. Although they prefer market solutions, they are willing to accept public-sector action when markets fail\u2014even if this means a permanent expansion of government.Last month the Urban Institute estimated that more than 200,000 of Ms. Capito\u2019s constituents would lose access to health care if the Senate bill became law. The bill\u2019s draconian cuts to Medicaid would have driven these losses, and the working-class West Virginians who voted for Donald Trump in droves would have been hit the hardest. Low-income Americans just don\u2019t earn enough to purchase health insurance in the private market. This reality\u2014not abstractions about the role of government\u2014drove her choice.In addition, the United States has an aging population. In coming decades, tens of millions more elderly Americans will need help with the normal activities of daily life, and many will end up in nursing homes. Most Americans of average income will be unable to save enough to afford more than a few months in such institutions, let alone the years that many end up staying. This is why Medicaid finances a large share of nursing-home costs\u2014and why these outlays are bound to rise for the foreseeable future.Yes, reforms are possible. But more than anything else, it is hard-to-change economic realities and immutable demographic trends that drive federal government expenditures. Sooner or later, Republicans will have to make their peace with these stubborn facts.Appeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 18:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/turns-out-governing-is-hard-1500417736", "news_title": "Turns Out Governing Is Hard", "keywords": "health care reform,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,senate republiucans,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Marc Kasowitz,        how could you?

They do want coverage of pre-existing conditions.There is a term for a system in which you are covered if you are sick, but you don\u2019t need to buy coverage and the government promises to make it affordable. It\u2019s health care on demand, with taxpayers footing the bill. It\u2019s single-payer\u2014at least for the sizable portion of the population who can\u2019t be induced through a giant tax incentive to accept insurance from their employer, or who aren\u2019t already under some version of proto-single-payer such as Medicare, Medicaid, etc.Obama      Care was a dog\u2019s breakfast, but at least it was coherent on this fundamental point.Here\u2019s how health care would sooner or later (most likely sooner) come to work in a system in which pre-existing conditions are covered but there is no individual mandate, as the GOP bill proposed.You develop a symptom. You show up at the doctor and, in addition to the other forms, you fill out a form applying for insurance, which you cancel as soon as your treatment is complete.If this is insurance, the cost is identical to the cost of treatment, which for some reason your insurance company fingers briefly (and takes a cut) before passing along to your doctor.This is not insurance. Nor is it a viable business model for insurance companies, except as a receptor into which to pour taxpayer money to cover the cost of everyone\u2019s health care. Now it can be told: The GOP plan that almost certainly now is dead would have been more of an express route to single-payer than ObamaCare ever was.Republicans, though inconvenienced by       John McCain\u2019s       keyhole craniotomy, could have passed something. It would have made no sense, except for the highly useful GOP curbs on Medicaid\u2014which were worth the price of admission.Every administration passes a health-care bill, knowing it won\u2019t be the last word, certain in the knowledge they haven\u2019t fixed anything fundamental in American health care. Reagan gave us Cobra to allow certain employees to keep their insurance after leaving their jobs. Clinton failed to give us HillaryCare but gave us the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.       George W. Bush       gave us the Medicare drug entitlement. Obama gave us you-know-what. Only       George H.W. Bush       failed to enact the obligatory expansion of health-care entitlements for somebody somewhere. He was a one-term president.Were a rational, coherent health-insurance law the apple of any eye, were legislators interested in serving up to the American people a system that would actually be viable and stable, what would it look like?It would repeal and replace everything that isn\u2019t ObamaCare. The bill would have 19 words: \u201cAll government programs and health care-related tax benefits are null and void, except for the Affordable Care Act.\u201dThen would come the much more tractable and cognizable job of fixing ObamaCare. The rational brain could actually get itself around it.Which old people cast adrift from Medicare should receive ObamaCare subsidies, and how much? And how should incentives be structured so young and middle-aged people, via ObamaCare, start financing their own old-age health consumption?How should pre-existing conditions be financed? By rolling the cost into everybody\u2019s premiums, or by a separate taxpayer subsidy so individual premiums could be more actuarially based and attractive to most users?Pre-existing conditions inevitably become a mere transitional problem when the individual mandate is fully institutionalized.We could go on. Correcting the distortions and cross-subsidies that make ObamaCare such a morass, a death spiral in waiting, is not actually a hard job. A properly fixed ObamaCare would be the only health-care program Americans need.This won\u2019t happen, of course. Neither will single-payer. America\u2019s jumble of health-care programs will just be increasingly poorly financed, with longer waits and fewer available providers. The rich, and those with good jobs in corporate America, will benefit from concierge health care in which all the frills and finery are available at a price. It will be expensive. But it will be a hell of lot better than Medicaid.In the meantime, the       Trump       administration is becoming incalculable. Will it survive? In 16 months, after disastrous GOP midterms, will Mr. Trump announce he\u2019s now a Democratic president? In return for what does Chuck Schumer throw him a lifeline? The people who put him in office would applaud and say that\u2019s our Trump, even if the media would be completely nonplused.Appeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-result-of-gop-failure-1500417682", "news_title": "The Result of GOP Failure", "keywords": "health care reform,individual mandate,obamacare,senate republicans,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "By the eve of World War II, the International Committee of the Red Cross had reshaped the landscape of humanitarianism. Founded in 1863 by       Henry Dunant,        a Swiss businessman appalled by the carnage he saw on an Italian battlefield, the organization had made itself the central player in the modern law of war. Having organized the conference that drew up the original Geneva Conventions, the ICRC was formally empowered to tend to wounded, sick and imprisoned soldiers and to ensure that they were humanely treated rather than left for dead. The ICRC had given rise to Red Cross organizations around the world, including in the United States, and had begun attending to disasters, natural and manmade.But what began as an organization meant to curb the barbarity of warfare has found it difficult to live down its most grievous mistake: cozying up to the Third Reich, remaining silent about the Holocaust and later helping Nazis escape justice. In his last book, \u201cNazis on the Run: How Hitler\u2019s Henchmen Fled Justice\u201d (2011), historian       Gerald Steinacher       chronicled one aspect of this shameful era. His newest effort, \u201cHumanitarians at War: The Red Cross in the Shadow of the Holocaust,\u201d synthesizes what he and other historians have learned about the ICRC\u2019s conduct during this troublesome period before adding new material on what the organization did next. This more comprehensive account of the ICRC\u2019s actions equips the reader to decide whether the organization truly recovered from its wartime and postwar errors.Much of \u201cHumanitarians at War\u201d re-treads the ICRC\u2019s missteps in those dark years, rightly laying most of the blame on Switzerland\u2019s       Carl Jacob Burckhardt.       With the ICRC\u2019s moralistic Christian president,       Max Huber,        elderly and often ill during the 1930s, it was Burckhardt, his second in command, who made major decisions regarding relations with Adolf Hitler\u2019s government. A diplomat and known careerist, Burckhardt harbored a traditional anti-Semitism and such hatred of communism that he regarded German Nazism as a bulwark of civilization and a necessary evil. As early as April 1933, the ICRC was receiving desperate letters from inmates of German concentration camps, including one from Dachau pleading: \u201c\u2018I beg you again in the name of the prisoners\u2014Help! Help!\u2019\u201d Yet as Mr. Steinacher writes, during this period Burckhardt was given an inspection tour \u201cand officially lauded the commandant of Dachau for his discipline and decency.\u201dBy Gerald Steinacher  Oxford, 330 pages, $32.95It wasn\u2019t just willfully repeating the Germans\u2019 propaganda that stained the ICRC. Nor was it only the fact that, knowing the Nazis had confirmed their policy of mass extermination of the Jews at the 1942 Wannsee Conference, the ICRC did nothing to intervene. What was more difficult to defend was Burckhardt\u2019s sympathies with and efforts on behalf of Nazi actors after Germany\u2019s defeat. He opposed the Nuremberg trials, labeling them \u201cJewish revenge.\u201d Red Cross officials attempted to whitewash the record of Nuremberg defendant and high-ranking Nazi diplomat       Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker.       After the Holocaust, the ICRC\u2014by then helmed by Burckhardt\u2014even abetted the flight of Nazis such as       Adolf Eichmann       and       Josef Mengele       by providing them with travel papers.Complicating matters was the close tie between the ICRC and the Swiss government. Switzerland\u2019s conduct during the war drew unfavorable comparisons with that of the Swedes, whose wartime record, while hardly \u201cclean,\u201d nonetheless led their country to be labeled the \u201cgood\u201d neutral in contrast with \u201cbad\u201d Switzerland. This fueled a postwar Swedish attempt to take over Switzerland\u2019s longtime custodianship of the laws of war, upon which Mr. Steinacher dwells at length. Strikingly, Switzerland\u2019s unfortunate wartime conduct was not the primary rationale for a Swedish takeover: It was essentially a turf war. Sweden lost because the champion of its effort, Count       Folke Bernadotte,        was assassinated in 1948 while serving as a United Nations mediator in Jerusalem.The denouement of \u201cHumanitarians at War\u201d focuses on the ICRC\u2019s work to create the new Geneva Conventions of 1949, which endure as the main treaties governing the conduct of war. Given their sterling reputation to this day, especially since they provided formal protections for civilians, Mr. Steinacher is willing to conclude that the results of the lawmaking have been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d For this reason, the ICRC seems largely redeemed by the end of the book, and the tale has a happy ending.Mr. Steinacher, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is an excellent historian with a good nose for archives, but his view that the crisis of this one organization amounted to a \u201ccrisis of humanitarianism\u201d is overblown. What difference would it have made if the Swedes had wrangled their way into custodianship of the law of war? One suspects little. Mr. Steinacher\u2019s book also suffers from problematic omissions. He doesn\u2019t explore the ICRC\u2019s yeoman work keeping many POWs in touch with their families, an achievement for which it won a second Nobel Peace Prize in 1944. Nor does he provide much context for the different agendas that European states brought to the revision of the Geneva Conventions\u2014including those powers facing brewing trouble in their colonies, where they knew brutal wars would soon have to be waged.Mr. Steinacher excels at toppling individuals from undeserved moral pedestals. Ironically, he does not do the same for the law of war itself. The truth is that the laws of war, as much as they strive to preserve humane values, still license fierce hostilities, even today. Perhaps it is less interesting that the ICRC almost lost control of the law of war than that humanitarianism has left the world so violent.Mr. Moyn, who teaches law and history at Yale, is the author of \u201cHuman Rights and the Uses of History\u201d and \u201cChristian Human Rights,\u201d among other books.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 18:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-red-cross-and-the-holocaust-1500417644", "news_title": "The Red Cross and the Holocaust", "keywords": "books,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,risk news,military action,war crimes,reviews"}, {"content": "Crown Castle International Corp.

The party has yet to write a budget that will be used as a framework for advancing a tax overhaul. Party leaders also haven\u2019t agreed on key policy objectives, although top leaders from the House, Senate and White House are trying to finish a blueprint.\u201cIt ratchets up pressure on us to get something done. It also makes it difficult to move forward with anything controversial because of a fear of it falling apart,\u201d said Rep.       Tom MacArthur       (R., N.J.) \u201cWe have to get things done that matter to the American people, and tax reform is one of them.\u201dThe tax plan will absorb policy fights left unresolved from health care. Republicans had counted on the health bill to repeal investment and payroll taxes and taxes on health industries created in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Repealing those items in the tax bill would make it harder to cut other taxes and hit fiscal targets, while leaving them in place would upset business groups and others.Politically, Republicans need momentum coming out of health care. But the same narrow vote margins and procedural technicalities that bedeviled them on health care could reappear.Aspects of tax policy could unite Republicans. Party members generally agree that lower marginal rates on corporate taxes can increase investment and spur economic growth. President       Donald Trump       has shown more interest and enthusiasm for a tax rewrite than health care. Moreover, the party isn\u2019t faced with the prospect of taking away popular health benefits, as they were in the Obamacare rewrite, which stymied them in attempting the health overhaul.\u201cAfter health care, taxes are going to be so easy,\u201d Mr. Trump said this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cIf we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.\u201dThe House Budget Committee will take the first step toward a tax bill Wednesday, considering a fiscal-2018 budget plan that will serve as a blueprint for a tax-code rewrite. If the House and Senate agree on a budget, they can advance a subsequent tax bill that avoids a Senate filibuster and passes with only Republican votes.The House budget calls for tying the tax bill to at least $203 billion in deficit-reduction measures, which may include changes to medical-malpractice law and federal employees\u2019 retirement benefits. That bill, like health-care legislation, would face procedural constraints and couldn\u2019t increase budget deficits after 10 years, a factor that potentially ties Republican hands.So far, the House doesn\u2019t appear to have enough votes to pass a budget measure. House members are scheduled to leave Washington next week and not return until September.Rep.       Dave Brat       (R., Va.), said conservatives want larger spending cuts and are wary of backing the budget without more clarity on taxes.\u201cWe did that last time on health care\u2014we opened the gate for a free-market health-care piece. We didn\u2019t get that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make that mistake again.\u201dOther internal divides loom. The party is split between members who prioritize rate cuts and those more concerned about the distribution of the tax burden. There is also a split between lawmakers who want tax cuts and those worried about budget deficits.\u201cThe GOP is likely to pivot away from a fully revenue-neutral bill towards a bill that is deficit-financed over the first 10 years,\u201d said       Jon Lieber       of the Eurasia Group consulting firm. \u201cIt is getting to be crunch time.\u201dBeneath those big-picture disputes are finer points, which will challenge Republicans to find unity amidst industry and regional differences.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to repeal the deduction for state and local taxes is drawing pushback from New York and New Jersey Republicans. The House plan to eliminate the business deduction for net interest costs has farmers and financiers lobbying against it.\u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details, and the details are important,\u201d Sen. RobPortman (R., Ohio) said at a hearing on Tuesday.Sen.       Ben Cardin       (D., Md.) said he thought the two parties could find agreement on tax policy if they worked together.\u201cIf they use a process like was used in health care, where it\u2019s a closed operation with Republicans only, it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d he said.\u2014Byron Tau and       Kate Davidson       contributed to this article.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 18:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-setback-has-republicans-looking-to-tax-policy-1500416465", "news_title": "Health-Care Setback Has Republicans Looking to Tax Policy ", "keywords": "congress,federal budget,health bill,tax overhaul,Tom MacArthur,Donald Trump,Ben Cardin,Dave Brat,Jon Lieber,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "Harley-Davidson Inc.        HOG -0.37%       shares fell sharply on plans to make and ship fewer motorcycles this year amid a sharp drop in retail sales.The Milwaukee-based manufacturer said Tuesday that world-wide retail sales fell 7% in the second quarter. Sales fell 9% in the U.S., Harley\u2019s largest market. Harley\u2019s shares fell as much as 11% on the news.Executives said strong competition from their own used motorcycles were partly to blame, as U.S. market share for new Harley bikes declined a percentage point to 48.5% in the quarter from that period a year earlier.\u201cNone of this is good,\u201d said James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cNot only are things bad, but it appears to be bad in such a way that management is really struggling to keep up with how bad things are.\u201dHarley\u2019s disappointing midyear results highlight the challenge facing the iconic American brand as it tries to grow its customer base.

The company is working to expand its appeal to women, minorities, young adults and city dwellers.Harley executives said they would scale back production and hold down inventories. They pushed back, though, on suggestions that Harley should lower prices on new bikes.Chief Financial Officer       John Olin       said that while strong used-bike sales don\u2019t bring Harley new revenue, they are \u201can indicator of the strength of the brand and an indicator of the health of the sport.\u201dHarley said Tuesday it expects shipments to be down 6% to 8% annually in 2017 compared with prior guidance of flat to modestly lower shipments. The company also expects its operating margin to contract by 1 percentage point. Harley has been reducing shipments of newer models to encourage dealers to shed existing inventory.Chief Executive       Matt Levatich       said Harley will scale back production and implement \u201chourly workforce reduction\u201d at some U.S. factories.\u201cNo one wants to have to take these steps,\u201d Mr. Levatich said.

A rejiggering of the division\u2019s leadership last fall failed to jolt the desk from its malaise, which culminated in having its revenue surpassed in the first quarter by             Morgan Stanley,        MS 3.28%       Goldman\u2019s rival historically weaker in debt trading. Morgan Stanley reports its earnings Wednesday.The poor showing drowned out a surprise earnings beat, which Goldman owed to gains in its portfolio of private-equity stakes. Shares fell 2% as investors looked through to shakiness at Goldman\u2019s core, tumbling as Chief Financial Officer       R. Martin Chavez       addressed concerns on a conference call.\u201cWe didn\u2019t navigate the market as well as we want to,\u201d he said, echoing nearly verbatim comments he made three months ago. \u201cEveryone in our business is intently focused on this topic and at a granular, molecular level are working on it, as are all of us in the leadership team.\u201dThe firm, run by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, reported earnings of $3.95 a share on revenue of $7.89 billion, both better than analysts had forecast.Still, Goldman\u2019s traders have struggled to find their footing as markets churn quietly higher and trillions of dollars shift from human portfolio managers to algorithms and index funds that don\u2019t try to beat the market, but simply match it. Meanwhile, many among Goldman\u2019s stable of hedge-fund clients are grappling with poor performance and outflows.That has led to less demand for Goldman\u2019s specialty: exotic trading products that allow investors to make one-of-a-kind bets on asset prices. Overall, the firm\u2019s trading revenue fell 17% from a year ago, capping a six-month run that is the worst start of a year in Mr. Blankfein\u2019s 11-year tenure.\u201cThe demand side of the equation has dried up for\u201d Goldman, said       James Mitchell       of Buckingham Research Group. \u201cThe market has moved to plain-vanilla.\u201dGoldman cited weakness in nearly every major fixed-income product it sells, from interest-rate derivatives to credit instruments.Goldman\u2019s trading business is more reliant on swashbuckling stock pickers than peers, a strategy that paid off in years past but now puts the bank on the wrong side of shifts in the money-management industry. As more assets move from actively managed funds to passive ones, trillion-dollar pools trade less frequently and generally need fewer services.Goldman has pushed over the past year or so to win more business from corporate treasurers and passive managers, and worked to better track where top clients are spending their trading commissions and fees.So far, it hasn\u2019t worked. Goldman\u2019s six-month trading revenue fell 10% from last year. Commodities trading, a business Mr. Blankfein once ran, had its worst quarter in Goldman\u2019s 17 years as a public company as the firm struggled to adequately hedge its inventory.Goldman has also seen a stream of departures among rank-and-file fixed-income salespeople and traders in recent months. Continued woes in the division are likely to ramp up pressure for another shake-up.\u201cGoldman was the unbeatable firm, the smartest guys on the block,\u201d Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets consultancy Opimas, said of the business\u2019s results. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost that luster.\u201dThe story was better in stock-trading, which posted its best quarter in two years. Goldman lost the equities crown in 2014 to Morgan Stanley, a jolt that spurred it to revamp its trading technology through investments that are now beginning to pay off.Rescuing the quarter was its portfolio of private company stakes, which rose 88%. Goldman has held on more tightly to merchant banking than rivals, and rising markets push up the prices for the shares it holds in everything from a publicly traded credit bureau to private technology startups.But investors tend to discount the lumpy revenues in the unit. Charles Peabody of research firm Compass Point called Goldman\u2019s results a \u201clow quality beat\u2026aided by gains that the marketplaces won\u2019t pay up for.\u201dInvestment-banking reported a 3% decline in revenue from a year ago, with merger fees down 6% and stock and debt underwriting basically flat.Goldman has leaned hard on investment banking in recent years, though there are signs that it also may be slowing. A record deal boom in 2015 and 2016 is cooling, and some companies have been postponing deals as they wait to see if the Trump administration can achieve promised tax and regulatory changes.Goldman\u2019s investment-management division reported a 13% rise in revenue and net inflows of $25 billion, though nearly all of that came from the acquisition of a business that courts big pension funds.Goldman\u2019s return on equity, a key measure of profitability, stood at 8.7% in the quarter. Goldman is one of few banks that has reliably exceeded 10%\u2014a level typically demanded by investors\u2014since the crisis. But in recent quarters, Goldman\u2019s ROE has slipped and in the second quarter, stalled in the same place it was year ago.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Bond Trading Thrashes Goldman.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 18:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-reports-surprise-profit-increase-1500378105", "news_title": "Goldman Sachs Delivers Profit Surprise Despite Trading Slump", "keywords": " 2q earnings, bank earnings, bank profit,goldman sachs earnings, interest rates, investment banking, lloyd blankfein,pe industry news,return on equity, second quarter earnings, trading,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Morgan Stanley,MS,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,JPMorgan Chase,JPM,J.P.

It was the first day of regular trading following the closing of the merger of Vornado\u2019s Washington portfolio and JBG Cos. The new company has more than $8 billion in assets.JBG Smith shares closed at $37.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, above the upper end of the $33 to $36.50 range that analysts predicted. The value was still well below the $41.75 a share the company\u2019s assets are worth, according to analysts.JBG Smith is launching at a time when major office markets throughout the country are grappling with anemic growth in occupancies and rents, which is unusual for this late in the economic cycle. They are being hurt by tepid job growth, increased efficiency by tenants and in some cases new supply. As a result, most office REITs are trading below the net value of their assets.JBG Smith executives said they are going to need to prove themselves to public market investors.\u201cNobody is just going to give us the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said CEO W. Matthew Kelly in an interview Tuesday.The office market in the Washington, D.C., region has been hurt by years of government downsizing. Budget cuts by the Trump administration are expected to damp demand further from most nondefense related government agencies.About 75% of JBG Smith\u2019s portfolio is office property. Most of the rest consists of rental apartments.\u201cNot only is competition among new product growing but existing product is also facing challenges from a demand perspective,\u201d said real-estate services firm JLL in a report on Washington\u2019s second-quarter office market.Mr. Kelly agreed the Washington office market has been hurt by government cutbacks in recent years. But lately trends have become more positive thanks partly to population growth and the high education level of the region\u2019s workforce, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s still some digging out that needs to happen\u201d from the \u201cterrible run\u201d the Washington office market has had, Mr. Kelly said. \u201cBut we view the market bottom as behind us,\u201d he said.The merged company achieves longtime goals for Vornado, which is contributing about $5 billion worth of property, and JBG Cos., a 57-year-old real-estate firm based in the Washington region. For more than three years, Mr. Roth has been trying to simplify Vornado as a New York-focused office and retail company by selling many of its other assets. A Vornado spokesman declined to comment.JBG Cos., meanwhile, has been looking for a way to tap the public equity markets and give some of its investors an opportunity to cash out. An effort by JBG to merge with             New York REIT Inc.       in a proposed $8.4 billion deal collapsed last year following strong objections by New York REIT shareholders.JBG Cos. won\u2019t be contributing all its property to the merged company. About $3 billion worth of properties\u2014including buildings in Pennsylvania and Baltimore\u2014will be managed but not owned by JBG Smith because they don\u2019t fit into the new company\u2019s strategy.The management team plans to sell the other property over four to six years. But that has raised some concerns about a possible conflict of interest.\u201cOnly the original JBG partners stand to profit from the sale of these assets,\u201d Green Street Advisors said in a report. \u201cThis\u2026could distract the team from running the REIT\u2019s owned portfolio.\u201dMr. Kelly said JBG is \u201cstaffed appropriately to tackle everything that\u2019s on our plate.\u201dThe merged company owns close to 19.5 million square feet of office space, 1.4 million square feet of retail and more than 11,000 rental apartments. Its well-known properties include the Warner Building, on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, and the Atlantic Plumbing redevelopment of a former industrial property into residential and retail space.But land and developments in the pipeline make up more than 15% of JBG Smith\u2019s assets, one of the largest amounts in the REIT sector. That is one of the reasons that Mr. Roth and others at Vornado believe the company has growth potential.Some analysts are skeptical of the risk associated with development. \u201cThe public market is leery of the high octane growth story,\u201d said       Jed Reagan,        a Green Street analyst.The Washington region already is saturated with new office development. JLL reported that seven projects totaling 2 million square feet broke ground in the second quarter and eight other projects will break ground over the next 12 months.JBG executives pointed out that most of their future development plans focus on residential projects, a sector with a more positive outlook than office. \u201cPeople are moving back into cities,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 17:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-pure-play-on-the-washington-d-c-market-makes-its-debut-1500414502", "news_title": "A Pure Play on the Washington, D.C., Market Makes Its Debut ", "keywords": "reit,vornado,washington,JBG SMITH Properties,JBGS,JBGS.W,Vornado Realty Trust,VNO,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,real estate investment trusts,real estate transactions,commercial,industrial real estate,real estate,construction,diversified reits,financial services,investing,securities,residential reits"}, {"content": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s police detained a woman for appearing in public wearing a short skirt and a cropped top, a violation of the country\u2019s strict dress code, state media said on Tuesday.A video of the woman walking around the historic town of Ushayqir, which first surfaced on Snapchat, went viral on Saudi social media over the weekend, sparking a fierce debate in the kingdom, with some speaking out in her defense and others calling for her swift punishment.The woman, who hasn\u2019t been officially named, was detained by police in Riyadh for wearing \u201cimmodest clothing\u201d and the case was referred to the public prosecutor, state television said.Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and a key U.S. ally in the battle against religious extremism, enforces one of the world\u2019s strictest interpretations of the religion, largely the product of the ruling monarchy\u2019s longstanding alliance with the powerful Sunni Muslim clerical establishment.Women must wear loose, head-to-toe gowns known as abayas in public, though exceptions are made for foreign officials and their spouses.

Eric Greitens       on Monday signed an executive order creating a prescription-monitoring system after a failed effort in the legislature left Missouri the only state lacking such a tool.Supporters of prescription monitoring said the system won\u2019t be as robust as one legislators aimed to create. They said a prescription database that doctors and pharmacies can check is needed to stop consumers from obtaining controlled substances from multiple sources.Neighboring states have complained that Missouri\u2019s lack of such a database has made it a magnet for people looking to abuse opioids through multiple prescriptions, because they know doctors and pharmacies there can\u2019t check their history.Mr. Greitens, a Republican, said the state would establish the system in phases. First, the state\u2019s health department will analyze prescription and pharmacy dispensing data provided by pharmacy-benefit managers, such as             Express Scripts,       to look for inappropriate prescribing or dispensing patterns. The department will alert law enforcement and professional licensing boards about suspicious activity, according to the executive order.In the second phase, pharmacies will be required to submit controlled-substance prescription information to the health department, which will alert law enforcement and professional licensing boards about suspicious activity.The program won\u2019t allow doctors or pharmacies to check a central database to see whether a particular patient is obtaining prescriptions from multiple doctors, a tool available in other states that public-health experts say is essential to prevent doctor shopping.\u201cI am happy to see the governor engaged, but his options are limited without support by the state legislature,\u201d said       Sam Page,        a physician and chairman of St. Louis County\u2019s council, who has pushed for a statewide database.

The report comes more than a decade after Hurricane Katrina and nearly five years after superstorm Sandy.\u201cWe need to go beyond the very incremental improvements that have been made disaster-to-disaster,\u201d Ms. Leicht said in a phone interview recently. \u201cThese are policy decisions that need to be made when you\u2019re not in the throes of disaster.\u201dThe report, which was commissioned by the Community Preservation Corporation, Inc., a nonprofit, and the office of the Staten Island Borough President, is expected to be presented at a disaster recovery symposium in Manhattan\u00a0on Wednesday.It lays out a series of 41 recommendations for federal, state and local governments dealing with natural disasters.It also tells the story of the complex patchwork of disaster recovery\u00a0initiatives set up to help Americans recover in New Jersey, New York state and New York City, where the October 2012 superstorm killed more than 80 people and caused billions of dollars in damages.Ms. Leicht oversaw more than $15 billion in federal disaster recovery funds. She said government agencies like HUD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration should consolidate their efforts to make it easier for victims to get help by accepting requests for aid through a single application. She also said agencies like HUD should be more hands-on with local recovery programs to help states and cities find the best approach to rebuild.In New York City, where Ms. Leicht helped oversee more than\u00a0$4.2 billion\u00a0in federal dollars toward Sandy recovery, much of the funding went to Build it Back, the city\u2019s program to rebuild and elevate homes damaged by Sandy.\u00a0The initiative began under former Mayor       Michael Bloomberg       and has continued under Mayor       Bill de Blasio.       It is behind schedule and at least $500 million over budget, despite serving less than half of the homeowners it was designed to.Ms. Leicht said the city had dedicated impressive resources to storm protection projects. But she said it should change its approach to rebuilding housing in future disasters.She said it should consider adopting an income cap for recovery programs, and that the decision to help all homeowners regardless of income had left less money to serve those most in need. She also said it had limited the city\u2019s ability to fund storm protection projects or affordable housing.Ms. Leicht also said that city officials didn\u2019t follow the advice of HUD officials who had repeatedly encouraged them to centralize the management of its recovery programs, which are run by at least five different agencies and two deputy mayors.A spokeswoman for Mayor de Blasio said the city\u2019s approach, \u201cpromoted high-level accountability while also capturing critical agency know-how.\u201d\u201cWe brought the full weight of City resources to bear on a $20 billion recovery effort, one that spans business and housing recovery, infrastructure improvements and coastal defenses,\u201d said       Melissa Grace,        the spokeswoman.Ms. Leicht said there were lessons at every level of government.\u201cWe were all learning as we went,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, I\u2019d wager none of us would do things exactly the same if we had it to do over again.\u201dWrite to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Holly Leicht served as regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama.

The Kremlin bridled its response amid hope that incoming President       Donald Trump       might reverse the moves, which came in the final weeks of the Obama administration.Any reversal now looks fraught for the White House, given sentiment in Congress in favor of new sanctions against Russia and a special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The Trump administration likely would need to receive something of clear value to the U.S. in exchange for returning the compounds, or risk opprobrium from hawkish U.S. lawmakers from both parties concerned about any moves seen as capitulation to Moscow.Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump and his representatives have said there was no collaboration.Russian officials, meanwhile, have been airing increasingly vocal threats since Mr. Trump met Russian President       Vladimir Putin       at the summit of leaders from Group of 20 leading nations in Hamburg early this month.\u201cWe warned that we have a way to respond, and American interests in the Russian Federation could suffer if our diplomatic property isn\u2019t returned without conditions,\u201d Mr. Ryabkov said in an interview early Tuesday with the Russian news agency Interfax after his meeting with Mr. Shannon. Mr. Ryabkov said Russia and the U.S. so far hadn\u2019t reached a common understanding on the issue but efforts were continuing.Mr. Ryabkov said Russia fundamentally rejects any attempts by the U.S. to formulate conditions for the return of the diplomatic compounds, which he said were seized illegally. He said such attempts would be doomed to fail and would bring Russia closer to taking reciprocal measures.Kremlin spokesman       Dmitry Peskov       said Tuesday that Russia\u2019s patience on the issue was running out. \u201cWe are counting on prudence from our American colleagues to put the situation back on track in accordance with international law,\u201d Mr. Peskov said, according to Interfax.The State Department released a statement about the talks early Tuesday that made no mention of the controversy over the Russian recreational compounds, sometimes referred to as embassy dachas.\u201cThe conversation was tough, forthright, and deliberate, reflecting both parties\u2019 commitment to a resolution,\u201d the State Department said. \u201cThe United States and Russia seek a long-term solution that would address areas of bilateral concern that have strained the relationship.\u00a0The talks reflected a spirit of goodwill, but it is clear that more work needs to be done.\u201dState Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said it would take time to arrive at any agreement. \u201cNothing is coming together anytime soon,\u201d she said.She declined to respond to threats of Russian retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothetical,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that they have threatened a lot of things.\u201dThe State Department also said Messrs. Shannon and Ryabkov committed to holding \u201cstrategic stability talks\u201d but didn\u2019t specify what issues would be discussed in such negotiations. The talks could include traditional topics of nuclear disarmament and missile defense, or could also more broadly address cyberweapons and questions over Russia\u2019s alleged violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War era pact limiting medium-range missiles. Russia, in turn, has accused the U.S. of violating the pact.Steven Pifer,        a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former deputy assistant secretary of state with responsibility for Russia and Ukraine, said such talks could be valuable and should have a broad mandate.Mr. Pifer also said the Trump administration shouldn\u2019t return the diplomatic compounds unless the U.S. receives something concrete in return, because the history of horse-trading between Washington and Moscow dating to the Soviet era shows that one-sided concessions yield few results.\u201cGiving the compounds back without getting something would be a mistake,\u201d Mr. Pifer said.The U.S. has complained about Russia\u2019s efforts to hamper construction of a new U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg, and Mr. Pifer said one possibility would be to exchange the U.S. compounds for Russian permission to move forward with that project.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 17:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-russia-remain-at-odds-over-seized-compounds-1500413974", "news_title": "U.S., Russia Remain at Odds Over Seized Compounds", "keywords": "political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Republicans could soon find themselves in a situation they didn\u2019t expect: shoring up rather than dismantling the Affordable Care Act.With the demise of the Senate Republican health push, a growing number of lawmakers and governors from both parties say the urgent next step is to bolster the ACA insurance exchanges, which have suffered from rising premiums and fleeing insurers.Such an approach would likely prompt strong opposition from conservatives, who view any effort to aid the exchanges as an insurer bailout and an abdication of a seven-year promise to repeal the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare.But some lawmakers fear they could pay a political price if the insurance market for customers who buy their own policy stumbles and voters believe they didn\u2019t act to stop it.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday urged the parties to work together, saying Republicans don\u2019t need to repeal the ACA or allow its marketplaces to collapse for that to happen.\u201cOur Republican colleagues don\u2019t need to wreak havoc on our health system first in order to get Democrats to the table,\u201d said       Mr. Schumer,        a New York Democrat. \u201cIf Republicans abandon cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthy and agree to go through regular order [in Congress], the door to bipartisan is open.\u201dA bipartisan group of 11 governors on Tuesday also urged both parties to come together on legislation instead of seeking the ACA\u2019s repeal.\u201cThe best next step is for both parties to come together and do what we can agree on: fix our unstable insurance markets,\u201d the governors said in a statement signed by five Republicans.Sen.       Lamar Alexander       (R., Tenn.) said he would hold hearings on market stability after consulting with his party\u2019s leadership.\u201cHowever the votes come out on the health care bill, the Senate health committee has a responsibility during the next few weeks to hold hearings to continue exploring how to stabilize the individual market,\u201d he said.The       Trump       administration is encouraging states to take advantage of ways to relax ACA regulations that don\u2019t require legislation.Mr. Trump on Tuesday argued for letting the ACA collapse under its own weight as premiums rise and insurers stop selling policies on the exchanges. But Democrats say the exchanges are showing resilience, and many lawmakers appear unwilling to take that approach.That leaves the option of Congress bolstering the ACA exchanges, most likely by authorizing payments that help insurers offset subsidies for low-income consumers.With the Senate Republican health reform legislation fizzling this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the bill\u2019s collapse \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the problems all go away.\u201d He added: \u201cMy suspicion is there will be hearings...and we\u2019ll have to see what the way forward is.\u201dMr. Trump and GOP leaders called Tuesday for repeal of most of the ACA, with       Mr. McConnell       urging a two-year delay to hammer out a new system. But at least three Senate Republicans said they would block that idea, enough to stop it.Now, bipartisan legislation is emerging as a real if long-shot option. Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), recovering from surgery, urged fellow GOP senators to work with Democrats, saying in a statement Monday that \u201cone of the major problems with Obamacare is that it was written on a strict party-line basis and driven through Congress without a single Republican vote.\u201dOn Tuesday, Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       (R., Alaska) also said it was time for bipartisan talks.\u201cI think what has to happen is the Republicans have to admit that some of the things in the ACA we actually liked, and the Democrats have to admit that some of the things that they voted for in the ACA are broken and need to be fixed,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said. \u201cAnd we need to come together in open committee.\u201dFor several months, at least a half-dozen Democrats and at least one Republican senator have been holding informal talks to discuss a bipartisan approach to stabilizing the insurance market.The main idea under discussion has been a bill that would order payment of the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies, which are given to insurers to lower out-of-pocket costs for some low-income customers. It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will continue paying the subsidies after this month, and insurers have warned they could leave the exchanges or raise premiums without them.Another focus is creating a national reinsurance fund to help insurance companies defray the cost of people with pre-existing conditions.Democrats have hesitated to push forward on a specific plan while Republicans continued weighing their ACA repeal effort, but that appears to be almost at its end. \u201cWe\u2019re saying to Republicans, put this repeal idea behind them,\u201d said Sen.       Patty Murray       (D., Wash.). \u201cWe\u2019re willing to work with them. Restabilizing the system is absolutely critical.\u201dSeparately, Sens.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) and       Bill Cassidy       (R., La) have proposed what they frame as a compromise that would retain most of the ACA\u2019s taxes and send the money to states in the form of block grants, to use largely as they see fit. But no Democrats have embraced the approach, which would dismantle the ACA\u2019s insurance subsidies, and 10 GOP senators quickly announced their opposition.Changes to the insurance markets and health coverage will occur no matter what happens in Congress.Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price       has already taken steps to weaken the health law and has encouraged states to apply for first-of-their-kind waivers that impose work requirements and other restrictions on recipients of Medicaid, the state-federal health plan for low-income people.The Trump administration is widely expected to relax enforcement of the ACA requirement that most Americans pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have insurance.Meanwhile, the insurance exchanges remain fragile. Some counties may have no insurers participating on their exchanges before long, including 20 in Ohio and 14 in Nevada. Many insurers are planning steep premium increases in 2019.The problems have spurred calls for Republicans to find a path forward with Democrats, at least on funding the subsidies to insurers.\u201cCongress must begin a collaborative process that produces a bipartisan approach to improve health care in our country,\u201d       David Barbe,        president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement Tuesday.But doing so comes with political risk. Republicans who support steps to bolster the ACA\u2019s markets worry they could face repercussions from voters who view them as going back on their promise to repeal Obamacare.\u201cI think it depends on how they look at the downside of doing nothing,\u201d said       Jesse Ferguson,        who served as a spokesman for       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       presidential campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re in control of Washington and responsible for the health care system.

Longtime             New York Times                   readers can be forgiven if they are now thoroughly confused on the matter.Last month this column noted that the actions of the New York Times suggest that the people who put out the newspaper don\u2019t think burning carbon is as dangerous as one would think from reading their product. How else to explain their marketing effort to persuade well-heeled readers to increase emissions by travelling the globe aboard a barely-filled             Boeing                  ? And now, one particularly industrious Times reader submits evidence of another reason to resist the paper\u2019s climate faith. In this case the skepticism about global warming comes not from refusing to take the paper seriously but from taking it too seriously.Anyone old enough to have been a Times reader in the late 1980s may recall a series of stories that helped educate the public on how cool our planet used to be. Here\u2019s one report from March of 1988:The paper returned to the topic in June of that year, and reminded readers of the planet\u2019s colder past:The following year, the paper reported a new record high in global temperatures and affirmed its climate history, which seemed to be the consensus view\u2014at least among scientists quoted by the Times:In 1991, the Times reported yet another record high, and published yet another reminder of how cool the planet used to be:By that point a reasonable consumer might have been ardently hoping to return to that magical era in which global temperatures averaged just 59 degrees. But in the ensuing years it must have been difficult for Times readers to stay hopeful. As the years and then the decades rolled by, The Times routinely reported record or near-record highs as global temperatures appeared to march ever higher.In January of this year, the newspaper published a feature entitled, \u201cHow 2016 Became Earth\u2019s Hottest Year on Record.\u201d The Times noted the disturbing news that \u201c2016 was the first time that the hottest year on record occurred three times in a row.\u201d And things could be about to get much worse. \u201cWe expect records to continue to be broken as global warming proceeds,\u201d climate enthusiast Michael Mann told the Times.Is there any way to return to the salad days of 59 degrees? Well, it turns out to be easier than you might think. In January, as the government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was reporting the third consecutive year of record highs, it noted that the average global temperature in 2016 had surged to a sizzling... 58.69 degrees.Over the years researchers seem to have concluded that the planet was not as hot as they thought. Oops.The most important facts in the climate debate are subject to frequent revisions. This doesn\u2019t mean the global warming thesis is wrong, but it argues for skepticism.

Hispanic buying power reached $1.4 trillion in 2016\u2014an increase of 9% from 2010 and 10% of total U.S. buying power\u2014and is expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2021, according to Nielsen.Earlier this month, NPD analyst Matt Powell wrote in a blog post that athletic footwear sales to Hispanics have been \u201cquite soft, after several years of good growth.\u201d He said he expects the slowdown to contribute to weaker back-to-school sales in the category.U.S. retailers are already struggling with declining foot traffic and the shift of consumer spending to e-commerce outlets, forcing them to close stores and cut jobs.Target has been battling those forces as well, though earlier this month it raised its sales outlook, saying it now expects a modest increase in sales for the current quarter at stores open at least a year.

The dollar slid 0.5% against the Japanese yen, 0.7% against the euro and 0.6% against the Mexican peso.The dollar began its decline late Monday after two more GOP senators announced they would oppose the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, leaving the party short of the votes needed to pass the bill.The failure to make progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priority has renewed doubts about the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on other campaign goals, including plans for fiscal stimulus, tax overhaul and deregulation. Expectations that those policies would accelerate U.S. economic growth and allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates helped propel the dollar to a 14-year-high after the U.S. election in November.The dollar has now given up all of those gains and on Tuesday traded more than 1% below its election-day level.The political uncertainty adds to investors\u2019 concerns about weak U.S. economic data and questions over the Federal Reserve\u2019s path for raising interest rates.Last week, the dollar suffered its worst stretch since May after Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen      sounded a cautious tone about the pace of interest rate increases during congressional testimony and U.S. inflation data came in softer-than-expected. Markets now see only a 47% chance that the Fed will stick to its plans to raise rates one more time this year, according to data from             CME Group.At the same time, central banks in Europe, the U.K. and Canada have signaled they are moving closer to withdrawing stimulus efforts that have helped boost markets since the financial crisis.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika, who in May was named by President       Donald Trump       to the temporary post, has twice protested the CFPB\u2019s rule in letters since it was announced last week, including in a missive sent on Monday asking that the rule be halted.Mr. Cordray\u2019s letter\u2014his second and the fourth between the two officials\u2014said he has already signed and sent the final rule to a government regulations site. He also said Mr. Noreika\u2019s claim that the arbitration rule could affect the safety of and soundness of the financial system was \u201cso plainly frivolous.\u201dPublication of the rule in the Federal Register, expected Wednesday, starts the clock for possible efforts by opponents to overturn the rule. Republican lawmakers have 60 days to try to kill it using a legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act. Another financial regulator, such as the OCC, could file a petition within 10 days to request the Financial Stability Oversight Council to stay the rule for up to 90 days. FSOC is a group made up of federal regulators that monitors the health of the financial system and includes heads of the OCC and CFPB.Mr. Noreika hasn\u2019t said whether the OCC planned to ask FSOC to delay the rule.Republicans have long criticized the CFPB, created by the Obama administration after the financial crisis. The bureau\u2019s completion of the arbitration rule touches on a long-running battle between companies, trial lawyers and consumer advocates over whether customer disputes should be handled in court or through arbitration, which businesses see as more certain and less expensive.In a letter dated Monday, Mr. Noreika asked Mr. Cordray to delay the rule until his office could assess the data behind it and verify it won\u2019t put banks at risk. Mr. Cordray responded Tuesday the CFPB was \u201chappy to share the data\u201d and that the bureau was assembling it.\u201cI appreciate Director Cordray\u2019s decision to share his agency\u2019s data,\u201d Mr. Noreika said in a statement, adding OCC staff will study it to \u201canswer my prudential concerns regarding what impact the final rule may have on the federal banking system.\u201dMr. Cordray\u2019s Tuesday letter criticized Mr. Noreika\u2019s claim that the rule could threaten the banking system. \u201cOn what conceivable basis can there be any legitimate argument that this rule poses a safety and soundness issue?\u201d Mr. Cordray wrote.The arbitration rule bars banks from requiring arbitration in the fine-print of financial contracts with customers.

The Volkswagen scandal raised awareness of toxic pollution from diesel vehicles, leading more European cities to weigh banning diesel vehicles.The move also comes as regulators and criminal investigators on both sides of the Atlantic are scrutinizing Mercedes-Benz on suspicion that some of its diesel vehicles used illegal defeat devices, an allegation raised by environmental groups that Daimler has repeatedly denied.In Germany, public concern about diesel bans has led to a sharp drop in diesel sales and forced Chancellor       Angela Merkel\u2019s       government to create a round table to encourage the auto industry to adopt voluntary measures to curb diesel pollution and prevent cities from banning diesel vehicles.\u201cThe public debate about diesel engines is creating uncertainty\u2014especially for our customers,\u201d Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said in a statement. \u201cWe have therefore decided on additional measures to reassure drivers of diesel cars and to strengthen confidence in diesel technology.\u201dDaimler first began updating software on some diesel vehicles in March, but is now dramatically expanding the program. Daimler said the update would cost about \u20ac220 million ($254 million), but would be free of charge to car owners. The repairs would begin in the coming weeks and are expected to continue for months.Volkswagen eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and U.S. consumers, agreeing to pay penalties, fines and compensation to consumers of more than $22 billion.Daimler is under investigation in Germany and the U.S., but hasn\u2019t been charged with any wrongdoing. The company denies using defeat devices.The investigations are ongoing, but there is no evidence so far that Daimler engaged in the kind of intentional criminal activity and long years of coverup that characterized the Volkswagen scandal.A German government report published in 2016 concluded that many European car makers, including Daimler, used a loophole in regulations to reduce emissions controls to protect the engine. Regulations allow this during cold temperatures, but the window is so wide that it allows car makers to reduce emissions control even in mild temperatures.In response to criticism, Daimler\u2019s software fix aims to narrow the window and as a result reduce toxic tailpipe emissions during normal driving.German car makers have made a huge bet on diesel because the engines are known for better fuel economy and lower carbon dioxide emissions than cars run on gasoline. But the downside is that they produce high levels of toxic nitrogen oxides, which are linked to respiratory diseases and death.Several studies of air quality in European cities have found levels of NOx pollution that far exceeds the legal limit, prompting cities such as Paris and London to create ultra low emissions zones in the city center.The public outcry against diesel leaves Germany\u2019s premium car makers Mercedes,             BMW,Audi                   and Porsche particularly exposed to a sudden shift away from diesel.Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Daimler Readies Emissions Fix.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 16:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daimler-ag-plans-emissions-modifications-on-more-than-3-million-vehicles-1500410862", "news_title": "Daimler Plans Emissions Modifications on More Than Three Million Vehicles ", "keywords": "cars,diesel,investigation,mercedes benz,pollution,probe,regulators,Daimler,DAI.XE,Volkswagen,VOW.XE,product,consumer safety,corporate,industrial news,product recalls,political,general news,natural environment,living,lifestyle,air,water,land quality,motor vehicles,passenger cars,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "In 2010, Democrats passed a sweeping health-care bill that polls showed to be unpopular with no support from the other party. In 2017, Republicans sought to do the same. Each party touted the respective merits of its bills, but here is a look at some of the differences that meant one passed and the other stumbled.CongressIn the wake of the 2008 elections, Democrats for a time had a 60-40 Senate majority. Republicans also have unified control of government but with a 52-48 Senate edge, allowing no more than two defections. Democrats passed part of the Affordable Care Act through the usual legislative process requiring 60 votes, and part of it through the \u201creconciliation\u201d process requiring a 51-vote majority.IndustryIn 2009 and 2010, Democrats brought the health industry and medical associations aboard, promising them financial help and big new markets. As a result, many such groups lined up behind the ACA, also called Obamacare. In contrast, the same groups largely aligned against the GOP bill.GovernorsRepublicans have had to contend with governors in their own party critical of their initiative, notably because of its proposed cuts to the Medicaid program. Democrats faced no similar dynamic. That\u2019s arguably in part because it is easier to create a new social program, as the ACA did, than to cut it back.PresidentThen-President       Barack Obama       bridged the split between his party\u2019s purists and centrists\u2014exhorting Democrats, traveling the country and holding public debates with Republicans. President       Donald Trump       has strongly advocated for the GOP bill in speeches, on Twitter and in meetings with lawmakers, but some Republicans privately say he hasn't always coordinated strategy with congressional leaders, and the party\u2019s own purists and centrists have not been reconciled.TimeDemocrats entered the 2008 election expecting to win and planning to push health care as a top priority. In contrast, many Republicans didn\u2019t expect to capture the presidency in 2016, and the GOP didn\u2019t have a health proposal ready.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 42 cents, or 0.9%, to $48.84 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both finished up for the sixth time in seven sessions.It was the 15th gain in 18 sessions for U.S. oil, a period that includes its longest winning streak in seven years. Tuesday\u2019s gains canceled out about half the losses from a rare retreat from Monday and intraday prices peaked within 40 cents of their highest point of the past six weeks.While oil is still nowhere near the $60 that many predicted for this time of year, analysts are saying that the reversal in recent weeks could be a turning point bouncing off a new floor for prices. The International Energy Agency said last week it raised its expectations for global demand growth and there are signs exports and oversupply from some of the world\u2019s biggest producers are easing.\u201cThe market is undergoing a positive psychological shift, with sentiment turning bullish as diminishing supplies and peak U.S. production take hold,\u201d       Peter Cardillo,        chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, said in a note.Brokers cited the dollar as another factor Tuesday after it fell sharply. That often raises the price of oil and other commodities traded in dollars by making them less expensive for traders who use other currencies. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, recently fell 0.5% on new doubts about President       Donald Trump\u2019s       ability to pass a constructive agenda.Traders will also be watching for stockpile estimates coming from analysts and the industry group the American Petroleum Institute, due later Tuesday. The U.S. government releases its official data on Wednesday mornings.S&P Global Platts estimates U.S. commercial crude stocks fell by three million barrels last week, and gasoline and distillates to have fallen by 500,000 and 700,000 barrels, respectively. A drop in crude stocks would be the 12th decline in the past 14 weeks, a catalyst for the summer rally.Revived gasoline demand has been another, and its prices early Tuesday rose to a new high dating back to June 1. Gasoline futures gained 2.22 cents, or 1.4%, to $1.5789 a gallon. Demand has picked up since around Memorial Day, significantly reducing a surplus in storage and likely boosted by a strengthening U.S. economy, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates in notes.\u201cGasoline\u2019s been pretty strong,\u201d said Ric Navy, senior vice president for energy futures at brokerage R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates LLC. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot of people jumping on board.\u201dOn Tuesday, brokers also pointed to trading interest in new report on export cuts from Saudi Arabia. Consultant Petroleum Policy Intelligence told clients that the kingdom is considering reducing its exports by as much as 1 million barrels a day.It would be the latest move as the kingdom struggles to cope with rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya. That has undermined an effort from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters to reduce world supply, and led to Saudi Arabia cutting back output even further than its allies in the deal. Saudi Arabia was already in the process of slashing its U.S. oil exports to a nearly three-decade low for this time of the year.The kingdom is still considering several options and no final decision has been made, said Bill Farren-Price, Petroleum Policy Intelligence\u2019s founder.

HUD previously rejected 10 earlier versions that reached similar conclusions.\u201cHUD appreciates the county\u2019s commitment to reaching an amicable resolution of this matter and acknowledges the county\u2019s efforts,\u201d said Jay Golden, the department\u2019s regional director of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, in a letter to county officials dated July 14.Westchester County Executive       Robert Astorino,        a Republican, said Tuesday HUD\u2019s decision was vindication for the county.\u201cIf I thought there was discrimination in our zoning, I would have agreed with HUD,\u201d Mr. Astorino said. \u201cThat just wasn\u2019t the case.\u201dThe back-and-forth over zoning dates back to a 2009 agreement between Westchester and the federal government to settle a housing-discrimination lawsuit. As part of that agreement, the county needed to analyze local zoning laws to determine if there were any obstacles to fair housing, and if so, how to fix it. The county maintained for years if found no evidence of exclusionary zoning.To complete the terms of the settlement, the county still must finish an outreach program marketing Westchester\u2019s affordable-housing units.As part of that agreement, the county agreed to build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 mostly white communities like Bedford, Ardsley and Scarsdale. Westchester officials said the county has since built nearly 800 units and has another 100 in the pipeline. The county has spent $81.6 million so far to comply with the settlement.After federal officials rejected the county\u2019s analysis in April for the 10th time, the county\u2019s consulting firm, VHB, objected. VHB said an independent analysis of the data found that local zoning laws didn\u2019t cause the concentration of black, Hispanic and white communities in Westchester County, and that it wasn\u2019t reasonable for HUD to draw its own conclusions despite the data and analysis conducted by several third-party experts.Michael Kaplowitz,        chairman of the county\u2019s board of legislators, applauded Westchester\u2019s progress completing the housing agreement, but noted there was still work to do.\u201cA lack of affordable housing remains one of the most challenging issues of this region,\u201d Mr. Kaplowitz said.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 15:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/westchester-county-wins-hud-ok-in-housing-dispute-1500407638", "news_title": "Westchester County Wins HUD OK in Housing Dispute", "keywords": " westchester affordable housing,westchester county, westchester housing, westchester hud,U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,urban planning,development,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues,government bodies,executive branch,housing,urban development department,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "For decades, the biggest enemy to progress in swimming was water.While other sports embraced video decades ago as a means for refining technique, that wasn\u2019t an option in the pool due to technological limitations. Coaches and elite swimmers made adjustments based on guesswork and feel. Those days are officially over.At the recent U.S. national championships in Indianapolis, swimmers watched underwater recordings of their races on one of eight television monitors within minutes of finishing their heats. Those recordings are also allowing the sport to catch up to the analytics craze: At the end of each race, coaches and swimmers now study metrics such as average stroke rate and 15-meter splits.They also study algorithim-generated illustrations\u2014developed through a partnership between             BMW                   and USA Swimming\u2014that are overlaid onto video footage to show where the swimmers\u2019 bodies veered away from the ideal angles for cutting through the water.\u201cSwimming is math. Performance is math,\u201d said Jonty Skinner, former director of performance science and technology for the U.S. national team and now an associate head coach at Alabama. \u201cIf you understand the math of performance, you can go about the process of breaking down the math and looking at the parts. You can\u2019t do that without videotape.\u201dThese advancements will be on further display next week, when the U.S. team tries to springboard off its dominating 33-medal performance at the Rio Olympics with a similarly strong showing at the world championships in Budapest.Incorporating such extensive data into racing strategies was unimaginable to coaches and swimmers in recent Olympic cycles. The swimmers who competed in the 2004 Athens Games recall coaches deploying a Rube Goldberg-like underwater camera housed in PVC piping that was attached to a TiVo-equipped television monitor and rolled down the side of the pool deck on a cart. But thanks to innovations in technology that have made portable underwater cameras like GoPros widely accessible, capturing underwater footage is easier than ever.Today underwater video analysis is ingrained in the training regimens of all of America\u2019s top swimmers, overseen by Russell Mark, USA Swimming\u2019s high-performance consultant.\u201cI try to teach people to be more technical, thoughtful and mindful in their swimming,\u201d said Mark, who was trained as a rocket scientist. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about working hard.\u201dIndiana coach Ray Looze films his athletes, including gold-medal winning breaststrokers Lilly King and Cody Miller, every day and says it is essential to their practice sessions. Both swimmers will be competing in Budapest. Most of his swimmers complete workouts designed specifically to make use of underwater video analysis three times per week.\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment. You\u2019ve got to design a practice that goes into [the cameras] where you have a little bit of time where you can make some comments,\u201d Looze said. \u201cThe corrections come exponentially faster.\u201dVeteran swimmers find the data from Mark\u2019s team helps maximize their potential in the dusk of their careers.\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger you can get huge improvements from just growing,\u201d said Nathan Adrian, three-time Olympian and eight-time medalist. \u201cHere I am in my late 20s trying to squeeze every little inch out [possible] and trying to become more efficient.\u201dDavid Plummer says the feedback from the High Performance staff on his start and stroke rate was the difference between missing an Olympic berth in the 100-meter backstroke in 2012 by 0.12 seconds at the age of 27 and winning a bronze medal in the event in Rio at 31.\u201cThere are definite changes and improvements that I made that I can relate directly to the work that they do,\u201d said Plummer, who retired after the 2016 Olympics.Most members of the U.S. National Team can offer similar stories of underwater video-induced \u201ca-ha moments,\u201d as longtime-national coach David Marsh calls them.Marsh, who won 10 national titles at Auburn and takes over at University of California at San Diego this fall, said this was the case last spring when Ryan Lochte developed his novel freestyle flipturn. Conventional wisdom instructed swimmers to immediately turn onto their stomachs after pushing off the wall, but Lochte discovered he could go up to 0.3 seconds faster by staying on his back while dolphin kicking underwater.\u201cInitially it was [with] a stopwatch,\u201d said Marsh of how the duo discovered the technical change. \u201cBut what we discovered with the video is you\u2019re better pushing off slightly at a downward angle and then you really catch a lot of the benefits of the hydrodynamic effect of the water as you kick up to the surface.\u201dThree tenths of second is about the time it takes the human eye to blink, but at meets like World Championships that time span is often the difference between winning and missing the podium. In the sprint events in particular, three tenths of a second is an eternity.The U.S. effort to harness video started in earnest in 2002, when Skinner assembled a team of biomechanics specialists, including Mark, to devise the most effective way to gather underwater footage.Yet Mark says the team is only just learning how to fully harness the technology\u2019s potential.\u201cIt\u2019s made my head spin with the amount of data I have to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a good way.\u201dAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'A Revolution Finally Being Televised.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 15:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-swimming-revolution-is-finally-being-televised-1500407546", "news_title": "The Swimming Revolution Is Finally Being Televised", "keywords": "swim,swimming,usa swimming,USA Swimming,aquatics,water sports,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "Prices of government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic strengthened Tuesday, sending the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note to the lowest level this month.Demand for haven bonds got a boost after Senate Republicans failed to garner enough support to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The latest setback on the health-care bill raised fresh concerns about President       Donald Trump\u2019s       ability to push through his fiscal agenda when data are showing tepid consumer spending and softening inflation.U.S. Treasury-bond yields rose sharply late last year, driven by expectations that large fiscal stimulus would lead to stronger growth and higher inflation, factors that would cause the value of haven bonds to fall.

The 10-year yield jumped to 2.393% on July 7 from this year\u2019s low of 2.135% on June 26.Bond yields have fallen over the past week after a recent selloff, supporting some money managers\u2019 belief that a rise in bond yields wouldn\u2019t last for long without clear signs of accelerated economic growth or inflation.An unexpected slowdown in the U.K.\u2019s inflation contributed to Tuesday\u2019s slides in bond yields. A report showed annual consumer-price gains in the U.K. slowed to 2.6% in June from 2.9% in May. The release reduced some anxieties that the Bank of England might soon follow the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, sending U.K. government-bond yields lower. Lower U.K. yields rippled into the U.S. market, highlighting the tight linkage of global bond markets.The yield on the 10-year U.K. gilt fell to 1.222% Tuesday from 1.271% Monday, according to Tradeweb.Some analysts say the global government-bond market remains vulnerable to potential shifts in central banks\u2019 monetary-policy outlook. Worries that the European Central Bank would taper its bond buying have been a key factor boosting bond yields recently.The ECB\u2019s policy meeting is scheduled for Thursday, followed by the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting next week.Readings of consumer prices have been softening over the past few months, which means the Fed would go slow in normalizing interest-rate policy, some investors said.Last Friday\u2019s report showed the consumer-price index rose by an annualized 1.6% over the past 12 months through June, the smallest gain since October 2016. The reading is below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201cThe bond market is starting to anticipate that the Fed will be forced to acknowledge weak inflation is no longer transitory, and thus the rate-hike cycle could get put on hold,\u2019\u2019 said Anthony Cronin, a Treasury bond trader at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA      .Federal-funds futures, a popular derivative market for investors to place bets on the Fed\u2019s rate-policy outlook, on Tuesday showed 47% odds that the Fed would raise rates by its December meeting, according to CME Group.

The federal board installed to revive Puerto Rico\u2019s economy placed the public corporation under bankruptcy protection this month to write down $9 billion in utility debt.The seven-member oversight board had vetoed a proposed restructuring designed to avert bankruptcy, saying the financial settlement would have left too much debt outstanding and thwarted Prepa\u2019s transition from a public monopoly to a modern, regulated utility model.Creditors have argued that restructuring Prepa\u2019s debts voluntarily would bolster its creditworthiness and attract private partners. A federal rescue package empowered the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in municipal bond debt either through negotiated settlements or through binding, court-supervised proceedings.Board members and local officials are searching for private investment capital to upgrade outdated power plants and lower electricity costs with the goal of jump-starting the Puerto Rican economy after nearly a decade of recession.Meanwhile Puerto Rico\u2019s governor,       Ricardo Rossell\u00f2,        has consolidated control over Prepa, recently firing an independent board of directors installed under his predecessor. Creditors on Tuesday criticized the governor for \u201cre-politicizing\u201d the utility board to avoid what they called necessary rate increases on Prepa customers.\u201cThe politicization of Prepa has only grown worse under the current administration,\u201d the court motion said. \u201cThis has resulted in a giant step backwards for Prepa.\u201dThe collapse of the proposed settlement was an unwelcome development for creditors, since a judge could impose larger losses than those they had agreed to accept. Prepa\u2019s bankruptcy also roiled some Republican members of Congress who wanted the deal quickly blessed as a model for consensual settlements of Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts.Yet planned increases in electricity rates to repay creditors made the deal politically toxic in Puerto Rico, even after the governor obtained additional debt concessions in March to mitigate the hit to consumers.

It bought back more this year, further hurting its ability to fund plans to revive sales, including improving its mobile app and expanding its off-price concept Backstage to more stores.Worries that borrowing will become more expensive or won\u2019t be there at all have prompted some relatively healthy companies to focus on paying down their debt, which further limits the amount they can invest.Retailers sold just four high-yield bonds this year worth $2.8 billion, compared with seven bonds worth $5.7 billion last year. That is down from a 20-year peak of 28 bonds totaling $10.7 billion in 2013, according to Dealogic.

The 12-year-old boy was killed outside his Brooklyn home after a van struck him.In the hopes of reducing the number of traffic-related fatalities in the city, Ms. Cohen, 52 years old, became an advocate for safer streets. She has been closely following Vision Zero, Mayor       Bill de Blasio\u2019s       campaign to end traffic-related deaths in the city by 2024.\u201cEverybody in New York knows what it means to drive like a New Yorker, and that can\u2019t be tolerated anymore,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cDriving like a New Yorker is killing people and the way to change driver behavior is to roll out the proven solutions for Vision Zero, which are redesigning our streets.\u201dEarlier this month, the Vision Zero campaign announced a milestone in its progress\u2014for the first time in city history, traffic-related fatalities in the first semester of the year had dropped under 100. The toll was 93.In the three years since the campaign launched, the city has re-engineered streets and corridors found to be the most prone to traffic crashes. It has also expanded protected bike trails and launched educational campaigns to keep pedestrians, bikers and motorists safe. These changes, Ms. Cohen said, are extremely effective, they just don\u2019t happen fast enough.Ms. Cohen founded Families for Safe Streets, a coalition of traffic accident survivors and relatives of victims, as a way to offer individuals support services and help New Yorkers challenge their grief into action and advocacy for safer streets. Traffic crashes, she said, are an epidemic that must be treated with fast treatment implementation.\u201cIf this was a virus and we had the inoculation, the vaccine, we would not be talking about when should we do this, what should be the time frame,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to treat it like the crisis it is.\u201dDepartment of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg acknowledges that getting to zero fatalities is a challenge, but she said this keeps her motivated to continue working on initiatives that have already curbed this number. For Ms. Trottenberg, increased traffic safety comes down to the \u201cthree E\u2019s\u201d: engineering, enforcement and education.According to the Vision Zero website, the DOT plans to carry out safety improvements at 50 city corridors and intersections a year. Notable redesigns include a re-engineering of Jackson Avenue in Long Island City, Queens, and the creation of bus lanes, crosswalks and protected bike lanes on Manhattan\u2019s First and Second avenues.City officials have also pushed for the campaign in Albany. The 2014 session passed legislations that lowering the citywide default speed limit to 25 miles an hour and increasing the number of school zones with speed cameras to 140 from 40.But the process can be slow. Activists and organizers said plans to redesign streets can take months, even years, to be approved by community boards across the city.Paul White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an organization that advocates for safer streets, said street redesign has proven to be the most effective way to lower traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries across the city. As an example, Mr. White cited Queens Boulevard, which was deemed a Vision Zero Priority Corridor in 2014. The boulevard was redesigned and, as of May 2017, has gone two years without a traffic-related fatality.Mr. White said some projects as successful as the Queens Boulevard redesign have received pushback from community boards. The Queens Boulevard project, he said, was only completed after Mr. De Blasio overrode community leaders.Though community boards tend to be responsive and even ask for these redesigns to happen, Mr. White said bureaucratic procedures slow down the pace of these changes, which could save lives if they happened faster.\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to see moving forward is these safety improvements being made as a rule, not the exception, and made as a matter of course,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to negotiate safe street designs the same way that we don\u2019t negotiate safe water and sewer designs and other public safety and public works projects.\u201dIn Albany, a push to increase the number of speed cameras in school zones to 290 from 140 failed this year. Ms. Trottenberg said this result was upsetting, but said Vision Zero will continue educational efforts and redesign projects. The campaign, she said, will be back in Albany next year to once again submit a speed camera proposal.\u201cWe\u2019ve been piloting a bunch of different treatments, we\u2019re going to continue expanding those, we\u2019re getting encouraging results,\u201d she said.Corrections & Amplifications   Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said New York City is \u201cpiloting\u201d different treatments for traffic safety.

The deal includes a 30-day \u201cgo-shop\u201d period, in which Rocket Fuel will solicit and potentially enter into alternative proposals from third parties.\u201cThe board unanimously approved this transaction and we encourage our stockholders to follow that recommendation and tender their shares,\u201d Rocket Fuel CEO       Randy Wootton       said in an email.The deal price shows how Rocket Fuel, one of ad tech\u2019s high-profile players, has fallen from its lofty position a few years ago. The company\u2019s stock traded as high as $66 in its first month as a public company in 2013 and its market valuation peaked at around $2 billion.Sizmek provides advertising buyers with tools to purchase digital ad space, optimize what their ads look like and manage their data for ad-targeting purposes. Rocket Fuel also has data-management capabilities and offers a demand-side \u201cpredictive marketing\u201d platform that it says uses artificial intelligence to help marketers place their ads efficiently.The two companies plan to combine their technology and scale in the hope of providing ad buyers with an alternative to             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Facebook Inc.,       as well as other ad tech vendors. Together, they will serve more than 20,000 advertisers and 3,600 ad agencies, the companies said in a statement.The acquisition will mark the latest in a wave of consolidation for the ad tech sector, which has seen private-equity firms and companies in the media, cloud computing and telecommunications industries swoop in as buyers.The majority of pure-play ad-tech firms have had a rough ride on the public markets, struggling to convince investors of their long-term potential, largely thanks to the dominance of Google and Facebook in the digital-advertising market. Combined, the two firms collect 77 cents of each new dollar spent on digital advertising in the U.S., according to research firm eMarketer.Excluding the sector\u2019s star performers,             Criteo                   and             The Trade Desk,       ad-tech stocks were down an average of 7% in the three-month period ended June 6, 2017, according to data from investment bank Luma Partners.But the firm\u2019s share price began a precipitous decline in 2014. In May of that year, The Financial Times published a report alleging ads Rocket Fuel bought on behalf of its client Mercedes-Benz had been viewed by more bots than humans.Rocket Fuel denied the allegation, saying only 6% of the ads served were questionable.The following year, the company announced layoffs and sweeping changes in its top management.Rocket Fuel\u2019s net loss, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, is expected to be between $4 million and $3 million in the second quarter of this year and full-year results \u201cwill be below current analysts\u2019 estimates,\u201d according to Mr. Wootton, who became CEO in November 2015.Rocket Fuel posted a 1% decline in revenue last year to $456 million in 2016. It narrowed its net losses to $66 million, from $211 million in 2015.Rocket Fuel is trying to change from being a managed-service business that makes the majority of its revenue from taking a margin from clients\u2019 advertising spending, to becoming a technology-platform business that takes in regular software fees. Mr. Wootton said the pivot was taking longer than expected and the costs of being a public company made this process more challenging.Sizmek, also previously a public company, was acquired by Vector Capital in an all-cash deal valuing the firm at $122 million including debt, in August, 2016.\u201cVector has a broad vision for the digital advertising and marketing space, an appetite for funding the roll-up of great technology and the strategic approach to accelerate the creation of an independent, third-party\u201d platform for ad buyers, said Sizmek Executive Chairman       Mark Grether.Write to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 15:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sizmek-to-acquire-fellow-ad-tech-company-rocket-fuel-for-125-5-million-1500379406", "news_title": "Sizmek to Acquire Fellow Ad Tech Company Rocket Fuel for $125.5 Million ", "keywords": "ad technology,advertising technology,digital advertising,pe deals,rocket fuel acquisition,sizmek acquisition,Rocket Fuel,FUEL,Sizmek,Vector Capital Group,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,digital marketing,public relations,alternative investments,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "To the list of woes afflicting the city\u2019s subway system\u2014track fires, train derailments, switch and signal problems, sick passengers and overcrowding\u2014add rice spilling from a Styrofoam container.Joe Lhota,        the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said officials are considering banning certain foods from the subway to improve the system.\u201cThere\u2019s a debate going on,\u201d Mr. Lhota said during a news conference at New York Penn Station\u00a0Tuesday morning.Acknowledging that it could be difficult to police what people eat, Mr. Lhota said one solution could be \u201can education program [listing] what types of foods really shouldn\u2019t be brought on.\u201dHe recounted being on a No. 2 train recently and watching someone eat what looked like Chinese food from a Styrofoam container. \u201cInevitably the rice fell, it was all over the place,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cI want to avoid things like that.\u201dIn 2012, during Mr. Lhota\u2019s first, brief chairmanship of the MTA, he said that he opposed banning food on the subway because it \u201cseverely hurts and impacts minority communities.\u201dHe said the discussion about permissible food was first raised during a meeting of authority officials\u00a0on Monday\u00a0evening as part of a 30-day review he is conducting of MTA operations.New York Gov.

And thanks in part to the upheavals of the 1908-09 civil war in Iran, more and more were arriving in Europe, where dealers routinely sold them folio by painted folio. Even Bernard Berenson, the expert in Italian painting, was drawn to them, acquiring a small collection of Persian paintings and manuscripts mostly between 1910 and 1914. They have been lent by the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at the Villa I Tatti, Berenson\u2019s former home in Florence.A New Light on Bernard Berenson: Persian Paintings From Villa I TattiHarvard Art Museums  Through Aug. 13One work in particular, a 1427 anthology of treatises made for Prince Baysunghur, was in dire need of conservation. Its misfortune is our good luck. Ay\u015fin Yoltar-Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m assistant curator for Islamic and later Indian art at the Harvard Art Museums, seized the opportunity to explore Berenson\u2019s little known interest in Persian painting and place him within the framework of a coterie of collectors.She timed \u201cA New Light on Bernard Berenson: Persian Paintings From Villa I Tatti\u201d to take place after conservator       Katherine Beaty       of the Weissman Preservation Center of Harvard Library removed the Baysunghur manuscript\u2019s binding and before she reassembled it. A selection of 19 of its pages shows us what attracted Berenson: Decorative headings are feasts of color and sinuous line, while the paintings teem with patterns. One window scene has as many as a dozen designs decorating concentric frames, curtains, and the dress of the young man peering out; in a scene of men playing chess and backgammon, vibrant oranges, blues and golds come together in sizzling geometric configurations.In many ways, Berenson followed the pack. We see him seeking out works from the 14th through early 16th centuries because he subscribed to a popular theory (since discredited) that Persian painting followed the same chronology as the Italian Renaissance. He joined the chase for paintings by Bihzad (c. 1450-1535), one of the rare masters scholars had identified and considered pivotal in Persia\u2019s art history. And when the dealer       Georges Demotte       dismantled the lavishly illustrated \u201cGreat Ilkhanid Shahnama\u201d (1330s), Berenson was as keen as other collectors to own a folio.Seeing what he bought alongside works chosen by peers is revealing. In the case of the Bihzad, Berenson seemed interested only in adding the name to his list. The work he bought lacks the sensitivity of the portrait of Sultan Husayn Mirza that Swedish dealer       Frederik Robert Martin       (1868-1933) plucked out of an album in Istanbul. Berenson\u2019s stiff portrayal of sages turns out to be from a later period and, viewed in isolation, would leave us wondering how Martin could get away with dubbing Bihzad the \u201cRaphael of the East.\u201d Equally telling is Berenson\u2019s choice from the prized \u201cShahnama\u201d: a static court scene filled with sumptuous textiles and furniture, not one of the manuscript\u2019s many fabulous dramatic scenes, such as the one purchased by       Edward W. Forbes,        director of the Fogg Museum. Filling the page, an army made of iron and filled with naphtha thunders forth, spewing flames.Even though Berenson never appreciated Persian painting for much more than its decorative beauty, he had a significant impact. \u201cA Standing Uzbek Youth\u201d painted around 1600, for example, was among the miniatures he saw at a show in Munich in 1910 to which he took Belle Da Costa Greene, who went on to build a significant collection of Islamic manuscripts for J.P. Morgan. By including works acquired by Greene and other peers\u2014among them Isabella Stewart Gardner, scholar Victor Goloubew and Forbes\u2014the show tells a broader, layered story. It reminds us that collectors, like artists, rarely if ever operate in a vacuum.\u2014Ms. Lawrence writes about Asian and Islamic art for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 15:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-light-on-bernard-berenson-persian-paintings-from-villa-i-tatti-review-a-connoisseurs-brief-detour-1500404696", "news_title": "\u2018A New Light on Bernard Berenson: Persian Paintings From Villa I Tatti\u2019 Review: A Connoisseur\u2019s Brief Detour", "keywords": "a new light on bernard berenson, art history,arts in review, bernard berenson, harvard art museums, persian art, persian paintings from villa i tatti,Bernard Berenson,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "CINCINNATI\u2014Prosecutors Tuesday said they won\u2019t retry a former University of Cincinnati police officer after a jury last month for the second time failed to come to a unanimous decision on the officer\u2019s guilt in a 2015 fatal shooting.\u201cAfter discussing this matter with multiple jurors, both black and white, they have said to us that we will never get a conviction in this case,\u201d Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said in a news conference Tuesday.Ray Tensing, who is white, was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter over the shooting of Sam DuBose, a 43-year-old black man, who he shot at close range, after pulling him over for having a missing front license plate. Mr. Tensing was fired from his job shortly after he was indicted over the shooting in 2015.Prosecutors will now be working with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 office to file charges of civil-rights violations against Mr. Tensing. These charges, prosecutors said, would be different from state charges already pursued.Mr. Tensing\u2019s first trial started in November 2016, but the jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict after 25 hours of deliberation resulting in a mistrial. A second mistrial was declared this June, after a jury deliberated for nearly 30 hours and were similarly stuck.Before the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Deters delivered his decision to the family of Mr. DuBose, whom he said were devastated and \u201cvery upset\u201d with the decision not to charge Mr. Tensing for the third time.\u201cMy heart breaks for the DuBose family.

Now that the bill has failed, what comes next could be more unpredictable and disruptive to the industry.Republican support for the Better Care Reconciliation Act unraveled Monday evening. This is good news for health-care companies of all sorts: Health stocks have delivered splendid returns since the ACA became law in 2010. The bill to replace it, in contrast, called for significant rollbacks in access to Medicaid and introduced new incentives for insurers to more aggressively control health costs. That would likely have harmed industry profits.Uncertainty now reigns, as opposed to a definite return to the status quo. For instance, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) vowed to take up a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement. But that idea was quickly scuttled after three Republican Senators said Tuesday they would oppose such a measure.Yet congressional approval may not even be necessary to frustrate investors. Much of what the Senate bill aim-ed to achieve also can be accomplished administratively, according to analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could permit states to add work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, which could result in less coverage. Or the individual mandate to buy insurance might not be enforced. And President Donald Trump could yet follow through on his vow to crack down on high drug prices.None of this means a bad outcome for investors is assured.

Union officials have charged Nissan is violating workers\u2019 rights by blocking organizing efforts and has criticized the auto maker for what the UAW says is a liberal use of temporary workers that don\u2019t get the same benefits and job security of permanent employment.\u201cThe company is running one of the most aggressive anti-worker campaigns that we\u2019ve seen in modern U.S. history,\u201d the UAW\u2019s Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in a statement.While the UAW has largely supported Democratic candidates, including endorsing       Hillary Clinton       in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, Mr. Trump\u2019s free-trade criticisms and support for American jobs has resonated with working-class voters. About one-third of the union\u2019s members cast a vote for Mr. Trump and another 8% either didn\u2019t vote for president or went with a third-party candidate, breaking from historical trends.Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement for killing U.S. manufacturing jobs and has vowed to overhaul the pact, although a plan released this week by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t deviate substantially from the established U.S. trade policy.The UAW still faces an uphill battle in the South, where antiunion sentiment runs deep and foreign auto makers employ thousands of workers who have routinely shunned organizing efforts.Three years ago, the union mounted a drive at             Volkswagen AG\u2019s       factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., ultimately losing an organizing vote by a narrow margin. The UAW did manage to organize a small group of skilled trades employees at the plant.Write to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 14:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uaw-working-to-organize-employees-at-mississippi-nissan-plant-1500395269", "news_title": "UAW Working to Organize Employees at Mississippi Nissan Plant", "keywords": "buy american,made in america,manufacturing,unions,union workers,united auto workers,Nissan Motor,NSANY,7201.TO,United Auto Workers,Ford Motor,F,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.,FCAU,General Motors,GM,Donald Trump,Rodney Francis,Gary Casteel,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,workers pay,cars,political,general news,international relations,living,lifestyle,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick to run the Treasury Department\u2019s tax policy office said he wished he had acted differently when the accounting firm he helped lead was marketing aggressive tax shelters.David Kautter       was director of Ernst & Young LLP\u2019s national tax practice when the firm was selling sophisticated tax shelters to business owners.\u201cI was not involved in the decision to get involved in tax shelters and I\u2019ve never designed or drafted one myself,\u201d Mr. Kautter told the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing Tuesday. \u201cLooking back, I should have been more active.\u201dSen.       Ron Wyden       (D., Ore.) said the committee\u2019s vetting process found that Mr. Kautter was regularly informed of decisions that let Ernst & Young profit.\u201cI remain troubled that he was at the top of a department that engaged in these practices,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, citing documents that Mr. Kautter had received at the time. \u201cUp to this morning, you have taken no responsibility for a very dark chapter.\u201dAs assistant secretary for tax policy, Mr. Kautter would help shape the technical details of the administration\u2019s tax agenda, including a rewrite of the business and individual tax codes. He would also oversee tax regulation.Mr. Kautter, who is both a certified public accountant and a lawyer, was at Ernst & Young from 1982 to 2010, where he specialized in employee benefits. He led the firm\u2019s national tax practice from 2000 to 2010.During the boom, firms charged high fees for complex schemes with names such as \u201cBLIPS,\u201d \u201cDAD\u201d and \u201cCobra.\u201d They promised to shrink or wipe out taxes on transactions, such as the exercise of stock options or the sale of a long-held asset, by using techniques that were legal. Critics and the IRS argued that the shelters were shams that cheated Uncle Sam out of billions in taxes.Ernst & Young was among several top accounting firms penalized for marketing these shelters. It paid $15 million in 2003 and $123 million in 2013 in connection with tax shelters and admitted misconduct by some employees from 1999 to 2004. While large, these penalties were smaller than the $456 million KPMG agreed to pay in 2014 to help resolve similar issues.In addition, four Ernst & Young\u00a0employees were convicted in 2010 in connection with the shelters, although an appeals court later reversed the convictions of two of them. All had been members of the Ernst & Young\u00a0\u201cVIPER\u201d group, for \u201cValue Ideas Product Extraordinary Results.\u201dCommittee Chairman       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah), said he hopes the panel can advance Mr. Kautter\u2019s nomination soon.\u201cThe committee has seen no evidence whatsoever that would call into question his honesty [or] his integrity,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.Mr. Kautter, a native of Luzerne County, Pa., attended the University of Notre Dame.

In January, Mr. Sun pumped $2.22 billion into online-video platform LeEco, saving the company from a cash crunch after it expanded too quickly into everything from smartphones to smartcars.Mr. Sun goes after such big deals because he likes to take the credit for helping others, according to people who are familiar with his thinking.Days after the Wanda deal, Mr. Sun posted a picture on the             WeChat                   social-media platform of a magazine cover of him and       Wang Jianlin,        Wanda\u2019s founder and one of the richest men in China. They are side by side, with Mr. Wang resting his hand on Mr. Sun\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe both are more handsome than the picture shows,\u201d Mr. Sun joked.People close to him describe him as talkative and funny, yet he can be volatile. With Mr. Sun, huge decisions can be made promptly on short notice, the people said.It took just four days for Messrs. Sun and Wang to agree on their deal, according to Ms. Ma, who said the two tycoons have known each other a long time.Mr. Sun\u2019s highflying ambitions haven\u2019t always worked out.Sunac in 2015 made a high-profile $1.2 billion bid for Shenzhen-based developer             Kaisa Group,       which had become a takeover target after the Shenzhen government blocked sales of its properties without giving a reason, prompting it to default on its debts. Sunac\u2019s bid represented a big discount on Kaisa\u2019s value based on financial reports. In the end, the deal didn\u2019t go through.\u201cWe gave up Kaisa just because we found it isn\u2019t worth buying,\u201d Mr. Sun said at the time, without elaborating.The experience with Kaisa didn\u2019t deter Mr. Sun. In the last two months, Sunac announced that it bought three small Chinese companies, each with net losses for the last two years, filings show.China\u2019s recent property boom has long boasted Sunac\u2019s finances, though its debt buildup and aggressive acquisitions has steadily weakened its credit profile, credit analysts say. Sunac said last year\u2019s profit declined because of an increase in interest expenses as it took on more debt.Based on net debt compared to equity, Sunac is one of China\u2019s most indebted property developers.The debt buildup over the last two years was largely to fund a land-buying spree. The company\u2019s total liabilities were 257.8 billion yuan ($38 billion) as of last December, more than doubling from 96.1 billion yuan a year earlier, according to company filings.It\u2019s unclear what effect the bank scrutiny will have on Sunac\u2019s borrowing or its ability to roll over financing deals.Sunac hasn\u2019t purchased any new land since October, Ms. Ma said. The company has 90 billion yuan of cash on its books and expects to generate 300 billion yuan in contracted sales from apartment and commercial-property sales for the full year, she added.\u201cI understand that some people have concerns about Sunac\u2019s cash flow over the deals but the pressure on our capital isn\u2019t really too big,\u201d Ms. Ma said.Fitch Ratings last week downgraded Sunac\u2019s corporate credit rating to BB- from BB, saying that the Wanda deal would cause a rise in Sunac\u2019s debt.Mr. Sun is a U.S. citizen who, on social media, describes himself as a rational thinker who drives slowly and hates risk.\u201cI do things, which I\u2019ve thought through, boldly and resolutely,\u201d he wrote.\u2014Dominique Fong and Yang Jie contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 14:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sunacs-debt-load-draws-attention-after-wanda-deal-1500402430", "news_title": "Sunac\u2019s Debt Load Draws Attention After Wanda Deal", "keywords": "sunac debt, sunac wanda deal,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,Sunac China Holdings,1918.HK,HK:1918,Sun Hongbin,Ma Zhixia,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,diversified holding companies,real estate transactions,property managers,business,consumer services,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014The sudden cooling in Toronto\u2019s once-frothy housing market is an encouraging sign and suggests a series of nonrate tools deployed by Canadian authorities are finally having their \u201cdesired\u201d effect, the country\u2019s finance minister said.Bill Morneau       said Tuesday it is too early to draw conclusions about whether housing has stabilized and no longer poses a significant threat to Canadian financial stability. Data this week indicated national resale activity fell in June for a third straight month, with June\u2019s one-month drop the steepest in seven years.In Toronto-area market, the source of most concern for the better part of 2017, \u00a0home resales have plummeted by almost 42%, coinciding with the introduction of measures in the province of Ontario aimed at curbing housing exuberance.\u201cWe can see now the measures we put in place, combined with some of the measures from the provinces\u2026are having the desired impact,\u201d Mr. Morneau said at a news conference in the Canadian capital.The nonrate tools implemented included tightening mortgage-finance rules and requiring prospective buyers to undergo a \u201cstress test\u201d before qualifying for a loan. The provinces of Ontario and British Columbia have also imposed taxes on foreign-led house purchases.The tools \u201care slowing down those markets that were rising at an unsustainable pace,\u201d Mr. Morneau said.He added the sales drop and slowing of price increases in the greater Toronto area, which were upward of 40% on a one-year basis in April in some pockets, is \u201cplaying out largely the way we thought it might.\u201dLow interest rates for an extended period fueled a housing boom in Canada, which was most pronounced in Toronto and the west coast city of Vancouver. That, in turn, led to household debt hitting fresh highs and borrowing surpassing growth in after-tax income for several years.Canada\u2019s main housing agency said in a report Tuesday that while mortgage delinquencies remain low, at 0.3% among active mortgages, there are still signs of added vulnerabilities in the credit market. The share of mortgage holders who experienced a \u201crapid degrade\u201d in their credit score is at its second-highest point in four years, and delinquencies for people 65 and older are the highest among all age groups and rising.Mr. Morneau said last week\u2019s interest rate increase from the Bank of Canada, and the specter of further rate rises, may \u201cchange people\u2019s behavior in terms of taking on more debt.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Morneau used his Ottawa news conference to unveil proposed changes to Canada\u2019s tax code, aimed at shutting loopholes that businesspeople, through the use of privately held corporations, have deployed to reduce the amount of tax paid.The number of Canadian-controlled private corporations has surged 50% from 2001, with an increasing proportion of the self-employed choosing to incorporate, Canada\u2019s Finance Department said. These setups now account for more than twice the share of taxable business income, as a percentage of gross domestic product, than they did in the early 2000s, a \u201cworrying trend,\u201d Mr. Morneau said.\u201cThis is not about a business not paying its share,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about people using a corporate structure to shield their income and to gain a tax advantage.\u201dSome of the tactics Ottawa is targeting include attempts by businesspeople to divert income from a high-income individual to family members who qualify for a lower personal tax rate; and individuals who retain income within the corporate vehicle through a \u201cpassive\u201d investment portfolio, as opposed to putting the money in a bank account.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 14:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-housing-market-responds-to-curbs-minister-says-1500401719", "news_title": "Canada\u2019s Housing Market Responds to Curbs, Minister Says", "keywords": "canada,housing,mortgage lending,toronto,Bill Morneau,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department"}, {"content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.        CMG -0.57%       is facing another blemish to its food-safety record more than a year after navigating a crisis that put a dent in the company\u2019s revenues and profits.The burrito chain said it temporarily closed a restaurant in Sterling, Va., on Monday after learning about a \u201csmall number\u201d of reported illnesses that the company believes are likely to be from norovirus, a common virus that can be spread through food that has been handled by people who are sick.Chipotle shares were down more than 6% Tuesday, with trading volume more than six times its average level.The closed restaurant was expected to reopen Tuesday after a \u201cthorough sanitization,\u201d a Chipotle spokesman said.\u201cWe are working with health authorities to understand what the cause may be and to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,\u201d said       Jim Marsden,        Chipotle\u2019s executive director of food safety, in a statement. \u201cNorovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle.\u201dConsumers anonymously posted reports of vomiting or having diarrhea after eating at the Chipotle to a website called iwaspoisoned.com.Dr. David Goodfriend,        director of the Loudoun County Health Department, which handles reports of illnesses in Sterling, said he isn\u2019t sure if any of his staffers have received reports from doctors and says he isn\u2019t aware of any hospitalizations. \u201cWe\u2019ve just started looking into it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are individuals who can be tested, that may give us an answer.\u201dThe closed location in Sterling hasn\u2019t been cited for any health department violations during its last three routine inspections, according to the county\u2019s website. In May 2015 and October 2013, however, it was cited for employees\u2019 lack of awareness of reporting procedures regarding their health if they suspect they had been exposed to norovirus or other illnesses.This isn\u2019t Chipotle\u2019s first brush with a suspected norovirus outbreak. In August 2015, a norovirus outbreak at a Chipotle in California sickened more than 200 people. Chipotle experienced a series of outbreaks, ranging from salmonella to E.coli throughout that year, culminating with another norovirus outbreak in Boston in December 2015. The biggest problem stemmed from two multistate E.coli outbreaks that, in total, sickened 60 people across the country.In January 2016, the chain said it had received a grand-jury subpoena seeking information about the California norovirus outbreak. A month later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the E.coli outbreaks were officially over, without identifying a cause.However, the chain has struggled to regain lost customers even with a number of food giveaways and it also attracted the attention of activist shareholder       William Ackman,        with whom Chipotle reached a settlement late last year. Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management LP got two seats on the chain\u2019s board and agreed not to comment publicly on the company for two years.Chipotle also dropped its dual-chief executive officer structure, which had been criticized by investors, leaving the role solely to company founder       Steve Ells.The chain has revamped a number of food-safety protocols, including employee-reporting procedures for reporting sicknesses and cooking procedures to protect against further such outbreaks. But sales haven\u2019t fully recovered and the chain has increased its marketing spending in an effort to attract customers. The company last month said it expects its marketing and promotion costs to be higher in the second quarter than the first. The chain is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on July 25.Write to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 14:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chipotle-faces-new-food-safety-scare-1500395902", "news_title": "Chipotle Faces New Food-Safety Scare ", "keywords": "chipotle outbreak,contamination,ecoli,food borne virus,food safety,outbreak,salmonella,Chipotle Mexican Grill,CMG,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014House Republicans are unveiling an ambitious fiscal plan on Tuesday to rewrite the tax code, revamp medical malpractice laws, change federal employees\u2019 retirement benefits and partially repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulations\u2014all in one bill that wouldn\u2019t require any votes from Democrats to pass.The strategy, embedded in the House GOP fiscal 2018 budget, faces political and procedural obstacles, including many of the same ones that derailed the party\u2019s health-care bill in the Senate. For instance, Republicans will have a narrow margin in the Senate and will have to comply with budgetary rules that restrict which policies can be included.Republicans this year control the House, Senate and White House for the first time since January 2007, and they are trying to take advantage of that moment by pairing a landmark tax bill with at least $203 billion in deficit-reduction measures.\u201cWith a Republican Congress and a Republican administration, now is the time to put forward a governing document with real solutions to address our biggest challenges,\u201d said Rep. Diane Black (R., Tenn.), chairman of the House Budget Committee.Most bills can be filibustered in the Senate and require a 60-vote threshold. Republicans are seeking to take advantage of an exception to that rule\u2014the so-called reconciliation procedures allowed under budgetary lawmaking.Under reconciliation, fiscally oriented bills can become law with a simple-majority vote in both chambers and a signature from the president. They can\u2019t increase long-run budget deficits and must hit fiscal targets set out by the budget. To get to that point, Congress must adopt a budget first, which means the House and Senate must agree twice, once on the budget and then again on the ultimate bill.The House Budget Committee\u2019s release on Tuesday, followed by a committee vote slated for Wednesday, marks the first step in that process. The committee\u2019s fiscal blueprint envisions $6.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, forecasts 2.6% average annual economic growth, and calls for cutting projected Medicare costs and reducing spending on nondefense programs in an effort to balance the budget by 2027.Democrats are expected to question those economic assumptions and criticize the GOP\u2019s broad fiscal agenda. But those criticisms are on the parts of the plan that are theoretical and nonbinding, while the tax bill and the $203 billion in potential spending cuts are a core piece of the Republican agenda over the next few months.The biggest impact of the budget is to set the stage for future reconciliation bills. It will assign deficit-reduction targets to 11 committees under reconciliation.The potential targets in this round of deficit reduction are unlikely to include changes to Medicare that are included in the 10-year budget outline. But other so-called mandatory spending programs could be affected.The Judiciary Committee, for example, has a $45 billion target, while the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has a $32 billion number. The committees will decide exactly which policies to pursue, but agenda items could include medical malpractice and Dodd-Frank bills favored by House Republicans, though reconciliation\u2019s special rules could affect and limit them too.As the House Budget Committee prepares for a Wednesday vote, it isn\u2019t clear whether the budget written by Rep. Black has enough support to pass the House before lawmakers leave for their August recess at the end of next week. Conservatives have been arguing for even larger spending cuts in the reconciliation package.\u201cI think we have the votes to move it out of committee. We get to the floor, that\u2019s another issue,\u201d said Rep.       Tom Cole       (R., Okla.), a member of the Budget Committee, noting that the Republican-controlled House was unable to pass a budget resolution last year.Rep. Dave Brat (R., Va.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the caucus would like to see at least $400 billion in mandatory spending cuts\u2014twice what the current version envisions. He also said some conservatives are reluctant to support the plan without more assurances about the GOP\u2019s tax proposal.\u201cWe did that last time on health care\u2014we opened the gate for a free-market health-care piece. We didn\u2019t get that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make that mistake again.\u201dRep. John Yarmuth (D., Ky.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the GOP budget \u201cembraces the worst extremes of the Trump budget, sacrificing nearly every investment that helps American families get ahead, in order to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and corporations.\u201dThe budget debate will occur even before Congress gets to the tax plan, which negotiators from the House, Senate and White House are working on. They have said they are optimistic that they can release a plan before the end of September and finish the entire process by the end of 2017.The tax plan itself aims to be deficit-neutral, partly paying for itself with revenue from stronger economic growth. That would seem to rule out, unless the budget framework changes, tax cuts on the scale of what President Donald Trump pledged during his campaign.\u201cThis creates the vehicle for ultimately getting tax reform to the president\u2019s desk this year,\u201d said Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.Adding nontax legislation could make that task harder, because it would create a massive bill with hundreds of moving parts and coalitions.Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.), a key centrist Republican, said the purpose of the budget should be to provide an \u201cappropriate\u201d top line spending number, which he said they don\u2019t currently have, and reconciliation instructions to advance tax legislation.\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing too much on the mandatory side in this discussion will make tax reform that much harder.\u201dThe reconciliation rules allow each budget to have three bills stem from it: one for revenue, one for spending and one for the debt limit.The House plan operates under the assumption that the tax bill and spending cuts must be coupled. But a different interpretation of rules or a different structure of the bills could let them decouple the two measures.Under the reconciliation rules, any bill created through that process can\u2019t add to budget deficits beyond the budget window. Although some lawmakers, including Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.), have called for a longer budget window that would allow long-lasting temporary tax cuts, the House budget has a 10-year window.Before they can advance the tax bill, the House and Senate must agree on the same version of the budget. The Senate Budget Committee hasn\u2019t yet released a budget or set a date. President Trump doesn\u2019t need to sign the budget resolution; he would need to sign the subsequent bill into law.The budget could change significantly in the Senate, and it could also be revised to facilitate whatever tax agreement the House, Senate and White House agree on.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of time, energy and capital expended on the first launch on these bills. I worry more about the landing than I do the takeoff. The landing is what matters,\u201d Mr. Dent said.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Budget Blueprint Faces Obstacles.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 14:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-republicans-set-out-plan-to-rewrite-tax-code-1500368402", "news_title": "House Republicans Set Out Plan to Rewrite Tax Code ", "keywords": "dodd-frank,gop budget,republican budget,republican deficit ,republican fiscal plan, spending cuts,tax cuts, tax reduction,regulation,government policy,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,gross misconduct,malpractice,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch"}, {"content": "The Group of 20 leaders\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 out of Hamburg earlier this month promises it: Public debt is to be put on a sustainable path. High debt is a mortgage on the future. Even the larger European countries, such as Italy and Spain, can be pushed to the brink, leading to the fiscal crises and widespread panics of only a few years ago. With the global economy strengthening, there\u2019s no reason to delay focusing on this important longer-term issue. The challenge now is to shift away from complacency and inaction.Today the debt situation appears stable. But the truth is it remains precarious: Gross government debt for the Group of Seven countries is now at broadly the same level as it was after World War II. And it shows no sign of coming down.Debt exceeds 100% of gross domestic product in the U.S., Italy and Japan. And it isn\u2019t far below in France and the U.K. Germany still shows debt well above the reasonably safe level of 60%. And even in today\u2019s relatively good times, many national deficits are stubbornly stuck between 2% and 5% of gross domestic product.As a result, little progress with debt reduction can be expected. This could lead to some really big dominoes toppling in the next major crisis.Three arguments are commonly offered as to why governments and policy advisors may take a relaxed approach to public debt. None of them holds up to scrutiny.The first is that a country can grow itself out of public debt. However, with working-age populations shrinking, it\u2019s unlikely that growth will pick up again. In advanced economies, it certainly won\u2019t exceed 1% by much over the next decades. Strong reformers and countries trying to catch up may do a little more. But with the current deficits this won\u2019t be enough to bring down the debt.Some claim that expansionary fiscal policies can have such a strong effect on growth that debts will come down despite temporarily higher deficits. Although growth-friendly fiscal reforms are certainly needed, self-financing fiscal expansions are an illusion. Fans of big government like to exaggerate the effect of higher public-works spending, while their opponents tend to trump up the supply-side effects of lower taxes. Neither is a solution to high debt.The second argument reflects the hope that somebody else will pay, especially in Europe. Debt relief\u2014as demanded, for example, by Greece\u2014is one facet. A new European debt facility, or the hope that Europe turns its national debts into a common responsibility, is another.The EU budget already transfers several percent of GDP each year to the poorer countries. Claims between eurozone central banks exceed \u20ac1.2 trillion ($1.376 trillion). And the European rescue fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism, provides a \u20ac500 billion fire wall.The combination of conditionality and support may have been an uncomfortable one for some countries, but in almost all cases it has also been quite successful.Nor would the sale of Eurobonds and other debt instruments lead to less debt or lower deficits. Quite the opposite: It would be a recipe for greater collective irresponsibility thanks to increased moral hazard.It might also destabilize the eurozone. What proponents call pro-European would actually prove to be anti-European. Nor is there any guarantee that it would work, given Europe\u2019s spotty history of keeping fiscal-discipline promises.The third illusion refers to the role of monetary policy. The hope is to deflate the real value of government debt through a combination of inflation and low interest rates. But to think this can keep governments from piling on more debt and fool today\u2019s savvy investors is a long shot. Instead, it could well induce a vicious circle of capital flight, higher interest rates, capital controls and protectionism. Be the result high inflation or a financial crisis, things would be very bad indeed.Where does this leave us? We can\u2019t expect long-term stability and resilience from more spending, monetization and bond issuances. Governments must make credible commitments to reducing the public debt. This requires a revival of rules-based fiscal policy making.In Europe, the Stability and Growth Pact must be properly implemented. At the national level, the fiscal compact must be adhered to, no matter what the expansionists claim. Without these, any grand new schemes from a eurozone budget and finance minister would only result in more broken promises and an inherently unstable debt union. In the U.S. and Japan, mechanisms for debt reduction must also be put in place.Debt reduction requires hard and smart choices.

Abdul Rashid Dostum, was returning to Afghanistan from Turkey late Monday when Afghan authorities asked the U.S.-led international military coalition to deny his chartered Turkish plane permission to land in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif, a senior Afghan official said.The aircraft was diverted to neighboring Turkmenistan, despite a request by Atta Mohammad Noor, the powerful governor and a Dostum supporter, that the general\u2019s plane be allowed to land in Mazar-e-Sharif. The governor made his appeal to the German military, which as a member of the international coalition oversees the airspace in northern Afghanistan, a coalition official said.The former governor of Jowzjan province, Ahmad Ishchi, says that Gen. Dostum abducted and sexually assaulted him last November. Since then, the general, a notorious former warlord and leader of the country\u2019s minority Uzbek community, has battled for his political survival. Many officials in the Afghan capital Kabul viewed his departure for Turkey in May as just the latest of the general\u2019s moves to escape political trouble at home.Gen. Dostum\u2019s aides dismissed any suggestion that his aircraft was forcibly rerouted. They also denied that his stay in Turkey represented a retreat from the Afghan political stage, saying he was in Turkey for medical treatment and would soon return to Afghanistan to participate in the new antigovernment movement dubbed the \u201ccoalition to rescue Afghanistan,\u201d which he formed earlier this month in Turkey.In addition to Gen. Dostum\u2019s National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, the coalition is made up of Jamait-e-Islami, a Tajik-dominated political party led by the acting foreign minister Salahuddin Rabbani, and the National Unity of People of Afghanistan party headed by Mohammad Mohaqiq, representing the country\u2019s ethnic Hazara community.The Afghan government of President       Ashraf Ghani       and its Western supporters have demanded that Gen. Dostum be properly investigated and prosecuted if necessary. He has, however, refused to cooperate with judicial authorities, and no formal charges have been filed against him.\u201cThis is a political case,\u201d said Bashir Ahmad Tayanch, a spokesman for Gen. Dostum. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to cooperate with the attorney general or the court.\u201dWhile Gen. Dostum remains under investigation and could still face prosecution, nine of his bodyguards have been charged with kidnapping and sexual assault in connection with the case. The attorney general\u2019s office ruled last week that the cases should go to trial.Corrections & Amplifications   Ahmad Ishchi is the former governor of Jowzjan province.

Mr. Mueller is investigating alleged Russian meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election and whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with Moscow.Mr. Kaveladze was asked by Mr. Agalarov to attend the meeting as an interpreter for the Russian lawyer, according to       Scott Balber,        the attorney who represents both Messrs. Kaveladze and Agalarov.But the Russian lawyer,       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        brought her own interpreter, and Mr. Kaveladze \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall saying a single word at the meeting,\u201d Mr. Balber said.Mr. Kaveladze is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the special counsel\u2019s probe but has yet to be interviewed, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov and his son, pop singer Emin, haven\u2019t been approached by Mr. Mueller, he said.Mr. Trump and his campaign aides have denied any collusion with Russia. The GOP president has also expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow sought to intervene during the campaign. Russian officials have denied doing so.Donald Trump Jr. released emails last week showing he helped arrange the Trump Tower meeting to discuss allegedly damaging information about former Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.       The meeting was also attended by       Jared Kushner,        Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law who was a senior campaign aide at the time and is now a top White House official, and       Paul Manafort,        then the campaign chairman.On Tuesday, Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       (D., Calif.) said she had been informed Mr. Mueller wouldn\u2019t object to Donald Trump Jr. and Mr. Manafort testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201cI am told that it is not a problem for the special counsel,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.A spokesman Mr. Mueller declined to comment. A spokesman for Republicans on the panel didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the committee\u2019s chairman, previously said he would like to call attendees in front of the panel to shed new light on the June 2016 meeting. It is unclear whether the Senate also wants to hear from Mr. Kushner.In an email to the younger Mr. Trump dated June 3, 2016, a British publicist said that a top Russian prosecutor had \u201coffered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201dThe publicist said the prosecutor had communicated this offer to Mr. Agalarov, who along with his son organized the 2013       Miss Universe       pageant in Moscow. At that time, Mr. Trump co-owned the pageant. The younger Mr. Trump replied to the email with the offer: \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201dMr. Kaveladze was unaware of what would be discussed at the meeting until moments beforehand, when he met Ms. Veselnitskaya and was told \u201ca little bit about this Magnitsky Act,\u201d Mr. Balber said. As he recalls it, the only thing discussed in the meeting was the act, a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations, his lawyer said.Donald Trump Jr. has said information about Mrs. Clinton was offered at the meeting but that it was of little value.In his role at Crocus Group, a Russian development company, Mr. Kaveladze oversees international development projects, including \u201csecuring and structuring project investments and negotiating with Chinese and other international contractors,\u201d according to his website. He is a member of both the America-Georgia Business Council and the U.S.-Russia Business Council.According to a business person formerly based in Moscow who has had dealings with Crocus Group, Mr. Kaveladze is \u201ca total straight shooter. Very easy to deal with. Very low key, gets deals done for the family, no fuss, no ego.\u201dThe younger Mr. Trump initially said that the meeting\u2019s attendees included himself, the lawyer, the British publicist and Messrs. Kushner and Manafort. It has since emerged that       Rinat Akhmetshin,        a Russian-born lobbyist who represents Russian interests in Washington, also attended the meeting, as well as a translator for Ms. Veselnitskaya.Mr. Mueller is conducting a criminal investigation into matters related to Russia\u2019s alleged activity in the 2016 campaign. On Capitol Hill, several House and Senate committees have been running their own investigation.Prosecutors typically don\u2019t want their witnesses commenting publicly while an investigation is under way because they could inadvertently say something to undermine the case. But the public interest surrounding the Russia investigation could shift the calculation for any prosecutor in favor of allowing testimony, former prosecutors said.The younger Mr. Trump has also made several public statements about the meeting, which could make it difficult for prosecutors to argue for limiting his testimony before Congress.Nearly two decades ago, Mr. Kaveladze was the subject of a congressional inquiry that found it was \u201crelatively easy\u201d for foreigners to launder money through U.S. banks using shell companies formed in the U.S. The inquiry found that Russians and other Eastern Europeans had moved more than $1.4 billion through accounts opened by Mr. Kaveladze, who moved to the U.S. from Russia in 1991.Mr. Kaveladze told the New York Times in 2000 that the investigation was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He didn\u2019t return a request for comment\u00a0on Tuesday.\u2014Brett Forrest  contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com, Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Special Counsel Examines Campaign Meeting.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 13:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-tower-meeting-with-russians-1500400598", "news_title": "Special Counsel Is Investigating Trump Tower Meeting With Russians ", "keywords": "election,hacking,hillary clinton,presidential campaign,putin,russian lawyer,russian probe,trump,Hillary Clinton,Natalia Veselnitskaya,Paul Manafort,Donald Trump Jr,Ike Kaveladze,Jared Kushner,Rinat Akhmetshin,Robert Mueller,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Merrill Lynch continued to pull client money into fee-based accounts during the second quarter, helping to push the brokerage\u2019s net income to the best level since it was acquired by             Bank of America Corp.        BAC 0.67%       in 2009.Clients of Bank of America\u2019s global wealth unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, moved $27.5 billion into fee-based accounts during the period. While that was down 5.8% from the first quarter in part because of a divestiture, it was a more-than fourfold increase from a year earlier. Net income rose to $804 million from $705 million a year earlier.Higher client assets on the fee side means a bigger benefit for the firm from rising markets and higher interest rates, said       Devin Ryan,        a managing director at             JMP Securities                   LLC. \u201cHigher markets are flowing through fee-based lines,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, as clients pay a percentage of their account value for advisory services.Brokerages have for years been putting more emphasis on boosting their revenue from recurring fees charged to customers. Fee revenue tends to be more predictable and steady compared with commissions, which can be harder hit during periods of market volatility. The shift has accelerated since the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule requiring brokers to act in the best interests of retirement savers was unveiled last year; the rule aims to eliminate conflicts from advice that often come when commissions are charged.Merrill Lynch has been more aggressive than its competitors in moving customers into fee-based accounts, Mr. Ryan said. To avoid the rule\u2019s more onerous requirements and heightened legal risk, Merrill has said clients who wanted retirement advice from one of its brokers would have to pay a fee. The firm said more than two-thirds of its advisers now have at least half of their client assets under a fee-based relationship.On a conference call Tuesday, Bank of America Chief Executive       Brian Moynihan       said the possibility of a revised or rescinded fiduciary rule isn\u2019t likely to change the firm\u2019s strategy. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don\u2019t expect to change our course.\u201d The Labor Department is in the midst of reviewing the Obama-era regulation after President       Donald Trump       ordered the agency to do so after his inauguration.

Still, those banks have continued to report gains in fee-based assets in recent years.Meanwhile, online brokerage platform Merrill Edge reported 21% jump in assets from the year-earlier period to $159 billion, the bank said, thanks to market performance and a 10% increase in self-directed accounts. It is unclear how much of that money is net new money, analysts say. The bank launched Merrill Edge in 2010 to attract investors with less than $250,000 in assets, and a robo-adviser service was recently added to the platform.The firm added to its adviser ranks during the period.

LMT 1.35%       said Tuesday that its order book had grown to more than $100 billion as it sold more F-35 combat jets and boosted sales of its helicopters and missile defense systems to foreign governments.The milestone provides the world\u2019s largest defense company by sales with more stability amid lingering uncertainty over the path of U.S. military spending and potential disruptions to deals in the Middle East.Defense companies typically face a lag of between a year and 18 months between securing orders and booking their sales and profits. Lockheed by far has the industry\u2019s largest order book, even as it chases more deals such as a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force and an $80 billion refresh of the country\u2019s nuclear missiles.Marillyn Hewson,        Lockheed\u2019s chief executive, said she remained confident the U.S. would continue to boost military spending. The company is targeting near-term annual sales growth of between 3% and 5%.U.S. lawmakers are still wrangling over the fiscal 2018 Pentagon budget, and President Donald Trump has yet to detail longer-term plans pending a military strategy review. That is likely to leave spending pegged at prior-year levels for several months under a temporary budget deal.Lockheed reported forecast-beating quarterly profits on Tuesday and boosted its outlook for sales and earnings this year.The F-35 jet is central to Lockheed\u2019s growth and already delivers almost a quarter of its sales. Annual production is expected to rise from 66 planes in 2017 to around 150 in the next several years. Profits from the program continue to rise despite the Trump administration\u2019s contentious effort to slim the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program.Sales in Lockheed\u2019s aeronautics business, which includes the F-35, rose almost 20% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Lockheed last month secured a $5.6 billion deal to support production of the next batch of jets and is eyeing a follow-on sale of as many as 450 planes that would potentially be the largest single arms deal in history.International sales already account for 27% of total revenue, and Chief Financial Officer       Bruce Tanner       said they were running ahead of plan. He said Lockheed may this year book a portion of the $28 billion in potential sales to Saudi Arabia announced when Mr. Trump visited the kingdom in May.Some U.S. lawmakers have called for new arms sales to the region to be frozen pending a resolution of the diplomatic dispute between Qatar and its neighbors.Lockheed boosted its per-share earnings forecast by 15 cents to between $12.30 and $12.60 and raised expectations for sales to a range of $49.8 billion and $51 billion, though it left its free cash flow guidance unchanged.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 13:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-raises-guidance-on-strong-quarter-1500380686", "news_title": "Lockheed Order Book Reaches $100 Billion", "keywords": "defense budget,defense contracts,defense spending,f-35,lockheed guidance,lockheed orders,middle east conflict,nuclear missile fleet,t-x air force trainer,Lockheed Martin,LMT,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,weapons programs,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}, {"content": "For nearly two centuries,             Deere        DE 0.17%       & Co. has built equipment to help farmers plant and harvest their crops. Now, the company\u2019s financial muscle is doing more of the work.Throughout the Farm Belt, low prices for corn, soybeans and wheat are putting a strain on U.S. grain farmers, making it harder to get bank lending to plant a crop, or commit to purchasing multimillion-dollar fleets of new equipment.Deere, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of tractors and harvesting combines, is stepping in to fill the gap. It already lends billions to finance farmers\u2019 purchases of equipment. Now, it is providing more short-term credit for crop supplies such as seeds, chemicals and fertilizer, making it the No. 5 agricultural lender behind banks             Wells Fargo,       Rabobank, Bank of the West and             Bank of America,       according to the American Bankers Association.Deere has also expanded its leasing program to get the company\u2019s green and yellow tractors into the hands of farmers, even when they are unable or unwilling to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy one.Its financing has helped farmers stay in business while generating income for Deere during the worst market for machinery sales in more than 15 years.Farmers\u2019 incomes will decline for a fourth year this year, to half what they were in 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects. And inflation-adjusted debt is at a level not seen since the 1980s farm bust.In shoring up the ailing sector, Deere\u2019s loans may be helping draw out the pain for farmers, allowing them to continue to rack up debt despite a glut of grain world-wide that is keeping a lid on crop prices. The increase in equipment leasing, meanwhile, is weakening Deere\u2019s own market for sales.If crop prices remain subdued, \u201cyou\u2019re just prolonging the agony and potentially building up [farm] losses instead of cutting the pain, cauterizing the wound and stanching the flow of financial blood now,\u201d said       Scott Irwin,        an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.But if poor weather ultimately spurs grain prices higher, Mr. Irwin said, the risks of farm lending likely would be forgotten, and Deere could win new or more loyal customers.Deere said it is responding to greater demand for leased equipment from farmers and for short-term credit from other farm-industry manufacturers such as seed companies that are offering aggressive financing through Deere as a sales incentive.\u201cOur core mission is to support sales of equipment,\u201d said       Jayma Sandquist,        vice president of marketing for the U.S. and Canada for John Deere Financial, the company\u2019s financing unit. \u201cIt\u2019s a cyclical industry. We\u2019ve built a business that we can manage effectively across all cycles, and our performance would indicate we can do that.\u201dThe financing arm has shielded the Moline, Ill., company from the worst of the farm slump, keeping factories and dealers intact and investors satisfied with profits. Despite a 37% drop in sales of its farm equipment since a record high in 2013, Deere\u2019s stock price is up 72% from its recent low in early 2016 and up 22% since the start of 2017.John Deere operating profit, by segmentOutstanding short-term credit extended to farmersValue of leased equipmentEquipment (sales)Includes farm andconstruction machineryFinancial servicesFarm machinery$6 billion", "news_time": "2017-07-18 13:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-farmers-turn-to-bank-of-john-deere-1500398960", "news_title": "America\u2019s Farmers Turn to Bank of John Deere", "keywords": " farm debt, farm income, farm leases, farm loans, farm machinery, low crop prices,plowed under,Deere,DE,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,financing agreements,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,grains,edible oils markets,agriculture,farming,oilseed,grain farming,machinery,agricultural machinery,banking,rental,leasing services,agricultural equipment rental,leasing,business,consumer services,credit,financial services,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Police are searching for suspects who made a fast getaway with one of Queens\u2019 slowest residents.The victim: Millennium, a 95-pound tortoise possibly born in 2000, though nobody really knows for sure.He went missing from his enclosure at the Alley Pond Environmental Center sometime between\u00a0Sunday\u00a0evening and\u00a0Monday\u00a0afternoon, according to Carlos Martinez the center\u2019s head of operations.Officials of Alley Pond say that police have taken security footage from the center and will return\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0with a search dog.

The mandate affects only students who pay full or reduced prices for lunch, not the millions of children who qualify for free lunch.A USDA-led study found that 58% of school food authorities, which are mostly school districts, incurred unpaid meal costs during the 2010-2011 school year.But some schools deny food to children or toss their chosen hot meal and provide a bag lunch instead if they see their account is delinquent. Opponents of that practice, which some call \u201clunch shaming,\u201d say that can embarrass students, and several states\u00a0have passed or are considering laws\u00a0that ban it.In the Southern Boone School District in Missouri, where school leaders are wrestling with a $30,000 meal balance,\u00a0parents that have fallen behind and haven\u2019t made arrangements to pay\u00a0would be barred from attending their child\u2019s graduation and other events under a policy being considered in August.\u201cMany of the people on the list have the means to pay,\u201d said Southern Boone superintendent Chris Felmlee, who noted that his small district has a low percentage of poor students.At least two states, New Mexico and Texas, recently approved laws aimed at avoiding lunch shaming, either forbidding practices that single students out or mandating that districts provide a grace period for nonpayment.\u00a0A federal bill introduced in May, called the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017,\u00a0would forbid actions such as students performing chores to pay off\u00a0debt.Many of the\u00a0local school district\u00a0meal policies, some in place before the\u00a0federal\u00a0mandate, outline how schools will communicate with parents to collect money before lunches are cut off, and they provide the length of grace periods, usually longer at the elementary level. They also describe the \u201calternate\u201d meal given to kids who can\u2019t pay, usually a cheese or peanut-butter sandwich with a vegetable, fruit and milk.Some policies also mention turning over unpaid accounts to collection agencies, taking parents to court, and involving child protective services when parents are unresponsive.In Colorado Springs School District 11, the policy states: \u201cAny student may work in the kitchen and receive a meal at no cost.\u201dThe meal policy for Union Area School District in Pennsylvania notes that students with negative account balances \u201cwill not be able to walk and/or attend the graduation ceremony.\u201dBut San Diego Unified and some other districts have decided to eat the costs instead of punishing students or parents.\u201cWe don\u2019t shame kids, never have, and we don\u2019t rip trays out of kids\u2019 hands,\u201d said Gary Petill, San Diego Unified\u2019s director of food and nutrition services. \u201cNo school should deny kids a meal.\u201dWrite to Tawnell D.

The hope: that lively atmospheres will encourage patrons to linger and shop.Three years ago, Atlanta-based developer Vantage Realty Partners LLC proposed an open-container ordinance in Duluth, Ga., where it developed a retail and entertainment complex called Parsons Alley in a historic district downtown. The ordinance passed this year.\u201cEvery restaurant and retailer loved it. It increases their sales. Their customers don\u2019t have to stay confined in their premises and can walk to the town green or fountain with a drink,\u201d said       Chris Carter,        co-founder of Vantage Realty.Of the 45,000 square feet of space at Parsons Alley, roughly 70% is leased or sold and the firm is picking tenants for the remaining space.The retail sector is slumping as internet shopping eats into revenue. Retail landlords are trying a variety of tactics to boost foot traffic at their properties, from adding restaurants and entertainment venues to creating open-air districts downtown.City councils and zoning boards from Georgia to Alabama to Texas to Iowa in recent months have proved amenable to changing land-use and public-drinking ordinances to boost activity in once-bustling shopping districts.\u201cI don\u2019t know why alcohol is so important, but if you have a brew in hand and walk around, you\u2019d enjoy it more, especially when there\u2019s good weather and live music,\u201d said       Marc Moen,        partner and owner of property developer Moen Group, a builder and operator of condominiums, retail, office and hotel buildings in the downtown area of Iowa City, which passed an open-container measure in May.Last October, the board of commissioners of Forsyth County, Ga., permitted businesses in certain development districts to serve alcoholic beverages in to-go cups, with certain limits.County officials understood the challenges in the retail environment, said       Patrick Leonard,        principal at RocaPoint Partners, which is building a $370 million, 135-acre mixed-use project in Forsyth County called Halcyon that would include plenty of lawn space.\u201cIt seems to be a trend for retail property to help get people outside,\u201d said Mr. Leonard, adding that the looser open-container regulations \u201cabsolutely helped us lease retail space.\u201dIowa City\u2019s ordinance permits patrons to carry open containers on sidewalks and streets between licensed premises. That allowed the Iowa City Downtown District business association to apply for a temporary license for a downtown block party, which took place in June.\u201cIt\u2019s an area that attracts all ages, little kids, grandparents, working adults and college students. Residents love being around activity and young people,\u201d said Mr. Moen, who supported the open-container ordinance.In the downtown block party last month, cups were sold to partygoers who had to patronize bars and restaurants in the district to be served. The organizers also arranged for Uber pickup and drop-off points and parking garages nearby that offered free overnight parking.\u201cWe wanted to make sure the event is safe and people are getting home,\u201d said       Nancy Bird,        executive director of Iowa City Downtown District, adding that there were no incidents. The party targeted 15,000 revelers, and 30,000 showed up.Ohio in 2015 passed a bill allowing open-container zones, which opened the door for municipalities to do so. In the New York state Senate, lawmakers in February proposed a bill to allow patrons of a licensed business located within a leisure or recreation district to leave with alcohol in an open container if they stay within certain boundaries. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 61-1, and the state Assembly has yet to weigh in on the measure.Pushing for change on public drinking often takes time. College towns, in particular, are resistant to measures that could lead to disorderly behavior.Mr. Carter of Vantage Realty in Atlanta said that having people visit Avalon, another retail and mixed-use development 10 miles away where an open-container ordinance had already passed, helped his campaign in Duluth.\u201cThey see how robust Avalon is. They had to touch it and experience it. And they realized it wasn\u2019t so scary,\u201d said Mr. Carter.Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'In Bid for Patrons, a Push to Open the Taps.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/property-developers-push-for-open-drinking-on-city-streets-1500370201", "news_title": "Property Developers Push for Open Drinking on City Streets ", "keywords": " developers, on the street,open containers, open drinking, retail, shoppers,RocaPoint Partners,Vantage Realty Partners,Moen Group,Nancy Bird,Chris Carter,Marc Moen,Patrick Leonard,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,wine,beer,spirits,beverages,tobacco,real estate transactions,retail real estate,alcoholic beverages,drinks,commercial,industrial real estate,consumer goods,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration on Tuesday leveled more sanctions against Iran, targeting its elite military unit and ballistic missile program in a move that heightened tensions between the two countries and raised new questions about the fate of the 2015 international nuclear deal.The sanctions came after the administration told Congress late Monday that Iran was continuing to comply with the 2015 international nuclear agreement, a notification that kept the accord in place for now. But that determination came after an intense debate within the administration over whether to certify Iran\u2019s compliance, according to officials familiar with the discussions.\u201cThis administration will continue to aggressively target Iran\u2019s malign activity, including their ongoing state support of terrorism, ballistic missile program, and human-rights abuses,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said in imposing the new sanctions Tuesday.Referring to the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cWe will continue to target the IRGC and pressure Iran to cease its ballistic missile program and malign activities in the region.\u201dThe Trump administration is reviewing the nuclear agreement and its policy toward Iran, a move that has European allies worried about the fate of the deal.State Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said the U.S. would meet its commitments as the review progressed and would press Iran to do the same. The U.S. will next have to certify Iran\u2019s compliance with the deal in October, and some officials expect the review will be completed by then.Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned the new sanctions, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Iran will retaliate by placing its own sanctions on American entities, the ministry said, adding that those targeted would be named soon.Iranian Foreign Minister       Javad Zarif       said Tuesday\u2019s sanctions \u201cpoison the atmosphere.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re designed to do, actually,\u201d he said in an interview with CBS. \u201cThey\u2019re not designed to help anybody, because they know that none of them ever travel to the United States or will have an account in the U.S.\u201dThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the 2015 nuclear agreement is formally known, was championed by the Obama administration as a way to obtain Iran\u2019s agreement to significantly cut back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions.President Donald Trump criticized the deal during his presidential campaign. For now, however, his administration is continuing its review of the accord, and officials said Monday that they would look to work with allies to strengthen its enforcement and fix what they described as its flaws, citing clauses that allow some restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program to expire.However, the decision to certify Iran\u2019s compliance late Monday was proceeded by several hours of debate during which President Trump considered refusing certification. Officials including White House strategist Steve Bannon urged Mr. Trump to declare that Iran hadn\u2019t complied, people familiar with the deliberations said. On the other side was Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and officials who urged Mr. Trump to keep the agreement intact while the policy review is under way.Tuesday\u2019s Treasury Department sanctions notice designated 16 entities and individuals that it said supported the IRGC. The State Department also designated two Iranian organizations involved with Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.\u201cThese sanctions target procurement of advanced military hardware, such as fast attack boats and unmanned aerial vehicles, and send a strong signal that the United States cannot and will not tolerate Iran\u2019s provocative and destabilizing behavior,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.Qeshm Madkandaloo Shipbuilding Cooperative Co was sanctioned for supplying equipment to the IRGC\u2019s navy. The U.S. also sanctioned Turkey-based Ramor Group and its owner Resit Tavan for providing goods to Qeshm Madkandaloo.Among the other individuals and entities blacklisted in Tuesday\u2019s action are Iran-based Rayan Roshd Afzar Co. and three associated individuals. The Treasury Department said the company produced technical components for the IRGC\u2019s drone program and produced tools that supported the IRGC\u2019s efforts to block social media and telecommunications access in Iran.The Trump administration also blacklisted a China-based procurement agent and several related China-based entities for supporting Iran\u2019s military activities.The Treasury Department also moved against Iran-based Ajily Software Procurement Group, which it said uses hackers to steal engineering software from the U.S. and other Western countries. The Treasury said the group sells some of the software to Iran\u2019s military, which can\u2019t acquire it otherwise because of U.S. export controls.Requests for comment from Rayan Roshd Afzar Co., Qeshm Madkandaloo Shipbuilding Cooperative Co, and Ramor Group owner Resit Tavan weren\u2019t immediately returned. Ajily Software Procurement Group couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The action against Ajily followed a move on Monday by the Justice Department against some related individuals. The Justice Department charged two Iranian men it said worked with a third man, who was pardoned by President       Barack Obama       as part of a prisoner swap with Iran that took place as the deal took effect in 2016. The two men were accused of hacking a Vermont software company and selling sensitive software to Iran, and the Treasury Department said the men were affiliated with the Ajily procurement group.\u2014Asa Fitch in Erbil, Iraq, contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Puts New Sanctions on Iran.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-slaps-iran-with-additional-sanctions-1500389848", "news_title": "Trump Administration Slaps Iran With Additional Sanctions", "keywords": " iran deal,iran nuclear, iran relations,iran sanctions,iran trade,Ramor Group,Ajily Software Procurement Group,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,executive branch,state department,weapons programs,industrial goods,drones"}, {"content": "In earliest Mesopotamia, the gods walked here and there among ordinary folk. You sensed them as presences, in nature and in certain animals and plants. Everything was potentially its mundane self and the occultation of itself, invested by the divine. As one walks among the 16 ancient objects from the Fertile Crescent in \u201cNoah\u2019s Beasts,\u201d the concentrated little show at the Morgan Library, one begins to understand. The nine sculptures, six cylinder seals and a tablet fragment\u2014many of them highly renowned\u2014are not merely exquisite keyholes on antiquity, not merely sanctified by the passage of centuries, but were crafted by minds habituated to uncovering the sacred in the commonplace.Noah\u2019s Beasts: Sculpted Animals From Ancient MesopotamiaThe Morgan Library & Museum  Through Aug. 27The objects come not only from the Morgan\u2019s own renowned collection but from other top American museums, and all date from roughly 3300 B.C. to 2250 B.C. To bring out his chosen themes, the show\u2019s curator,       Sidney Babcock,        resident expert in Near Eastern antiquity, has pressed out the seals\u2019 images on clay next to several of the objects. He has thereby illustrated various arcs of narrative in humankind\u2019s first steps toward civilization. None of the items\u2019 raw materials, for example, originate in the muddy terrain of Mesopotamia except for clay. We understand that humans, at the dawn of progress, engaged in trade from surprisingly far-flung places: The lapis lazuli in some pieces came from what is now Afghanistan.The first sculpture you encounter upon entry is a six-inch-high kneeling cow figure, made from 15 silver sheets hammered together. Her horns are perfectly curved, her front limbs are extended forward\u2014holding, with her hoofs, a spouted vessel apparently offered to the gods. Everything about her is intentional, subtly humanized and meaningful: her half-pregnant belly, her upright posture and feminine haunch. Dignity and piety emanate from her.Behind her, the display features a seal and its clay impression with the first depiction of a cyclops, a protective one that holds up two slain lions. The curator has launched us quietly on a couple of his narrative arcs: the occult guardianship of agrarian life and humans identifying with animal stories. We are also being introduced to the origins of our oldest myths, from Cyclops to Noah to Aesop and beyond.Nearby sits the preternaturally vivid head of a ewe in sandstone, almost life-size and perhaps the oldest object at over 5,000 years. The accompanying seal shows a childlike design of sheep and stylized rosettes, mythic flowers that denote the fertility goddess Inanna. (The same pattern illustrates the panel that circles the walls above the visitor\u2019s head). Her beneficence bestows beauty and plenty. On the main wall we see the head of a bull and head of a lion, both in aged browning silver with lapis eyes, beside the head of a Markhor goat in copper patina, all dating from the mid-third-millennium. Beneath them is the show\u2019s sole cuneiform tablet, a written fragment of the earliest flood myth featured in the Epic of Atrahasis, predating Noah by millennia yet eerily similar: \u201creject possessions, save all living things\u2026the wild animals\u2026two by two he brought them onboard.\u201dThe last sculpture, the most celebrated, is a gorgeous piece of decorative temple furniture for incense. It features a rearing goat, made of a sophisticated mix of gold, silver, lapis and incised shell, standing against a gold flowering plant. On the seal, a man fights lions as they attack goats. A millennium has passed since the earliest sculpture. Humans shape their world more actively, taking their place in the picture doing the deity\u2019s work. Their art, too, shows signs of competing with the gods for immortality.Mr. Kaylan writes about culture and the arts for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/noahs-beasts-sculpted-animals-from-ancient-mesopotamia-review-everyday-divine-1500394903", "news_title": "\u2018Noah\u2019s Beasts: Sculpted Animals From Ancient Mesopotamia\u2019 Review: Everyday Divine", "keywords": "arts in review, history, morgan library and museum,noah's beasts, religion, sculpted animals from ancient mesopotamia,art,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,history,religion,sciences,humanities,reviews"}, {"content": "Crispin Sartwell\u2019s \u201cLeft or Right? Thoreau Wouldn\u2019t Have Understood the Question\u201d (op-ed, July 12) observes that the traditional, left/right paradigm has no place for political philosopher Henry David Thoreau. The author of \u201cWalden\u201d and \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d is merely the best-known luminary of what political scientists term the \u201cAmerican Anarchist\u201d movement that emerged in this country in the early 19th century (distinguishing it from its mid-19th century counterpart in Russia.)Although \u201canarchy\u201d has now come to be used as a synonym for \u201cchaos,\u201d it originally referred simply to theories of social order in the absence of institutional government. Given that anarchism was the logical extension of the Enlightenment concepts \u201cthat all men are created equal\u201d and \u201cthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\u201d that informed and inspired the American Revolution, it is unsurprising that abolitionism and feminism arose as corollary movements. These were in fact also initially championed by other notable, albeit less renowned, anarchist polemicists.The confusion of the left/right spectrum that incomprehensibly consigns 20th-century dictators Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to its opposite ends derives from the fact that it is based merely on an assessment of positions on various policy issues instead of, as libertarian theorist David Nolan suggests, calibrating both issues and political systems according to the spheres of decision-making properly belonging to the individual versus the collective will (the latter, of course, being enforced on all of society at gunpoint by its leaders).Tim O\u2019BrienImlay City, Mich.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thoreau-best-fits-with-libertarian-ideas-1500394620", "news_title": "Thoreau Best Fits With Libertarian Ideas", "keywords": "philosophy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,letters,routine general news"}, {"content": "American corporations have painted themselves into a corner by holding off on pay raises (\u201cJobs Grow, but Wages Stay Stuck,\u201d page one, July 8).

Equally surprising is the rebound in manufacturing sentiment. The Caixin purchasing managers index for June edged above 50 into expansionary territory last week.The recent resurgence is likely more than a temporary blip. In part it reflects better global demand for Chinese products. But it\u2019s also the result of longer-term shifts in China\u2019s manufacturing landscape that will increase productivity.Chinese industrialists began to move production to poorer interior regions, away from the more developed coastal cities, in the early 2000s. This process, known as industrial transfer, is now in full swing. It encompasses not only the physical relocation of factories, but also investment in inland businesses, creation of new distribution chains and so forth.One example is Li-Ning, a privately owned athletics-goods company founded by former Chinese Olympian Li Ning in Guangdong province. In 2008, Li-Ning invested 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion) in a large production facility in Hubei province\u2019s Jingmen city. The factory produces 30 million pairs of shoes and 67 million athletic suits annually, most of which are sold to Chinese consumers.Industrial transfer is hard to measure because, unlike industrial output, it is dynamic and multifaceted. Even officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s top economic-planning agency, acknowledge that they lack systematic measures of the migration.One commonly used estimate of industrial transfer is interprovince investment, a term that first appeared in some provincial-government reports in the 2000s. It is a novelty compared to foreign direct investment, which has been recorded in Chinese statistics since the 1980s.The scale of interprovince investment is impressive. In 2015, the value in five central provinces alone\u2014Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi\u2014was 2.5 times that of FDI throughout China. In 2011, Hubei received 333 investment projects from the coast, of which 70% were in manufacturing.Industrial transfer injects new growth opportunities into poor inland regions, but it also frees up resources for high-end manufacturing and services on the coast. Chinese policy makers term this dual structural shift \u201cemptying the cage to change the bird.\u201dBut Beijing didn\u2019t predict, let alone plan, this wave of industrial migration. It occurred spontaneously among coastal producers, primarily in the private sector and in response to market pressures.During the 2000s, labor and land costs rapidly rose and local governments stiffened environmental regulations, killing the profits of low-end manufacturers. Some headed overseas, while others moved inland. In central China, labor costs are less than a quarter of those in Shanghai, and enforcement of regulations is also lax.China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, reacted belatedly to the bottom-up surge of industrial transfer, making it a top priority in 2010. Earlier policies of regional development centered only on providing financial assistance to and building infrastructure in the poor interior. After 2010, the leadership actively encouraged industrial transfer, primarily by creating \u201cspecial recipient zones\u201d throughout central China. These enjoy preferential policies similar to the special economic zones on the coast.As a result, central and western provinces are now in the midst of an \u201cinvestment frenzy.\u201d Belatedly mimicking the practices of coastal governments in the 1980s and 1990s, inland governments are mobilizing their civil servants to attract domestic investors using attractive benefits.Li-Ning, the sporting goods company, was fiercely courted by several competing cities. It ultimately chose Jingmen for its \u201cdedicated services.\u201d The Jingmen government took care of the company\u2019s every need, from land and labor supply to electricity.If the interior takes over low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing while the coast advances technologically, China will command both the low and high ends of production within a single market. That would give it a formidable competitive advantage.Yet China\u2019s process of industrial transfer faces some obstacles. Coastal investors run into corruption and weak property rights in inland locations. Large companies like Li-Ning fare well but smaller ones falter. Environmentalists worry whether pollution will migrate from rich to poor regions. While labor costs are lower in the interior, they too are rising.Nevertheless, China\u2019s manufacturing landscape is undergoing a sea change. Domestic investors are eclipsing foreign ones. Domestic consumption is surpassing exports. Supply chains are being remade. The regional shifts in manufacturing may allow China to grow faster for longer than many analysts thought possible.Ms. Ang is associate professor of political science at the University of Michigan.

If the CFPB goes forward with this rule, it will leave the field to unregulated and unscrupulous lenders and will cut off an important source of credit for more than 20 million Americans.Congress has the power to overturn these nonfact-based, ideologically driven CFPB rules and needs to do so.Dennis ShaulCEO, Community Financial Services Association of AmericaAlexandria, Va.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-should-throttle-unjustified-cfpb-rules-1500394534", "news_title": "Congress Should Throttle Unjustified CFPB Rules", "keywords": "regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,letters,routine general news"}, {"content": "Regarding Peggy Noonan\u2019s \u201cA Pope and a President in Poland\u201d (Declarations, July 8): Have you noticed that many in the U.S. media are treating President Trump\u2019s speech in Poland the way the communist government\u2019s media treated Pope John Paul II\u2019s famous words in 1979 Poland?

About 20 or 30 teens would get together at a friend\u2019s house, when parents were out, and dance to records.Most of the dancing was slow. Sofie was a friend who lived a few blocks from me, and we had grown up together. At these parties, we often paired up to dance.\u201cOnly You\u201d was a big party record. The title song opens with a measure of bluesy electric guitar chords followed by a one-beat pause.

The rest of the group sang harmony.The song had come out in the States in 1955, but we didn\u2019t know that at the time, nor did we care. For us, it was a timeless song by a man singing openly about love and devotion.As the years went on, many of us from the parties continued to see each other regularly. Sofie and I entered military service at about the same time, though we served in different units. We also were at the Hebrew University together.At some point, Sofie and I took a trip together to the Dead Sea and went from being friends to being a couple. In 1968, we married.At home today in the States, I still have a CD of the Platters.

The regulation, long contested by business groups, forces firms to hire an auditor to review their internal controls designed to insure quality accounting. Mr. Farley\u2019s comments also show how Wall Street is leveraging Washington\u2019s renewed interest in deregulation to revive old laments over the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law, which expanded the power of corporate boards and enhanced criminal penalties for CEOs and CFOs that signed off on fraudulent accounting statements filed with the SEC.The growing call from business groups to scale back the rule comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s new chairman,       Jay Clayton,        is crafting an agenda stressing deregulation and meant to encourage more smaller companies to go public. A bill passed by the House last month would broaden an exemption from the auditor rule that is currently available to firms with less than $1 billion in annual revenue.It \u201cput such a great cost on corporate America, and the benefits are not entirely clear,\u201d Mr. Farley said at a hearing of a panel of the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cThe data doesn\u2019t show clearly that we have reduced fraud or greatly inspired confidence. But what is clear is we have far fewer public companies.\u201dMr. Clayton has said the drop in initial public offerings means retail investors have fewer good investment opportunities, as the fastest-growing startups increasingly seek capital from private investors. SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar, a Republican, called yesterday for exempting more companies from the Sarbanes-Oxley provision.Mr. Clayton\u2019s hasn\u2019t revealed his views on the future of the auditor rule.Jay Brown, a securities law professor at the University of Denver, told lawmakers that repealing or watering down the rule would have bad consequences for investors. \u201cIt better insures the accuracy of financial statements,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnd it benefits officers because they make better decisions when they understand the finances of their own company.\u201dWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 12:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyse-backs-rollback-of-enron-era-rule-meant-to-boost-accounting-quality-1500394097", "news_title": "NYSE Backs Rollback of Enron-era Rule Meant to Boost Accounting Quality ", "keywords": "deregulation,enron era,executives,financial regulation,finreg,house committee,repeal,sarbanes oxley,sec,securities and exchange,Securities and Exchange Commission,Tom Farley,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,securities fraud,electricity,gas utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Goldman Sachs        GS -0.20%       is starting to lose its Wall Street halo, and it isn\u2019t clear what the bank intends to do about it.For the second straight quarter, the bank dramatically underperformed its peers in fixed income, currency and commodities trading. Revenue in this segment fell by 40% from a year earlier in the three months through June.The main reason appears to be Goldman\u2019s large footprint in commodities. Volatility was particularly low for commodity prices in the second quarter, so analysts already expected Goldman to post a weak trading result.Still, the contrast with other banks is striking. In the same quarter,             Citigroup,Bank of America                   and J.P. Morgan Chase saw declines of 6% to 19% in comparable businesses.Also for the second quarter in a row, Goldman acknowledged that poor execution in commodities trading played a role. \u201cWe didn\u2019t navigate the market as well as we aspire to, or as well as we have in the past,\u201d chief financial officer       Martin Chavez       said on a conference call.He also granted that Goldman\u2019s unique client base contributed to its relative underperformance. Universal banks such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase do more trading for corporate clients, providing a steady flow of business. Goldman specializes more in serving hedge funds and other active investors, meaning volumes can fall off more quickly when speculative appetite recedes.However, when pressed by analysts on how Goldman might improve execution or customer mix, Mr. Chavez didn\u2019t offer anything concrete\u2014just vague assurances that Goldman is looking to fill in client gaps, serve existing clients better and learn from what has worked in other units such as equities.Goldman still managed to beat analyst estimates for the quarter, thanks to a strong performance in its opaque investing and lending unit. This was largely due to big increases in the value of venture startups and other companies in which Goldman holds equity stakes. But the lack of transparency in this unit means investors can\u2019t count on this strong performance being repeated in future quarters.Goldman\u2019s shares have been basically flat over the last three months, compared with a rise of around 6% in the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.

Finance Chief       Dominic Caruso       said sales have held up well against a biosimilar from             Pfizer Inc.,       and that most of the drop was due to a tough comparison in the previous year\u2019s quarter, when J&J recorded a positive gain for rebates on Remicade and other drugs.J&J attributed a $342 million drop in its pharmaceutical sales in the quarter to the same positive gain last year.Sales of diabetes drug Invokana, another key J&J product, plunged 23% to $295 million in the quarter.

And it is indeed held in Britain. Royal Birkdale, in the seaside town of Southport, England, is this year\u2019s host. But they are adamantly opposed to the use of the term British Open, and have launched a serious campaign to eradicate it from the American sports lexicon.Their tournament is the Open Championship, they say, or simply the Open. The R&A, the governing body that oversees the event, views the two names as interchangeable. The only improper name for it is the one most Americans use for it.\u201cIt\u2019s an education process we\u2019ve embarked on,\u201d said Malcolm Booth, the R&A\u2019s director of sales and marketing.To win the broadcast rights beginning in 2016, NBC Sports had to agree as part of the contract that it would refer to the tournament strictly as the Open or the Open Championship. NBC, in turn, has instructed announcers not to use the phrase \u201cBritish Open\u201d on the air.But Johnny Miller, the longtime NBC analyst and 1976 Open champion, has had to correct himself repeatedly. \u201cI have trouble with it,\u201d he said.Getting other networks to follow suit has been even more difficult. Moments before play-by-play voice Dan Hicks made a recent promotional appearance on CNBC, an NBC Sports publicist reminded the anchors of the tournament\u2019s proper name.When the cameras went on, Hicks said, \u201cFirst thing out of their mouth: \u2018The British Open is coming our way!\u2019 \u201d The publicist sighed, \u201cOh, the R&A is not going to be happy about this.\u201dLikewise, the R&A last year appealed to American print media outlets in the hope that a change in the published name for it will prompt stateside fans to use the proper reference. But most U.S. news organizations continue to call it the British Open, as has been their custom for more than a century.Players who qualify for the tournament receive a placard in the mail that emphasizes its singular place in golf. \u201cWelcome to The Open,\u201d it reads in large, bold lettering. The bottom of the card reads: \u201cThe One. The Open.\u201dBut players compete in many opens, from the U.S. Open to the Houston Open to the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. For clarity\u2019s sake, some still use the B word for this one.\u201cWe all fall into that trap,\u201d said Ernie Els, a two-time Open champion. Speaking to a small group of reporters after the final round of last month\u2019s U.S. Open, Els confessed, \u201cI do call it the British Open, but\u2026\u201dA British journalist standing nearby interjected: \u201cBooo!\u201dThe R&A is quick to note that, while the tournament is held annually in Britain, it is a global event. Qualifying tournaments this year were held in nine countries spread across five continents. But much of the pride Britons take in the proper name comes from the fact that their Open was the first.Before 1860, golf at the highest level was a competition between private clubs rather than individuals, said Tony Parker, historian at the World Golf Hall of Fame. The start of the Open Championship in 1860\u2014at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland\u2014wasn\u2019t just a new tournament. It was the birth of modern golf competition.\u201cThere are some jingoistic Americans that say, \u2018Well, we would have done it, but we had a Civil War,\u2019 \u201d Parker said. \u201cWell, yeah, but we did have a Civil War, and that kept golf off the playing field for a while.\u201dThe first U.S. Open was played in 1895. Officially, the Open Championship retained its name. But by 1903, Parker said, American newspapers were calling it the British Open. That has been the popular name for it in the U.S. ever since.The British media requires no education: it has long used the proper name, both in print and on the airwaves. But the influence of American media has created some confusion about the name in other countries where the R&A does business.Alastair Johnston, the longtime IMG executive who has represented the R&A in media rights, licensing and sponsorships since the 1990s, said the B word has complicated some licensing negotiations in Asia.\u201cBusiness partners in Japan are saying, \u2018Please call it the British Open because it will mean more to people here,\u2019 \u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to give them the name that they want.\u201dFor the R&A, it is a circular problem: Because most people in the U.S. know it as the British Open, even those who know better still call it the British Open, which only adds to the popular notion that it is the British Open.American Stewart Cink, the 2009 Open champion, said that whenever he is in Britain, he refers to it strictly as the Open. But if he is talking to someone in the U.S., he calls it the British Open.\u201cThe whole idea when you\u2019re talking is for communication,\u201d Cink said. \u201cPeople in America don\u2019t know what the Open is.\u201dBooth said the R&A has seen progress, both among players and fans, in part because of the influence of its social media channels. The previous broadcast partner, ESPN, was also contractually obliged to use the proper name, Johnston said. A native Scotsman, Johnston added that he does not have to correct Americans in conversation quite as often as he used to.But there remains some confusion both in the U.S. and abroad. Contrary to what the R&A said, Englishman Nick Faldo, a three-time Open champion, said it is no longer correct to call it the Open Championship.\u201cNow it\u2019s \u2018The Open,\u2019 \u201d Faldo said. \u201cIn another five years, it will just be called \u2018The.\u2019 \u201dWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'The Open Takes Place in Britain\u2014but Don\u2019t Call It the British Open.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 11:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-open-is-in-britain-but-dont-call-it-the-british-1500376574", "news_title": "Dear American Twits: This Golf Event\u2019s Proper Name Is \u2018The Open\u2019", "keywords": "british,british open,golf,royal birkdale,the british,the open ,the open championship,Alastair Johnston,Malcolm Booth,sports,page-one stories,routine general news"}, {"content": "It\u2019s great to have a friend on your team at work\u2014unless your friend isn\u2019t pulling his weight.It may not feel like your place to tell a friend to work harder, but ratting him out to the boss isn\u2019t very appealing, either. Walking the line between being a good friend and a good employee requires figuring out whether your friend is likely to listen to any critique you give, and if so, delivering the message in a kind but firm way.Tattling on a teammate can backfire.

Rubin,        a management professor at DePaul University.

More than 95% of Plex employees give the process high ratings, he says.Friends may be more able than others to deliver criticism kindly.

Facing the performance problems early, before their boss got wind of them, motivated his friend to move to a job that was a better fit before he damaged his track record.Workplace friendships are linked to improved job performance, but coping with role conflicts, misunderstandings and disagreements with friends on the job can be emotionally draining, says a 2016 study in the journal Personnel Psychology. If conflicts over serious ethical or legal issues arise and can\u2019t be resolved by talking it over, it\u2019s best to end the friendship, says       Eileen Habelow,        managing partner of Learning-Link, a Cambridge, Mass., corporate-training firm.Bosses should get involved if an employee\u2019s behavior crosses legal or ethical boundaries, or if a friend\u2019s performance continues to cause problems after repeated attempts by teammates to help.It\u2019s wise to figure out before raising performance problems whether your friend is likely to listen, says       Tasha Eurich,        a Denver organizational psychologist and author of \u201cInsight,\u201d a book on self-awareness. If your friend thinks she\u2019s already nearly perfect and belittles others who give her feedback, she\u2019s not likely to pay much attention, Dr. Eurich says. If she knows she\u2019s performing poorly but doesn\u2019t care, you\u2019ll have to persuade her that she\u2019s actually causing problems for herself or others.What to do when a poor performer on your team is also your friend:It\u2019s more likely that your friend is open to change but doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s needed, Dr. Eurich says. One way to start the conversation is to wait for an opening. If your friend expresses disappointment about a performance review, ask if it would be OK to share your thoughts, then describe problem behaviors you\u2019ve seen.Another option is to open with a question, Dr. Rubin says, such as, \u201cI noticed that you missed a major deadline, which isn\u2019t like you. Is everything OK?\u201dAvoid throwing around labels. Declaring that your friend has a poor work ethic or is too aggressive will only put him on the defensive, says       Dana Brownlee,        an Atlanta corporate trainer. Cite specific behaviors, such as leaving early during rush periods or raising his voice repeatedly.Tap your understanding of your friend\u2019s goals and values to lend context. Say, \u201cI know you want to be seen as a team player, and I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve stopped helping out less-experienced colleagues.\u201dFinally, affirm your support for your friend and ask how you can help.Human-resources executive Eileen Timmins of Chicago was in a bind when a teammate years ago procrastinated on his part of a deadline project. To avoid complaining to their boss, she researched his role and completed part of his work herself, so she could meet her deadline. Her friend was grateful, she says, and they later agreed on some tactics to help him finish tasks on time, such as having her set deadline reminders on his calendar. Her friend\u2019s performance soon improved.Q: I enjoyed your profile of the master networker. He mentioned starting conversations by asking a friendly question. Could you give some examples?\u2014N.B.A: Try to approach new people with a smile, enthusiasm and warmth, and draw ideas from the context. Ask, \u201cWhat did you think of the point made by that last speaker?\u201d Show curiosity about the person by asking, \u201cWhat other kinds of events do you go to?\u201d or, \u201cWhat brings you here tonight?\u201d If the person wants to meet another attendee you know, offer to introduce them.Some people offer cues to their interests via fashion items, or hats or bags with sports or organizational logos. Take note, compliment them if you can do so honestly and ask them about it. Comments about the food can be engaging too.Openers to avoid: Predictable observations about the weather, and, \u201cSo, do you come here often?\u201d or, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d If all else fails, a friendly \u201cHi, nice to meet you,\u201d can work just fine.Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 11:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-your-work-pal-is-the-office-laggard-1500392014", "news_title": "When Your Work Pal Is the Office Laggard", "keywords": "bosses,co-workers,friends at work,management,office politics,ratting out,tattling,teams,unit,work politics,work-life balance,political,general news,general labor issues,living,lifestyle,human resources consulting,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,business consultancy"}, {"content": "Bank of America Corp.        BAC 0.67%       said its second-quarter profit climbed 10% as the bank continued to pocket gains from Federal Reserve rate hikes.Quarterly profit at the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank was $5.27 billion, compared with $4.78 billion a year ago. Per share, earnings of 46 cents beat the 43 cents a share that analysts expected.Second-quarter revenue was $22.83 billion, up from $21.29 billion a year ago. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $23.07 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of $21.78 billion.Bank of America\u2019s large base of U.S. deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities makes it particularly poised to benefit from an uptick in interest rates, which recently started rising after years of record lows. But declining long-term bond yields and other factors meant that the second quarter was a mixed bag for net interest income, a key measure of lending profits.On one hand, net interest income rose 8.6% from the year-ago period to $10.99 billion. The lender was able to keep most of the benefit from rising short-term rates because it hasn\u2019t faced competitive pressure to increase deposit rates for customers.The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, which influence the rate the bank earns on loans and securities, twice so far in 2017. But the rate the bank paid on U.S. interest-bearing deposits has barely budged: it stood at 0.11% in the second quarter, compared with 0.09% in the prior quarter.The rates the bank is paying depositors are \u201camazingly low,\u201d said Glenn Schorr, a bank analyst at Evercore ISI. Analysts have attributed depositors\u2019 reluctance to chase higher yields at other banks to a variety of factors including the convenience of BofA\u2019s large branch network and digital capabilities.But when compared with the first quarter of 2017, the bank\u2019s net interest income metric was less impressive. The metric, which Bank of America initially said would rise about $150 million, fell by $72 million. In May, the lender said the sale of a business and a reversal in long-term bond yields would eliminate most of that projected gain.On Tuesday, bank executives said they expected net-interest income to rise in the third quarter from the second quarter. But they declined to specify by how much. \u201cI think we want to get out of the game of putting size parameters on it,\u201d said       Paul Donofrio,        the bank\u2019s chief financial officer.Shares moved 1.5% lower in morning trading, sharper than the fall in the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index but less dramatic than the 2.4% decline in shares of             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       which also reported earnings Tuesday.Still, Bank of America shares are up more than 40% since the November election. The initial share-price gains after Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory have been sustained as the lighter regulatory touch investors hoped for has started to materialize. In late June, Bank of America got Federal Reserve approval for a large increase in its dividend and stock buybacks.The lender, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, faced challenges in the second quarter. Trading revenue at Bank of America, excluding an accounting adjustment, fell 9% to $3.37 billion from $3.7 billion in the second quarter of last year. The drop was, however, less than some analysts predicted. Similar factors weighed on earnings reports from             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. and other big lenders that reported their earnings on Friday.Loans at the bank were up 1.5% from a year earlier. Loan growth has slowed down across the banking industry, though there\u2019s debate about whether that has been caused by borrower reluctance or lenders hoarding capital to meet regulatory requirements.Quarterly expenses rose 1.7% to $13.73 billion, from $13.49 billion a year ago. Chief Executive       Brian Moynihan       has made cost cutting a key tenet of his business strategy, and last year he promised to cut another $5 billion in annual expenses by 2018.Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Higher Rates Benefit BofA.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 11:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-america-results-beat-expectations-1500375040", "news_title": "Bank of America Results Get Boost From Higher Rates", "keywords": " 2q earnings, bank earnings,bank of america earnings, bank profit, brian moynihan, deposits, earnings season, interest rates, lending, second-quarter earnings, trading,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Donald Trump,Glenn Schorr,Paul Donofrio,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "UnitedHealth Group Inc.        UNH 1.25%       reported profit growth in the second quarter and raised its projections for the year, fueled by its Optum health-services arm, which highlighted the company\u2019s ongoing expansion of its role as a health-care provider and data-analysis shop.The biggest U.S. insurer has almost completely exited the Affordable Care Act marketplaces this year, which created a drag on revenue but also reduced pressure on UnitedHealth\u2019s earnings, as the company\u2019s net margin rose to 4.6% from 3.8% a year earlier.That decision reduces the company\u2019s immediate exposure to the ongoing uncertainty in Washington. Republicans\u2019 efforts to pass a broad health overhaul bill through the Senate ran into potentially fatal resistance from Republican Senators Monday night, and Republicans said they would consider moving to repeal the ACA, with the shift taking effect in two years. Like other insurers, UnitedHealth may next year face the resumption of an ACA tax that is currently under a moratorium and had been expected to be repealed if Republican health-overhaul legislation passed.During a call with analysts, UnitedHealth Chief Executive       Stephen J. Hemsley       generally steered clear of discussing the legislative state of play, referring briefly to uncertainty around national and state policy as a headwind for 2018 and declining to speculate about next steps. He also reiterated the company\u2019s opposition to the health-insurance tax, which he said was a specific headwind for next year and which he said would, if not canceled, \u201cfurther destabilize the market, which is already fragile.\u201dWhile UnitedHealth didn\u2019t offer specifics about its 2018 outlook, Mr. Hemsley offered broadly optimistic comments about the company\u2019s growth prospects.UnitedHealth on Tuesday raised its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance for the year to between $9.75 and $9.90, from between $9.65 and $9.85 previously.Revenue rose 7.7% to $50.05 billion, slowed by withdrawals from ACA individual markets, combined with the 2017 ACA health-insurance-tax deferral. Revenue from the Medicare business rose 17% to $16.7 billion. Optum\u2019s growth was tied to its OptumRx pharmacy-benefit management unit and its OptumCare ambulatory-care business, among other factors.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $50.06 billion in revenue.UnitedHealth once again highlighted its rapidly growing footprint as a health-care provider, which was underscored by the recent acquisition of Surgical Care Affiliates Inc. The company said that Surgical Care Affiliates started a half-dozen new outpatient facilities so far this year, while its MedExpress urgent-care unit added 20 new clinics and it took over two new physician practices. UnitedHealth said it feels it is in the \u201cearly stages\u201d of major expansion in its health-care provider business.Optum overall saw earnings from operations grow 21% to $1.5 billion.On the insurance side, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s medical-loss ratio\u2014the percentage of premiums paid in claims\u2014increased less than some analysts had projected, as the health-insurance tax deferral was offset by an improved business mix, product performance and favorable reserve development. It rose by 20 basis points year-over-year to 82.2%.The Minnetonka, Minn.-based company recorded a profit of $2.28 billion, or $2.46 a share, compared with $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year ago. Excluding certain items, UnitedHealth earned $2.32 a share, compared with $1.96 a year ago. Analysts had anticipated the company reporting a profit of $2.23 a share.Shares in UnitedHealth, up 32% from a year ago, edged down 0.9% on Tuesday.Correction to UnitedHealth story   Optum is UnitedHealth\u2019s health-services arm. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the unit was UnitedHealth\u2019s health-benefits platform.

He is the author of \u201cThe Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food\u201d (Penguin). He spoke with Marc Myers.When I was little, I didn\u2019t like mixing the fruit at the bottom of yogurt containers. I only wanted the jelly. So I choked down the plain yogurt as fast as I could. I never thought to just remove it. I had to pay my dues.I grew up in an apartment building on 96th Street off Madison Avenue in Manhattan. My father, Fred Lee, was a businessman who worked in the toy industry.We lived on the fourth floor in a two-bedroom apartment with a maid\u2019s room. My half-sister, Carolyn, from my mother\u2019s first marriage, was 12 years older than me. She had the maid\u2019s room. My older brother, David, and I shared a bedroom.I don\u2019t have many memories of my mother, Joan. She died of breast cancer when I was 4. She hated to be photographed, so I don\u2019t have many images of her, either.From the time I was little, my father took David and me to spend our summer vacations at my maternal grandmother\u2019s farm in Great Barrington, Mass. In my teens, I went there to work the farm.Ann, as my grandmother liked to be called by us, didn\u2019t talk much about my mom. No one in my family really did. Back then cancer was taboo. Which is why the Berkshires took on a certain importance for me and the rest of my family.Ann liked to tell the story of how she came to own the farm. She had married a wealthy guy who started Strauss pens. At the time, they lived in Great Barrington, and Ann loved heading off to climb a hill a short distance from their house. At the top was a panoramic view of southern Berkshire County along with a dairy farm known locally as Blue Hill Farm. Two brothers ran the farm, which had been in their family for generations.\u2018The Berkshires took on a certain importance for me and the rest of my family.\u2019Ann said she occasionally asked them if they\u2019d be willing to sell. They always laughed politely, which meant \u201cnot a chance.\u201d Then one day, up on the hill, Ann was approached by one of the brothers.He said he had a terrible fight with his brother and that if she still wanted to buy the farm, they\u2019d sell it to her that day. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll wind up killing each other.\u201dAnn bought the 700 acres on the spot. She didn\u2019t even know where the property began and ended, just that it was special.Years later, she and her husband divorced. My sense is she didn\u2019t get much in the settlement, but she had the farm.When I worked up there in my teens, Ann\u2019s farm had a huge vegetable garden that someone tended for her. She also had pasture and 40 head of grazing cattle that belonged to a neighbor.The family inherited the farm when Ann died in 1982.After high school, I studied political science and English at Tufts University. But when I graduated in \u201992, I was lost. So I headed to Los Angeles to bake bread at a well-known bakery. I had this hair-brained idea that I\u2019d bake at night and write the great American novel during the day. One evening I forgot to salt 1,200 pounds of rosemary dough and was fired.Over the next decade, I worked in kitchens in France, California and New York. For the most part, I was thinking of that time as researching material for my writing.By then I was living in Greenwich Village and cooking at various restaurants. From time to time, I visited a restaurant in an old brownstone. One day, I asked the owner if he might want to sell. He\u2019d always laugh, saying the place was his dream. Then one day he said, \u201cI\u2019m selling.\u201d It was as if I was re-living Ann\u2019s experience.Together with my brother, David, and sister-in-law, Laureen, we decided to take it over. Laureen had the idea to name the new place Blue Hill as an ode to Ann\u2019s farm. The year we opened, David Rockefeller came in to eat. He enjoyed his meal, but more than that I think he was impressed that the restaurant was a family business with ties to a farm. As a boy, he had to milk cows before church on Sundays with his brothers and sisters at their estate in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. His family wanted them to be connected to the land.In 2004, Mr. Rockefeller invited us to open a restaurant in the stone milk barns on his family\u2019s estate. We soon opened Blue Hill at Stone Barns.Today, my wife, Aria, and I live with our two daughters in a brownstone in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. We visit Ann\u2019s farm when we can. The cows provide much of the dairy for our restaurants.Recently, I was at the farm with my daughter, Edith, when the landscape and late-afternoon light caught me.

CoverWallet, launched last year by technology entrepreneurs, focuses largely on the market of online issuance of policies and related services to small businesses. Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed.Historically, many large insurers avoided small businesses because of the costs of dealing with them individually. But quantitative analysis is changing that and suddenly a lot of big-name insurers want to sell to local retailers, coffee shops, contractors and other small businesses. These firms believe that algorithms\u2014which are sets of rules for powering calculations\u2014work well for the standardized policies used by many small business.\u201cChange is inevitable,\u201d Mr. Greenberg, 92 years old, said in an interview. \u201cThere is no stopping that.\u201dLast year, $1.7 billion was invested in 179 \u201cinsure tech\u201d deals of various sorts, according to CB Insights, a firm with a venture-capital database.Entrepreneurs with engineering and other computer-related backgrounds say the insurance industry is particularly ripe for innovation because of its heavy reliance on traditional ways of doing business even as consumers increasingly favor online financial transactions.Because of advances in computer analytics, scientists can feed millions of data points into computers to find patterns. In general, algorithms can draw on publicly available data such as construction features of a business\u2019s premises, proximity to fire hydrants and code violations.James Ermilio, CoverWallet\u2019s president of insurance, said the firm\u2019s goal is using \u201cdata analytics, data science and predictive modeling to make it easy for small businesses to understand, buy and manage their insurance.\u201d Large sets of data, cloud computing and sophisticated algorithms operate behind the scenes, while the firm\u2019s services are available to customers around the clock online and through smartphones, CoverWallet said.CoverWallet previously raised about\u00a0$10 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures and Two Sigma Investments\u2019\u00a0Two Sigma Ventures division.Among other insurers using predictive analysis to issue policies to small businesses is             American International Group Inc.,       which Mr. Greenberg used to run. Last year, AIG entered a joint venture with Two Sigma, a hedge fund that is a leader in quantitative analysis.In earlier moves,             Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.       began biBerk to sell property and liability policies to small businesses.

Skyscrapers bankrolled by Saudi, Kuwaiti and Qatari investments tower over the Blue and White Nile rivers that converge here. One recently developed business and residential district is called Riyadh.Osama Abdellatif,        the country\u2019s most prominent tycoon, built a desert conglomerate that employs 8,500 people, working mostly with Middle Eastern banks and selling to the Gulf\u2019s wealthy consumers.\u201cThe impact of these sanctions on our business has been extreme, the biggest problem being banking,\u201d said Mr. Abdellatif, at his sprawling DAL Group compound, where state-of-the-art German and Swiss machines churn out thousands of bottles of Coca-Cola, packs of flour and cartons of milk a day. \u201cBanks are extremely scared of doing business here,\u201d he added.A $8.9 billion fine against French lender             BNP Paribas                   in 2015 after it admitted violating sanctions, sent a chilling message to major financial institutions.

Bush       as well as Congress in response to worsening fighting in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region.Even if the U.S. lifts sanctions in October, Sudan\u2019s crippled economy will take many years to recover.As part of a separate set of sanctions that aren\u2019t under review, the U.S. is blocking debt relief. Sudan owes more than $55 billion to external lenders, about half its economic output, the IMF says.Unless Washington reverses that policy, Khartoum can\u2019t apply for debt forgiveness, even though it technically qualifies under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries program that relieved several sub-Saharan African nations from crippling debts in the 1990s.For now, businesses in sweltering Sudan must wait to come in from the cold.After the U.S. delayed its decision last Wednesday, the dollar jumped 10% on the black market, said currency traders, as they tried to fan away the heat with wads of notes.\u201cSudanese love to buy new technology, they want to be part of all fashions,\u201d said       Ahmed Murad,        whose market stall sells knockoff Chanel T-shirts emblazoned with the misspelt \u201cCHANNEL.\u201d \u201cWhen the sanctions go, I\u2019ll get the real stuff and open a boutique,\u201d he said.Write to Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'In the Face of Sanctions, Sudan Gets Down to Business.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 10:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sudan-gets-down-to-business-in-the-face-of-sanctions-and-strife-1500382800", "news_title": "Sudan Gets Down to Business in the Face of Sanctions and Strife", "keywords": "africa,economy,omar al-bashir,sanctions,sudan,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "Gold prices advanced Tuesday as the U.S. dollar slumped after Senate Republicans abandoned their effort to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act Monday night.Gold for August delivery was recently up 0.5% at $1,239.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.The failure to replace former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature health law left the market questioning whether other promises from President       Donald Trump       will be achievable.That pressured the dollar and helped lift gold, a traditional haven commodity in times of political uncertainty, said       Eugen Weinberg,        head of commodity research at             Commerzbank.Mr. Trump\u2019s other campaign goals, including infrastructure projects and tax reform, \u201care likely to get more resistance,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, was down 0.6% to 86.86.

That push began around midday and lasted into the evening.The Trump administration has been reviewing the Iran deal for several months. President Donald Trump has attacked the agreement, reached in 2015, as a \u201cterrible deal\u201d for the U.S.Despite the certification, the Trump administration will disclose on Tuesday that it is leveling additional sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and other behavior it considers destabilizing, senior administration officials said.\u201cIran is unquestionably in default of the spirit of the of the JCPOA,\u201d a senior administration official said Monday evening, using an acronym to refer to the nuclear deal.The official said the administration intends to pursue a strategy \u201cthat will address the totality of Iran\u2019s malign behavior and not narrowly focus\u201d on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.A second administration official said the U.S. will be \u201cworking with allies to build a case for serious flaws in agreement, while also at the same time looking for ways to more strictly enforce the deal.\u201dOfficials said they intend to make sure Iran is complying with a \u201cstricter interpretation\u201d of the deal than that of the Obama administration.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, speaking in New York on Monday, said the Trump administration was sending contradictory signals and Iran doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhich to interpret in what way.\u201dSpeaking at the Council on Foreign Relations after traveling to the U.S. for a conference at the United Nations this week, he said the accord wasn\u2019t an Iran-U.S. deal but a multilateral agreement and Iran had built trust by implementing its side of the bargain.Mr. Zarif was restrained in his criticism of the Trump administration, while saying additional U.S. sanctions were a violation of the deal. He said the U.S. hasn\u2019t done enough to lift sanctions or given a clear answer to businesses that want to invest in Iran.The Trump administration is particularly concerned about Iran\u2019s ballistic missile development, support for what the U.S. considers terrorist groups, support of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       and the arbitrary detention of American citizens, officials said.Over the weekend, Iran sentenced American academic Xiyue Wang to 10 years in prison on spying charges, the latest in a series of cases against foreigners. There are several other Americans in Iranian custody.A State Department official said Monday the \u201callegations against Mr. Wang are baseless, and we call on the Iranian government to release him immediately so he can be reunited with his family.\u201dMr. Zarif defended the sentence, saying Iran\u2019s judiciary is independent and it must have found evidence of spying to sentence Mr. Wang.Trump administration officials are skeptical about the 2015 agreement because it only addresses nuclear issues. Obama administration officials have defended that approach, saying Iran would be a greater threat if it possessed nuclear weapons.The Trump administration faced a Monday congressional deadline to assess whether Tehran is complying with the terms of the accord, which requires Iran to significantly scale back its nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief. The deadline occurs every three months.Monday\u2019s decision came after hours of talks at the White House involving Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       and other officials. Mr. Tillerson backed recertification, while others, including White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, advocated that Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t sign off on compliance.The people familiar with the deliberations said the Trump administration was considering not certifying Iran\u2019s compliance but keeping sanctions relief in place.Mr. Tillerson last certified compliance in April, but said then that the Trump administration was weighing whether to continue easing sanctions as required by the deal, citing Iran\u2019s support for organizations considered by the U.S. to be terrorist groups.European officials are becoming more wary about the Trump administration\u2019s policy review and fear it could undermine the agreement by curbing the economic benefits meant to ensure Iranian compliance.Obama administration officials, including former Secretary of State       John Kerry,        encouraged European banks and other companies to do business with Iran to ensure it received economic benefits promised by the deal. In contrast, Mr. Tillerson hasn\u2019t spoken with his Iranian counterpart and the Trump administration has transmitted a greater sense of uncertainty about the business climate in Iran.Mr. Zarif said Monday that while he has had no contact with Mr. Tillerson, future interactions are possible.European diplomats worry that if the U.S. commitment remains uncertain, Iran may respond by attempting limited violations of the nuclear deal.Mark Dubowitz, chief executive officer of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and an opponent of the deal, said the administration\u2019s statement Monday could forecast tougher measures.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a temporary waive and slap strategy, where the administration will waive certain sanctions while slapping on additional measures, but no one should expect this to be an ongoing strategy for much longer,\u201d Mr. Dubowitz said.\u2014Farnaz Fassihi contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Says Iran Is Complying With Deal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 10:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-again-certifies-iran-is-complying-with-nuclear-deal-1500346585", "news_title": "Trump Administration Again Certifies Iran Is Complying With Nuclear Deal", "keywords": "bashar al-assad ,donald trump ,iran certification nuclear deal ,iran nuclear deal ,rex tillerson ,steve bannon,syria ,trump administration ,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,weapons programs"}, {"content": "It pays to take an internship\u2014but not a lot.Average pay for college interns climbed to $18.06 per hour this year, but that is less than their predecessors earned in 2010, when wages are adjusted for inflation, according to a survey of paid positions released earlier this month from the National Association of Colleges and Employers.With competition for entry-level labor increasing, economists offer multiple explanations for the sluggish rebound.One theory is tied to the growing share of internships that are paid, in a market where more than half of all positions were unpaid just a few years ago, according to a separate survey by the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University.After a string of lawsuits by unpaid interns, more employers are paying their interns for reasons of \u201cliability protection and competing for good talent\u2014and therefore they are pulling together the funds to pay their interns, even if it is minimum wage,\u201d said Andrew Crain, a talent acquisition specialist at the University of Georgia in Athens.Those new, lower wages may be driving down the average, he said. Less than 30% of the university\u2019s students took unpaid internships in the fall of 2016, compared with more than 50% in 2010.Employers holding intern wages stagnant in the face of inflation may also drag average pay lower, said Phil Gardner, director of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute.Interns in some fields aren\u2019t hurting for cash, though. From 2011 to 2016, pay for software engineering interns in the San Francisco area climbed 15% to $6,250 a month, or roughly $39 per hour, according to an analysis by career website Glassdoor. That is more than double the 6% climb in average paid-intern wages nationally over that period, not adjusted for inflation, according to pay levels tracked by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.Over the same period, wages remained flat at around $13 per hour for students studying communications and humanities, who are also more likely to take unpaid positions, according to the survey published by the research institute at Michigan State.Things may improve once those interns take full-time jobs. College graduates who accept regular full-time jobs this year are earning an average starting salary of $49,785\u2014the highest in at least a decade, according to an analysis released in May of about 145,000 entry-level positions by executive search firm             Korn/Ferry International.Write to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 10:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pay-for-college-interns-is-so-2010-1500386400", "news_title": "Interns Today Make Less Than They Did in 2010", "keywords": "compensation,intern lawsuits,intern pay,summer intern pay,summer interns,tech-industry intern pay,National Association of Colleges and Employers,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,career planning,education,general labor issues,university,college,surveys,polls"}, {"content": "French oil giant             Total SA        TOT 0.91%       recently sent its 96,000 employees an unusual corporate missive: a comprehensive guide to religion at work.Intended as a practical tool for managers and employees, its 80-plus pages cover everything from the basic tenets of major world religions to whether bosses must provide halal food during company meals.Few if any U.S. companies have gone as far as Total, but religious issues are cropping up more often in the workplace, resulting in lawsuits and complicated questions of faith on the job. At a time when many managers encourage employees to \u201cbring their whole selves to work\u201d and celebrate their individual identities, religious identity has proved tougher to navigate, managers and experts say.When it comes to faith, most companies \u201cstay as far away as they can,\u201d for fear of making a wrong\u2014or unlawful\u2014move, said Deb Dagit, former chief diversity officer at drugmaker             Merck                   & Co. Ms. Dagit now runs her own consulting group.Religious discrimination complaints filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission increased by 50% from 2006 to 2016. While religious discrimination comprises a relatively small portion of EEOC complaints, the rise reflects an ever more multicultural workforce with a wider array of religious faiths, said Mark Fowler, deputy chief executive of Tanenbaum, a nonprofit that works to eliminate religious prejudice.At 92 pages, the English-language version of Total\u2019s guide offers few firm rules but states that employees\u2019 religious practices, such as prayer, should generally be respected and accommodated. Employees aren\u2019t required to read the document, which is available to those who are \u201ccurious,\u201d said a company spokeswoman.The company created the guide to aid managers and employees who \u201cmay have questions or doubts on this topic, working with people who might not eat, dress or pray the same,\u201d said the spokeswoman.U.S. companies often fail to address employee faith until problems arise, said Philadelphia-based employment attorney Jonathan Segal of Duane Morris LLP. Companies cannot ban religious expression outright, and U.S. Title VII requires employers to accommodate religious expression so long as it doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship on the company or workforce.\u201cEmployees don\u2019t shed their religious rights when they walk in the door,\u201d Mr. Segal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance.\u201d For instance, he said, a receptionist\u2019s request to keep a Bible at the front desk may be treated differently than an employee\u2019s request to keep one in an office, away from public view.Failing to strike that balance can put companies into hot water. After turning down a Muslim job applicant because her head scarf violated dress codes for retail employees,             Abercrombie & Fitch Co.lost a discrimination case that went to the Supreme Court in 2015.\u2018Employees don\u2019t shed their religious rights when they walk in the door. It\u2019s a balance.\u2019In a statement, Abercrombie said that it had \u201cgranted numerous religious accommodations when requested, including hijabs\u201d and \u201cremains focused on ensuring the company has an open-minded and tolerant workplace environment for all current and future store associates.\u201dIn December 2015, Cargill Inc. fired more than 100 Muslim workers from a meatpacking plant in Fort Morgan, Colo., in the midst of a dispute over whether they could take prayer breaks at work. The workers, mostly from Somalia, filed complaints with the EEOC and were deemed eligible for unemployment benefits by Colorado\u2019s labor department in 2016.At the time, the Council of American-Islamic Relations said that the company told workers prayer breaks were no longer allowed, while a Cargill spokesman said that no changes had been made to the company\u2019s religious accommodation policies.Tensions are being felt across the spectrum of faiths. A 2013 Tanenbaum survey of 2,024 workers showed that white evangelicals were equally as likely as non-Christians to say they felt their faiths weren\u2019t respected at work, and 28% of workers said discrimination against Christians is as serious an issue as discrimination against religious minorities.The two easiest accommodations companies can make, according to Mr. Fowler, are allowances for Sabbath observances or religious holidays and providing kosher, halal or vegetarian options at company-sponsored events.Religion is often missing from conversations about corporate diversity policies, said Ms. Dagit. During her time at Merck, the company started faith-based employee resource groups and educated employees on religious traditions during the holiday season. Even small things, like celebrating winter holidays, such as Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, help workers feel more included, she said.Tanenbaum\u2019s survey found that workers at companies with religious nondiscrimination policies were less likely to say they were seeking a new job. And, those with access to flexible hours for religious observance were more than twice as likely to say they look forward to coming to work.Every afternoon, Nazneen Nathani, an associate manager at consulting firm             Accenture                   PLC, stops in a designated prayer room in her Los Angeles office. A Shiite Muslim, she prays up to five times daily, but just once at the office.\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy time to be a Muslim in America,\u201d said Ms. Nathani, a 14-year company veteran who works in risk management and quality.

K. consumer inflation slowed unexpectedly in June, new figures showed Tuesday, offering a tentative sign that a squeeze on households evident since last year\u2019s Brexit vote may soon begin to ease.The slowdown in the rate of inflation from the near-four-year high the previous month will be welcomed by the U.K.\u2019s Conservative government, which has come under pressure over declining living standards just as it begins to negotiate Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.The data will also cast doubt over the prospect of an interest rate rise, which some Bank of England officials have signaled might be needed this year to bring inflation back to the bank\u2019s 2% goal.Sterling weakened by nearly 0.2% against the U.S. dollar shortly after the data was published as the prospect of a rate increase faded.Annual price growth slowed to 2.6% in June, the Office for National Statistics said. This was significantly below the forecast of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected it to hold steady at May\u2019s 2.9%, its highest since mid-2013.The June slowdown in inflation was driven largely by falling gasoline and diesel prices, and the rate remained higher than in the recent past, government statisticians said. However, the core inflation rate\u2014which excludes the most volatile products such as food, alcohol and gasoline --also saw a visible annual drop, to 2.4%, 0.2 percentage points below the May reading.Oil prices have slumped this year, particularly in the second quarter, due to a persistent oversupply. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is down around 13% since the start of the year.This has weighed on inflation across the globe, complicating policy-setting for the world\u2019s major central banks. Annual consumer-price inflation in the U.S. was flat in June at 1.4%. Low inflation is one reason for the Fed to move cautiously with interest-rate increases, though officials say the phenomenon is likely to fade.The Bank of Japan is expected to trim its inflation forecast when officials meet later this week. The European Central Bank also meets, just weeks after ECB President       Mario Draghi       hinted the ECB might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth in Europe.Other economic indicators published Tuesday suggest that inflation in the U.K., which accelerated sharply in the wake of the pound\u2019s Brexit-related depreciation last year, may indeed be tailing off.Growth in prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers has been slowing steeply since the beginning of this year, with the annual rate dropping by 10 percentage points since its January peak, to 9.9% last month. Growth in import prices, which are particularly sensitive to currency swings, has seen a similar deceleration.\u201cThe effects of sterling\u2019s slide now already appear to be fading at the start of the production line,\u201d said       Ruth Gregory,        U.K. economist at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy.While inflation is likely to accelerate still as growth in producer prices makes its way down to the consumers, inflation should now not be too far away from its peak, Ms. Gregory said. This means that the squeeze on real incomes will likely be less severe than the one following sterling\u2019s 2008 depreciation, she said.That would be good news for the mostly domestic-driven U.K. economy. British consumers have seen their wallets squeezed as inflation accelerated sharply since the Brexit vote in June last year, outpacing the tepid growth in wages.U.K. households suffered the longest sustained decline in disposable income in over four decades in the nine months through March, last month\u2019s data showed, highlighting the scale of the living standards squeeze.As households retrenched, reining in their spending sharply, the economy slowed significantly in the first quarter, growing by a mere 0.2%.This was down from the 0.7% growth rate seen in the final three months of 2016, and the slowest rate of growth among the Group of Seven developed economies.\u2014Georgi Kantchev contributed to this article.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 09:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-inflation-eases-unexpectedly-in-june-1500368034", "news_title": "U.K. Inflation Eases Unexpectedly in June", "keywords": "bank of england,british prices,consumer prices,consumer spending,inflation,interest rates,uk economy,Bank of England,European Union,Office for National Statistics,economic performance,indicators,prices,personal income,average earnings,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Merle Mullin,        an artist/designer from Los Angeles, on her 1957 Ford Thunderbird, as told to A.J.

He returned with this beautiful white Thunderbird. I said, \u201cThis is not my car.\u201d My husband said, \u201cI guess you\u2019d better get in and drive it home.\u201dI figured out quickly: This was not a joke. I had owned a 1957 T-Bird years earlier, and I had often said to my husband, \u201cI wish I had never sold that car. How did I not know it would become such a classic?\u201dHe had made a lot of phone calls to find out what color my old T-Bird was, and what model year, and he had purchased this car for me. I was stunned to the bottom of my feet.The T-Bird is an icon. Ford first introduced the car for model year 1955, and along with the Corvette, it is considered to be one of the first American sports cars. Ford was known at the time for more staid, functional cars, so this was an anomaly, and very few from this era were built.My husband and I redid the suspension, so the car drives very smoothly. I love the simplicity. When you look at the dashboard and then you look at the dashboard of, say, a Tesla, the difference is remarkable.Later this summer, I will be driving this car\u2014which turns 60 this year\u2014in a rally called It\u2019s All About the Girls!

The dynamism of the dollar at the end of 2016 has given way to enthusiasm for the euro. That shift could yet support appetite for riskier assets such as emerging-market stocks and bonds.The WSJ Dollar Index has now unwound the boost it got from the election of       Donald Trump       in November, and is down about 6.5% this year. The greenback\u2019s key counterpart, the euro, is up close to 10% in 2017. Early Tuesday, the euro rose above $1.15 for the first time since May 2016, reaching the top of the range it has been in since the start of 2015 under the influence of monetary-policy divergence between Europe and the U.S.The transformation in the dollar and euro\u2019s relative fortunes in 2017 has been remarkable. The focus at the start of the year was on the U.S. Federal Reserve and its efforts to raise interest rates; now the European Central Bank has stolen the spotlight as it tacks gently away from ultraloose policy settings.Hopes for growth were centered on U.S. spending and tax reform under the Trump administration. Instead it is the eurozone that has delivered consistently positive surprises on growth. And it was Europe that was supposed to face political headaches. But it is the U.S. where the challenges are rising .The collapse of the health-care bill delivered a fresh blow to the dollar.True, a lot of these factors may now be in the euro-dollar exchange rate. Europe faces a higher bar to provide new positive surprises than the U.S. A further sharp rise in the euro might cause European policy makers to feel the currency is doing the tightening work on its own. Conversely, the risk might yet be that the Fed raises rates more than the market thinks is likely.But the ramifications of this shift are broad. A weaker dollar should add to the attraction of local-currency emerging-market assets. The Mexican peso, Brazilian real and South African rand have all risen against the dollar in July.The important thing for risk appetite is the reason for dollar weakness. As long as it reflects other parts of the world, such as the eurozone, faring better than expected relative to the U.S., rather than fears for the U.S. economy in particular, then emerging markets should have continued support. Seen like that, a weaker dollar is a source of strength.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 09:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-a-weaker-dollar-is-a-source-of-market-strength-1500385094", "news_title": "Why a Weaker Dollar Is a Source of Market Strength   ", "keywords": " dollar,dollar decline, euro, euro rise, us interest rates,Federal Reserve,Donald Trump,monetary policy,interest rates,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,insurance,financial investments,risk management,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The problem with a command economy is policies tend to create unintended consequences, which inevitably lead to heavy-handed crackdowns. China apparently is in the crackdown phase now.After years of encouraging companies to \u201cgo global,\u201d Beijing is getting uncomfortable with the capital outflows and leverage that have resulted from some companies\u2019 headlong expansion. In an expression of that discomfort, regulators have blocked China\u2019s big banks from lending to Dalian Wanda Group for several of its overseas deals, according to The Wall Street Journal.Wanda, controlled by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        has built a global media empire by splashing billions on companies like             AMC Entertainment                   and Legendary Entertainment, the studio behind \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Beijing, seeking to expand its soft power overseas, had been supporting such efforts to create rivals to Hollywood.Another example: China\u2019s support for the housing markets in smaller cities has created many nouveau riche who are betting their newfound wealth in Macau\u2019s casinos.According to             Deutsche Bank,       VIP gambling revenue in Macau and third-tier city property prices have a correlation of 0.74, where a correlation of one indicates they move in lockstep. And high rollers have been a big driver in Macau\u2019s recovery this year: VIP revenue was up 35% last quarter, versus 8% for mass-market revenue. That has most benefited             Wynn Resorts                  \u2019 Macau operations, which caters to the high end more than others.That undercuts Beijing\u2019s goal of developing Macau into a tourist spot for casual gamblers, rather than a place for China\u2019s rich to contribute to capital outflows. Tightening policies have already appeared. Banks have to report cross-border transfers above 200,000 yuan ($30,000) and ATMs with facial recognition are popping up in the city. The city\u2019s biggest junket operator, Suncity, which brings big-stakes gamblers to Macau and lends them money, sent messages to its customers last week warning about the risks of moving money across the border.The more the high rollers keep coming, the more likely Macau is to become the next part of the economy to be squeezed.Write to Jacky Wong at Jacky.Wong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 07:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-visible-hand-starts-to-squeeze-1500379032", "news_title": "China\u2019s Visible Hand Starts to Squeeze ", "keywords": "china crackdown,china leverage,china outflows,heard on the street,macau casinos,macau gambling,macau gambling revenue,AMC Entertainment,AMC,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,commodity,financial market news,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,motels,casino hotels,diversified holding companies,film,video exhibition,gambling industries,business,consumer services,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "Good morning.

The social media manager handbook tends to instruct brands to take conversations regarding complaints from customers offline as soon as possible to prevent a pile-on. But Delta ripped up the rulebook earlier this week when conservative commentator Ann Coulter unloaded on the airline after it gave away her \u201cextra room seat\u201d to another customer, as the New York Times reported. Ms. Coulter\u2019s tirade peaked when she tweeted a photo of said passenger and went on to compare Delta\u2019s flight attendants and gate agents to \u201cNurse Ratched,\u201d the cruel antagonist in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d Delta refunded Ms. Coulter $30 for the seat, but not without also tweeting, \u201cAdditionally, your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary.\u201d This won some social media praise, but perturbed Ms. Coulter\u2019s supporters further: #BoycottDelta is now a thing on Twitter.The U.K.\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it\u2019s going to introduce tougher guidelines surrounding the depiction of gender stereotypes in ads, having conducted research to explore the public\u2019s attitudes on the issue, Marketing Week reports. The ad watchdog will now take a harder line on ads, such as those that mock people for not conforming to gender types. The Committee of Advertising Practice (which is responsible for writing the U.K.\u2019s self-regulatory ad code) is expected to update the industry on its progress by the end of the year. If advertisers need to adapt their campaigns for the U.K. market, it could have an impact on the creative they run in other markets like the U.S., too.-- We\u2019ve Come A Long, Long Way Together --The news shows what a distance the industry has come in a short amount of time. The ASA\u2019s review was prompted by a 2015 ad for a diet shakes and supplements company featuring a svelte woman in a bikini and the line \u201cAre You Beach Body Ready?\u201d which led to a wave of complaints and even a protest from critics who complained it was socially irresponsible. The ad escaped a ban as it wasn\u2019t in breach of the ad guidelines. Unilever marketing boss Keith Weed, who last year launched the global \u201cUnstereotype\u201d initiative to do away with all sorts of outdated stereotypes of people in advertising, emails in response to the ASA\u2019s move: \u201cThe business case for doing this is clear: progressive advertising delivers 25% better branded impact.\u201dFirst there was header bidding. Now the rise of header bidding has helped spawn more ad tech jargon for marketers and publishers to get their heads around. As with anything in ad tech, there\u2019s a few names and definitions, but most people have settled with \u201csupply path optimization\u201d (SPO), which ad tech consultant Paul Gubbins has a great primer on here. As Business Insider reported, header bidding (which allows publishers to offer out their inventory to multiple ad exchanges at the same time) is putting a huge strain on ad tech vendors and their infrastructure costs, which can often get passed on to marketers. Enter SPO. The idea is that SPO can use algorithms and some manual actions to filter out any duplications of ad inventory, weed out any other ad auction techniques that are not in a buyer\u2019s best interest and reduce advertiser and ad tech vendor costs in the process.Tesla named 21st Century Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch and Ebony Media CEO Linda Johnson Rice to its board.

That cloak of secrecy, say some entrepreneurs and investors, poses potential problems that founders must navigate when seeking early capital.One hazard is a conflict of interest for scouts who are tied to just one venture firm, because the scout could put the venture firm\u2019s interests before those of the startup. Unlike typical angel investors, scouts are affiliated with a venture firm and receive pay or a cut of the profits on investments. Many scouts double as founders of portfolio companies of those firms.\u201cEntrepreneurs don\u2019t know exactly whose side the scouts are on when scouts invest in their companies and later advise the companies on when to raise a venture round and which venture capitalists to meet with,\u201d said       Salil Deshpande,        managing director at Bain Capital Ventures.Among venture firms using such programs are Accel Partners, CRV, Founders Fund, Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Social Capital and Spark Capital, according to people familiar with the matter. Flybridge Capital and First Round Capital just announced public versions of such programs. Meanwhile some firms have tried other approaches to be transparent.\u201cIt\u2019s to get companies on our radar early because there\u2019s only so many companies we can see, so having more companies helps widen our aperture,\u201d said Lightspeed partner Jeremy Liew.AngelList, a popular site for angel investing, recently weighed in with an alternative offering. Its Angel Funds program aims to make it easier for angels to raise a fund and for passive investors to get into AngelList deals.Instead of getting their own scouts, venture firms like Accomplice, Bain Capital Ventures and Crosslink Capital have backed AngelList\u2019s funds in nonexclusive arrangements.Mr. Deshpande says Bain is able to gain access to early-stage opportunities through AngelList, which he says makes clear which firms are putting money behind a particular scout or angel.Some critics cite the risk that angels might invest their own money in the best deals and then steer their less attractive deals into funds controlled by a venture firm.In many venture-firm relationships, scouts often have to split profits from their successful startups with other scouts. AngelList says its program allows them to keep their own profits as individuals.\u201cIt\u2019s the scouts who really benefit the most from angel funds, as they get multiple LPs and get to be transparent and eat what they kill instead of getting carry out of a big pool,\u201d said AngelList Chief Executive Naval Ravikant. \u201cSo I expect that over time there will be some adverse selection against traditional, secretive, one-LP scout programs.\u201dParker Thompson, a partner at AngelList, says venture firms should be directly involved with a startup, rather than relying on an exclusive scout to get a deal.\u201cYou win these (Series A) deals by supporting them and being there early, not just by being the only one who saw it,\u201d Mr. Parker said.Sequoia Capital, for its part, has guidelines to ensure founders\u2019 interests have primacy, said Matt Huang, partner at Sequoia. The firm asks scouts to inform founders proactively of their Sequoia ties, Mr. Huang said, and some of them even list their affiliation on their LinkedIn profiles.Sequoia has no special rights to invest before other firms, or information rights, in scout deals, Mr. Huang said.\u201cWe think about it as a service to the community and to founders,\u201d Mr. Huang said.Scout-originated deals have resulted in Sequoia follow-on investments in well known companies including Stripe, which was last valued at more than $9 billion, and Thumbtack, valued at more than $1.3 billion, according to Mr. Huang.Scout programs can be preferable to AngelList investing if a CEO has never thought about or tried being an investor, said Saar Gur, general partner at CRV. In that case the venture firm can proactively bring them in. He said such programs create a community that benefits both the scout and the firm.\u201cNow that these programs are more widespread and common, most scouts are upfront with founders they\u2019re investing in,\u201d Mr. Gur said.With venture firms sporting ever-larger fund sizes, more of them need help to keep up with seed-stage opportunities.\u201cThey\u2019re focused on deals that put capital to work in Series A, B, C stages,\u201d said Ramtin Naimi, founder of Abstract Ventures, who has been a scout for three venture firms. \u201cSpending time chasing seeds with $1 million checks isn\u2019t worth their time and resources, because they\u2019re not putting enough money to work.\u201dAnother factor behind the proliferation of scouts: More associates at venture firms who used to source early-stage deals are now working at top startups instead, said       Semil Shah,        founding partner at venture firm Haystack.\u201cLarger VC firms are constantly focused on monitoring talent and collecting information,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Red Sox or Yankees: They want to know who\u2019s coming up through the ranks.

Then came the Amazon effect.The country\u2019s retailers have been cutting prices in response to the rise of online rivals like             Amazon.com Inc.,       disrupting what had seemed like perfect conditions for Japan to get the stable dose of inflation it has long been looking for.In part as a result, Japan\u2019s central bank is likely to lower its price forecast for the current financial year at its policy meeting\u00a0on Thursday, said people familiar with its thinking. That reflects continued resistance to price rises, despite Japan\u2019s longest economic expansion\u00a0in 11 years\u00a0and its tightest labor market in decades. The Bank of Japan is also likely to raise its view on the economy while keeping its policy settings on hold, the people said.Japan isn\u2019t alone in its surprise at the slow response of prices to improved economic strength. Policy makers, economists and central bankers in the U.S. and Europe are also scratching their heads about why prices around the world can move so little while economic growth gathers momentum\u2014a factor that usually drives inflation.While BOJ officials continue to refer to a number of factors that are holding back price gains, e-commerce is now among them, people familiar with their thinking said.Aeon Co.      , one of Japan\u2019s largest retailers, said e-commerce has made competition more severe, especially when consumers remain budget-minded. Aeon, which operates             Wal-Mart                  -like superstores that sell food and general merchandise, cut prices on milk, shampoo and more than 250 other products in April and is planning to do so again in August.Aeon President Motoya Okada said in April that consumer trends, including the low prices offered by internet retailers, left Japan unable to return to inflation after nearly 20 years in which prices have often been in decline.\u201cThe end of deflation was a great illusion,\u201d Mr. Okada said.E-commerce in Japan still accounts for less than 6% of retail sales, but its influence on price-setting may be much larger because e-commerce sales keep growing 8% to 10% a year, while overall retail sales are roughly flat. E-commerce makes up about 8.5% of U.S. retail sales.Japan was the third-largest global market for Amazon.com Inc. in 2016 after the U.S. and Germany, accounting for sales of nearly $11 billion, while some local websites offering cut-rate fashion such as Zozotown are also growing fast.\u201cPrice competition between e-commerce companies like Amazon and brick-and-mortar shops has become fierce in the U.S. and is beginning to turn that way in Japan,\u201d said Izuru Kato, president of Totan Research Co. \u201cIt isn\u2019t so simple that the BOJ can spur inflation by just easing monetary policy.\u201d\u2018The end of deflation was a great illusion\u2019Amazon representatives didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.While consumers may welcome a better deal on shampoo, the BOJ and other central banks have long been concerned that broad overall price declines can hurt an economy by fostering a negative cycle of low corporate investment, low wage growth and general lack of vitality. The BOJ has targeted inflation of 2%, and it has pumped the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy each year through purchasing government bonds and other assets.In the past, the central bank blamed sliding oil prices for its failure to hit the target. Recently, oil prices have stabilized, and Japan\u2019s price index edged into positive territory this year. Still, the core inflation rate in May\u2014covering all prices except for fresh food\u2014was just 0.4%.BOJ officials looking for explanations cite the difficulty of changing the common view among Japanese consumers that prices don\u2019t go up. One person close to the central bank\u2019s policy makers said Amazon was helping entrench that view further.The BOJ predicted in April that core consumer prices would increase 1.4% in the year ending March 2018, but it is likely to reduce that estimate, said people familiar with its thinking. Some of those people said recent data suggest it will be hard for inflation to reach the 2% target by March 2019 as the BOJ has projected.Another theory gaining ground at the BOJ is that Japanese companies are investing in automation to improve productivity and offset the higher costs of labor and raw materials. This could help them avoid pushing up the prices they charge customers.Analysts have long said Japan\u2019s heavily staffed service industries have plenty of room for more efficiencies. However, data so far don\u2019t show major productivity gains in Japan.Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 07:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/monetary-policy-has-a-new-problem-amazon-1500373250", "news_title": "Monetary Policy in Japan Has a New Problem: Amazon ", "keywords": " amazaon, bank of japan, inflation,japan, japan economy,Amazon.com,AMZN,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,economic news,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "Good morning,Senate GOP leaders have abandoned their effort to dismantle and simultaneously replace much of the Affordable Care Act, after the defections of two more Republican senators left the party short of the votes needed to pass President Trump\u2019s top legislative priority. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas on Monday night became the third and fourth Republicans to oppose the latest version of the bill, joining Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged the defeat Monday night and, in a strategy facing long odds, said the Senate would instead vote \u201cin coming days\u201d on legislation to unravel most of the ACA without a replacement, a bill the chamber passed in late 2015 but that was then vetoed by President Obama.Some employees who haven\u2019t saved enough for retirement are getting a boost from their employers. Companies from Microsoft to Host Hotels & Resorts are increasing contributions to their workers\u2019 401(k) plans, something many employers have long resisted because of the cost. Some explain they are spending more to retain the best employees and motivate staff. It also helps ensure that older, relatively expensive workers can afford to retire on time and make way for younger staff. The average company contribution to 401(k)s rose to an estimated 4.7% of employee salaries in 2016, from 3.9% in 2015. That marks a reversal from the depths of the financial crisis, when many employers suspended or pared contributions.The U.S. has long refused to sell its most-powerful drones to most countries, fearing they might fall into hostile hands, be used to suppress civil unrest or, in the Mideast, erode Israel\u2019s military dominance. But growing evidence suggests that military drones exported by China have been deployed in conflicts in the Mideast and Africa by several countries, a strategic and commercial blow to the U.S. We report that China\u2019s sales have enabled multiple countries to use drones to spy and kill remotely, as the U.S. has done on a large scale since 9/11.

Tax cuts could unite them.Today\u2019s Republican coalition weaves together three distinct philosophical strands: the populists/nationalists, the movement conservatives and the Wall Street/establishment conservatives. All three are well represented in the       Trump       administration\u2014indeed, in the Trump White House itself\u2014which is one reason it has had a hard time projecting ideological coherence.The health-care debate has been a seven-month migraine that pulls apart those strands of the Republican coalition.The populists/nationalists are troubled by the idea of rolling back the Affordable Care Act\u2019s taxes on the wealthy while cutting Medicaid funding and insurance subsidies that benefit some core elements of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 constituency. Movement conservatives want a complete uprooting of Obamacare and far more reliance on market forces in the health sector. The party\u2019s establishment wing, meantime, could live with some kind of compromise, if there were one that could satisfy the others.That problem has been made worse by the fact that the Trump White House has been left either defending or trying to sell somebody else\u2019s idea of a repeal-and-replace plan, because it doesn\u2019t have one of its own. That has produced the spectacle of the president occasionally championing and then criticizing the very same proposal; supporting competing ideas; and backing plans that would hurt many Trump voters.Mr. Trump has never offered a sustained public defense of any of the various approaches Republicans have tried. He owns none of them, and has left the impression that any will do.Unfortunately for the GOP, the magic compromise that skirts past these differences has proven elusive. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged Monday night that he simply doesn\u2019t have the votes to pass a health bill to replace Obamacare.Tax reform holds out the prospect of something different.For starters, the Trump administration will be selling a tax plan of its own, and, with luck, one precooked with congressional leaders, rather than hoping somebody else presents one that is acceptable. That alone would change the dynamic.More broadly, the belief that it is essential to revamp the tax system to lower tax rates, especially corporate rates, is as close to gospel as you can reach in today\u2019s Republican Party. Nothing unifies the GOP like cutting taxes.Even the populist/nationalist wing agrees with the Wall Street/establishment wing on that notion. And that\u2019s especially true if, as the administration has promised, lower corporate rates can be married to a broad-based tax cut that will help the middle class, financed by closing tax breaks for businesses and at the top end of the income ladder.That isn\u2019t to say changing the tax code is simple\u2014not by a long shot. There certainly are intra-Republican differences.Most notably, House Speaker       Paul Ryan       and Ways and Means Chairman       Kevin Brady       have long been pushing the idea of building a new tax system around a border-adjustable tax\u2014a tax that essentially imposes a levy on imports while letting exports leave the country tax-free. The idea is to both build domestic industries and supply chains while also raising a big chunk of revenue to finance tax cuts elsewhere.That idea does, in fact, split the GOP coalition. Parts of the establishment wing hate it because it would hurt industries that rely on imported goods; the populist/nationalist wing likes the way it could promote American manufacturing, but is leery of how it would drive up costs for products that working-class America buys at             Wal-Mart                  ; and the Trump White House thinks it\u2019s too complicated.But the reality is that, because of such misgivings, the border tax probably has been a dead letter for months now, though its proponents haven\u2019t given up. The Trump team will try to steer the conversation in a different direction.There are plenty of other complications, including a debate about how much to cut taxes at the top end of the income scale. If tax reform were simple, three decades wouldn\u2019t have passed since the last significant one. And the prospect of finding Democratic support is nearly as bleak as it has been on health care.Still, the fundamental idea of lowering rates and simplifying the tax code is one Republicans are almost desperate to rally around.\u00a0If that holds true, we\u2019ll be left to ponder how different the story of Mr. Trump\u2019s first year might have been if Republicans had been able to start with an idea that united them rather than one that divided them.Write to Gerald F.

U.S. importers are bringing goods at a fast pace this summer, building up inventories with record-setting inbound volumes hitting seaports on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The import volumes signal a far stronger start to the industry\u2019s peak shipping season than last year, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Erica E. Phillips writes, suggesting rising hopes that the U.S. economy will pick up steam this fall. An early estimate from the retail industry says shipments into major U.S. ports were up more than 5% in June, and projects that the business will accelerate at a healthy pace. So far, consumers haven\u2019t shown the same outlook, with measures of sales and of consumer confidence both slipping back. And data firm Panjiva says some of the growth this year has come in sectors facing fears of U.S. import tariffs, suggesting companies may be rushing in goods ahead of potential restrictions.FedEx Corp.       is still struggling with the June 27 cyberattack, and so are its customers. The delivery giant says the global cyberattack known as Petya significantly affected the operations of its Europe-based TNT Express business, and the WSJ\u2019s Imani Moise reports that although package depots are running they\u2019re still handling much of the operations and paperwork by hand. FedEx appears to be suffering deeper long-term problems following the ransomware attack than container shipping giant Maersk Line, which slowly ramped up operations at its liner business and at its sister APM Terminals unit after a direct hit from Petya. Some three weeks later, FedEx customers still face long delivery delays and erratic information, and the company expects to suffer a material financial impact. The attack hit the TNT Express operation that FedEx bought last year, a $4.8 billion acquisition that triggered a highly complicated effort to integrate information systems.The freight business is about to get real for Flexport. The San Francisco-based company, one of several that have sought to use technology to insert themselves into the logistics market, is opening its first warehouse next month, WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Erica E. Phillips writes, an expansion that will push the company more into the physical world while making it look more than ever like a freight forwarder. Flexport insists its software will have the company operating more nimbly than traditional companies that move goods around the world, but the expansion in California along with planned additions in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, suggest the company sees its best growth prospects in handling freight in the real world. Flexport is among the biggest of several startups attempting to digitize various logistics functions, including booking transportation and finding warehouse space. The biggest freight forwarders are building technology to meet the startups, but they also have the facilities that help put the goods into motion.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. has spent $100 million in recent years to boost its online sales, but the investment has only left the retailer falling further behind. The retailer is among many fighting to keep up with the big stakes counted in the billions of dollars that competitors are laying out in the e-commerce arena, the WSJ\u2019s Miriam Gottfried reports. High debt and heavy real-estate holdings weigh on the ability of many retailers to pull together their own matching investment. It\u2019s part of a tough riddle at the heart of e-commerce competition: High debt loads, nervous lenders and falling sales make it impossible to invest enough to compete online. And when companies generate online sales, the costly logistics leave margins so tight that future investments are harder to make. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us illustrates the tough position. The company had to halt some online sales last year after a deluge of web orders overwhelmed its ability to get products to customers in time for Christmas.The rapid development of warehouse space in New Jersey isn\u2019t coming fast enough to keep up with the demand for e-commerce logistics. Cushman & Wakefield says developers this year will more than double the addition of industrial space from a year ago, the WSJ\u2019s Keiko Morris reports, and that companies are now scrambling to find sites that can accommodate the sprawling facilities exceeding 750,000 square feet that are in demand. The big driver is e-commerce, with transportation and fulfillment operators coming in along with retailers to eat up distribution capacity in the region. The dynamic is playing out in other regions, where a mix of population density, high shipping demand and older warehousing has developers rushing to meet modern needs. The bottom line for distribution companies and retailers is higher prices for warehouses, adding to the tough economic calculations for online sales.\u2018Certainly in selected industries I\u2019d say there\u2019s a very real chance of an oversupply of inventory.\u2019Inventories-to-sales ratio for U.S. retailers in May, matching the highest level this year, according to the Commerce Department.The U.K. and the European Union began the first round of serious Brexit talks.

IBM -4.20%       is scheduled to announce second-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday. Here\u2019s what to look for:EARNINGS FORECAST: For IBM\u2019s second fiscal quarter that ended in June, analysts expect IBM to report per-share earnings of $2.75 on an adjusted basis that omits items including acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, down nearly 7% from $2.95 the same quarter a year earlier.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $19.5 billion for the quarter, down nearly 4% from $20.2 billion a year earlier.WHAT TO WATCH:STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES:\u00a0With its legacy businesses slowing, Big Blue has placed big bets on higher-margin markets it calls \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, analytics and cybersecurity. Revenue in those areas must expand faster than legacy businesses contract to return IBM to growth after years of falling revenue. In the first quarter, though, revenue growth for strategic imperatives slipped to 13% in constant currency, which some analysts reckon is close to the rate core businesses are declining.Some degree of declining growth in strategic imperatives is \u201cnot unexpected,\u201d said       Josh Olson       of Edward Jones, explaining that each percentage point becomes harder to achieve as new areas encompass a larger proportion of total revenue (41% last year). \u201cBut the decline in the core legacy,\u201d such as on-premises software and equipment, \u201cis worse than expected.\u201dMARGINS: IBM\u2019s first-quarter results revealed a drop in gross profit margins across all segments, challenging investor confidence in the earning power of purportedly high-margin offerings such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Some deterioration is to be expected as the company invests in new businesses and shifts from contracts paid up front to cloud-style recurring revenue, analysts said, but investors are looking for margins to stabilize or rise. The second quarter typically is stronger than the first, said       Steven Milunovich       of UBS, so \u201cwe\u2019ll focus more on year-on-year comparisons.\u201dTHE SECOND HALF: IBM\u2019s first-quarter results threw its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of $13.80 per share into question. IBM typically generates 55% of its annual per-share earnings in the third and fourth quarters, analysts said, but the company\u2019s guidance implies a back-end contribution of 63%. That would require the rest of this year to be one of IBM\u2019s two highest-earning second halves in the past 20 years, according to Bernstein Research analyst       Toni Sacconaghi      \u2014an ambitious goal in his view.Shareholders will be on the lookout for perspective on factors that could boost second-half earnings including new mainframes, cost-cutting, low tax rates, and favorable currency trends. \u201cInvestors want some level of comfort that we can believe in the target,\u201d said       Greg McDowell       of             JMP Securities.Write to Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 06:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-earnings-what-to-watch-1500372000", "news_title": "IBM Earnings: What to Watch", "keywords": " earnings season,ibm, ibm 2q, ibm earnings, ibm earnings estimate, ibm earnings preview, ibm revenue estimate, ibm strategic imperatives, international business machines,International Business Machines,IBM,Bernstein Research,Edward Jones,financial performance,earnings,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,surveys,polls,computer services,cloud computing,business,consumer services,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "With the relentless upscaling of one New York neighborhood after another, it\u2019s always fun to check in on the more obvious prospects to see if they\u2019ve acquired a locavore cafe and a             Starbucks.A personal favorite: Beach 116th Street\u2014a two-block retail strip running north from the Atlantic in Rockaway Park, Queens.When I told one local shopkeeper I was planning to write about the street, she said \u201cYou mean, how crazy it is?\u201dWell, yes!Here we have a primo span of real estate linking the last stop on the A train to beautiful Rockaway Beach. It is sandwiched between prosperous Belle Harbor and a fashionable artists\u2019 enclave to the east. But it still feels like the main street of a struggling small town.There are faded awnings and long stretches of shuttered storefronts. There are remarkably few chains stores. The unisex salon still offers perms. Shops hawk $4 sunglasses.Thanks to the area\u2019s many shelters, the PPB (Panhandlers Per Block) index may be the highest I\u2019ve ever encountered. They come at you in various stages of undress, demanding cash.And the strip isn\u2019t always welcoming to day-trippers. A plaque behind the bar at Rogers Pub commands, \u201cNo Sniveling\u201d. The surf shop warns, \u201cPlease No: Wet sandy oily bodies.\u201dBut this throwback aura may soon be washed away. There\u2019s no Starbucks, but a recent visit turned up a spate of new restaurants and shops, and there is a big condo development in the works.Why now?\u201cThere\u2019s so few left,\u201d says Yarden Flatow, chair of the Rockaway Business Alliance, of New York\u2019s undiscovered neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I found the last one!\u2019\u201dThe first of the strip\u2019s new shopkeepers say they located here out of necessity. Tom Murphy, owner of Curran\u2019s Superior Meats, rented a store on Beach 116th Street after superstorm Sandy wiped out his shop in Belle Harbor. He worried customers wouldn\u2019t follow him 13 blocks east.\u201c116 is always getting knocked,\u201d he says.They proved him wrong. Opening day was a blur of hugs and flowers, he says. Sales are up 30% from his previous location.Others followed. There is a new bike shop, wellness center and several new restaurants.The city\u2019s ferry service, launched in May, is bringing tourists from around the world. And some say the police are doing a better job of curbing the aggressive panhandling.One of the newest arrivals is the Lola Star gift shop. If you need a Rockaway-themed T-shirt or mug, this is your place. Founder Lola Star even offers Rockaway \u201cGood Vibes\u201d hand soap.\u201cI have this specialty for finding up-and-coming neighborhoods that are on the cusp of change,\u201d says Ms. Star, who owns four stores around the city. \u201cThis street is going to become what it should be, Rockaway\u2019s main street.\u201dDeveloper Mark Caller, founder and chief executive officer of the Marcal Group, got interested in Beach 116th while cruising the area on his bicycle. His first impression: \u201cThis is the perfect block.\u2019\u201dHe bought a vacant complex steps from the boardwalk and tore it down. He expects to complete construction in 2018 on a 90-unit condo with street-level retail.His site faces closed storefronts, a boarded-up theater and a rooming house. But he\u2019s wouldn\u2019t mind buying the entire block. In New York, it isn\u2019t just about the dollars, it is about getting there first.\u201cI\u2019ve never been this excited,\u201d says Mr. Caller, who previously built in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Clinton Hill in Brooklyn. \u201cThis is the first time I feel what we\u2019re going to do is a complete game-changer.\u201dHe even discarded a plan to name his building \u201cSeaside Landing.\u201d It is now dubbed \u201cOne Sixteen,\u201d as if the strip were already a hot destination.Locals are smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate yet,\u201d says Mr. Flatow. \u201c\u2018Yet\u2019 is the key word.

TSLA -0.91%       by games and social-media company Tencent Holdings Ltd.China\u2019s overseas auto-industry investments\u2014more than $34 billion since 2008\u2014have come despite a broad government clampdown on foreign acquisitions.Investment VehiclesChinese auto companies have been aggressively buying U.S. and other foreign assets, securing a raft of deals in the first half of 2017. Select investments for detailsThat reflects two factors, according to       Michael Dunne,        president of Dunne Automotive, an advisory firm. One is that Chinese automotive companies, unlike their peers in other sectors such as entertainment, have picked their targets carefully and secured good value for the money, he said.The other is that the automotive sector clearly has government support at the highest levels to take a commanding position in the global market, he said.\u201cThere is no question their ambition is to be No. 1,\u201d said Mr. Dunne. He likened the approach to the ancient Chinese game of Go, \u201cwhere you gradually encircle your opponent by taking strategic assets.\u201dIn many cases, Chinese companies are doing this by acquiring parts suppliers and small car makers, or setting up joint ventures on foreign soil. U.S. assets have been high on China\u2019s shopping list.Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.\u00a0is investing $500 million to build a Volvo plant that will employ 2,000 people in Ridgeville S.C., for example, while auto-glass producer             Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co.        600660 0.08%       has spent $1 billion on U.S. manufacturing facilities, including reopening a former             General Motors Co.       plant in Moraine, Ohio, that will employ 2,500.Among the eight deals chalked up in the first half of 2017 was             Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp.\u2019s        600699 1.91%       deal last month for bankrupt air-bag maker Takata. If completed, the $1.59 billion purchase would be Ningbo Joyson\u2019s fourth in two years\u2014a streak that included last year\u2019s $920 million acquisition of Michigan-based Key Safety Systems Inc., a maker of air bags and other auto-safety equipment.Beijing has given vehicle-industry companies free rein to expand even as it tamps down acquisitions in other sectors, said       Chen Yang,        Ningbo Joyson\u2019s communications director, underscoring the car sector\u2019s strategic value to Chinese policy makers.\u201cWe have had a lot of support from the relevant government departments,\u201d said Mr. Chen. \u201cYou can\u2019t do overseas acquisitions without government support.\u201dGeely is the most active Chinese car manufacturer in terms of foreign takeovers. It bought struggling Malaysian auto maker Proton along with its Lotus Cars unit for $235 million in March, before acquiring U.S. flying-car startup Terrafugia in June for an undisclosed fee.Geely\u2019s 2010 acquisition and subsequent turnaround of Volvo Cars, previously an unprofitable unit of             Ford Motor Co.      , is often cited as the most successful example of a Chinese auto acquisition to date: As well as reviving the Swedish brand, Geely used Volvo\u2019s technology to upgrade its own product lines.Geely\u2019s absorption of foreign technology and know-how has put it \u201cin a class by itself\u201d among Chinese auto makers, according to Mr. Dunne, vindicating acquisitions that industry analysts initially questioned.Other Chinese buyers have preferred to take strategic stakes in foreign vehicle makers rather than make outright purchases, as when Tencent spent $1.8 billion on a 5% stake in Tesla in March.China National Chemical Corp.\u2019s $7.86 billion purchase of Italian tire maker Pirelli in 2015 remains the biggest Chinese auto-sector foray to date. The nation\u2019s largest supplier to auto makers, Wanxiang Group, is also a significant competitor, claiming a 12% share of the international car-parts market outside China.Mr. Chen of Ningbo Joyson said Chinese auto suppliers are still closing the gap on world leaders such as Germany\u2019s Robert Bosch GmbH and Japan\u2019s             Denso Corp.      , some of which have been offloading surplus units to Chinese buyers as they themselves move into more high-tech fields thought to represent the future of the car business, such as automation and connectivity.Bosch, for example, sold its starter-motor division to Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co. in May.Ningbo Joyson, however, is investing in cutting-edge technology rather than assets that Western rivals no longer want, but is still playing catch-up, Mr. Chen said. \u201cChina does not yet have one single world-class auto company,\u201d he said.Chinese companies that are doubling down on specific subsectors of the auto-parts market might have a better chance of securing global dominance than those aiming to diversify, said       Robin Zhu,        an auto analyst at Bernstein Research.Ningbo Joyson\u2019s acquisition of Key Systems and Takata will make it a top-three global player in the vehicle-safety segment, provided it can successfully stitch its various units together, he said, while auto-glass maker Fuyao, car-trim maker             Minth Group Ltd.       and vehicle-interior supplier Yanfeng are among the other Chinese suppliers in growing command of their specialties.Yet even as China\u2019s auto industry racks up overseas purchases, it remains behind overall, Mr. Zhu said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a Chinese Bosch anytime soon.\u201d\u2014Lilian Lin contributed to this article.Write to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Beijing Speeds Up in Global Car Business.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-aims-to-take-over-car-industry-one-part-at-a-time-1500370204", "news_title": "How China Plans to Take Over the Car Industry", "keywords": "auto ,car industry,china,chinese business,chinese investments,foreign investment,tesla,trade,trade barrier,volvo,Tesla,TSLA,Takata,7312.TO,JP:7312,Fuyao Glass Industry Group,600660.SH,CN:600660,Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp.

Employment in the Denver metropolitan area grew by 3.2% in 2016, with more than 50,000 jobs being added, the seventh highest among all major U.S. metro areas, according to             CBRE Group Inc.        CBG 1.83%Government officials declined to estimate what the winning price will be. Based on comparable sales in the area, the parcel could go for more than $30 million, real-estate market watchers say.The General Services Administration, which owns and leases office space, land, labs and other facilities for the federal government, began switching to online auctions for disposing of surplus property in the early days of the internet. Over the years the process has been refined.In the past 10 years, the agency has conducted 1,097 online sales yielding $452.2 million. These auctions are considered to be a more fair, efficient and lucrative process than the old, sealed-bidding process. Auctions ensure wide participation and are structured to achieve top price by doing such things as allowing bidders to see rival bids in real time as they are submitted, GSA officials say.The GSA\u2019s portfolio currently consists of 370 million square feet in 8,600 assets. Other properties that were sold in recent online auctions include an 80-year old Washington, D.C., office building that had been used by the Agriculture Department and Sugar Grove Station, a former naval base in West Virginia that is being converted into a health-care facility.\u201cGSA\u2019s goal in disposing of surplus property is to bring value to taxpayers and return property to the communities we serve so it can be used in a beneficial manner,\u201d a GSA spokesman said in an email.Still, the sales process of the Denver Federal Center site has run into controversy and criticism. For years, the city of Lakewood worked with the General Services Administration to take over the site. Lakewood officials believed that they were better positioned to develop a master plan that would ensure certain uses\u2014like affordable housing\u2014than the GSA, which typically sells to the highest bidder.About 18 months ago, Lakewood and the GSA were on the verge of a complicated deal in which GSA would have given the city the site in exchange for the city developing a lab for the federal government. But the two sides weren\u2019t able to get the deal over the goal line, and GSA ultimately opted to put the parcel on the block.Lakewood will still try to shape what happens on the site, but it isn\u2019t going to be as easy as it would have been if the city owned it, according to Jay Hutchison, Lakewood\u2019s director of public works.\u201cIt was difficult after a long, very focused challenging negotiation to have it crumble right at the end,\u201d he said.Critics say the sale of the Lakewood site to the highest bidder represents a squandered opportunity for the region.\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to create a mixed-use, mixed-income community,\u201d said developer Jonathan Rose, who is known in the region for such projects as the redevelopment of the century-old Denver Dry Goods Building into office, retail and both market-rate and affordable housing.Mr. Rose said he probably won\u2019t bid on the Lakewood site because he would likely be outbid by a developer who wouldn\u2019t include as much affordable housing.\u201cSomebody will pay more,\u201d he said.The Federal Center site has roots going back to the World War II era when the federal War Department acquired 2,100 acres to make and test .30 caliber rifle cartridges and other munitions. Over time the GSA, which came into existence in 1949, used it to house 28 different agencies.About a decade ago, the GSA determined the Lakewood parcel wasn\u2019t needed and began studying plans to sell. Those plans accelerated in 2013, when the Regional Transportation District opened the Federal Center rail station.Interest in the site appears to be keen. More than 75 interested parties showed up for a tour last month and several participated through a streaming video.The first round of bidding officially ends one week from Tuesday. The GSA retains the right to extend the bidding period to give people the right to resubmit bids after they see the top price in the first round, the GSA spokesman said.Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-18 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/click-to-bid-feds-selling-big-denver-development-site-online-1500370202", "news_title": "Click to Bid: Feds Selling Big Denver Development Site Online ", "keywords": "colorado,commercial property,denver,federal government,general services administration,online auction,property report,real estate,CBRE Group,CBG,General Services Administration,Denver Federal Center,Jay Hutchison,Jonathan Rose,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,social issues,welfare,social services,building construction,residential building construction,real estate transactions,office real estate,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "The dollar\u2019s doldrums are deepening.On Tuesday morning in Asia, investors dumped the U.S. currency after it emerged that Republican lawmakers were pulling the plug on a contentious health-care bill\u2014the latest sign that President       Donald Trump       is having trouble implementing his policy agenda.The selling followed data showing investors were already less bullish on the world\u2019s reserve currency than they have been in more than three years.The setback for Mr. Trump was \u201cjust the last straw,\u201d said       Andy Ji,        Asian currency and rates strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore. \u201cThe health-care bill is just a small part of the big puzzle.\u201dInvestors started selling the dollar soon after two GOP senators became the third and fourth Republicans to oppose the latest version of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, effectively killing Mr. Trump\u2019s top legislative priority.The failure suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s other legislative efforts, such as overhauling the tax code and implementing fiscal stimulus, might also encounter obstacles.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against six global counterparts, fell 0.3% in Asian trading Tuesday to a 10-month low. The index is heavily weighted to the euro and yen, both of which gained about 0.3% against the dollar.The dollar index has dropped 7.2% so far this year.Recent disappointing inflation data in the U.S. and the prospect of tighter monetary policy in other developed economies have also fed declines in the dollar.One sign of how much dollar optimism has evaporated is the falling number of net bets on the currency\u2019s strength by hedge funds and other speculative investors. The figure for the week ended July 11 was the lowest since June 2014, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Such bets had soared as the dollar index climbed to a 14-year high in the wake of November\u2019s presidential election, fueled by hopes that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed policies would stimulate the economy and force the Federal Reserve to accelerate rate increases, making the dollar more appealing to investors seeking yield.Some analysts said they believe the dollar has more room to weaken.U.S. inflation was flat in June compared with the previous month. Consistently low inflation readings could give Fed officials a reason to hesitate before raising rates again.\u201cFriday\u2019s inflation result was shock,\u201d said       Gareth Berry,        a foreign-exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Bank in Singapore, adding that the Fed\u2019s next policy statement scheduled for later this month could sound more cautious on the inflation outlook.The prospect of rate increases by other developed-market central banks may also curb the interest-rate advantage the dollar holds over its counterparts.The Bank of Canada raised rates for the first time in seven years last week, while top officials at the European Central Bank and Bank of England have hinted that they could also begin to tighten monetary policy in the near term.

When Microsoft reports fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday afternoon, its cloud businesses should remain a big growth driver\u2014especially in a period of weaker sales of personal computers. The company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment is expected to boost revenue by 9% year over year, according to FactSet. The Productivity and Business Processes segment, which contains important cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics and the newly acquired LinkedIn, is expected to grow revenue by 20%.The second point has been more of a challenge. The acquisition of LinkedIn last year added more than 10,000 full-time employees to Microsoft\u2019s payroll. That brought the company\u2019s total head count to more than 121,000\u2014not quite the record, as the ill-advised pickup of             Nokia                   in 2014 pushed the size of the workforce to more than 128,000. Microsoft has been working since then to bring that number down without substantial job cuts because growing its cloud business requires talent, and not the cheap kind.So investors shouldn\u2019t expect Microsoft to get much smaller, despite new layoffs numbering \u201cin the thousands\u201d reported earlier this month. An internal email from the company billed the move as an effort to \u201calign the right resources for the right customer at the right time.\u201d And it should be noted that Microsoft\u2019s efficiency hasn\u2019t been a big problem to date. Even with the head count boost this year, Microsoft\u2019s annual revenue per employee still ranks well above that of many of its big tech peers.Still, Microsoft has to mind its spending. Shifting to the cloud has trimmed the high gross margins of its legacy software business. That isn\u2019t a burden shared by its main cloud rivals Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet Inc.

Jerry Brown       scored a major win for his climate-change agenda Monday night when the legislature approved an extension of the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program.Mr. Brown had struggled to get Democrats on board, with some more business-friendly members concerned about the program\u2019s effect on jobs and some environmentalists objecting that it gives too much to industry. Under the program, California businesses pay for the carbon dioxide they emit while reducing the emissions over time. The state\u2019s goal is to cut emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.In the end, some Republican members\u2014enticed by measures such as a tax break for manufacturers and a fee waiver for rural residents\u2014joined Democrats Monday night to extend the program from 2020 through 2030. One Republican backed the measure in the Senate\u2019s 28-12 vote, and seven Republicans supported it in the Assembly\u2019s 55-22 vote. The GOP votes in the Assembly were critical to reach the two-thirds majority required for new tax measures.\u201cTonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time,\u201d Mr. Brown said shortly after the vote. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That\u2019s what good government looks like.\u201d\u2018Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action.\u2019Some Republicans sharply criticized the program, though, saying it will drive up gas prices and utility bills for California consumers.\u201cMark my words, today is the start of the next great California recession,\u201d said Sen.       Ted Gaines,        a Republican representing 11 rural counties in the state\u2019s northeast. \u201cI can\u2019t support this bill. I am going to protect California\u2019s poor and the working class, not double their fuel costs.\u201dMonday\u2019s two-thirds margin\u2014the threshold for new taxes in the state\u2014should insulate the program from further legal challenges like the one brought earlier by the California Chamber of Commerce. It sued the state, arguing cap and trade is an illegal tax on businesses, but the program was upheld by a state appeals court in April, and the California Supreme Court last month declined to hear the group\u2019s appeal.After the loss, the Chamber backed cap and trade as a better option than more-onerous regulations. Last week it endorsed the governor\u2019s plan.The legislative victory is a boost for Mr. Brown, who has played the role of global-warming crusader abroad but has struggled to enact pieces of his climate agenda back home. In pushing the program last Thursday, the 79-year-old Democratic governor warned of an apocalyptic future if climate change continues unabated.California began using a cap-and-trade program to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2013. The state imposes a limit on the CO2 that industry is allowed to release and then auctions or gives away permits for those emissions. Businesses are free to sell permits they don\u2019t need, allowing market forces to distribute and price these allowances.\u2018Mark my words, today is the start of the next great California recession.\u2019Money from the quarterly auctions, so far totaling $4.9 billion, will also go toward a state fund used for projects that include one of Mr. Brown\u2019s priorities: a high-speed rail train from Los Angeles to San Francisco.Legislators on Monday also approved a bill to address air quality in the state, backed by Democrats concerned over the environment. They also approved a ballot measure that, if approved by voters, will give Republicans in the state more say on how cap-and-trade funds are spent.Some members of California\u2019s Republican establishment had endorsed the plan in recent days, including former Republican Gov.       Pete Wilson       on Monday.State Sen.       Tom Berryhill,        of Twain Harte, Calif., the lone Republican in the state Senate to support the cap-and-trade measure, said the protections for small-business owners and rural Californians\u2014and his belief that the program is preferable to more-direct regulation\u2014won his vote.\u201cCap and trade fills a void created by onerous policies, a void that would otherwise be filled by regulations written by out-of-touch, unaccountable bureaucrats,\u201d Mr. Berryhill said.Write to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Votes Help Pass California Climate Measure.'", "news_time": "2017-07-18 01:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-legislature-approves-climate-change-measure-1500355679", "news_title": "California Legislature Approves Climate-Change Measure", "keywords": "california cap and trade,cap and trade,carbon dioxide,carbon emissions,climate change,co2,global warming,greenhouse gases,Jerry Brown,political,general news,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,air,water,land quality,regional politics"}, {"content": "GOP leaders abandoned their effort to dismantle and simultaneously replace much of the Affordable Care Act, after the defections of two senators left them short the votes needed to pass a new health bill.The White House released its road map for remaking Nafta, aiming to keep \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions and reduce the trade deficit.Chinese military drones have been deployed in the Mideast and Africa by U.S. allies blocked from buying American models.Venezuela\u2019s opposition called for a general strike and the U.S. threatened sanctions over Maduro\u2019s plans to rewrite the constitution.House Republicans are seeking to defund an agency that works to ensure the voting process is secure.New York prosecutors demanded records on loans to Trump\u2019s ex-campaign chairman Manafort.An ex-Texas police officer was indicted on a charge of murder in the April shooting death of a black teenager.Seoul offered to hold talks with North Korea.The U.K. and the EU resumed Brexit talks, with a focus on citizens\u2019 rights and British payments.Appeared in the July 18, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-18 00:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1500352113", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate GOP leaders gave up their effort to dismantle and simultaneously replace much of the Affordable Care Act, after the defections of two more Republican senators left the party short of the votes needed to pass President       Donald Trump\u2019s       top legislative priority of his first seven months in office.In a stinging defection for party leadership, GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas on Monday night became the third and fourth Republicans to oppose the latest version of the GOP bill, which would roll back and replace much of the Affordable Care Act.Senate Republicans had already lost two GOP votes, from Sens.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and       Susan Collins       of Maine, and the new opposition from Messrs. Lee and Moran meant Senate leaders didn\u2019t have enough support to advance the bill in a procedural vote.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) acknowledged the defeat. \u201cRegretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\u201d he said in a statement.In a strategy facing long odds, the majority leader said the Senate would instead vote in coming days on a bill the chamber passed in late 2015 to unravel most of the ACA, a measure former President       Barack Obama       vetoed in January 2016.Conservatives in both chambers and Mr. Trump have pressed to repeat the vote on the 2015 bill, which Mr. McConnell said would come as an amendment to the health-care bill passed by the House in May and would allow for a two-year transition.\u201cRepublicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before Mr. McConnell\u2019s statement.Mr. Trump had embraced the idea earlier in July when it was proposed by Republican Sen.       Ben Sasse,        who noted that 49 sitting GOP senators had voted for a sweeping repeal bill earlier.But many Republican senators have balked at this strategy, saying they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable rolling back the ACA without being able to tell their constituents what would supplant it.Mr. McConnell\u2019s latest tactic applies new pressure to conservatives who have so far blocked a bill they have said falls short of ACA repeal by offering them the chance to vote on exactly that. And while the measure is unlikely to become law, it also offers a way to move on from a bruising fight.With 52 Republicans in the Senate, Mr. McConnell needed to secure at least 50 GOP votes, with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting a tiebreaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the bill. The opposition from Messrs. Lee and Moran ended a frenzied period of negotiations aimed at shoring up faltering GOP support.\u201cIn addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn\u2019t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle-class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations,\u201d Mr. Lee, one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative Republicans, said in a statement Monday night.Mr. Moran said he objected to the process used to craft the Senate GOP health-care bill, which he said \u201cfails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address health care\u2019s rising costs.\u201dMessrs. Lee and Moran are likely to face backlash from Mr. Trump and his supporters, who were eager to see Republicans keep their seven-year promise to repeal the 2010 health law.Their move comes as a surprise to many in Washington, since Mr. Moran rarely breaks with GOP leaders and Mr. Lee has often voted in step with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who introduced a key measure that GOP leaders incorporated into the bill last week.On Monday night, the White House issued a statement that repeated a stance the president\u2019s officials have taken in recent days\u2014that GOP senators have no choice but to act.Number of insurers participating in ACA exchanges in 2017, by countyCounties at risk of having no insurer in 2018OneThree or moreTwo20 counties at risk", "news_time": "2017-07-18 00:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-senate-leader-mcconnell-abandons-health-care-bill-1500348064", "news_title": "GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell Abandons Health-Care Bill ", "keywords": "aca repeal,gop health care bill ,gop obamacare repeal ,mitch mcconnell ,republicans health care,republicans obamacare ,senate health care ,senate health law ,trump health care,Donald Trump,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration released its road map for remaking the North American Free Trade Agreement that aims to preserve \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, but steps back from some of President Donald Trump\u2019s most fiery campaign rhetoric on trade with Mexico and Canada.The blueprint for a new Nafta shows the White House trying to navigate the shoals of striking a deal with its closest trading partners that can pass in U.S. Congress. It contains nods to Mr. Trump\u2019s base of voters fearful and angry over lost U.S. manufacturing jobs\u2014including the broad objective for reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Nafta countries and an effort to retain rules that favor U.S. firms in government procurement.The plan also backs an unspecified mechanism to prevent countries from manipulating their currencies for trade advantage, an issue of increasing concern among lawmakers and some economists, though one less central to U.S. trade ties with Mexico and Canada. It also includes provisions meant to challenge Mexico on labor and environmental issues.In the 2016 campaign Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from Nafta, calling it the \u201cworst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.\u201d The plan released Monday didn\u2019t deviate substantially from established U.S. trade policy.The Mexican government welcomed the U.S. guidelines, and said it expects the three partners to be ready to begin formal negotiations by Aug. 16. The blueprint \u201cwill help set out more clearly the subjects to be negotiated and the timing of the modernization process,\u201d the economy ministry said in a statement.Canada Foreign Minister       Chrystia Freeland       said the country welcomed the opportunity to improve the existing Nafta framework. The government would do so \u201cwhile defending Canada\u2019s national interest and standing for our values,\u201d she said.The plan drew a muted response from wary business groups and Republican lawmakers, whose votes will be needed to pass any agreement signed by Canada and Mexico.Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, attacked the blueprint as vague and insufficient, indicating the challenge Mr. Trump faces in winning support across party lines. And some of the Nafta objectives laid out in the document could alienate officials in Mexico City and Ottawa, including a goal of eliminating a dispute settlement system that allows trading partners to challenge duties imposed by Washington on goods allegedly dumped at below market costs.The criticism underscores the challenge Mr. Trump\u2014or any president\u2014faces in negotiating a new deal in a heated political environment.Less than two years ago,       Barack Obama       hammered out the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 Pacific nations but couldn\u2019t get the deal to a vote in Congress as the 2016 election geared up.Mr. Trump\u2019s previous threats of withdrawing from the deal could still give him some leverage.Some issues show common ground between Mr. Trump, who has complained about unfair trade practices in Mexico, and Democratic lawmakers, who want much stronger labor and environmental provisions in Nafta to keep companies from cutting corners by moving abroad.In Monday\u2019s road map, the Trump administration backed much stronger labor standards in the new Nafta than the previous ones, which were added late in negotiations as a side agreement to win congressional approval of the original pact in 1993.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed strengthening of those provisions wasn\u2019t enough to draw the immediate support of Democrats, including those who supported Mr. Obama\u2019s policy and the Pacific pact.Sen.       Ron Wyden       (D., Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees trade, called the blueprint \u201chopelessly vague both in explaining how the administration\u2019s specific objectives will benefit the United States on key topics ranging from intellectual property rights and investment, to currency manipulation and government procurement.\u201dMr. Wyden\u2019s Republican counterpart, Sen.       Orrin Hatch       of Utah, applauded the administration\u2019s commitment to working with Congress but said \u201cfuture negotiating objectives must include stronger protections for intellectual property rights, upgraded rules and enforcement procedures for American exporters and investors, and improved regulatory practices that treat American goods and services fairly.\u201dRep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), the chairman of the House committee that handles trade, applauded the administration and said the objectives are an \u201cambitious standard for improving Nafta and make clear that the United States is seeking strong, enforceable rules that go beyond any agreement ever negotiated.\u201dIf the administration moves as quickly as officials have signaled, lawmakers and outside groups may have only a few months to influence the debate.U.S. trade representative       Robert Lighthizer       formally notified congressional leaders on May 18 of the president\u2019s plans to renegotiate Nafta, a step that, like Monday\u2019s publication of a road map, is required under the 2015 law known as \u201cfast track\u201d or trade promotion authority. The law allows expedited congressional consideration of trade deals, with an up-or-down vote and no amendments, if the administration follows certain procedures.\u201cWe clearly need to see more details, and I look forward to having further conversations with Ambassador Lighthizer,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.Under fast track, the U.S., Mexico and Canada may now begin talks in 30 days. U.S. officials say they would like to finish the talks by January, before the Mexican presidential campaign and U.S. midterm elections heat up.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty short period of time, but we also have a political problem\u201d in the Mexican elections, said       Carla Hills,        a lawyer and consultant who led Nafta\u2019s negotiations as U.S. trade representative under President George H.W. Bush.Faced with a drop in political support, the White House is focusing this week on \u201cMade in America\u201d products in an effort to shore up support among voters skeptical of free trade and globalization.The administration appears divided between \u201ceconomic nationalists\u201d who want to erect barriers at the border to defend manufacturing workers and business-friendly officials who say erecting barriers could hurt overall income and economic growth. The modest tone of the principles released by Mr. Trump Monday could be seen as a victory for the business-friendly wing of his White House.Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened during the 2016 campaign to withdraw from Nafta, which he called the \u201cworst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere,\u201d and as recently as April he considered pulling out of the pact before deciding, after a congressional backlash, to attempt a renegotiation.\u201cWe can keep the current benefits of the Nafta, enhance them with modern, new provisions, and proceed in a way that avoids disrupting the flow of trade and the millions of jobs it supports,\u201d said       Myron Brilliant,        executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business lobby. \u201cThe Chamber and its members are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\u201dBefore of the release of the negotiating objectives, Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau       said his country stood ready to begin talks \u201cas soon as its practical,\u201d with officials prepared to make changes that modernize the trade pact\u2014reflecting changes in technology and electronic commerce\u2014that improve the economic prospects for workers in all three countries.One area where the plan does embrace the trade warrior agenda is a proposal to scrap a special Nafta provision that has made it easier for Canada and Mexico to avert U.S. trade sanctions, the so-called \u201cChapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism.\u201d Canada in particular has made keeping Chapter 19 a priority.\u201cThere are some time bombs in here that will get people going in Canada,\u201d said Mark Warner, a Toronto-based trade lawyer with clients in the U.S. and Canada, pointing to the Chapter 19 issue.In Mexico, concerns that the Nafta renegotiation could prove damaging have diminished in recent months, and that has been reflected in gains in the peso, which is trading at a 14-month high at fewer than 18 pesos to the U.S. dollar. The peso hit a record low around 22 to the dollar in January as Mr. Trump prepared to take office, with investors spooked by the             Ford Motor Co.\u2019s       decision to cancel a planned $1.6 billion investment in a new plant in Mexico.Should the U.S. abandon Nafta and revert to import tariffs under World Trade Organization rules, Mexico would be allowed to impose significantly higher tariffs for U.S. goods than the U.S. would for Mexican imports, Mexican observers say. In the case of vehicles manufactured in Mexico, excluding pickup trucks, the U.S. import tariff under the WTO\u2019s most-favored nation status would be just 2.5%.The Trump administration on Monday highlighted a complicated set of rules that determine which products and components have enough North American content to be traded duty free across the continent\u2019s borders.Mexican officials say that they, like the Trump administration, are also open to reviewing the pact\u2019s \u201crules of origin,\u201d as long as proposed changes don\u2019t threaten to hurt investment by making it easier for manufacturers to bypass Mexico altogether if they\u2019re unable to import certain components from outside the region to make products bound for the U.S.\u201cWe need to make sure that there\u00b4s equilibrium, and avoid objectives that will be out of reach and affect productivity,\u201d a senior Mexican official said.But the Mexican auto industry, the country\u2019s largest manufacturing sector which accounts for about a third of Mexico\u2019s factory exports, doesn\u2019t want any changes in its rules of origin. Imported components from Asia represent less than 3% of a car\u2019s value, according to estimates from the Mexican government.U.S.-based car manufacturers also don\u2019t want significant changes to the rules of origin.The administration also wants to make Nafta the first U.S. trade pact to police \u201ccurrency manipulation.\u201d That would be a big deal\u2014and one that may be easy to reach, because neither Canada nor Mexico face such accusations, which are usually leveled at Asian trading partners. The goal would be to establish this as precedent for future trade pacts.\u2014Jacob M.
