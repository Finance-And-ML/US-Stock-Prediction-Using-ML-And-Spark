[{"news_time": "2017-07-22 18:08:00", "news_title": "U.S. Lawmakers Reach Deal on New Sanctions Against Russia ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Congressional negotiators reached a deal late Friday to advance a bill that would punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 election and restrict the president\u2019s power to remove sanctions on Moscow.It remained unclear whether President Donald Trump would sign the bill if it reaches his desk, which is now likely. Mr. Trump has said he wants to improve America\u2019s relationship with Russia and has been slow to embrace the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the election.The House is slated to vote Tuesday on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to guidance released by House Majority Leader       Kevin McCarthy       (R., Calif.). The new Russian sanctions, which passed the Senate last month in a 98-2 vote, have been held up in the House over disputes about a provision that would have prevented the House minority from introducing legislation to block the president if he chose to remove the sanctions.The new deal is a compromise between Republican and Democratic leaders. It also makes some concessions to oil-and-gas companies.\u201cThose who threaten America and our interests should take notice\u2014your actions have consequences,\u201d Mr. McCarthy\u2019s Twitter account posted on Saturday.The compromise legislation, which must pass the House and Senate, would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities and limit Russian businesses in the energy and defense sectors from partnering with U.S. citizens. It also would require the president to seek Congress\u2019s permission to relax any sanctions against Russia.The bill would allow a senator to bring up a resolution of disapproval if the administration moves to lift the sanctions, and it would expedite House consideration of such a resolution once it passes the Senate.Passing the bill before the August recess would give lawmakers a bipartisan victory to take to constituents back home, as they continue to tussle over health care and a tax overhaul. The legislation is expected to move forward, as the deal was negotiated by both parties and a similar North Korea sanctions bill passed the House in May with overwhelming bipartisan support.The White House hasn\u2019t said how Mr. Trump would respond if the bill reaches his desk.Spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       has said repeatedly that the administration objects to the congressional review provisions because they erode the president\u2019s power to conduct diplomacy.But a failure to sign the bill could prompt criticism that Mr. Trump is siding with President       Vladimir Putin       amid investigations into the Russian interference in the election and into possible ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia.Russia has denied interfering in the election. Mr. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia and has called questions about campaign associates\u2019 ties to Russia a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t return a request for comment about the new sanctions legislation.\u201cA nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message,\u201d Sen.

He played steady\u2014actually, a little better than steady\u2014golf, surviving just one bad hole to shoot a 66 and remain very much alive, just three shots behind Spieth.And yet this is the 23-year-old Texan\u2019s tournament to lose, as it has been since he survived the wrong side of the draw and braved the nasty winds and brutal rain over the first two days to carry a two-shot lead into the weekend. Now, after his second bogey-free round of 65, Spieth will take his lead into Sunday, which will mark his best chance to exorcise the ghosts of the 2016 Masters, 14 months ago.A win at the Travelers Championship last month, nice as it was, doesn\u2019t kill the demons that remain from coughing up a five-shot lead on the back nine at Augusta last year.Spieth on Saturday was every bit the Jordan Spieth of seven-and-a-half straight rounds at Augusta in 2015 and 2016, when he led at the end of every one. Three birdies on the front nine got him to nine-under par. Two more on the back got him to 11-under.\u201cPretty stress-free,\u201d he said of the round.Sure he seemed to be stepping away from his shots and remeasuring them a little more often than he had over the first two rounds. But all the same, he was slapping hands with the crowd, and telling his playing partner, \u201cNice shot, Kooch,\u201d using Kuchar\u2019s nickname, whenever the moment merited it. Sitting on a two-shot lead through the first 13 holes, he did what leaders have the luxury of doing. He aimed for the middle of greens and stayed of trouble.\u201cThat was smoke,\u201d he told caddie       Michael Greller       when his iron from 166 yards landed 12 feet below the hole on the 11th.While Spieth was tightening his grip on his first Claret Jug, his expected hunters never got rolling.Rory McIlroy       got as low as four-under on the front nine, but on the 10th hole he wedged out of one bunker into another a few yards ahead. From there he hit into a steep hill beside the green. He double-bogeyed the hole to drop back to one-under par at the very moment Spieth was headed in the other direction.Brooks Koepka, the U.S. Open champion, started strong with four front-nine birdies, but he couldn\u2019t get lower than six-under and finished six shots behind Spieth. He will play in the second to last group with the surprising 20-year-old Texan/Canadian Austin Connelly.South Africa\u2019s       Branden Grace       put a scare into the field and carded the first 62 in major championship history. The 29-year-old, who has a solid international career but just a single victory on the PGA Tour, took advantage of the day\u2019s calm, blue-gray skies. He torched the front nine in 29 shots, to get to five under on the day and one-under for the tournament. Then he carded birdies on 14, 16 and 17 with steady driving, killer iron play and essentially mistake-free putting to finish the back nine in 33 shots.Amazingly, Grace had no idea he was breaking a record until after his putt dropped on 18. \u201cI played flawless golf,\u201d he said.Alas, he started the day at four-over par so he will likely need another record-setting day to make up seven shots on Spieth.Or, maybe not. Spieth isn\u2019t afraid to admit that he sleeps a little less and gets his share of butterflies when he is in the final group on Sundays at major championships. This will be his fifth major with a 54-hole lead.He credits the worrying with a hairline that is prematurely slipping backward. Clearly the nerves got the better of him when he hit two shots into the water on the 12th hole at Augusta last year as he clung to a lead.Saturday evening, Spieth called last year\u2019s Masters a \u201chumbling experience that he learned from. \u201cLeads can be squandered quickly,\u201d he said, before adding,\u201d if I don\u2019t win tomorrow it has nothing to do with\u201d what happened at Augusta. \u200bWill he master those nerves Sunday here beside the Irish Sea? He missed a handful of 10-12 foot birdie putts on the back nine Saturday that likely could have put the tournament truly away. Then he drained one of them downhill on the 18th hole to get to 11-under par. Maybe this time it will be different? There is supposed to be some nasty British weather to contend with Sunday afternoon. If the forecast proves right, it will be far easier for him to come back to the field than for the field to catch him, and it is unlikely he can run away and hide.Spieth is always so interesting to watch. He stalks his shots when they leave his club and yells at his ball as it soars through the air toward safety or danger. He will be doing plenty of stalking and talking Sunday. If he can play through the bad memories of the 2016 Masters, he will get his third major before his 24th birthday.That would put him in the company of       Jack Nicklaus,        the only other golfer to pull off that feat\u2014and a step further away from the nightmare of last year at Augusta.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jordan-spieth-looks-to-beat-back-ghosts-on-british-opens-final-day-1500753982", "keywords": ["2017 british open,2017 open championship,british open,golf,golf major,golf tournament,major championship,royal birkdale,Matt Kuchar,Rory McIlroy,Jordan Spieth,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 14:53:00", "news_title": "Joseph Rago, Wall Street Journal Editorial Writer, Dies at 34", "content": "Joseph Rago, a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial writer at The Wall Street Journal who was known for his richly reported pieces and influence on policy makers, was found dead Thursday evening at his home in Manhattan. He was 34 years old.The New York Police Department found Mr. Rago dead in his apartment at 7:40 p.m., according to a police official. The authorities went to check on Mr. Rago after he didn\u2019t show up for work on Thursday. Paul Gigot, the editor of the Journal\u2019s editorial page, had alerted the paper\u2019s security officials, who then contacted the police.Mr. Rago was found with no obvious signs of trauma and emergency responders declared him dead at the scene, the police said.

He was the Journal\u2019s main editorial writer during the 2016 presidential campaign and did interviews with many of the candidates as well as filed colorful opinion pieces from the campaign trail.A native of Falmouth, Mass., Mr. Rago graduated with a degree in history from Dartmouth College in 2005. While there, he was a member of the Phi Delta Alpha fraternity and wrote for the Dartmouth Review, an independent conservative student newspaper. He served on the paper\u2019s board of directors at the time of his death.He remained active with the campus and in a 2011 videotaped interview there said he tried to stay in touch with students from all over the country and offer his advice.\u201cJournalism is a hard field to get into, and I caught a break and try to help other people,\u201d he said.In an interview, Peter Robinson, a former speechwriter to President       Ronald Reagan       and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said that attitude was typical of Mr. Rago, a longtime friend and 2010 media fellow at Hoover.\u201cJoe was an intellectual fighter but there was also just a wonderful sweetness about him,\u201d he said.He praised Mr. Rago\u2019s rigorous approach to opinion writing, saying Mr. Rago always presented the information readers needed to have to assess his conclusions.\u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cJoe was never just mouthing off.

But of all the successes in the race\u2019s \u201cFroome era,\u201d this one will go down as the strangest. When he rolls over the line on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he will become only the seventh man to win the Tour without a single stage victory. How is this possible? He kept his overall time lower than anyone in the race through unrelenting consistency in more than 80 hours of competition.Froome was always excellent enough this summer, though he never sparkled. There were no dramatic attacks in the mountains, no one-man displays of panache. Backed by his bruising cohort of Team Sky helpers on a course designed to keep the race close, he was able to grind his opponents away.\u201cOn this Tour de France, there wasn\u2019t one day where you could win it all,\u201d Froome said in French. \u201cWe needed to race for all three weeks.\u201dFroome made sure no one could yank the yellow jersey off his shoulders by coming in third in Saturday\u2019s stage, a 14-mile time trial that ended inside Marseille\u2019s V\u00e9lodrome soccer stadium.

But topping the wish list was cutting U.S. trade deficits with Mexico and Canada, an approach that has been criticized on grounds that trade policy isn\u2019t the cause of the deficits.\u201cI\u2019m not going to go and argue about whether it\u2019s right or wrong to define trade deficits as a goal, that\u2019s not my role in the U.S.,\u201d Mexico\u2019s Economy Minister       Ildefonso Guajardo       said in an interview.\u201cWe don\u2019t rule out the possibility of reviewing the trade balance among the partners of North America as long as any solution we propose is through expanded trade, not restrictions on trade,\u201d he said.The U.S.-trained economist said Mexico\u2019s recent opening of its energy industry to foreign investment is a case in point. Pipelines are being built across the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico is buying increasing amounts of U.S. natural gas. Foreign oil firms arriving in Mexico will need to buy imported equipment and machinery.Carla Hills,        the former U.S. trade representative who signed the original Nafta in the mid-1990s, said the broad U.S. objective to update the treaty were reasonable. John Melle, the assistant U.S. trade representative for the Western Hemisphere who will serve as chief negotiator for the Nafta talks, will have to balance the economics and politics involved in trade deals. \u201cI have a trade deficit with my grocer, and a surplus with my company, which pays me,\u201d Ms. Hills said. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201dThe U.S. had a $63 billion deficit with Mexico in goods trade last year. But the services sector, where Mexico runs a $10 billion deficit, must also be considered, Mr. Guajardo said.Adding e-commerce and energy provisions to the pact could help the U.S. narrow its trade gap, Mr. Guajardo said.Their inclusion, along with an update to intellectual-property rules, could bolster U.S. private-sector support for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to overhaul Nafta, said Jaime Zabludovsky, a member of the Mexican team that negotiated the original trade deal.Concerns that renegotiation could hurt Mexico\u2019s export-dependent industries have eased in recent months, helping the peso reach a 14-month high against the U.S. dollar, as bilateral relations have warmed after a rocky start under the Trump administration.A compromise agreement in June on Mexican sugar exports to the U.S. showed the two sides understand Nafta\u2019s complexity and commercial dynamics, Mr. Guajardo said.\u201cIt was the first agreement that the Trump administration closed with a foreign government regarding a conflict over trade practices,\u201d he said. The sugar talks helped officials such as himself and U.S. Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       to get to know each other.\u201cThe most important capital in a negotiation is the credibility of the negotiators,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said. \u201cIn the case of sugar we found that.\u201dMexico\u2019s private sector has also been lobbying U.S. policy makers to convince them of the benefits of Nafta, seeking support among U.S. governors, lawmakers and mayors, particularly in states that rely on trade with Mexico.\u201cWe have made progress in countering some points of the protectionist rhetoric, but we have to be on guard,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Kalach, a businessman who leads the effort. He put together a team of some 50 experts to prepare possible responses to different scenarios the U.S. might pursue.Mexico is open to reviewing rules of origin, which determine how much content of goods has to come from within the region to enjoy tariff-free benefits of the pact, Mr. Guajardo said.But revising rules of origin for thousands of products is detailed work. \u201cWe need to see what\u2019s happened in regional trade over the past 20 years. China and Vietnam weren\u2019t players back then, and some goods are no longer made in North America,\u201d said Mr. Zabludovsky, who is advising Mexican companies over Nafta\u2019s renegotiation.The timing of the talks\u2014which officials on both sides hope to complete by year-end\u2014is a challenge, with Mexico holding presidential elections and the U.S. midterm elections next year.\u201cIn a way, incentives have aligned,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said. The first round of negotiations will take place in mid-August in Washington.A bone of contention could be the U.S. goal of eliminating Chapter 19 of Nafta, a mechanism for challenging antidumping duties imposed by governments to protect domestic industries or sectors.The removal of dispute-settlement mechanisms could affect U.S., Mexican and Canadians exporters alike, Mr. Guajardo said. \u201cWe need to take care to preserve something that has been positive.\u201d\u2014Juan Montes and Robbie Whelan contributed to this article.Write to Santiago P\u00e9rez at santiago.perez@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-suggests-solution-to-u-s-trade-deficit-more-cross-border-commerce-1500743447", "keywords": ["cross border,export,free trade,import,mexico,nafta,negotiation,renegotiate,trade deficit,trade imbalance,trade talks,u.s.-mexico trade,North American Free Trade Agreement,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 12:10:00", "news_title": "Actor John Heard Dies at 72", "content": "NEW YORK\u2014Actor John Heard, best known for playing the father in the \u201cHome Alone\u201d movie series, has died.

A neighbor heard the screams, rushed to the home and opened fire, wounding al-Abed who was taken to an Israeli hospital, said the head of Israel\u2019s rescue service.On Saturday morning, Israeli troops searched the assailant\u2019s family home in the West Bank village of Kobar and detained one of his brothers, the army said. Video footage released by the military shows soldiers leading away a handcuffed and blindfolded man.The assailant\u2019s father said his son had been angered by the escalating violence at the Jerusalem shrine, known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as the Temple Mount.The Israeli army said it sent more troops to the West Bank and placed forces on high alert amid concerns of further violence. The Israeli daily Haaretz said several thousand more soldiers were deployed.Israel has repeatedly accused Mr. Abbas and his Palestinian Authority of permitting anti-Israeli incitement in the public Palestinian discourse.Michael Oren,        a deputy minister for public diplomacy, alleged Saturday that Hamas and Mr. Abbas\u2019 government are exploiting tensions to incite violence. He said claims that Israel intends to change delicate arrangements at the Muslim-administered Jerusalem shrine are \u201cemphatically untrue.\u201dMr. Oren also argued metal detectors are a routine security measure at holy sites around the world and Palestinian leaders seized on the issue as a pretext to whip up anti-Israeli sentiment.Israeli officials have said they would guarantee continued access to Muslim worshipers but haven't said how huge crowds could speedily pass through metal detectors during busy periods.Mr. Abbas has rejected Israeli incitement allegations, saying Israel\u2019s 50-year-old occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state is at the root of widespread Palestinian anger and helps drive violence.On Friday evening, Mr. Abbas announced that he would \u201cfreeze\u201d ties with Israel \u201con all levels\u201d until the metal detectors are removed from the shrine, but didn\u2019t say whether this means halting security coordination. Ending such ties would have far-reaching repercussions and sharply raise tensions with Israel.Even if largely meant for domestic Palestinian consumption, the Abbas announcement dealt a setback to fledgling efforts by the       Trump       administration to revive long-dormant Israeli-Palestinian talks on a peace deal.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-sends-troops-to-west-bank-forces-are-on-high-alert-after-attacks-1500735020", "keywords": ["attack,high alert,israel,israeli military,jerusalem,mahmoud abbas,noble sanctuary,old city,palestine,politics,religion,temple mount,violence,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,society,community,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 10:54:00", "news_title": "South African Breaks Record for Lowest Round in a Golf Major", "content": "Southport, EnglandBranden Grace,        a 29-year-old South African with a solid international career but just a single victory on the PGA Tour, set the record for the best round in a major championship Saturday, torching Royal Birkdale with an 8-under-par 62.Playing under rare calm, blue-gray skies and almost no wind, Grace played the front nine in 29 shots, to get to five-under on the day and one-under for the tournament.

BA 9.88%       is cutting workers at its fastest clip in more than a decade.The aerospace giant shed more than 6,000 staff during the first half of the year, some 4% of its workforce, through a mix of attrition, buyouts and layoffs, most of them at its big jetliner plants in Washington state.Boeing has said it needs to improve efficiency and rely on more factory automation to build the next generation of aircraft as it works through an order book of more than 5,700 jets.Executives said the cost-cutting drive was crucial to remain competitive with         Airbus               SE. Boeing\u2019s European rival has in recent years claimed more than half of the market for single-aisle workhorse jets, tilting the balance of what had been an evenly balanced duopoly for two decades.The job cuts at the world\u2019s largest airline manufacturer by revenue are most pronounced in Washington state, home to two of its three commercial jet-assembly plants. Washington\u2019s employment department said Boeing has issued layoff notices to 1,251 staff in the state this year, with the latest batch of cuts starting on July 21.Over the past four years, Boeing has reduced its Seattle-area workforce by more than 20,000, according to company records.The scale of the cuts have drawn fire from Boeing unions, which are concerned the company is diluting its engineering skills at a time when it is boosting aircraft production and transitioning to new models of two of its best-selling jets.While focused on the Seattle area, the job cuts also have extended to the plant in North Charleston, S.C., where President       Donald Trump       attended the February rollout of the new 787-10 Dreamliner, extolling plans to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs.Four months later, Boeing said it planned to lay off around 200 workers at the facility, adding to 700 who had taken buyouts. Employment at Boeing\u2019s Charleston-area facilities dropped to around 7,300 at the end of June from a peak of over 8,000 at the end of 2015.Richard Aboulafia,        an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said Boeing\u2019s warming relationship with Mr. Trump after a rocky start over the Air Force One replacement program helped provide some political cover for the job cuts. In December, Mr. Trump called for the cancellation of the order for a new Air Force One from Boeing, citing the cost.The stock is up about 36% so far this year, valuing the company at close to $129 billion. Boeing reports second-quarter earnings on July 26.More than 1,800 Boeing employees have accepted voluntary buyouts so far this year, with 3,000 taking that route in 2016, according to the company\u2019s two largest unions.Boeing declined to comment on the unions\u2019 numbers and said its work to increase efficiency is continuing. \u201cEmployment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs,\u201d the company said.Boeing hasn\u2019t detailed how many more jobs it may cut, but the existing pace has prompted local Seattle-area officials in March to seek an emergency grant from the Labor Department, said       Dot Fallihee,        interim chief executive of the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County. Ms. Fallihee said it would share over $300,000 with neighboring Snohomish County to support around 1,000 displaced Boeing workers with benefits such as retraining.The job cuts have led some critics to question tax breaks the company is receiving from Washington state as it moves some work elsewhere in the U.S. and prepares to open a new center in China to complete work on jetliners destined for that market.However, the congressman representing the area housing Boeing\u2019s big plants said the move into China reflected its status as a multinational company, even if it is the state\u2019s largest employer. \u201cAerospace is bigger than Boeing,\u201d said Rep.

Parliament passed the legislation early\u00a0Saturday\u00a0morning, and Mr. Duda\u2019s signature is now required to make the bill law. Previously, he has said he would sign it.The spokesman didn\u2019t specify the president\u2019s misgivings, but did mention a minor discrepancy between the two different texts passed by Parliament. Many analysts expect him to sign it.The 45-year-old leader\u2019s hesitation comes as denunciations pile up from foreign governments and local institutions over a move that has thrown a spotlight on a growing divide between Brussels and nationalist-tilted governments in the bloc\u2019s east.Tens of thousands of protesters have gathered outside his office this week, at one point spelling \u201cveto\u201d with candles.In a move some ruling party members said surprised them, the U.S. State Department\u00a0on Friday\u00a0said the law \u201cappears to limit the judiciary and potentially weaken the rule of law in Poland.\u201d\u201cThe fact that the legislative process is still under way makes any such pronouncements premature,\u201d Poland\u2019s foreign ministry said in reply in a statement.EU leaders have also criticized the bill, but their capacity to intervene is limited, highlighting the bloc\u2019s diminishing influence over some member states.More than 280 partners at Poland\u2019s largest law firms also asked Mr. Duda to veto the law in a letter. A top business lobby made the same request, saying the law would make Poland a riskier place to do business if elected officials held such sway over the courts. In a poll published\u00a0Friday\u00a0for private Polish broadcaster TVN24, 55% of respondents said the president should veto the bill; 29% said he should sign it.That has brought this country\u2019s post-communist democracy to a critical moment, 28 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Poland\u2019s ruling party says it is finally purging former communists from the judicial bench in favor of Poles who, in its view, didn\u2019t betray their country during the decades when it was a Soviet satellite.The ruling Law and Justice party says judges need to be more accountable to voters and the government they voted in two years ago with a parliamentary majority.\u201cWe will not give into pressure,\u201c Prime Minister       Beata Szyd\u0142o       said on state television on\u00a0Friday. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by Polish and foreign defenders of the interests of the elite.\u201dThe law\u2019s critics say its enactment would cement the devolution of Poland, the largest country in what was once Europe\u2019s eastern bloc, into a weaker democracy. The ruling party has already changed laws to give it more influence over state media and a introduced a tribunal that decides whether laws are constitutional.\u201cYou can basically build an authoritarian state from building blocks that exist in each democracy,\u201d said       Maciej Kisilowski,        associate professor of law at the Central European University in Budapest. \u201cI would expect this is maybe going to be the last controversial law from Poland.

In the statement the U.S. offered its condolences to the families of the security forces who were killed.While much of Helmand province is under the control of Taliban, Afghan national security forces have been waging fierce battles to retake territory. NATO and U.S. troops are in Helmand to assist Afghan troops.Mr. Safi told the Associated Press in a telephone interview that the dead were police officers who were operating with the army in the area. They had recaptured the post from the Taliban when the airstrike occurred, he said. On Friday, the Helmand Gov.       Hayatullah Hayat       said it was believed the police officers weren\u2019t in uniform, which may have resulted in mistakenly identifying them as Taliban fighters.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, in northern Badakhshan province Gov.

At such an event, specially elected delegates from the state\u2019s legislative districts can propose amendments to New York\u2019s constitution.Those favoring a \u201cyes\u201d vote include a coalition of conservatives and liberals who say they are frustrated with the status quo and want to bypass the governor and state legislature to make changes.The proponents are hoping the grass-roots activism and calls for radical change that buoyed presidential candidates       Bernie Sanders       and       Donald Trump       in the 2016 election could carry over into the referendum.On the other side, the governor, legislative leaders, New York City\u2019s mayor and other skeptics have suggested it could be a waste of time or money. The most ardent opponents, such as union leaders, have said it could be a danger.Backing \u201cno\u201d campaigns is also a coalition of some of the state\u2019s most influential groups, including Planned Parenthood, the United Federation of Teachers, and the Rifle and Pistol Association.J.H. Snider,        an expert on state constitutional conventions who is editing the New York State Constitutional Convention Clearinghouse, said lawmakers and the groups that work with them have an incentive to oppose the event.Fourteen other states have similar mechanisms in place as New York for amending their constitutions.\u201cIt\u2019s a legislative bypass that takes away their gatekeeping powers,\u201d Mr. Snider said. \u201cAny interest group that has invested heavily in a legislature and has a track record of success is going to view this as a Pandora\u2019s box.\u201dBy state law, New York puts a convention up for referendum every two decades. If \u201cyes\u201d wins, delegates would be elected next year and the event held in 2019. Amendments to the constitution would be codified only if they win another referendum.At New York\u2019s last referendum for a constitutional convention, in 1997, the issue was voted down. The state last held a constitutional convention in 1967, but none of its amendments was passed by voters in the later referendum.In struggling upstate areas, a push to divide the state into two autonomous regions through a constitutional amendment is gaining steam among conservatives.Its backers say the policies that work for New York City have hurt upstate New York, and splitting the two would solve the problem.\u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d said       Carl Paladino,        an upstate Tea Party conservative who backs the convention. \u201cThings can\u2019t get any worse.\u201dDownstate, liberal activists are pushing a variety of issues, including some that take aim at lawmakers, such as imposing term limits and campaign-finance restrictions.\u201cMost of the opposition is coming from groups for whom the current system is working,\u201d said       Evan Davis,        a New York City attorney backing the convention. \u201cBut for most people, state government is not going swimmingly.\u201dPoliticians, unions and others wary of the convention have expressed several concerns.Gov.       Andrew Cuomo,        a Democrat, said convention delegates could be people who already hold public office, as elected officials aren\u2019t barred from running for convention delegate roles. \u201cIf the convention is going to be run by the people who currently run the government, then I would say the purpose of the convention is basically defeated,\u201d he said recently.Senate Majority Leader       John Flanagan,        a Long Island Republican, warned a convention could be costly and said the money is better spent elsewhere. He also noted the constitution is regularly amended through another process, by which legislators put amendments on ballots.Senate Minority Leader       Andrea Stewart-Cousins,        a Yonkers Democrat, said \u201ccorporate interests\u201d could take over the convention. \u201cWhile the intent of one may be good, the reality is much different,\u201d she said.New Yorkers are still learning about the issue. In a Siena College poll this month, 67% of New York voters said they know nothing about it.Spreading the word, small donors and some wealthy activists have begun giving to \u201cyes\u201d campaign committees, while unions and other organizations fund \u201cno\u201d campaigns.A fundraising campaign for a \u201cno\u201d vote on the constitutional convention, New Yorkers Against Corruption, recently received $50,000 from teachers union NYSUT and $250,000 from health-care union SEIU 1199, state campaign-finance records show.The group has raised some $635,300 overall. \u201cOur coalition is robust and diverse,\u201d a spokesman said.A competing fundraising group for a \u201cyes\u201d vote, Committee for a Constitutional Convention, has raised some $67,000, mostly from individual donors giving small amounts.Separately, liberal donor       Bill Samuels       has given more than $100,000 to \u201cyes\u201d campaigns.Bertha Lewis,        the former chief executive of organizing group Acorn and a longtime liberal activist, is campaigning to hold the convention.She said \u201cyes\u201d activists, which span the ideological and geographical spectrum, are \u201cstrange bedfellows,\u201d but their alliance would end if a convention came to be. \u201cLet\u2019s have a fair fight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut first, \u2019yes\u2019 has to win.\u201dWrite to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-political-establishment-activists-spar-over-constitutional-convention-1500728401", "keywords": [" amendments,constitutional convention, legislature,Andrew Cuomo,Bertha Lewis,J.H.

But significant rent drops in neighborhoods such as SoHo have helped generate lease deals.\u2018If you are a tenant in this market that is highly sought after, you are in a good place for making better deals\u2019In SoHo, average asking rents on Broadway fell 16% to $667 a square foot from the second quarter in the previous year, according to CBRE. Rents on Spring Street decreased 22% to $828 a square foot, CBRE said.SoHo had 13 retail lease deals, for almost 80,000 square feet of space, signed in the second quarter, ranking among the busiest Manhattan neighborhoods, according to CBRE.Availability rates rose in seven of the 12 major shopping corridors tracked by real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield in the second quarter. Fifth Avenue between 42nd and 49th streets had the highest availability rate at 32.8%, according to Cushman\u2019s report.\u201cLandlords have become more realistic,\u201d said       Robert K. Futterman,        CEO of retail real estate services firm RKF. \u201cThey are willing to contribute to tenants\u2019 construction and make shorter-term leases or take a lower base rent just to get a 10-year lease.\u201dFor the past year to two years, there was a dearth of tenants looking for Manhattan retail space, but that has changed, said       Patrick A. Smith,        a vice chairman at real estate services firm JLL. More potential tenants, including those looking to explore new retail concepts, are touring spaces.\u201cA bunch of new tenants are sniffing around, coming into the market, primarily driven by price,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey believe they can come into New York at an overall occupancy cost they probably haven\u2019t been able to get in the past 10 years.\u201dYoung entrepreneurs and local or regional retailers are among the merchants viewing spaces, said       Chase Welles,        executive vice president at real-estate-services firm SCG Retail. Home-furnishing and do-it-yourself home-improvement retailers, many of which were once shut out of the Manhattan market, are scouting locations in Manhattan and surrounding suburbs, Mr. Welles said.\u201cThe rents are much more in line with the traditional percentage of sales they are used to seeing,\u201d Mr. Welles said. \u201cIn the past, to get into New York you would have to pay a greater percent of gross sales on rent.\u201dHow low prices can go depends on the particular retail corridor and how specific properties have been financed, brokers said. Owners who recently purchased and financed their properties based on achieving higher rent levels are much more aggressive in offering sweeteners such as free rent periods and allowances for improving tenant spaces.Some landlords who have owned their properties for some time and have more flexibility have been lowering the rents, brokers and analysts said.But other landlords who believe their properties are worth more than the rents tenants are offering to pay now also might wait a bit, said       Joanne Podell,        executive vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield.In some markets, such as Fifth Avenue between 49th and 60th streets, the availability rate rose 1.5 percentage points to 14.5% and the asking rent for ground floor space increased to $3116 a square foot, a 2.6% rise, according to Cushman.\u201cThat corridor, while there is more availability, people believe in the market and rents are going up,\u201d Ms. Podell said.Write to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Retailers Shop for Deals on Leases.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drop-in-manhattan-retail-rents-has-retailers-looking-1500724800", "keywords": ["asking rents ,ground floor spaces , landlords ,lower rents,manhattan,manhattan retailers,new york city,real estate brokers ,retail corridors,retail spaces ,shopping corridors,soho,stores,tenant incentives ,CBRE Group,CBG,political,general news,society,community,retail,wholesale,real estate transactions,office real estate,retail real estate,commercial,industrial real estate,real estate,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 07:08:00", "news_title": "Philippines Extends Martial Law in Mindanao", "content": "The Philippine Congress has overwhelmingly approved the president\u2019s appeal for martial law in the southern island of Mindanao to be extended to the end of the year, a boost to the massive offensive aimed at quelling a two-month siege by Islamic State-linked militants.250 miles250 kmPhilippine SeaManilaSouth China SeaPhilippines", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/philippines-extends-martial-law-in-mindanao-1500721726", "keywords": ["congress,duterte,isis,islamic state,marawi,mindanao,siege,Rodrigo Duterte,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 07:00:00", "news_title": "Why Vinyl\u2019s Boom Is Over", "content": "Folk music duo Gillian Welch and David Rawlings were frustrated by the quality of vinyl LPs being produced today.

The couple\u2019s first LP, a re-issue of their 2011 Grammy-nominated \u201cThe Harrow & the Harvest,\u201d arrives July 28.Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings have gone to extreme lengths to solve a problem many music aficionados say is an open secret in the music industry: Behind the resurgence of vinyl records in recent years, the quality of new LPs often stinks.Old LPs were cut from analog tapes\u2014that\u2019s why they sound so high quality. But the majority of today\u2019s new and re-issued vinyl albums\u2014around 80% or more, several experts estimate\u2014start from digital files, even lower-quality CDs. These digital files are often loud and harsh-sounding, optimized for ear-buds, not living rooms. So the new vinyl LP is sometimes inferior to what a consumer hears on a CD.\u201cThey\u2019re re-issuing [old albums] and not using the original tapes\u201d to save time and money, says       Michael Fremer,        editor of AnalogPlanet.com and one of America\u2019s leading audio authorities. \u201cThey have the tapes. They could take them out and have it done right\u2014by a good engineer. They don\u2019t.\u201dAs more consumers discover this disconnect, vinyl sales are starting to slow. In the first half of 2015, sales of vinyl records jumped 38% compared to the same period the prior year, to 5.6 million units, Nielsen Music data show. A year later, growth slowed to 12%. This year, sales rose a modest 2%. \u201cIt\u2019s flattening out,\u201d says Steve Sheldon, president of Los Angeles pressing plant Rainbo Records. While he doesn\u2019t see a bubble bursting\u2014plants are busy\u2014he believes vinyl is \u201cgetting close to plateauing.\u201dWhen labels advertise a re-issued classic as mastered from the original analog tapes, the source can be more complicated. Sometimes they are a hodge-podge of digital and analog. Often \u201clabels are kind of hiding what\u2019s really happening,\u201d says Russell Elevado, a veteran studio engineer and producer who has earned two Grammys working with R&B singer D\u2019Angelo.Mr. Rawlings says a Netherlands-based label, Music On Vinyl, used a CD to make vinyl copies of Ms. Welch\u2019s 2003 album \u201cSoul Journey,\u201d getting a license from Warner Music Group. Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings, who didn\u2019t have rights to release the album in the U.K., found out when fans saw the vinyl selling on the Internet. They successfully convinced Music On Vinyl to destroy the 500 copies that had been pressed, reimbursing the firm 3,300 euros for its costs. \u201cThis is commonplace,\u201d Mr. Rawlings says. A representative of Music On Vinyl could not be reached.\u200bMajor labels say they use original analog masters when possible. Sometimes tapes are too brittle to be used to make a vinyl master. Low-quality re-issues may be the result of less-reputable labels that can\u2019t afford to shell out big bucks for engineering and record-pressing, says Billy Fields, a veteran vinyl expert at Warner Music Group. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, the two other leading music companies, didn\u2019t make anyone available to comment.Today\u2019s digital files can sound fantastic\u2014especially for hip-hop and dance music. But engineers say they need to be mastered separately for vinyl in order to have the right sound. To meet deadlines for releasing new albums, labels can\u2019t always cut vinyl to the absolute best audio quality, says Mr. Fields, who declined to discuss specific examples on the record because it might alienate others in the industry.Another culprit for vinyl\u2019s slowdown is cost: Mr. Sheldon estimates vinyl has gone up four to six dollars per album in recent years. So-called \u201c180-gram\u201d or \u201caudiophile\u201d records, marketed as higher quality, can cost $30 to $40. Their heaviness makes them more stable during playing, Mr. Sheldon says, and such records might last longer. But any sound differences are \u201cvery marginal.\u201dAs low-quality vinyl proliferates, Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings are taking the high road.It took five years to get their record-cutting equipment up and running. Once they bought their lathe, they found a tech who gave up his job at a particle accelerator for the new job. \u201cThe scientists who developed how to cut good stereo were the brightest people in our country at that time,\u201d Mr. Rawlings says. With their trusted mastering engineer Stephen Marcussen, the team customized the lathe for Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings\u2019 sparse, haunting acoustic music.Songs are generally recorded in a studio digitally today. (In Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings\u2019 case, they chose to record using analog tape.) A mastering engineer then fine-tunes the recorded music to ensure the album, often the product of myriad studios, sounds consistent. Using a lathe, the music is engraved onto a \u201clacquer,\u201d the technical term for the master copy from which copies are pressed in plants.The goal is to put as much sonic information on the record as possible. A high-quality LP can give listeners the sensation of instruments or sounds occupying different points in space\u2014a \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d quality that Mr. Fremer says evokes a live performance. Ms. Welch likens it to the difference between \u201cfresh basil and dried basil.\u201dThe vinyl version of \u201cThe Harrow & the Harvest\u201d is \u201cmesmerizing,\u201d says Mr. Fremer, who heard a test copy. On Aug. 11, the couple, which often records as \u201cGillian Welch,\u201d will release a new album, \u201cPoor David\u2019s Almanack,\u201d under the \u201cDavid Rawlings\u201d name, before re-releasing more old albums. Having launched a label and souped up a derelict Nashville studio years ago, they may cut and re-issue albums by other artists, they said, effectively becoming a full-service, vertically-integrated\u2014if tiny\u2014old-school music company.Ms. Welch and Mr. Rawlings, whose careers took off as the CD era crashed into the age of iTunes, feel like putting out vinyl now brings them full circle. \u201cIt\u2019s like an author who has only ever released an e-Book,\u201d Mr. Rawlings says. \u201cYou see a book in print and bound and you feel like you\u2019ve finally done what you were aiming to do.\u201dWrite to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Why Vinyl\u2019s Latest Boom Is Over.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-vinyls-boom-is-over-1500721202", "keywords": ["david rawlings,gillian welch,lathe,o brother,sony,the harrow & the harvest,universal,vinyl,vinyl's resurgence,vinyl boom,warner music, where art thou,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 07:00:00", "news_title": "A Fitness Plan for Plunging Into Arctic Waters", "content": "To capture his award-winning photos,       Chris Burkard       has learned to find joy in Arctic waters and blizzard-like conditions. The 31-year-old self-taught photographer has a predilection for shooting surf in some of the world\u2019s stormiest, most remote coasts.\u201cI guess you could say I\u2019ve made a career out of being able to suffer,\u201d he says. His personal and commercial projects, for clients such as             Sony,       the North Face and Jeep, have taken him to the Faeroe Islands, Alaska, Iceland, Norway, Canada, New Zealand and Russia.For his film \u201cUnder an Arctic Sky,\u201d which is touring now and will be available online Sept. 5, Mr. Burkard and six surfers traveled to Iceland, hunting for waves through winter storms. Ocean temperatures hovered around 35 degrees, which the Pismo Beach, Calif.-based photographer considers \u201cnot terribly cold.\u201d\u201cGetting out of the water was the most brutal part,\u201d he says. \u201cWith windchill, the air was minus-20 degrees. Our wetsuits turned into blocks of ice.\u201dIt takes strength to snap just the right image. Mr. Burkard often finds himself treading water while dodging icebergs or trekking across waist-high snowbanks while he carries 100 pounds of camera equipment.Mr. Burkard credits a mix of climbing, bodysurfing and yoga with keeping him mentally and physically fit enough to get the jaw-dropping shots that have earned him 2.7 million Instagram followers. \u201cAll three activities sharpen body awareness, which is crucial to my job,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019m trekking or climbing over slippery rocks or even rappelling on a mountain with my camera.\u201dHis wife, Breanna, introduced him to yoga six years ago. \u201cYoga keeps me sane,\u201d he says. \u201cWe focus so much on physical health, but yoga also contributes to my mental health. I find myself in a lot of gnarly situations where I\u2019m out of my comfort zone. If I can breathe through them, I can stay calm and sometimes even find happiness in that moment.\u201dWhen home, Mr. Burkard tries to climb, bodysurf and practice yoga daily. He first started rock climbing in Yosemite National Park. These days he does the majority of his climbing at an indoor rock gym or on the climbing wall in his office to maintain upper-body strength.In the fall, peak surf season, he may bodysurf morning and night near the Pismo Beach Pier. He uses a handplane, a wood board between nine to 17 inches long that straps onto one hand, to create more planing action when bodysurfing waves. \u201cUsing your body rather than a board in the water teaches you the rhythms of the ocean and requires way more effort than just cruising on a surfboard,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot more fun than swimming. I used to swim one mile in a pool, but I probably cover that if I bodysurf for two hours.\u201dHe mixes up his yoga styles. Some are gentler and focus on breath, while harder styles also emphasize physically demanding postures. \u201cWhen I first started practicing yoga, the idea of sitting cross-legged and meditating sounded crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, I\u2019m way more open in my back and hips.\u201d He can hold a handstand or drop into wheel, an advanced back bend.Before a cold-climate assignment, Mr. Burkard will force himself to take frequent cold showers. He also performs breathing exercises on an app developed by       Wim Hof,        a Dutchman whose ability to withstand extreme cold earned him the nickname the Iceman.Mr. Burkard installed standing desks at his photography studio. In a pinch he\u2019ll go running, even though he loathes it. He says his hardest workout is chasing his 3- and 5-year-old sons.Mr. Burkard was a strict vegetarian for 10 years. \u201cI had more sustained energy without meat,\u201d he says. Today, he eats 90% vegetarian, occasionally allowing sustainably-harvested salmon and tuna into meals. Breakfast is usually oats with chia seeds and fruit, or a green smoothie with hemp protein. Eggs, avocado and brown rice are a frequent lunch.Mr. Burkard will stray from his diet when he travels. \u201cFood connects people. I never want to limit my experience or be inhospitable,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten reindeer, whale, seal.\u201d He has a weakness for gummy candy. \u201cI could crush a bag of Haribo sour gummies,\u201d he says.\u201cI\u2019m a function-over-fashion kind of guy,\u201d Mr. Burkard says. He is sponsored by Prana. \u201cThey make my go-to yoga and climbing pants,\u201d he says. He is a fan of La Sportiva trail sneakers and Black Diamond climbing shoes and clothing. A drop-in class at Harmony House Yoga in Pismo Beach costs $18. A monthly membership at Slo-Op Climbing in nearby San Luis Obispo costs $55. He travels with a lacrosse ball to roll out tight muscles and a Thera Cane, a DIY therapeutic massage tool (retail $40).Songs on his yoga playlist include \u201cTear of the Moon\u201d by Coyote Oldman, \u201cYawny at the Apocalypse\u201d by       Andrew Bird,        \u201cFollow the Sun\u201d by       Xavier Rudd,        \u201cAll Wash Out\u201d by       Edward Sharpe       & the Magnetic Zeros and \u201cOld Pine\u201d by       Ben Howard.Adventure photographer Chris Burkard jokes that his best images are often the result of the most suffering. Here, he shares some of the most extreme situations that he\u2019s endured in pursuit of the perfect shot.2009: While shooting images for the book \u201cRussia: The Outpost Vol. 01,\u201d Mr. Burkard was interrogated for six hours at customs in Vladivostok over a visa issue. He ultimately spent the night in jail and was then deported to South Korea. \u201cThe trip wasn\u2019t physically challenging, but the mental stress was brutal,\u201d he says.2011: On a winter surf trip to Vardo, on the border of Norway and Russia in the Arctic Circle, Mr. Burkard had to snowmobile to the waves. \u201cThe trek was hell on the body. We had to pare down all of our gear to reach the surf,\u201d he recalls.2013: Three years of planning went into a surf trip to Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands. \u201cWe arrived to find six residents, no roads and we only had half of our food supply,\u201d he says. \u201cTraveling to the beach required riding [ATVs] and being exposed to harsh conditions every day. The closest hospital was islands apart, so there was always the stress of: What if something goes wrong?\u201d2014: Mr. Burkard was surfing and shooting in Norway\u2019s Lofoten Islands, just inside the Arctic Circle, for the film \u201cArctic Swell: Surfing the Ends of the Earth.\u201d The water hovered at freezing and the air was minus-10 degrees with the windchill. He was borderline hypothermic when his friends pulled him out of the water.2015: Mr. Burkard\u2019s photo of surfer Timmy Reyes riding a wave in the glow of the Northern Lights in the remote Westfjords region of Iceland won the X Games Zoom photography contest gold medal. The image was taken while filming for \u201cUnder an Arctic Sky.\u201d \u201cWe barely slept, so we were mentally running on fumes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe temperature was minus-20 at times, and my gear was always freezing. You really felt at every moment that you might freeze to death.\u201d2016:Fitbit hired Mr. Burkard to capture inspirational images from three trails in Yosemite National Park to populate the Adventures feature in its app. He and his team spent two weeks hiking nearly a marathon a day while carrying 100-pound packs of gear. \u201cThe mileage actually wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d he says. \u201cLugging so much equipment really starts to tweak your shoulders and back.\u201dWrite to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-fitness-plan-for-plunging-into-arctic-waters-1500721203", "keywords": ["arctic,bodysurfing,cinematography,climbing,exercise,fitness,photography,pismo beach,san luis obispo,surfing,under an arctic sky,waves,what's your workout,yoga,Chris Burkard,aquatics,water sports,political,general news,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 07:00:00", "news_title": "Norway Takes Lead in Race to Build Autonomous Cargo Ships", "content": "OSLO\u2014Two Norwegian companies are taking the lead in the race to build the world\u2019s first crewless, autonomously operated ship, an advance that could mark a turning point in seaborne trade.Dubbed by shipping executives the \u201cTesla of the Seas,\u201d the Yara Birkeland now under development is scheduled in late 2018 to start sailing fertilizer 37 miles down a fiord from a production facility to the port of Larvik. Using the Global Positioning System, radar, cameras and sensors, the electric ship is designed to navigate itself around other boat traffic and to dock on its own.The vessel will cost $25 million, about three times as much as a conventional container ship of its size, but its backers say without need for fuel or crew it promises to cut annual operating costs by up to 90%. The 100-container ship is scheduled to be in the water toward the end of next year, though initially it will be tested with a human at the controls.The Birkeland is being jointly developed by agriculture firm Yara International ASA and             Kongsberg Gruppen AS      A, which builds guidance systems for civilian and military uses.Petter Ostbo,        Yara\u2019s head of production who leads the project, said the company would look to invest in bigger ships and use them for longer routes once international regulations are in place for crewless vessels. \u201cMaybe even move our fertilizer from Holland all the way to Brazil,\u201d he said.The International Maritime Organization, which regulates maritime travel, doesn\u2019t expect legislation governing crewless ships to be in place before 2020.Shipping executives say autonomous vessels will be popular for short sea routes, but doubt they will replace oceangoing ships that move thousands of containers across continents with an average crew size of around 25.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of technology, which is already there, but a business case,\u201d said       Lars Jensen,        chief executive of SeaIntelligence Consulting in Copenhagen. \u201cAutonomous ships are expensive to begin with, and have to be built very robust, because if they break down, the cost of getting a team to fix them it in the middle of the ocean will be very high.\u201dIn addition to reducing fuel and labor costs, the Birkeland project is being pitched as a way to cut emissions. The ship is expected to replace 40,000 truck drives a year through urban areas in southern Norway, the companies say.Ship operators increasingly are being asked to introduce cleaner fuels when sailing close to populated coastal areas, especially in the U.S. and Europe.\u201cWe want to go zero emission,\u201d said Mr. Ostbo. \u201cEven if some say climate change is not reality, it\u2019s a business reality because clean sources of energy are more affordable than fossil fuels.\u201dThe Birkeland will become autonomous in stages. At first, a single container will be used as a manned bridge on board. Then the bridge will be moved to shore and become a remote-operation center. The ship will eventually run fully on its own, under supervision from shore, in 2020.\u201cWhen the bridge goes on land, it will be something like flying a drone from a command center,\u201d said Kongsberg\u2019s chief executive,       Geir Haoy.       \u201cIt will be GPS navigation and lots of high-tech cameras to see what\u2019s going around the ship.\u201dThe Norwegians aren\u2019t alone in looking into autonomous shipping. British manufacturer Rolls-Royce Holding PLC is investing in similar technology and plans to launch robotic ships by 2020. The first vessels will likely be tugboats and ferries, with cargo ships that can sail through international waters to follow.\u201cOnce the regulation is in place, I can see this spreading fast,\u201d Mr. Haoy said. \u201cThere is a lot of interest from operators of coastal tankers, fish-transport vessels and supply ships that are knocking on our door.\u201dWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Norway Pioneers Crewless Ships.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/norway-takes-lead-in-race-to-build-autonomous-cargo-ships-1500721202", "keywords": ["autonomous ships,container ships,fertilizer,global shipping,Kongsberg Gruppen,KOG.OS,NO:KOG,Rolls-Royce Holding,Yara International ASA,NO:YAR,Petter Ostbo,chemicals,marine transport,autonomous driving technologies,agrochemicals,automotive,basic materials,resources,water transport,shipping,technology,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 07:00:00", "news_title": "\u2018No Rules: Helen Frankenthaler Woodcuts\u2019 and \u2018As in Nature: Helen Frankenthaler Paintings\u2019 Reviews: In the Restless Innovator\u2019s Studio", "content": "Williamstown, Mass.\u2018The only rule,\u201d       Helen Frankenthaler       often said, \u201cis that there are no rules,\u201d a dictum reflected in her notable adventurousness in the studio. Over her long working life\u2014born in 1928, she died in 2011\u2014she made paintings, works on paper and sculptures; worked in ceramic; designed ballet sets and costumes; and explored a wide gamut of printmaking techniques\u2014among other things.No Rules: Helen Frankenthaler WoodcutsAs in Nature: Helen Frankenthaler PaintingsClark Art Institute  Through Sept. 243This summer, two concurrent exhibitions at the Clark Art Institute offer a glimpse into this restless innovator\u2019s responses to different materials, approaches and methods. \u201cNo Rules: Helen Frankenthaler Woodcuts,\u201d organized by Jay A. Clarke, the Clark\u2019s curator of prints, drawings and photographs, and installed in the Manton Center, surveys the artist\u2019s transformative use of a time-honored medium through 17 large-scale works, from her first woodcut, made in 1973, to her last, printed in 2009. The title comes from an admonition in a 1994 interview to \u201cGo against the rules or ignore the rules, that is what invention is about.\u201d In the Tadao Ando-designed Lunder Center at Stone Hill, \u201cAs in Nature: Helen Frankenthaler Paintings\u201d assembles 12 major canvases from 1951 to 1992 for a staccato overview of her evolution, organized by guest curator       Alexandra Schwartz.       Both exhibitions, which bring together works from the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, the Louis-Dreyfus Family Collection, and the Williams College Museum of Art, are spectacular.Frankenthaler relished the challenges and exchanges of ideas inherent in the collaborative printmaking process. Excited by the unexpected and by new discoveries, she used multiple proofs to explore possibilities. Even when working with traditionally trained Japanese woodcut artisans, she was deeply involved, from start to finish, rather than making images for \u201ctranslation,\u201d as was usual. As a result, her woodcuts (like all her prints) enlarge the boundaries of the discipline. They depend on unprecedented contrasts of transparency and opacity, pools of layered color, delicate drawing, and gestures usually associated with painting, played against woodgrain and a variety of paper textures.Among the most striking works in \u201cNo Rules\u201d are the deceptively economical \u201cEssence Mulberry\u201d (1977), with its stand-off between saturated red-purple and the warm tan of handmade paper, and the virtuoso \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d (2000), with its subtle vertical divisions, like memories of the folds of a Japanese screen, and fluid runs of transparent color; this 6 1/2-foot-wide masterwork, we learn, required 102 colors, 46 woodblocks, and three sheets of paper. Six gorgeous prints from the series \u201cTales of Genji\u201d (1998), each roughly 4 feet square, are equally arresting, with their \u201cpainterly\u201d compositions and luminous hues, produced with anything from 34 to 53 colors and 12 to 21 blocks, plus stencils. The ravishing works in \u201cNo Rules\u201d both affirm Frankenthaler\u2019s pre-eminence as a printmaker and permanently alter our conception of what a woodcut can be.\u201cAs in Nature\u201d allows us to follow some of Frankenthaler\u2019s dominant painting concerns over five decades, beginning with the Mir\u00f3 and De Kooning-influenced \u201cAbstract Landscape\u201d (1951), a muscular, airy improvisation by an ambitious 22-year-old Bennington graduate who was pitting herself against the best art on view in her native New York and already finding her own voice. We see her preternatural alertness to the expressive character of her materials in early paintings breathed into being with her influential method of staining with thinned-out oil paint, and in crisper, more nuanced, later compositions in acrylic. We admire the lyrical, operatic Frankenthaler in the enormous, radiant \u201cOff White Square\u201d (1973), with its sweeps of pink, mauve-gray and yellow animated by the pulse between the eponymous white square and a half-hidden darker one. (Frankenthaler always described herself as \u201ca space-maker.\u201d) We meet the tough, truculent painter of the ocean-gray \u201cTethys\u201d (1981), with its hovering, dense ovals, the playful author of the sharp-edged \u201cScorpio\u201d (1987), with its discs and bubbles, and the brooding creator of the stormy, thickly brushed \u201cBarometer\u201d (1992), one of her last canvases.Occasionally, as is typical of Frankenthaler, elusive images seem to assert themselves and then subside into the abstract construction of unnameable hues. The exhibition\u2019s curator interprets this as evidence of a struggle between abstraction and references to nature, an idea she supports by identifying presumed allusions to landscape in the paintings, prompted by Frankenthaler\u2019s titles. (In fact, the artist attached titles after the fact, choosing them from an ongoing list of possibilities.) As a thesis, this view is somewhat over-determined. That Frankenthaler was acutely aware of everything around her, both in nature and the built-environment, among many other things, is hardly news. Neither is the fact that her feelings about experiences of all kinds informed her work, as is true for many artists. But both \u201cNo Rules\u201d and \u201cAs in Nature\u201d are full of wonderful works to be studied and savored.

If convicted on all counts, Mr. Gasperini could face up to 70 years in prison.Simone Bertollini, Mr. Gasperini\u2019s lawyer, sought to dismiss the case before trial, arguing the alleged crime didn\u2019t have enough of a connection to the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s basically government overreaching to civil matters abroad,\u201d Mr. Bertollini said.The trial will give jurors a detailed look at how attackers infect a network of computers with malicious software. Such networks, known as botnets, allow hackers to remotely control the computers and command them for criminal purposes, including to steal banking credentials, launch denial-of-service attacks and transmit viruses.Law-enforcement officials say botnets play an increasing role in a wide range of crimes, heightening concerns that U.S. laws lag too far behind cybercriminals. Botnets have fueled a surge in ransomware\u2014which encrypts and hijacks files on a computer system and demands money in exchange for decrypting them\u2014attacks that have crippled computers and businesses around the world.Justice Department officials have urged Congress in recent years to modernize laws that fight cybercrime, including to criminalize the renting and selling of botnets. The primary computer-hacking statute in the U.S., which was used to charge Mr. Gasperini, was passed in the 1980s and hasn\u2019t been amended since 2008.In this case, prosecutors say Mr. Gasperini illegally installed malicious software on servers around the world, including in the U.S., that gave him remote access, constituting a botnet. Mr. Gasperini then installed computer scripts that caused the servers to automatically \u201cclick\u201d on website ads, appearing to advertising companies as clicks from human customers, according to the indictment.Mr. Gasperini registered various websites in his name and contracted with an online advertising company in Italy to earn money every time an ad on one of his websites received a click, prosecutors say.Beyond advertising companies, Mr. Gasperini is also accused of defrauding U.S. businesses that were paying for advertisements.The trial testimony could feature some major U.S. companies. In a court filing last week, the defense asked the judge to stop jurors from hearing any evidence related to approximately two dozen companies, including             Walt Disney Co.      ,             Procter & Gamble Co.       and             Nike Inc.       Representatives for the companies didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The filing didn\u2019t specify what evidence is connected to these companies, and the government has declined to comment. The companies weren\u2019t named in the indictment.Based on court filings, Mr. Gasperini\u2019s defense will likely use their own technical experts at trial to undermine the government\u2019s forensic evidence and raise questions about the authenticity of online communications.\u201cAnyone can open an email account with any name,\u201d Mr. Bertollini wrote in a court filing.The government hasn\u2019t stated how much Mr. Gasperini profited from the alleged scheme. The indictment says Mr. Gasperini obtained information worth more than $5,000, but prosecutors wrote in a court filing that they are \u201cnot obligated to allege a loss amount.\u201dMr. Gasperini\u2019s lawyer said the government has no proof Mr. Gasperini took any information of value.Corrections & Amplifications   Law-enforcement officials believe the case against Fabio Gasperini is the first click-fraud case in the U.S. to go to trial.

Saturday\u2019s agreement will provide budget support for 2,575 public-sector positions, including police and airport personnel.The approval of the supplementary budget, which totals roughly 11 trillion Korean won, comes as South Korea faces slowing growth at its large conglomerates, an economic standoff with its biggest trading partner China, a declining population and growing concerns of U.S. trade protectionism.Domestically, South Korea is tackling challenges from youth unemployment, an issue Mr. Moon has said could become a \u201cnational disaster\u201d unless urgently addressed. Half of the country\u2019s roughly 1 million unemployed workers are between 15 and 29 years old.A spokesman for the presidential Blue House said in a press release that the extra budget will ensure the creation of more quality jobs and improve employment.The plenary session to pass the bill came to a standstill early Saturday after members of the conservative opposition party walked out, depriving the legislature of a quorum. The bill was ultimately passed just before noon with 140 votes in favor, 31 against and eight abstentions.Write to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Seoul Law Aims for Growth.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-koreas-budget-gets-nearly-10-billion-boost-1500707064", "keywords": [" moon jae-in,south korea budget, south korea economy, south korea president, supplementary budget,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-22 02:32:00", "news_title": "Poland\u2019s High-Court Move Unnerves EU, but Not Many Voters ", "content": "WARSAW\u2014Poland is giving the government sweeping powers over its judiciary, a move that is rattling European Union leaders and U.S. diplomats but hasn\u2019t shifted voters much at home.Opinion polls show steady support for Law and Justice, Poland\u2019s ruling faction, since the 2015 election.\u00a0Prior to the Senate passing a law early Saturday giving the ruling party the right to dismiss the entire Supreme Court, a survey by Warsaw-based research institution Ibris showed that\u00a037% of Poles continue to back the party, a 16-point lead over the next nearest competitor.More than half of Poles,\u00a0including many young people,\u00a0say they don\u2019t like the party, but they can\u2019t agree on whom they do like.\u201cWe feel outraged and desperate because we think that we can\u2019t do anything and our government doesn\u2019t listen to us,\u201d said Aldona, a 34-year-old who was protesting against the dismissal of the country\u2019s high court on Friday.Young people are also the most likely to tune out. \u201cEven among my friends, there are many people who don\u2019t respect democracy,\u201d said Wladek Chilmon, a Ph.D. student studying Turkish politics. \u201cThey say \u2018who cares? What is this democracy good for?\u2019 Maybe it\u2019s better to have someone with strong ideas run this country.\u201dThat\u00a0highlights one of the sources of strength\u00a0for populist governments on the EU\u2019s eastern edge\u2014and of frustration for EU leaders.\u00a0Voters who elected Law and Justice two years ago to upset the system are happy to see their leaders challenge the norms of European democracy. The remainder of voters aren\u2019t coalescing into a real backlash as the former communist country clocks some of the developed world\u2019s fastest economic growth. \u00a0Apathy, not opposition, appears to be the rising political force, say legal scholars.\u201cWe have two Polands at the moment,\u201d said Marcin Matczak, professor of separation of powers law at the public University of Warsaw.\u00a0There is a Poland that is tuned into the momentous political change, he added \u201cand there is a Poland that doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re on holiday.\u201dPoland has been a star economic performer in Europe and the right to travel has transformed a country once shuttered behind the Iron Curtain. Young people, those most opposed to the ruling party, have, in some ways, been the biggest beneficiaries of Poland\u2019s modern freedoms and wage growth.But those same windfalls may have given Law and Justice the political room it needs to change Poland without\u00a0voters taking much notice.On Thursday, the lower house of parliament easily approved the bill, which allows government to dismiss the entire Supreme Court. The Senate passed it Saturday.\u00a0President       Andrzej Duda       has said he would sign it, likely within days.Law and Justice says voters sent them to shake up a stagnant oligarchy whose elites, including Supreme Court judges, haven\u2019t been answerable to the public.\u00a0Since voters chose the party, judges should be accountable to it, Law and Justice says.\u201cWe are changing the model from a corporatist model to a democratic model,\u201d said Deputy Minister Marcin Warchol in a speech to Poland\u2019s\u00a0Senate during the debate. \u201cWe will meet the expectations of our citizens.\u201dThat is a very different model from the one Poland\u2019s post-communist founders largely established. In the early 1990s, as Poles drafted their constitution, the country\u2019s judiciary was insulated from elected officials: Five decades of politically motivated trials had left some uneasy with the notion of a judiciary answerable to government.Poland\u00a0was drawing a \u201cthick line\u201d in its history,\u00a0Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said at the time. The state wouldn\u2019t seek to purge people for the morally complex decisions they made under communism, he said. But many Poles felt that approach let communists go free\u2014and even stay in power.The party\u2019s critics view the emptying out of the country\u2019s top court as overreach: The justice minister would be free to unilaterally appoint, or dismiss, interim judges who could spend years deciding the most important cases, such as election results. But the ruling party has explained its reforms as a long-overdue chance to finish a purge that should have occurred in the 1980s.Prime Minister       Viktor Orban       of Hungary\u2014another EU member whose policies have sparked criticism among the bloc\u2019s leaders\u2014has pursued much of the same argument in cementing control over government agencies that regulate business and politics. There, as in Poland,\u00a0voters, particularly young people, have turned away from\u00a0the governing party, but have failed to form a common front.Write to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.comAppeared in the July 22, 2017, print edition as 'Polish Party Backers Hold Steady.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-high-court-move-unnerves-eu-but-not-many-voters-1500667642", "keywords": [" eu, european union,poland, polish senate, protestors, supreme court, voter poll,European Union,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,judicial branch,upper house"]}]
