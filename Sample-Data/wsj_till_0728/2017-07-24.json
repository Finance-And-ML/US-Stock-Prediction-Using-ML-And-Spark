[{"news_time": "2017-07-24 22:40:00", "news_title": "Mostly Mozart Festival Gives Other Artists Some Play", "content": "True to its name, Lincoln Center\u2019s Mostly Mozart Festival features no shortage of works by its namesake composer.But these days, the festival, which kicks off Tuesday\u00a0night, is taking especial liberty with the \u201cmostly\u201d side of its programming, going beyond traditional symphonic repertoire to incorporate contemporary music, opera and other types of presentations.\u201cIt\u2019s not the Mozart with the wig and the little buckled shoes we\u2019re trying\u201d to invoke, said       Jane Moss,        Lincoln Center\u2019s artistic director.The 2017 edition of Mostly Mozart, which runs through\u00a0Aug. 20, includes everything from an accordion recital to a concert by the So Percussion ensemble featuring works by the avant-garde musical pioneer       John Cage.There are also innovative programs that go beyond the strictly musical. Consider a theatrical-style presentation of the Schubert song cycle, \u201cWinterreise,\u201d that incorporates films, projections and stage design.And while the opening-night program, featuring the Young People\u2019s Chorus of New York City in its debut at the festival, has its share of Mozart, it also explores other terrain. The chorus will offer a variety of other works, from traditional spirituals to a song from the Amazonian rainforest.Festival programmers say the eclectic approach is necessary to keep the event, which bowed in 1966, fresh and relevant for a new generation of concertgoers.They also say that while a lot of the concerts may not have an overt Mozart connection, there is still a musical thread of sorts.In the case of the accordion recital and the percussion program, they are part of a late-evening series, dubbed \u201cA Little Night Music.\u201d The idea is to re-create the intimately scaled salon-style concerts of Mozart\u2019s heyday, but in a contemporary context.Although Ms. Moss and other Lincoln Center officials didn\u2019t provide revenue figures, Ms. Moss says festival ticket sales have gone up in recent years. Still, Ms. Moss concedes Mostly Mozart\u2019s new-school programmatic approach may not appeal to everyone, noting that she received one recent complaint from a festivalgoer about the lack of an all-Mozart program on this season\u2019s schedule.Johanna Keller,        a veteran arts writer and educator, says Mostly Mozart\u2019s previous approach, which emphasized its namesake composer and other mainstream classical fare, simply wore out its welcome.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to stick with a programming formula when it outlives it usefulness or currency,\u201d Ms. Keller said.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Mozart Festival Branches Out Beyond the Old Master.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mostly-mozart-festival-gives-other-artists-some-play-1500950400", "keywords": ["lincoln center,mostly mozart festival,mozart,music festival,new york city culture,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,music"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 22:30:00", "news_title": "Barnes & Noble Investor Presses for Bookseller\u2019s Sale ", "content": "An activist investor wants             Barnes & Noble Inc.        BKS -3.61%       to try again to sell itself, arguing the bookseller needs an owner who can invest in its beleaguered operations.Sandell Asset Management Corp. has recently started buying a stake in the New York bookstore chain and is already among its 10 biggest investors,\u00a0according to people familiar with the matter.Sandell believes the company could attract a bid of more than $12 a share, compared with a closing price Monday of $7.10, according to a letter\u00a0reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that is to be released Tuesday.Even though physical bookstores have declined in popularity in the U.S. in the internet age, Sandell reckons they aren\u2019t going away and that Barnes & Noble\u2019s status as the only national chain could attract a well-heeled private-equity firm or another retailer.Barnes & Noble declined to comment.The company has explored several possible deals to sell or break itself up over the years, including a buyout attempt by its chairman,       Leonard Riggio.       But none of the plans came to fruition and the stock has slumped 60% in the past two years, with the company\u2019s market value plunging to just above $500 million.Like many retailers, Barnes & Noble has struggled to compete with             Amazon.com Inc.,       which dominates the online sale of physical and digital books.\u00a0For the fiscal year ended\u00a0in April, Barnes & Noble\u2019s revenue declined 6.5% to $3.9 billion, while earnings rose to $22 million. The bookseller, which currently has more than 600 stores, said it expects sales at stores open at least a year to show a percentage drop in the low single digits in fiscal 2018.In June,       Demos Parneros,        the retailer\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe\u2019re examining every aspect of the business and our customer value proposition.\u201d Mr. Parneros, who had spent nearly 30 years at\u00a0office-supply retailer\u00a0            Staples Inc.,       joined Barnes & Noble in November 2016 and was named chief executive in April. He is the chain\u2019s fifth CEO\u00a0in four years.Sandell believes\u00a0Barnes & Noble investors are\u00a0overreacting to the broader retail malaise, according to the letter. The activist says it takes solace in Amazon\u2019s planned purchase of             Whole Foods Market Inc.       as well as the recent proposed leveraged buyout of Staples, arguing those deals show there is still value in traditional retail.Attempts to sell the company date back to at least 2010. After the company announced a sale process that year, Mr. Riggio, then and now the largest shareholder, said he was considering forming an investor group to buy the business.In May 2011,       John Malone\u2019s            Liberty Media Corp.offered $1.02 billion. Ultimately, Liberty Media invested $204 million and received two board seats. One of those directors remains in place.Nearly\u00a0two years later, Mr. Riggio said he was interested in buying Barnes & Noble\u2019s consumer bookstores. Later that year, he dropped those plans.Since then, Barnes & Noble spun off its college-bookstore business, which now has a market value of more than $330 million.The bookseller has also come under pressure from an activist investor before. In 2009,       Ronald Burkle      began accumulating shares and eventually waged a proxy fight, which he lost. Any new shareholder fight at the next annual meeting, likely in September, would have to be started next month.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com and Jeffrey A.

Dannel Malloy       for the fourth time since he took office in 2011.The veto override by the state House of Representative and state Senate, both controlled by Democrats, gave final approval to legislation that loosens the state\u2019s affordable-housing standards.The House passed the override legislation in a vote of 101 to 47, while the Senate passed it 24 to 12. A veto override required at least 101 votes in the House and 24 in the Senate.Lawmakers who support the bill said it gives local municipalities more control over housing policy. Republican House Minority Leader       Themis Klarides,        who voted in favor of it, said the housing needs of Connecticut vary town by town and city by city.\u201cIt is really a local control issue,\u201d Ms. Klarides said. \u201cThey need to have more control over their own destinies.\u201dMr. Malloy, a Democrat, has said the bill would damage the state\u2019s efforts to end discriminatory policies of the past such as redlining and could erect new barriers for minorities and low-income residents to find places to live.\u201cThe best interests of our residents and communities were not served by this action,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Malloy said Monday, referring to the veto override. \u201cThe final votes by the House and Senate move the state in wrong direction.\u201dConnecticut enacted a law in 1990 to discourage the use of exclusionary zoning and to spur the development of affordable housing. The law gave real-estate developers the ability to appeal when their affordable-housing project applications were denied by local planning and zoning agencies.Under the law, developers could challenge the rejection of a local zoning board when less than 10% of the housing stock in a town was deemed affordable. Developers typically must go to court and argue that the municipality acted illegally or abused its discretion in a land-use appeal.The 1990 law puts the burden of proof on cities and towns to defend their decision.The law\u2019s effect on housing is an open question. The state\u2019s Office of Legislative Research has said it is \u201cdifficult to determine the number of units added to the state\u2019s housing stock under the procedure because no state agency keeps statistics on the number of units built following a successful appeal.\u201dApart from this specific law, the state developed 18,500 units of affordable housing since Mr. Malloy took office in 2011.The bill passed by the Legislature Monday makes it easier for a municipality to qualify for a moratorium on that 10% rule. It also expands what types of housing qualify as affordable to include resident-owned mobile homes.Democratic Speaker of the House       Joe Aresimowicz,        a Democrat who voted in favor of the proposal, said the changes to current law are only slight. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are putting borders around towns to say we don\u2019t want people that need affordable housing,\u201d Mr. Aresimowicz said.But other Democrats said the bill sent the wrong message and could reverse the state\u2019s progress at supplying homes for low- and middle-income residents.\u201cI just feel that it is going to push us backward,\u201d said state Rep.       Patricia Billie Miller,        a Democrat who voted against the measure. \u201cIt is going to open up the door for other things to happen.\u201dWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Connecticut Legislature Overrides Malloy on Housing Measure.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-house-overrides-malloy-veto-on-affordable-housing-law-1500938069", "keywords": [" affordable housing bill, connecticut affordable housing law, connecticut state house,dannel malloy, gov. dannel malloy,joe aresimowicz, patricia billie miller, themis klarides, veto override,Dannel Malloy,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,social issues,welfare,social services,building construction,residential building construction,construction,real estate"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 21:47:00", "news_title": "John McCain to Return to the Senate on Tuesday as Health Vote Looms ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen.

Bradley Jr., 60 years old, told investigators that he had no idea that anyone had been hiding in his sweltering truck and only discovered them after he pulled over to use the bathroom, according to court filings.Mr. Bradley, who faces one count of illegally transporting aliens, made an initial court appearance on Monday and is being held without bond. A federal public defender representing Mr. Bradley didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and it wasn\u2019t yet clear how the trucker would plead to the charge.Under federal law, he could receive the death penalty if he is found guilty because the smuggling resulted in deaths.Federal authorities said there were at least 100 people crammed into the back of Mr. Bradley\u2019s big rig.Over the past several weeks, several large scale smuggling operations have also been foiled in Texas. In Houston, police rescued 12 people, including a girl, from the hot cargo bay of a box truck after they had spent hours banging on the wall for help. Three people were charged with human smuggling, the local prosecutor said.On July 7, Border Patrol agents discovered 72 migrants locked in the back of white tractor-trailer they had pulled over near Laredo, Texas. The next day, agents working in the same area discovered 33 migrants in a tractor trailer they were inspecting. In both cases, the drivers, U.S. citizens, were arrested.Mr. Bradley told investigators he had been delivering a trailer from Schaller, Iowa, to Brownsville, Texas, and had stopped at a             Wal-Mart                   store in San Antonio after getting his truck detailed near Laredo.When he got out, he said, he heard banging and shaking from the trailer and \u201cwas run over by \u2018Spanish\u2019 people\u201d who rushed from the truck and knocked him to the ground, according to an affidavit.Mr. Bradley said he tried to administer aid to people who had been hiding in the back of the truck and quickly realized that at least one person was dead. He didn\u2019t call police and called his wife but she didn\u2019t answer, according to court filings.After being alerted to the horrific scene by a Wal-Mart employee, police and rescuers rushed to the area and began pulling people from the back of the truck, many of them stricken with heat exhaustion and severely dehydrated.Eight people were found dead and federal immigration enforcement authorities said that two more people died since being hospitalized, bringing the death toll to 10. About 30 individuals were taken to area hospitals and many were initially in serious or critical condition, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said Sunday.Several of the undocumented immigrants taken from the trailer described in disturbing detail their journey to investigators with the U.S. Homeland Security Department. Their jarring accounts were included in court filings.One man\u2019s trip started in his home in Aguascalientes, Mexico, from where he had traveled to Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, hoping to get smuggled to San Antonio.He said he first had to shell out 12,500 pesos ($706) to smugglers so he could get on a raft with a group of nearly 30 others to cross the Rio Grande. The man said that after being ferried across the river, he and the others walked until the next day when they were picked up by cars and taken to the trailer, which had some 70 people already packed inside.During the first hour of the trip, the man said everyone seemed to be OK.\u201cLater, people started having trouble breathing and some started to pass out,\u201d the man told investigators. \u201cPeople began hitting the trailer walls and making noise to get the driver\u2019s attention.\u201d But the driver never stopped, the man said.\u201cPeople had a hole in the trailer wall to provide some ventilation and they started taking turns breathing from the hole,\u201d he told investigators.Suddenly, the driver braked, the man said, the rear door opened and people swarmed out of the back of the truck where six sport-utility vehicles were waiting. The vehicles filled with people in a matter of minutes and sped off, he said.Another man told investigators he and other migrants had been holed up in a stash house in Laredo for 11 days after crossing the border and were then taken to the truck.Court filings show that a James Bear Bradley, who public records indicate is the same person as the trucker arrested in the Texas case, has a criminal history in Colorado and Florida.According to the Arapahoe County District Attorney\u2019s Office in Colorado, Mr. Bradley was sentenced to three years in prison in 2005, stemming from probation violations after pleading guilty to a prior felony menacing charge. According to a police report, Mr. Bradley\u2019s wife claimed he\u2019d beaten her and threatened her with a handgun.Florida court records show Mr. Bradley was charged in Tampa in 2004 with grand theft of a motor vehicle, but it is not clear from the filings whether Mr. Bradley was ever convicted in that case.Federal law-enforcement officials said that smuggling routes are often controlled by cartels or their underlings and can involve a complex series of pickups and drop-offs to avoid detection. Often times, migrants are taken across the border to the U.S. on foot or by raft, secreted away in stash houses in border towns and then picked up by cars or trucks to haul them to various distribution points to major metropolises.Daniel Martinez, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Arizona, who studies migrant deaths and border issues, said the Texas case, while not unheard of, was unusual because of the sheer number of migrants involved. Mr. Martinez said that smugglers typically try to sneak smaller groups of people into the country, who are then picked up by cars, vans or trucks.Still, Mr. Martinez noted that smugglers are often adjusting to various points of increased enforcement by U.S. authorities and that commercial trucks have in the past been used to avoid detection.\u2014Jim Oberman contributed to this articleWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Driver Charged in Fatal Smuggling.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/driver-in-texas-human-smuggling-case-faces-federal-charge-1500920306", "keywords": ["death penalty,human smuggling,human trafficking,illegal immigrant,texas truck death,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,capital punishment,disasters,accidents,human rights,civil liberties,man-made disasters,transport accidents,trafficking,smuggling,transport"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 20:31:00", "news_title": "Google Parent Posts Strong Ad Growth, but Earns Less for Each Click", "content": "Google parent             Alphabet Inc.        GOOGL -0.38%       said its advertising business continued to hum, but its fastest-growing segments\u2014mobile and YouTube advertising\u2014are less lucrative than desktop ads.Alphabet said clicks on its ads surged 52% in the second quarter from a year earlier. But ads on smartphones and with YouTube videos generally earn less money per ad than search ads on traditional computers, the highly targeted ads that appear atop search results. As a result, Google said its revenue per click fell 23% in the quarter, the widest spread between the two metrics in at least six years.The growth in the number of clicks helped boost second-quarter revenue 21% to $26.01 billion over a year prior.\u201cThe results are reflecting two basic trends: an ongoing shift to mobile and an increasing amount of their revenue coming from YouTube,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThe growth remains very impressive for a company this size.\u201dThat shift in its business has also pressured margins. Alphabet\u2019s operating margin was 26.4% in the quarter, compared with 27.8% a year ago, marking the first drop in eight quarters, said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.The shift to smartphones is increasing the fees Google pays to smartphone partners, such as             Apple Inc.,       to be the default search engine on smartphones. Google\u2019s payments to partners, including phone makers and websites on which it places ads, increased 28% to $5.09 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. YouTube\u2019s growth also drives up costs because Google must pay to license some videos on the site.Such payments to partners will likely continue to increase given the shift to mobile, \u201cbut our focus remains on growing profit dollars,\u201d Alphabet Chief Financial Officer       Ruth Porat       said on a call with analysts. \u201cWe\u2019re just really pleased with the strength of our mobile business.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s net profit fell by 28% to $3.52 billion because of a $2.74 billion fine from European regulators. EU regulators last month fined Google after their seven-year investigation concluded Google favors its shopping ads in its search results at the expense of competitors. Google denies the charges and said it is considering an appeal.Alphabet shares, up 26% this year, fell 3% in after-hours trading.Google, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, dominates the digital-ad landscape with fellow tech giant             Facebook Inc.       The two firms captured about 77% of the $12 billion increase in spending on online ads in the U.S. last year, according to eMarketer. Given Google\u2019s size, if it continues to earn less per ad click, it could depress online-ad prices across the internet.As more people connect to the web on smartphones, they are using the internet more often and thus clicking on more ads Google sells on internet search results, websites and videos. Ads also take up a larger portion of smartphone screens, making it more likely that users will click.On YouTube, Google often shows ads at the beginning of videos that companies buy using an automated auction system. That system of programmatic advertising caused a problem for Google earlier this year when a series of news stories in late March showed Google was running some brands\u2019 ads alongside videos with content that could be considered racist or hateful. That caused some major advertisers to pull their spending on YouTube ads.As of last month, many major companies, including             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,AT&T Inc.,       and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., still hadn\u2019t resumed spending on YouTube ads. Others, including             General Motors Co.      ,             Coca-Cola Co.       and Lyft Inc., had returned to the site after Google improved technology to screen videos, among other moves.There was little sign of an impact from those spending cuts in the second quarter sales growth.However, marketers have pressured Google to offer more guarantees that their ads only appear with acceptable content, likely squeezing margins, Mr. Wieser said. Google is likely showing more ads on reputable websites as a result, which charge more to host Google\u2019s ads than lesser-known sites, he said.YouTube ads, specifically, are much cheaper for advertisers, said Mark Ballard, vice president of research at Merkle Inc., a digital-marketing firm. Merkle estimates that for just Google search ads, clicks increased about 23% in the quarter and revenue per click was up roughly 1%. \u201cThe shift to mobile is depressing [revenue-per-click] growth for Google, even in search, but by far the biggest factor of that decline is YouTube,\u201d Mr. Ballard said.Google is pursuing growth outside of advertising, giving rise to a second major business beyond advertising: the cloud, in which Google stores other companies\u2019 data and runs their systems on its global network of computers.Google has said it believes the business can one day eclipse its ad sales, which accounted for 88% of its $90.27 billion in revenue last year.The segment that includes Google\u2019s cloud sales, dubbed \u201cother revenue,\u201d grew by 42% in the quarter to $3.09 billion.Write to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Google Sees Ad Growth but Earns Less for Each Click.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-fine-drags-on-google-parent-alphabets-profit-1500928330", "keywords": ["anticompetitive,antitrust,digital advertising,earnings,eu fine,google,growth,net,online advertising,profit,revenue,search engines,Alphabet Inc.

Andrew Cuomo       appointed Mr. Lhota the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about a month ago, Mr. Lhota has sparred with Mr. de Blasio and backed up Mr. Cuomo as the governor feuds with the mayor.As he prepares to release a plan for fixing the subways, Mr. Lhota is facing new tensions between the MTA and City Hall, and criticisms from some of the legislators who unanimously confirmed him last month.\u201cA lot of us have confidence [Mr. Lhota] has the skill set necessary to lead the MTA,\u201d said Sen.       Michael Gianaris,        a Queens Democrat who voted for Mr. Lhota. \u201cBut the concern is he\u2019s been acting in a very political way since his appointment, and he seems to just be echoing the position of the governor\u2026That raises questions about his credibility.\u201dMr. Lhota said politics isn\u2019t driving his decisions. \u201cIt is about the people of New York who deserve a subway system that gets them where they need to go safely and reliably,\u201d he said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo declined to say if his office has directed Mr. Lhota\u2019s policies or statements.Mr. Lhota, a former aide to Mayor       Rudolph Giuliani,        ran the MTA from 2011 until his campaign for mayor as a Republican against Mr. de Blasio in 2013. His appointment in June to head the MTA initially was cheered on both sides of the aisle as the city and state grapple with subways stalling and derailing as ridership rises.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, was among those supportive of Mr. Lhota taking the MTA reins, saying he has \u201ca lot respect for\u201d Mr. Lhota and he considered the appointment apolitical.Since then, Mr. Lhota has called Mr. de Blasio\u2019s commentary on the subways \u201cnonsensical,\u201d \u201clame,\u201d \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d and \u201cincendiary.\u201d They have clashed over issues such as Mr. Lhota saying he is open to possibly banning food on the subways, and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s suggestion that the MTA has spent its money poorly.Mr. Lhota\u2019s presentation last week backing up Mr. Cuomo\u2019s assertion that the city bears more responsibility than the state for funding the subways inflamed tensions further.\u00a0The mayor and his aides were \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by Mr. Lhota\u2019s remarks, de Blasio spokesman       Austin Finan       said\u00a0Monday. \u201cThat was a head-scratcher.\u201dIn an emailed statement\u00a0Monday, Mr. Lhota said the \u201cpolitical posturing and photo ops are getting silly,\u201d referring partly to a subway ride the mayor took with reporters last weekend. \u201cWhat we need right now is for leaders to step up and work together,\u201d he said.The feuding has worried legislators who had hoped Mr. Lhota would keep the MTA above the political fray.Sen. Daniel Squadron, a Brooklyn Democrat who voted for Mr. Lhota\u2019s confirmation, said he supported the appointment because of the \u201cincredible leadership\u201d Mr. Lhota showed after superstorm Sandy in 2012. But Mr. Squadron said he is now \u201cperplexed\u201d by some of Mr. Lhota\u2019s recent remarks.Mr. Squadron\u2019s Republican counterpart, Sen.       Marty Golden,        said both Mr. Lhota and Mr. de Blasio should hold their fire until after Mr. Lhota releases his plan. \u201cGive him a chance,\u201d Mr. Golden said of Mr. Lhota. \u201cAttacking each other is not getting the trains to run better.\u201dWith Mr. Lhota adopting many of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s positions, his tensions with City Hall are partly an extension of the evergreen feud between the city and state over MTA responsibilities.Mr. de Blasio and his aides have doubled down on efforts to remind voters that it is the governor who oversees the subways. In a call with reporters Monday,       Anthony Shorris,        a deputy mayor, said again and again that the city isn\u2019t in control of the system. \u201cWe know who is,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office has said the city has a legal responsibility to fund the MTA and has suggested it is unclear who controls the MTA because of the agency\u2019s Byzantine structure.The governor, however, names the highest number of appointees to the 23-member MTA board, including its leader, oversees its funding, and has directed much of its operations.\u00a0The city has four appointees to the board.The MTA didn\u2019t come up much in the 2013 mayor\u2019s race when Messrs. de Blasio and Lhota ran against each other, though Mr. Lhota made waves in the race when he said he wouldn\u2019t stop the subway system to save a kitten on the tracks.

The landlord of the building, who was also present, was hit in the crossfire and later died of his wounds, the ministry said.Jordan confirmed a shooting incident via its state news agency but didn\u2019t say one of its citizens had attempted to attack the Israeli guard.The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the situation in Jerusalem, a day before its quarterly Middle East briefing.The U.N.\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, Nickolay Mladenov, briefed the council and warned that the crisis must be contained before Friday, a day of communal prayers at the Al Aqsa mosque, otherwise protests and violence could escalate, moving the Israelis and Palestinians further away from achieving long-term peace.Diplomats said the meeting had been productive and there was consensus among the 15-member council to condemn the violence and call for calm.Jordan initially barred the Israeli guard from leaving for Israel, Israeli media reported.\u200bBut the security guard and Israel\u2019s diplomatic envoys in Amman returned to\u200bIsrael late Monday after\u200ba flurry of diplomatic efforts between Israeli and Arab officials, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said.Thousands of Jordanians took to the streets of Amman on Friday to protest Israel\u2019s installation of metal detectors at the Jerusalem shrine after a shooting incident the previous Friday at the compound left two Israeli policemen dead. On Sunday, it also introduced surveillance cameras at its entrance.The moves, considered standard security measures by Israeli officials, have stirred widespread anger among Palestinians and Waqf, the Jordanian religious authority that administers the site.Early Tuesday morning, Israel began removing the metal detectors that had angered Muslims from entrances to the shrine, according to the Associated Press. Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet said it would replace them with more advanced technologies, the AP said.The plaza in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City is holy to both Muslims and Jews, home of the Al Aqsa mosque and said to previously have been the site of two ancient Jewish temples.But only Muslims are allowed to pray on the site, and although Jewish groups have been lobbying for that right, the Israeli government hasn\u2019t initiated any plans to change the status quo.Waqf has called on Muslims not to visit the site until the cameras are removed. It accuses Israel of using such security apparatus to try to take control of the area, a charge Israel denies.\u201cThe Jordanian government has to tone down its statements on the issue of Jerusalem,\u201d Oded Eran, the former Israeli ambassador to Jordan, told reporters on Monday. \u201cThe atmosphere is quite tense in Amman.\u201dU.S. President       Donald Trump      appointed Mr. Greenblatt in December to lead efforts to make peace between Israelis and Palestinians. A former lawyer with no diplomatic experience, he has made multiple trips to the region but hasn\u2019t outlined a definitive plan for restarting peace talks, frustrating some people on both sides. The latest round of peace talks collapsed in 2014.Former Secretary of State       John Kerry       flew into the region in late 2015 amid a similar simmering standoff over the Jerusalem compound, and persuaded Mr. Netanyahu, Jordan\u2019s       King Abdullah II       and Palestinian leader       Mahmoud Abbas       to soften their rhetoric over the site.Though tensions then calmed around the Temple Mount, there swiftly followed a spate of stabbings and shooting attacks by Palestinians against Israelis across the West Bank and Israel over a number of months.Mr. Abbas said this weekend that the Palestinian Authority would cut all ties with Israel until the Temple Mount issue is resolved, including cooperation around security matters.The two sides coordinate information around potential terror threats and in tamping down protests or violence, measures that political analysts said would be difficult to cease.Israel and Jordan have also increased security cooperation in recent years, particularly in the wake of an influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan and the expansion of Islamist sentiment in the country. The two countries have begun cooperating further on economic issues, with Israel last year confirming it would export gas to its neighbor.\u2014Eli Stokols in Washington and Farnaz Fassihi at the United Nations  contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Oded Eran is the former Israeli ambassador to Jordan.

Succeed or fail, the Republican Majority Leader is right to demand this moment of political accountability.Mr. McConnell wanted to hold the vote last week after a rump group of GOP Senators on the right and left opposed his latest draft. But the White House sought more time for talks and he agreed\u2014apparently in the name of hope over experience. The vote he wants to hold Tuesday would require 50 Senate ayes to proceed to a floor debate, and he can only afford to lose two Republicans.Members have been debating among themselves for weeks, they know or should know the bill\u2019s essential policy choices, and the bill isn\u2019t getting prettier with age. That\u2019s especially true on Medicaid reform and spending, which is the chief gripe of the so-called moderates led by Rob Portman of Ohio. They keep demanding more money. They keep getting it, but it\u2019s never enough.The first version of the bill\u2019s \u201cstability fund\u201d for states was $62 billion. The moderates demanded more and pushed that to $132 billion in the second version. Then they demanded $45 billion to fight opioid addiction. Check again. Now we hear they are back demanding tens of billions more. A spokesman said Mr. Portman is undecided on the bill.A particular outrage would be if Senators blocked the bill from even going to debate if the extra money isn\u2019t added to the latest McConnell draft. Never mind that they could offer an amendment on the floor after debate begins and see where the sense of the Senate is. The moderates, and conservatives like       Rand Paul       and Mike Lee, are using Mr. McConnell\u2019s narrow margin to trump the policy preferences of the vast majority of their conference as the price of even allowing debate.Tennessee Senator       Bob Corker       had it right last week when he said that \u201cit\u2019s beginning to feel like a bazaar, much like how ObamaCare was put together where disparate things are added and put in.\u201dMr. McConnell is obliged by procedural rules to introduce the bill that passed the House for the motion to proceed to debate. By our deadline Monday, he had not announced what he would offer as the first amendment on the Senate floor. Some Republicans want him to offer his latest draft, and he probably will if he thinks he may have the votes to pass it. The bill would then have to endure an amendment free-for-all, with Democrats and perhaps some Republicans seeking to amend it in ways that might kill it. But at least we\u2019d get a debate, and voters could see which Senators have which priorities.Mr. McConnell\u2019s other option would be to offer the December 2015 bill that repealed ObamaCare with a two-year delay to find time to replace. Fifty-one of the 52 current GOP Senators voted for that repeal bill that       Barack Obama       vetoed. (Maine\u2019s       Susan Collins       was the exception.)The only difference now is that President Trump will sign the bill. This would keep a core promise to GOP voters over four elections and seven years. Opposing this same bill now would expose Senators who campaigned for repeal only when they thought it had no chance to happen. The vote would stick with them for the rest of their careers.Paradoxically, repeal-and-delayed-replacement might also offer the best chance for bipartisan action on health care. With the fuse lit on ObamaCare repeal, Congress would have an urgent incentive to fix it. Democrats might not want to help the GOP do so, but their refusal would be litigated in the 2018 midterms. If they refused to help at all, they would share the blame for collapsing insurance exchanges.The larger stakes in the ObamaCare fight are whether Republicans can be a governing party. They can win elections but not since the early 2000s have they showed they can pass a major reform through Congress. They blew it the last time they controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2005-2006. They\u2019ve already wasted six months on health care in this Congress with nothing to show but division and discord.This failure is all the more remarkable given the current Senate election cycle. Only one GOP incumbent\u2014Dean Heller of Nevada\u2014faces a difficult challenge in 2018 and that is 16 months away. If Republicans can\u2019t reform Medicaid when they are in this strong an election position, when will they ever? Forget about modernizing Medicare or Social Security before a debt crisis.What is becoming clearer every day is that some GOP Senators would rather not vote on health care at all. They\u2019d rather talk in the cloakrooms until time runs out on this Congress. But voters want to see who honors their campaign promises, and especially who doesn\u2019t.

On Monday his parents announced they are giving up their appeal to have him undergo experimental treatment in the U.S. for his genetic disorder. Their decision came after the doctor who\u2019d offered it said too much time had elapsed and too much damage had been done.People can disagree with the best treatment for Charlie: The British doctors certainly disagreed with the American specialist the family invited. In a statement defending the British actions that delayed the treatment until it was too late, Justice       Nicholas Francis       admitted no \u201cparent could have done more for their child\u201d than Charlie\u2019s had done\u2014but went on to say that in Britain \u201cchildren have rights independent of their parents.\u201dWhat does that mean for an 11-month-old baby?

In an 11-page statement released before meeting this week with the Senate and House intelligence committees, the President\u2019s son-in-law and White House aide described his contacts with Russian figures during the campaign and after the election.The statement to the committees ends with a definitive denial of collusion with the Russians: \u201cI did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government.\u201dThe Beltway media are past the point of no return on their collusion odyssey, so there is little chance that Mr. Kushner has put this issue behind him. But as we suggested in these columns last week (\u201cThe Trumps and the Truth\u201d), the White House\u2019s best defense against death by a thousand cuts of anonymous leaks is radical transparency on Russia. Mr. Kushner\u2019s statement has provided a template.There isn\u2019t much in this statement about Russia beyond what we know, but Mr. Kushner expressly rebuts some of the more incendiary news reports of recent months.The biggest was the recent disclosure of a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, which was also attended by several functionaries serving as \u201ctranslators.\u201d About 10 minutes into the meeting, which he calls a waste of time, Mr. Kushner says he emailed his assistant: \u201cCan u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.\u201d Aside from the amusement of this extraction effort, Mr. Kushner\u2019s email to his assistant is surely available to investigators for confirmation.Mr. Kushner also rebuts suggestions that he served as a back-channel conduit between the Russians and Trump Administration, and he denies ever discussing sanctions against Russia with its then ambassador to the U.S.,       Sergei Kislyak.In Mr. Kushner\u2019s accounting, the Russian ambassador comes off as a suspiciously eager pest, constantly seeking meetings with the President-elect\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner says he finally agreed to a meeting that would have set off alarms of skepticism in a more politically experienced person. Mr. Kislyak puts him together with one       Sergey Gorkov,        \u201ca banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian president.\u201dAn important point is that with this and the other contacts described, Mr. Kushner offers details about what was, and what was not, discussed at these meetings. Up to now,       Team Trump       has taken the view that because every story is unfair or a witch hunt, they are under no obligation to provide their side of these allegations. Which has left the field open for months to media speculation.Now we have the Kushner disclosure template. Lying to Congress is a crime, so this statement and its details involve some risk for Mr. Kushner if some other meetings or Russian connections turn up. But if this is all there is, the collusion narrative will have to find another protagonist.

Democrats call the campaign an improper use of federal resources to undermine the health law.The disagreement amounts to a low-profile skirmish on health care unfolding in the shadows of the attention-grabbing battle playing out on Capitol Hill. If Republicans in Congress fail to enact a sweeping health-care overhaul, Dr. Price\u2019s battle with Democrats will take on far greater importance as the primary arena for the partisan back-and-forth on health care.Democrats have been pursuing investigations and requests for information as they push back against Dr. Price, whose agency is working to give states more leeway in relaxing ACA requirements.Their focus is on the department\u2019s and Dr. Price\u2019s public messaging, which has included tweets and other social-media posts disparaging the ACA and backing GOP repeal legislation.HHS officials say there is no legal problem with updating the public on the problems with the current health law.David Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, said HHS-promoted videos criticizing the ACA likely violate a century-old anti-lobbying law that forbids federal funding to be used to drum up support for pending legislation.\u201cThe question is, what is the point of posting those videos?\u201d Mr. Vladeck said. \u201cIf it is to gain support for the administration\u2019s proposals to reform the law, and it uses federal funds, I think that\u2019s a serious problem.\u201dBut Ken Gross, a prominent government-ethics lawyer, said the department\u2019s use of funds could be considered advocacy, which is permitted, rather than direct lobbying.In order to violate the law, which is rarely enforced, HHS would need to post messages or videos urging citizens to contact members of Congress in favor of the pending health-care legislation, Mr. Gross said.Official HHS accounts such as @HHSGov, @SecPriceMD and www.Facebook.com/HHS have posted videos of people complaining about the ACA, press releases criticizing the law and tweets calling for people to contact Congress and demand full repeal, Democrats say.The official HHS Twitter account on June 22 included a message from Dr. Price saying he welcomes \u201cmuch-needed #relief from #Obamacare.\u201d The HHS Twitter handle has been used to share video testimonials from people speaking out against the ACA that Democrats say were produced with taxpayer funds.\u201cThe Administration is committed to reforming the current healthcare system to bring down the cost of coverage, expand healthcare choices, and strengthen the safety net for generations to come,\u201d Alleigh Marre, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement.In several cases, official government accounts appeared to endorse statements from conservative organizations. In one case, the Twitter account for HHS\u2019s public-affairs office retweeted a post by American Action Network, a nonprofit organization closely aligned with House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.), which has spent over $2 million supporting the GOP\u2019s health-care bill. AAN doesn\u2019t disclose its donors.Democrats allege many of the actions violate federal law. They cite the Hatch Act, which bans executive-branch employees from using federal resources to advocate for a party, candidate or political group, and the Anti-Lobbying Act, which bars federal workers from undertaking substantial grass-roots lobbying.\u201cThe ACA is the law of the land, and HHS officials have an obligation to uphold and implement it,\u201d three Democratic senators\u2014      Brian Schatz       of Hawaii,       Cory Booker       of New Jersey and       Chris Murphy       of Connecticut\u2014said in a July 21 letter to Dr. Price.HHS officials say they are within their authority in informing the public about the need to improve the status quo regarding the ACA.The criticism from Democrats and liberal-leaning advocacy groups is the latest in a continuing strategy to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back the current health law. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to block the GOP repeal push, so they are using other tactics to apply pressure and to defend the ACA.The Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that specializes in election law, earlier this month filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging Dr. Price had improperly used his congressional campaign fund to promote his confirmation to Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Seven Democratic senators in March urged Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       to investigate Dr. Price\u2019s stock trades.Dr. Price has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to both matters.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Democrats Assail HHS Chief.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-accuse-hhs-of-using-improper-tactics-in-health-law-battle-1500939105", "keywords": ["aca,donald trump,gop health care plan,healthcare law,health-care law,health care news,health care overhaul,obamacare,repeal and replace,tom price,Tom Price,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,health,human services department,elections,national,presidential elections,welfare,social services,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 19:28:00", "news_title": "Scaramucci\u2019s White House Role Raises Questions for Planned Sale of His Investment Firm", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014      Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s       appointment as White House communications director presents a sensitive situation for the planned sale of his investment company to a Chinese conglomerate\u2014a deal that is now under government review.Mr. Scaramucci first announced plans to sell a controlling stake in his hedge-fund investing firm, SkyBridge Capital, to Chinese giant HNA Group Co. in January in anticipation of joining the White House, he said.

Securities filings indicate that Mr. Scaramucci has a 25%-to-50% stake in the firm, which would mean that he could stand to earn between $62.5 million and $125 million from the deal.White House officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mr. Scaramucci is far from the only official to face business issues as he joins the Trump administration.Wilbur Ross Jr.      , the billionaire private-equity investor whom Mr. Trump tapped to serve as secretary of Commerce, agreed to sell 80 assets worth at least $92 million. Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin      was required to sell by mid-May more than $100 million of shares in             CIT Group Inc.,       the financial firm he helped lead.But ethics experts say the CFIUS involvement makes Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s case unique, given that the White House and other senior Trump appointees have a hand in the outcome. In addition to Treasury, CFIUS includes representatives of the Justice, Commerce, Defense and State departments, and others, and the president has the right to overrule committee decisions.The review is also occurring at a time when the government has ramped up its scrutiny of Chinese deals. The backers of at least five Chinese deals\u2014including another one involving HNA\u2014have recently refiled or said they would refile applications to the committee after failing to get CFIUS approval, according to people familiar with the matter and public disclosures.In his first news conference Friday, Mr. Scaramucci said he had worked with the Office of Government Ethics \u201cto take care of\u201d all conflicts of interest with his business. \u201cMy start date is going to be in a couple of weeks, so that it\u2019s a\u2014100% totally cleansed and clean,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cYou want to go serve the country, and so the first thing you have to do is take on this mega opportunity cost by getting rid of all your assets, and so\u2014but I\u2019m willing to do that, because I love the country.\u201dThe ethics office declined to comment.President       George W. Bush\u2019s       White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, said in an interview that he couldn\u2019t recall a similar situation arising in which a deal by an incoming White House staffer was undergoing a CFIUS review. He recommended that the White House stay out of the process entirely and respect whatever decision CFIUS makes, without the president exercising his right to overrule it.\u201cThe worst case is this deal gets approved and it looks like favoritism,\u201d said Mr. Painter.Under the terms of the deal, HNA, together with George Hornig-backed investment company RON Transatlantic, will take a stake of approximately 89% in SkyBridge, according to filings. HNA could end up with as much as 80% of SkyBridge, the filings indicate, while RON Transatlantic, which has been a minority shareholder for the past four years, could end up with between 9% and 38%, the filings show.In recent weeks HNA has come under pressure from its own regulators back home as Beijing attempts to rein in some of its highest-profile private sector companies in what officials say is growing unease with their mounting debt and rising influence. Regulators last month ordered banks to scrutinize loans to HNA, one of China\u2019s most acquisitive companies, and others. On Monday the closely held company unveiled a new ownership structure to try to clarify who ultimately controls it.An HNA spokesman said in a statement Sunday: \u201cHNA Group is a financially strong company with a robust, diversified balance sheet that reflects our continued growth and engagement across the capital markets.\u201dHNA has spent $5.68 billion on investments abroad so far this year, following $20 billion last year, according to Dealogic. The spree included the company\u2019s $6 billion deal for U.S. electronics distributor Ingram Micro Inc., which cleared CFIUS last year.\u2014Lisa Beilfuss in New York, Rebecca Ballhaus in Washington and Anjani Trivedi and Julie Steinberg in Hong Kong contributed to this article.Write to Michael C.

More than half a dozen GOP senators have said they would block debate on different versions of the health-care bill, though it remained up in the air exactly how many would vote no on Tuesday.That makes Tuesday\u2019s vote to proceed with the consideration of legislation pivotal in either derailing Republicans\u2019 health-care ambitions or inching them closer to reviving a bill that is still on shaky ground.Lawmakers typically vote with party leaders at least to begin debate on legislation, and failure to pass the motion would be a rebuke for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has argued that allowing debate to begin would give senators unhappy with the bill a chance to amend it.Mr. McConnell can only afford to lose two votes, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking any tie, since no Democrats are expected to vote for the proposal. In a late boost for GOP leaders, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) announced he would return to the Senate Tuesday. He has been recovering from surgery in Arizona, where he was diagnosed last week with a brain tumor.The dissent from some senators, and the full-court press to get their votes, has turned what is typically a mundane procedural motion into a high-stakes political gamble.\u201cEvery Republican running for office promised immediate release from this disastrous law,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday, adding that \u201cso far Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.\u201dMr. McConnell took to the Senate floor to deliver an unambiguous pitch. \u201cMany of us have waited literally years for this moment to arrive, and at long last it has,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Monday. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my commitment to vote to move beyond the failures of Obamacare. I would urge all of our colleagues to do the same.\u201dDemocrats warned that any vote to push the bill forward could lead to legislation that harms consumers, stripping insurance coverage from many millions of people who received it under the ACA.\u201cMake no mistake, a yes vote tomorrow is an endorsement of the most indefensible process on a major piece of legislation I\u2019ve seen in my 24 years in the Senate,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.).For now, even if the motion to proceed passes, Mr. McConnell is still far short of the votes needed to pass the underlying legislation\u2014either a measure repealing most of the ACA, or the most recent version of a bill aiming to supplant it with a new health-care system.Opening debate would leave GOP lawmakers open to dozens of politically perilous votes on amendments, including those offered by Democrats designed to put them on the spot. Any senator would be able to force a vote on an amendment, in a marathon session known informally as a \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201dThat could be particularly damaging to GOP senators with the most competitive re-election races next year, including Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Democrats, too, could face votes they would rather not take.Failure to get a vote to debate the health bill could hold similar political danger. Conservative advocacy groups are warning they will view GOP senators who don\u2019t back the procedural motion as breaking their campaign promise to repeal the ACA. Some have said they would promote GOP challengers to run against them in future primaries.\u201cFailure is not an option,\u201d said Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, in a statement Monday. \u201cFor seven years, Republicans promised the American people that they would do everything in their power to dismantle Obamacare. Every single Republican should vote yes tomorrow.\u201dMr. Trump made a similar point in his White House comments Monday, asking whether GOP senators had been pretending to want to repeal the law on previous occasions, when they voted for repeal knowing that Mr. Obama would veto the measure. \u201cThey now have a chance,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis is their chance to keep their promise.\u201dFollowing those comments, Mr. Trump went to West Virginia with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), a trip that could escalate pressure on the senator. Ms. Capito has said she wouldn\u2019t vote for the procedural motion if it means a repeal of the ACA with no replacement, but hasn\u2019t indicated how she would vote on the latest version of the Senate replacement bill.Uncertainty has surrounded the vote in part because it was unclear as of late Monday what the underlying legislation would be, so senators didn\u2019t know what they would be debating. Republican senators are scheduled to have their regular luncheons Tuesday, and that could provide clarity before the vote.Senators and GOP aides said Monday night that leaders wouldn\u2019t have to choose between the repeal-only bill and the repeal-and-replace version. Under Senate rules, both measures can receive votes during the amendment session. But GOP leaders could still make a decision about which measures would come up first, an issue that was still under discussion Monday night.Despite his reputation as a deft negotiator, Mr. McConnell has already been forced to delay a vote on the motion three times, largely because it was clear he didn\u2019t have enough support.Several options are on the table. Conservative GOP senators such as Rand Paul of Kentucky want a plan that would repeal most of the ACA after two years, allowing lawmakers time to come up with a replacement. \u201cSo if my team remembers what they\u2019ve said and what they\u2019re supposed to stand for\u2014count me in,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed in the Hill on Monday. \u201cBut if they continue not to, I\u2019ll be a hell no.\u201dBut that repeal-only strategy is unlikely to win support from centrist Republicans who want to see parts of the current health law retained. However, Republicans haven\u2019t coalesced around a single bill that would replace the ACA with an alternative system.Still, any replacement plan is expected to include steep cuts to the enhanced federal Medicaid program for low-income Americans, an end to funding for the program\u2019s expansion and a return to less expensive health plans that offer fewer benefits. Recent tweaks could include more funding for states that see their Medicaid expansion phased out.Mr. McConnell and the president have made it clear that getting support for the motion to debate the bill is a central objective. But even if they succeed, the next hurdle would be equally challenging\u2014passing an actual bill.\u201cIn my experience of 37 years in public service, I have never experienced a time when somebody stopped a leader of the party on the motion to proceed,\u201d Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) said last week. \u201cYou can always vote against the bill or offer an amendment.\u201dWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com, Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Chides Senators on Health Vote.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-urges-gop-senators-to-overturn-affordable-care-act-1500927394", "keywords": ["Donald Trump,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 19:09:00", "news_title": "Notable & Quotable: Kushner on Russia", "content": "From       Jared Kushner\u2019s       statement to congressional investigators, July\u00a024:With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate       Trump       was delivering a major foreign policy speech. .\u00a0.\u00a0. I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event,       Dimitri Simes.       .\u00a0.\u00a0. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador       Sergey Kislyak.      \u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred.The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9. .\u00a0.\u00a0.

When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote \u201cCan u pls call me on my cell?

Judging from Capitol Hill\u2019s self-abasing deference to Special Prosecutor       Robert Mueller,        the answer is no.You remember Ms. Lerner. She was the official at the center of an Internal Revenue Service effort that denied conservative political advocacy groups tax-exempt status, or at least held up approval long enough that these groups could not be a factor in the 2012 election.Back when Republicans were holding hearings on the matter, time and again they were lectured not to do anything that might affect the FBI\u2019s investigation\u2014which eventually ended with no charges against anyone. Though Ms. Lerner was found in contempt by the House for her refusal to testify, it proved all for show.The tip-off came when then-Speaker       John Boehner,        rather than use Congress\u2019s inherent contempt power to jail Ms. Lerner until she talked, opted for classic swamp symbolism\u2014by passing the buck to an       Obama       Justice Department everyone knew would never prosecute her.The result? Ms. Lerner avoided having to answer any hard questions. The IRS merrily continued to lose or destroy crucial documents. And       John Koskinen,        the awful replacement IRS commissioner who stonewalled and misled, remains in office.The Lois Lerner fiasco offers a sobering lesson for a Congress whose various committees are holding hearings on Russia\u2019s intervention in last year\u2019s elections as Mr. Mueller investigates the same. While Mr. Mueller\u2019s office is a watered-down version of       Ken Starr\u2019s       or       Lawrence Walsh\u2019s      , it remains true that special prosecutors corrupt even if they don\u2019t corrupt as absolutely as independent counsels. The main headlines of the past week\u2014Is       Donald Trump       attempting to undermine Mr. Mueller? Will Trump Fire Mueller?\u2014all speak to the challenge a special prosecutor poses to the constitutional authority of the president.Far less scrutiny has been devoted to the challenge Mr. Mueller poses to the authority of the legislative branch. In this case, ironically, the challenge stems less from the aggressiveness of the special prosecutor than from the meekness of Congress. In between their public tributes to Mr. Mueller\u2019s sterling character, too many in Congress seem to worry more about how they might be affecting his investigation than about what his investigation might be doing to theirs.One small snapshot: Mr. Mueller, an unelected appointee, had the Trump memos written by former FBI Director       James Comey       even as the FBI was refusing to release them to the elected representatives of the American people.When Mr. Mueller was appointed back in May, Sen. Lindsey Graham rightly noted that though he respected the decision, the appointment will \u201creally limit what Congress can do, and it\u2019s going to really limit what the public will know about this.\u201d Alas, the South Carolina Republican went on to say that \u201cwe in Congress have to be very careful not to interfere in his lane.\u201dCertainly representatives and senators shouldn\u2019t set out to frustrate Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. But neither should they permit Mr. Mueller to frustrate theirs.In this investigative capacity, Congress has many tools to enforce its demands for information. It can, for example, use inherent contempt to jail someone until he testifies or produces the requested information. True, inherent contempt hasn\u2019t been invoked since 1935, but given that the civil path to enforcing a contempt finding takes years and the criminal option (as Ms. Lerner showed) has effectively been overridden, Congress would do well to rely on its own powers and authority.Here a May 2017 review from the Congressional Research Service is illuminating. Although witnesses before a congressional committee do have the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment, the House can get a court order directing the witness to testify so long as the threat of prosecution for that testimony is removed. Mr. Mueller might not like this, but that shouldn\u2019t stop Congress from using a power designed to extract information rather than punish.Even more intriguing, sensitive or privileged client information is not exempt from congressional subpoena. This might prove especially fascinating in the case of former Trump campaign manager       Paul Manafort,        who has had business dealings with a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. Ditto for       Glenn Simpson,        whose Fusion GPS commissioned what became the       Christopher Steele       Russian dossier on behalf of political clients.Not to mention the many other powers of Congress, including impeachment and the purse. The point is, Congress has many ways to get to the bottom of the Russia story and hold people accountable\u2014if it so chooses.In Anderson v. Dunn (1821), the Supreme Court correctly noted that without the power to imprison those found in contempt, Congress would be \u201cexposed to every indignity and interruption, that rudeness, caprice or even conspiracy may meditate against it.\u201d Two centuries later, the different examples of Ms. Lerner and Mr. Mueller both point to a brand new indignity\u2014which Congress inflicts on itself when it is too timid to assert its own powers.Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Appeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-is-trumping-congress-1500937661", "keywords": ["2016 election,robert mueller,russia collusion,special counsel,trump,white house,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 19:06:00", "news_title": "Europe\u2019s Next Crisis: The Balkans", "content": "At a recent closed think-tank meeting, a well-informed German official was asked what problem in Europe caused him the most worry. His answer came without hesitation: the Western Balkans, where a new crisis is brewing as Turkey and Russia stir the pot.In his worst-case scenario, Russia and Turkey would encourage their proxies in the Balkans, Serbia and Albania, to help them redraw the region\u2019s borders. The Serbian government, with Russian support, could annex large portions of Bosnia populated by ethnic Serbs. Turkish support could help Albania pull off a similar maneuver, not only in heavily Albanian Kosovo but also in Macedonia, where much of the large Albanian minority would like to reunite with the motherland.This course of events is unlikely. Since some of the territory claimed by Greater Albania partisans is in Serbia, it would be difficult for the two countries to agree on a new map. But it\u2019s not an impossible outcome, even if the idea more likely would inspire a James Bond villain than a foreign minister. And increasing numbers of wannabe Bond villains seem to be popping up in world politics these days.There is a grave reality underlying the German\u2019s concerns. The Balkans are unraveling, and the West now must worry about more than Russian meddling. Turkey is becoming more of a NINO (NATO in Name Only) power, and despite deep Turkish suspicions of Russia, President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       is cooperating more closely with President       Vladimir Putin.Turkey and Russia have been brought together by their opposition to Germany and the European Union. Russians don\u2019t just hate NATO; they see the EU as a barrier against Russia\u2019s historical great-power role in European affairs. Turkey has also turned against the EU and is looking for leverage against Germany and its fellow members. For Russia and Turkey, the ability to cause Europe trouble in the Balkans with relatively little risk and cost is too good to pass up.The prospect of EU membership for countries like Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Bosnia has done more than anything to keep the fragile peace in the Western Balkans. Every Balkan country would rather be part of the EU than be allied to either Russia or Turkey.But hopes of near-term EU membership are fading. Europe is losing Britain and has had a hard time managing relations with members like Hungary and Poland. The 28\u2014soon to be 27\u2014EU members have little desire to take in five obstreperous new Balkan states that would make the union even more ungovernable, and would expect financial aid at a time when the post-Brexit EU budget will already be stretched.Serbs and Albanians are both signaling that if the West walks away, they will have to look east, and that will mean shifting to a nationalist agenda with Russian and Turkish help.For the EU, a new round of Balkan chaos would be a disaster: refugees, crime, radicalization among Balkan Muslims, greater opportunities for hostile powers to gain influence at EU expense. But the EU doesn\u2019t think it can manage the Balkans on its own. The U.S. will have to be part of the solution, Germans say.Will the U.S. play ball? Engaging in distant Balkan quarrels to make Germany\u2019s life easier isn\u2019t exactly       Donald Trump\u2019s       idea of smart foreign policy. Even as Atlanticist a president as       Bill Clinton       struggled for two years to keep the U.S. out of the post-Yugoslav wars. Mr. Trump may be even more skeptical of intervention and treat the possibility of a new round of Balkan wars with the chilly aloofness that       Barack Obama       displayed in Syria. This would be a grave mistake. Although the quarrels in the Balkans are trivial compared with larger problems elsewhere, what happens in the Balkans doesn\u2019t always stay in the Balkans, and NATO as well as the EU could be shaken to the core by another round of Balkan bloodletting. The crisis has the potential to redefine U.S.-EU relations for decades.Europeans argue that relatively small, short-term American investments\u2014active diplomacy and building up U.S. forces in Kosovo\u2014could go a long way. But we have a president who may not find that argument convincing. Mr. Trump\u2019s core foreign-policy conviction seems to be that the U.S. has let its allies enjoy a decadeslong free ride. Europeans who worry about Balkan peace need to think about how they can persuade a skeptical White House to engage. The old appeals\u2014to NATO solidarity, defense of freedom, fear of Russia\u2014may not be enough. Mr. Trump thinks in terms of deals, and Berlin needs to think about how to bring him to the table.Mr. Mead is a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a professor of foreign affairs at Bard College, and editor at large of the American Interest.Appeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-next-crisis-the-balkans-1500937579", "keywords": ["albania,european union,macedonia,russia,serbia,the balkans,turkey,European Union,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 19:05:00", "news_title": "India\u2019s Best-Loved Politician", "content": "India\u2019s proudest boast is that it is the world\u2019s biggest democracy. But in the 70 years since independence, India\u2019s citizens have been poorly served by government ministers, many of whom have been remote, overbearing, idle, AWOL or corrupt.Not Foreign Minister       Sushma Swaraj.       A longtime member of the ruling nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, the 65-year-old Punjabi has also been chief minister of Delhi and opposition leader. In her present role, she has become India\u2019s best-loved official, mostly due to her tireless attention to Indians in distress abroad. It is a task she gave herself after it became clear that Prime Minister       Narendra Modi,        a control freak, intended to exercise tight personal control over foreign and security policy.Ms. Swaraj\u2019s space, therefore, lay in elevating that most mundane but vital diplomatic function: consular and citizen services. By using             Twitter                   publicly as a channel for citizens (and even noncitizens) to call for assistance, Ms. Swaraj has reminded people that the oldest role of any foreign ministry is to look after its nationals outside the country. Ms. Swaraj has 8.69 million followers, putting her in the global top 10 among politicians. The majority of her tweets are written in response to pleas for help. Of these, a good number come from the Indian diaspora in the Persian Gulf, mostly blue-collar workers who toil under stressful, often inhumane conditions.Late last week, a group of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia filmed an appeal to Ms. Swaraj. Each man had his palms pressed together, as if in prayer; their leader, in plaintive tones, asked Ms. Swaraj to help them return to India as their salaries were being withheld. Ms. Swaraj tweeted right back. \u201cWhy do you beseech me? You\u2019re Indian citizens. The Indian Embassy in Riyadh will do everything to help you.\u201d They are now on their way home.On other occasions, she has helped Indians who are sick abroad find hospitals, then negotiated with those hospitals to accept Indian insurance. Indian women in bad marriages to foreign men tweet to her for her help to return to India. On one delicious occasion, a man tweeted to her for assistance with his fridge, complaining that Samsung was making him pay to repair it. Her response was blunt but courteous. \u201cBrother, I cannot help you in matters of a refrigerator. I\u2019m very busy with human beings in distress.\u201dMany of these human beings, as it happens, are Pakistani, and they tweet directly to Ms. Swaraj, too. Despite tensions between India and Pakistan, there\u2019s a steady flow to India of Pakistani visitors in urgent need of medical attention, hospitals in Pakistan being expensive and largely substandard. They often encounter problems getting permission to leave Pakistan, or visas to enter India.Recently Ms. Swaraj ensured that       Rohaan Siddiqi,        a Pakistani toddler, was able to fly to India for life-saving surgery.

During the next 20 minutes, they loaded bin Laden\u2019s corpse, computers and flash drives onto helicopters, then departed into the moonless sky.What happened next is the subject of       Ali Soufan\u2019s       \u201cAnatomy of Terror.\u201d A Lebanese-born Muslim, Mr. Soufan tracked al Qaeda during his career as an FBI special agent and went on to publish a book on the period from 9/11 to 2011 titled \u201cThe Black Banners.\u201d \u201cAnatomy of Terror\u201d picks up the story since 2011, though much of it, for context, rehearses the events of the preceding decade.Bin Laden\u2019s demise, Mr. Soufan says, deprived al Qaeda of a charismatic leader at its apex. His successor, the Egyptian doctor Ayman al Zawahiri, had the personal magnetism of a falafel. By 2011, however, bin Laden had set the conditions for al Qaeda to survive without his inspirational guidance, by seeding his lieutenants across Africa, the Middle East and Asia and shifting from spectacular terrorism to governance in fragile states.The most successful al Qaeda offshoot, ISIS, attracted an estimated 38,000 foreign nationals to its cause. Its explosive growth, however, provoked interventions by Iran, Russia and the United States. Although ISIS has since lost much of its caliphate, it has begun to adjust in a manner similar to al Qaeda, by going underground in sympathetic areas and establishing franchises in other Islamic countries.By Ali Soufan  Norton, 359 pages, $27.95By Gilles Kepel  Princeton, 220 pages, $29.95Mr. Soufan asserts that the United States has relied too much on military power to contend with al Qaeda and ISIS, neglecting the diplomatic, political and economic tools required for developing local institutions and countering extremist ideas. In fact, the United States has spent huge sums on reconstruction, nation building and information operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Regrettably, much of it was squandered by corruption or by       Barack Obama\u2019s       hasty withdrawal from the two countries.According to Mr. Soufan, recent events have disproved       Samuel Huntington\u2019s       prediction of a clash among civilizations. The struggles of al Qaeda and ISIS, he says, are struggles within Islamic civilization. \u201cAll of the major combatants are Muslim,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor all their military might, outside powers like the United States and the Russian Federation can at best only marginally affect the outcome.\u201dYet only in an ahistorical sense has the United States not been a \u201cmajor combatant.\u201d Less than a decade has passed since 160,000 U.S. troops were at war in Iraq, and fewer than six years since 100,000 were fighting in Afghanistan. Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria saved       Bashar al Assad\u2019s       government from a defeat that could have turned the broader conflict upside-down. Today both the United States and Russia remain capable of more than marginal influence.If one looks outside the Middle East, one can find plenty of violent conflicts between Islamic and Christian civilizations. At the moment, the most violent are taking place in Africa. Less violent, but more momentous, are the clashes between Muslims and Westerners in Europe. Those clashes are the subject of Gilles Kepel\u2019s \u201cTerror in France.\u201dMr. Kepel published the first edition of his book in French in late 2015, just weeks after ISIS operatives killed 130 civilians in Paris. During the next year, Islamic terrorists conducted further deadly attacks in France and struck in Belgium, Denmark and Germany. Mr. Kepel gives the impression that ISIS has generated little sympathy among French Muslims; one would have liked more from him on that subject, given how much controversy surrounds the extent of support for ISIS among Europe\u2019s Muslims.Mr. Kepel traces the radicalization of some French Muslims to the riots of 2005, during which Muslim youths erupted in protest against alleged police misconduct. Initially, France\u2019s Socialists tried to win Muslim voters by pushing for more government spending in blighted neighborhoods. They were overshadowed by       Nicolas Sarkozy,        whose vow to restore law and order won him middle-class votes and the 2007 election. As president, he promoted French national identity and called on immigrants to assimilate\u2014e.g., by forgoing the veiling of women. Muslims were pivotal in Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s narrow defeat in 2012, as more than 80% of Muslim voters cast their ballots for       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        the Socialist candidate, who espoused multiculturalism. Mr. Hollande, in his turn, alienated large segments of the Muslim population by pushing for same-sex marriage.Mr. Kepel blasts political elites, saying that they are an insular class reliant on \u201cpseudo-experts who block public financing for in-depth research that would expose their imposture.\u201d But he reserves his greatest scorn for the populist nationalists. Their overreaction to Islamic terrorism, he says, will drive French Muslims into the arms of the extremists. Unfortunately, he offers little in the way of alternative policies. He calls for greater attention to academic research on Islam but does not spell out the academic insights that remain unknown to government leaders.Given the absence of clear alternatives, one must conclude from \u201cTerror in France\u201d that the French should keep muddling along, avoiding any bold changes lest they antagonize Muslims. The election of       Emmanuel Macron       seems to set France on that track. But if the Muslim population in France continues to grow faster than the non-Muslim one, its political clout will grow as well. With greater power, Muslims will be even more inclined than now to clash with a Western civilization whose vitality seems to erode with every passing day.Mr. Moyar is the author of \u201cOppose Any Foe: The Rise of America\u2019s Special Operations Forces.\u201dAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'After the Death Of bin Laden.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-the-death-of-bin-laden-1500937520", "keywords": ["book review,books,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 19:04:00", "news_title": "Cops and Robbers, All Rolled Into One", "content": "There aren\u2019t many things government can claim to do more efficiently than the private sector. Taking people\u2019s property is one. In 2014 the federal government seized about $4.5 billion from people who hadn\u2019t been charged with crimes. That exceeds the private-sector equivalent, burglary. According to an analysis by Armstrong Economics, perpetrators absconded with only $3.9 billion that year.Since 2007 the Drug Enforcement Administration alone has seized more than $3 billion in currency from individuals in civil actions under which legal protections for criminal charges do not apply. Criminal asset forfeiture requires an indictment against both an individual and the property in question. With civil asset forfeiture only the property is charged before being seized.Last week Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       stated his intention to increase the volume of these asset forfeitures. Contrary to published reports, the Sessions directive does not extend asset forfeiture to states that have outlawed the practice. It clarifies that federal asset forfeiture can only be applied to violations of federal law.But there\u2019s no doubt Mr. Sessions is putting himself in bad company. As California attorney general,       Kamala Harris       opposed a 2011 law restraining the practice of civil asset forfeiture. In 2015 she sponsored a bill to allow authorities to seize suspects\u2019 assets before filing charges. That year California forfeitures totaled $50 million. Ms. Harris is now a U.S. senator in the midst of a 2020 presidential boomlet.Civil asset forfeiture has become a profit center for law enforcement. Any law-enforcement official can seize assets, and anyone suspected of a crime can be a target. In 2016 half of all forfeitures in Connecticut were valued at less than $570, casting doubt on the claims of many government agencies that civil asset forfeiture is used only against big-time thieves and drug dealers. Many states allow law-enforcement agencies to keep all or part of what they seize.It\u2019s impossible to know how many instances of federal asset forfeiture lead to criminal convictions, because the Justice Department doesn\u2019t keep such data. \u201cAlthough the Department of Justice\u2019s forfeiture database tracks more than 1,300 variables about cash and property seizures, not one indicates whether a criminal charge or conviction accompanied a forfeiture,\u201d according to a 2015 report from the Institute of Justice, a free-market legal group. \u201cThe DOJ carefully tracks and reports forfeiture revenue, but fails to publicly report whether forfeitures target proven criminals.\u201dIn 2013 the Internal Revenue Service seized $33,000 from Carole Hinder. It was the entire balance in her restaurant\u2019s checking account. Ms. Hinder had operated her business for more than 40 years, accepting only cash. The agency then got a warrant to seize another $150,000. Ms. Hinder\u2019s crime? Making deposits of less than $10,000, the threshold above which banks must report transactions to the IRS.Ms. Hinder\u2019s mother had advised her to make smaller deposits because it would be more convenient for the bank\u2014the required IRS Form 8300 is long, complicated and time-consuming for banks to fill out. The IRS alleged that Ms. Hinder\u2019s deposits were \u201crelated and excessive.\u201d Thankfully, sanity eventually prevailed. The IRS dismissed her case in late 2014.In 2012 Bi-County Distributors, a small family-owned business on Long Island, watched the federal government yank $446,000 from its account. Three different banks had stopped doing business with Bi-County because of the reporting requirements triggered by its frequent large cash deposits. Bi-County\u2019s accountant advised the company to stay below the $10,000 limit, which, of course, drew the IRS\u2019s attention.In January 2015,       Loretta Lynch,        then U.S. attorney for New York\u2019s Eastern District, signed a settlement returning the $446,000 to the company. Bi-County survived because its vendors allowed it to postpone paying bills. At one point, Bi-County owed a supplier almost $300,000.Asset forfeiture imposes costs on the broader economy as well as individual businesses. Capital that is tied up in court proceedings or accounts payable is not available to finance productive enterprise. Instead of expanding this practice, Mr. Sessions should reform it. His recent directive took a tiny step in this direction by expediting both the notification and appeal processes.But he should do more. The Justice Department should start keeping track of forfeitures that do not lead to charges and urge Congress and the states to pass reforms, especially an end to the practice of using the proceeds as a source of revenue for the government.Mr. Lima is a professor emeritus of economics at California State University, East Bay.Appeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cops-and-robbers-all-rolled-into-one-1500937471", "keywords": ["civil asset forfeiture,jeff sessions,kamala harris,law enforcement,trump administration,Drug Enforcement Administration,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,burglary,theft,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 18:52:00", "news_title": "Visual-Effects Company Sues Another Two Movie Studios", "content": "A visual-effects company has filed suit against two Hollywood studios and a videogame company, alleging unauthorized use of its technology.Rearden LLC on Monday sued             21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s        FOX 0.76%       Twentieth Century Fox,             Viacom Inc.\u2019s       Paramount Pictures and videogame publisher Square Enix Inc., as well as Square Enix subsidiary Crystal Dynamics Inc. in federal district court in San Francisco.

The defendants used Digital Domain to perform work with MOVA on their movies and videogame, the complaint says. Rearden claims that based on prior relationships or due diligence, the defendants should have known that Rearden had exclusive rights to perform work with MOVA, not Digital Domain.Rearden and the companies affiliated with Digital Domain have been battling in court since 2015. In June, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing Digital Domain from continuing to use MOVA.

The venue will allow traders to place options bets on virtual currencies, which have recently posted some of the wildest swings across global markets.LedgerX, which plans to launch in the fall, will offer institutional investors bitcoin puts and calls, contracts that allow them to sell or buy, respectively, at designated prices.The CFTC\u2019s decision marks a victory of a three-year-plus effort by founders of New York-based LedgerX, overseen by Ledger Holdings. Co-founders       Paul Chou,        chief executive officer, and       Juthica Chou,        president, were traders at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before taking the helm of LedgerX. Chief Technology Officer       Zach Dexter,        also a co-founder, was a software engineer.The CFTC\u2019s approval also represents a divergence to how two U.S. regulatory agencies have treated bitcoin, the largest virtual currency with a market capitalization of about $45 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com.In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission denied an application for the first exchange-traded fund that would track bitcoin on concerns the virtual currency could be manipulated. The SEC declined to comment on LedgerX.Most bitcoin markets are unregulated and outside of the U.S. Bats BZX, an exchange owned by             CBOE Holdings Inc.,       asked the SEC to reverse the bitcoin ETF decision, saying that the CFTC calls bitcoin a commodity and had allowed another exchange to offer swaps based on it.CFTC Acting Chairman       Christopher Giancarlo       has stated publicly that he\u2019s optimistic about blockchain technology\u2019s future, but he hasn\u2019t commented on LedgerX. Blockchain is a digital ledger and the technology that underpins bitcoin. LedgerX\u2019s chief executive Paul Chou is on the CFTC\u2019s Technology Advisory Committee.A CFTC spokeswoman said \u201cNo committee, including the Technology Advisory Committee, plays any role in any registration decision.\u201dAn approval \u201crecognizes the important and legitimate uses of digital currencies that are spreading throughout the world,\u201d said       Jeremy Liew,        a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, in an email before the CFTC\u2019s decision Monday. The venture-capital firm has a stake in LedgerX.Proponents say an options exchange will spur trading and attract investors who are fearful of entering what has so far been an unregulated market, dominated by coders and entrepreneurs. A CFTC-regulated venue could assuage institutional concerns about the virtual currency landscape. Bitcoin has won over unlikely champions as it gains mainstream acceptance, including Fidelity Investments Chief Executive       Abigail Johnson.It might also be welcome news for traders who thrive on volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s value has more than doubled this year to $2,762.63 as of Sunday, July 23, but the currency is prone to violent swings. Within one day in January, it approached a record before entering bear market territory.A weekend slide in July was yet another reminder of how immature cryptocurrency markets are. Another currency, Ether, recently plunged 50% after hitting its all-time high one month prior.The more volatile an asset is, the pricier options contracts on it are. Mr. Chou says he expects bitcoin miners to sell options on the currency in exchange for U.S. dollars. Bitcoin miners use computer programs to solve math problems and receive in exchange new bitcoins\u2014a system that ensures the issuance of new coins is a decentralized process.Investors can use options to hedge portfolio declines or place directional bets. Wealth managers, family offices, and hedge funds have expressed interest in trading on LedgerX, and it has market makers\u2014trading firms that provide continuous options quotes\u2014signed on, the company said.Other venues offer options for digital currencies, but none are federally regulated.

ABBV 0.10%       to pay $150 million in punitive damages to an Oregon man after finding the company liable for fraudulent misrepresentations about the safety of the testosterone-replacement therapy AndroGel, according to court records.The case was the first to go to trial of more than 4,000 lawsuits against AbbVie claiming AndroGel harmed patients, and that the North Chicago, Ill., company failed to properly warn doctors and patients about its risks.The Oregon man, Jesse Mitchell, had filed a lawsuit against AbbVie in 2014, claiming that his use of AndroGel for several years caused a heart attack in 2012. He accused AbbVie of failing to properly warn doctors and patients that the drug carried an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.The lawsuit said AbbVie relayed positive information about AndroGel while omitting cardiac risks in its advertisements, and that AbbVie spent $80 million promoting AndroGel in the U.S. in 2012.The jury in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois found AbbVie not strictly liable or negligent in Mr. Mitchell\u2019s heart attack, according to court records.

We expect the punitive damage award will not stand.\u201d The jury didn\u2019t award compensatory damages to Mr. Mitchell, AbbVie said.Some studies have suggested AndroGel and similar testosterone-replacement therapies increased patients\u2019 risk of heart problems, and in 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened warnings in the drugs\u2019 prescribing labels about cardiovascular risks.

As part of her plea, Ms. Graswald admitted she removed the plug from the kayak of her fianc\u00e9, Vincent Viafore. She also admitted that she knew Mr. Viafore wasn\u2019t wearing a life vest, that a locking clip to his paddle was missing and that the water was dangerously cold, prosecutors said.Ms. Graswald initially had been charged with murder.\u201cWhile no outcome can compensate for the loss of a beloved son, brother, and uncle, this disposition will hopefully bring a measure of closure to the Viafore family,\u201d District Attorney David Hoovler said.A lawyer representing Ms. Graswald said she has always maintained her fianc\u00e9\u2019s death wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201cThe totality of the circumstances created a risk of death and she failed to perceive that risk,\u201d said the lawyer, Richard Portale. \u201cThat\u2019s much different than intentional murder.\u201dProsecutors said that on April 19, 2015, in response to a 911 call, the New York State Police and others searched the Hudson River for Mr. Viafore and eventually found his kayak.In late April, police arrested Ms. Graswald and, on\u00a0May 23, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office was notified of a body in the river that was later identified as Mr. Viafore\u2019s, prosecutors said.Police also found the kayak plug in Ms. Graswald\u2019s car, they said.The plea carries a mandatory penalty of 1 to 4 years in state prison.

He subsequently announced that he had carried out the vetoes, as protests continued late on Monday outside the presidential palace.The legislation had drawn the ire of European Union leaders, who warned the measures it set forth would erode the rule of law in Poland\u2019s post-Communist democracy. Many of the tens of thousands of Poles who protested believed action from the EU would be decisive in pressuring the government to back down.The debate in Brussels, however, has moved more slowly than the reaction in Poland itself. The EU\u2019s executive branch was set on Wednesday to discuss legal procedures that could lead to fines against Poland after the country\u2019s leaders repeatedly rebuffed EU attempts to start a dialogue. But those actions would have taken months to bear fruit. Bolder steps such as stripping Poland of funding or its voting rights would ultimately require the consensus of all 27 other EU members, making them unlikely.Meanwhile, Mr. Duda saw a more widespread alliance of opposition rise up. Dozens of university rectors, hundreds of Polish legal experts, top business lobbies and former anti-Communist dissidents all voiced reservations about the bills. The U.S. State Department also criticized the legislation, as did U.S. Senator       John McCain.       On Monday, prominent Catholic leaders, normally close to the ruling party, thanked Mr. Duda for his decision to veto the bills.That broad chorus of opposition appears to have moved Mr. Duda to break with his party. In announcing his intention on Monday, he mentioned a conversation with       Zofia Romaszewska,        a 76-year-old anti-Communist dissident who was in Poland\u2019s 1980s Solidarity movement and has been close to the ruling party. The laws, she said, would return Poland to an era when courts took orders from the ruling party, as they did under Communism.\u201cI agree with all those who say that it should not be this way,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would deepen the divisions in our society.\u201dOne of the laws Mr. Duda vetoed would have retired every judge on the Supreme Court except those exempted by the justice minister, who would have then been allowed to appoint their temporary replacements. He also vetoed a second law that would have given the justice minister and parliament the authority to choose most of the appointees charged with selecting new Supreme Court judges to replace those temporary judges.The ruling party and the opposition agreed that the two laws would have amounted to a milestone for Poland. The Law and Justice party saw them as a means to purge the last of the country\u2019s officials who entered public life in the tainted Communist era. The opposition said the laws would have pushed Poland toward becoming an authoritarian-tinged democracy like Turkey or Russia, where leaders face few constitutional restraints.Both factions said they were surprised by the vetoes from Mr. Duda, a party loyalist who had never before so exerted his independence. Many protesters who rallied for days outside his office said they considered their efforts a hopeless bid to inspire him to defy his party.Mr. Duda, an obscure deputy justice minister when he was put forward by Law and Justice leader       Jaroslaw Kaczynski       as the party\u2019s 2015 presidential candidate, had been seen as a mere figurehead for the ruling party. A popular TV comedy show here lampoons the Polish president as forever stuck in Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s waiting room.With Mr. Duda\u2019s acquiescence, the Law and Justice party has passed a series of laws securing more direct parliamentary and government control over the press, as well as over a tribunal\u2014separate from the Supreme Court\u2014that decides whether laws are constitutional.\u2018We now have a better chance for a more balanced politics in Poland, and for separation of powers to remain.\u2019Mr. Duda\u2019s vetoes may now provoke a split in the ruling party, political scientists said, with the president exerting himself as a moderating force.\u201cI think this is maybe the beginning of a new Andrzej Duda, a new Polish president, an independent president,\u201d said Marcin Matczak, a law professor at the University of Warsaw. \u201cWe now have a better chance for a more balanced politics in Poland, and for separation of powers to remain.\u201dMr. Duda said he would sign a third law, which gives the ruling party more administrative powers over judges who preside over the country\u2019s lower courts. He also said he would like to help write legislation over the next two months aimed at overhauling the country\u2019s judiciary in what he called \u201cwise reform.\u201dWith that process still ahead, the president\u2019s vetoes aren\u2019t the last word on a controversial matter. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal but it doesn\u2019t mean the status quo in the Polish judiciary will stay,\u201d said Maciej Kisilowski, associate professor of law at the Central European University in Budapest, Hungary.After the announcement, top ruling-party officials gathered in their headquarters in central Warsaw to discuss further steps. The party doesn\u2019t have enough votes to override their president\u2019s veto, but it promised more action ahead.\u2018Changes to the judicial system and Poland\u2019s justice system are necessary. And they will be implemented.\u2019Arriving for the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters he was \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Mr. Duda\u2019s action. Another prominent official complained that \u201csomeone chickened out.\u201d\u201cChanges to the judicial system and Poland\u2019s justice system are necessary,\u201d said Stanislaw Karczewski, head of the upper chamber of the Polish parliament. \u201cAnd they will be implemented.\u201d\u2014Laurence Norman in Brussels contributed to this article.Write to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Polish President Blocks Court Law.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/polish-president-to-veto-two-bills-seen-as-moves-on-judiciary-1500889373", "keywords": ["duda,kaczynski,poland,polish judiciary,polish legislation,polish protests,separation of powers,Jaroslaw Kaczynski,Andrzej Duda,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:29:00", "news_title": "Massachusetts State Court Rules Against Immigration Detention Policy ", "content": "The highest court in Massachusetts dealt a fresh legal blow Monday to the Trump administration\u2019s effort to compel local authorities to assist in its crackdown against illegal immigration.The state\u2019s Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Massachusetts court officials can\u2019t hold people in jail simply because the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency requests it.ICE routinely issues these requests, called detainers, to local officials asking that they hold for up to 48 hours people who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The Trump administration has labeled those that don\u2019t comply \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions and is looking for ways to compel cooperation.While the decision applies only to Massachusetts, several federal appellate courts have issued similar rulings undercutting ICE\u2019s authority. In addition, a federal court has blocked parts of a Trump executive order aimed at punishing sanctuary cities.Justice Department spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t address the decision directly in a statement, but he urged cities to cooperate with detainees to protect public safety.\u201cThe attorney general has made clear that these so-called \u2018sanctuary policies\u2019 intentionally undermine our immigration laws by protecting illegal aliens who have committed crimes,\u201d he said.Many jurisdictions nationwide cooperate on immigration enforcement, but other cities and counties decline to honor detainers for both policy and legal reasons.The administration and its allies argue that it is wrong for jails to release people who are known to be undocumented and that turning them over to federal authorities for possible deportation prevents them from committing crimes. Opponents say that immigrant communities won\u2019t trust local police if they are seen as agents of immigration enforcement.The Massachusetts court ruled that keeping people in custody beyond their scheduled release amounts to an arrest and that nothing in federal or state law gives court officers authority to detain someone based on their immigration status. The court also noted that being in the U.S. without authorization is frequently a civil violation, not a criminal one.\u201cMassachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody,\u201d the court wrote in its decision in the case, Lunn v. Commonwealth.The case involved       Sreynuon Lunn,        who was arraigned on a count of unarmed robbery last fall. His case was dismissed but, because of a pending ICE detainer, he remained in jail and was then transferred to federal custody. He remained in the U.S. because of trouble deporting him.Massachusetts Attorney General       Maura Healey       celebrated the result, which she said was the first statewide decision on the matter.\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for the rule of law and smart immigration and criminal justice policies, and a rejection of anti-immigrant policies that have stoked fear in communities across the country,\u201d she said in a statement.The Trump administration also is pushing legislation that would cut federal funding for jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him.\u201dMr. Kushner spoke to the press after an interview behind closed doors Monday with the Senate Intelligence Committee staff. It was his first time speaking to congressional investigators who are probing Russian meddling in the election. Mr. Kushner is set to speak Tuesday, also in private, to the House Intelligence Committee.That interview Tuesday would come on the same day lawmakers are set to vote on a bill that would punish Russia with sweeping sanctions for interfering in the U.S. election. The bill would force the president to notify Congress if he wants to lift the sanctions, and the White House had criticized the legislation as an erosion of the president\u2019s power.Press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders,        who said Sunday that the president would sign the bill, said Monday that Mr. Trump would \u201cstudy\u201d the bill before deciding whether to sign it.Congressional investigators and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing a criminal probe for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as well as whether Trump associates colluded in it.According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence community, the interference was directed by the highest levels of the Russian government. The tactics included hacking state election systems, stealing and leaking information from party committees and political strategists, and using social media and other outlets to disseminate negative stories about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.Mr. Trump and his campaign aides have denied any collusion, and the president has said he questions U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 consensus Moscow sought to intervene during the campaign. Russian officials have denied the charge.The Senate Judiciary Committee was originally scheduled to hear testimony this week from former Trump campaign chairman       Paul Manafort       and Donald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s eldest son. But both men made agreements with the panel to provide documents and sit for interviews with committee staff as their representatives negotiate the terms around their public testimony. The committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), said they won\u2019t appear Wednesday but would eventually testify in public.A third witness scheduled to appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Glenn Simpson, has been issued a subpoena. Mr. Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who now runs a political-intelligence firm in Washington called Fusion GPS, helped compile a dossier of unverified material about the president when Mr. Trump was running for the Republican nomination.Ahead of the Senate panel interview on Monday, Mr. Kushner released an 11-page statement detailing his contacts with Russian officials and businesspeople in the two years since Mr. Trump launched his presidential campaign.In that statement, he said he had no improper interactions and that he hadn\u2019t \u201crelied\u201d on Russian funds to \u201cfinance [his] business activities.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Kushner didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether the statement meant no Russian funds were involved in his businesses.Mr. Kushner also provided to the committees documents including calendar entries, emails and call sheets that referenced any meetings or interactions with Russians, according to a person familiar with the document production.Democratic Sen.       Ron Wyden,        an Oregon Democrat and a member of the intelligence committee, said that Mr. Kushner\u2019s back-to-back appearances behind closed doors are no substitute for a public appearance.\u201cKushner\u2019s statement, which he released publicly to the press, raises far more questions than it answers,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in a statement. \u201cHe has an obligation to be transparent with all relevant documents to back up his claims.\u201dMr. Kushner\u2019s written statement released Monday included details of a previously undisclosed, brief meeting with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in April 2016.During the encounter\u2014shortly before Mr. Trump would become the Republican party\u2019s effective nominee\u2014Mr. Kushner met Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at an event at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. Mr. Kushner said he was introduced to Mr. Kislyak and three other ambassadors by       Dimitri Simes,        the publisher of a foreign-policy magazine who was hosting the event, at a reception held directly before it.Mr. Trump, who gave a speech addressing foreign policy at the event, also greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to a VIP reception, The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2016.Mr. Kushner\u2019s account makes no mention of Mr. Trump being present at the reception. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2014then a U.S. senator advising the Trump campaign\u2014also attended the event, and said in sworn testimony before a Senate panel this past June that he couldn\u2019t recall whether he had a passing encounter with Mr. Kislyak there.\u201cThe ambassadors\u2026expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election,\u201d Mr. Kushner wrote in his statement. \u201cEach exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Kushner had previously denied that Messrs. Kushner and Kislyak met privately at the event. A separate Kushner spokesman said Monday that the statement doesn\u2019t contradict the previous denial because the two met at a reception, not one-on-one.In the statement, Mr. Kushner also denied trying to establish any \u201cbackchannel\u201d with Russia, though he said that in a December meeting with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Kushner proposed receiving information about military operations in Syria via a secure communications line at the Russian embassy, because the Trump transition team had no secure system of its own.After Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on Election Day, the White House repeatedly denied that there had been any contacts between his campaign and Russian officials\u2014many of which have since emerged. \u201cIt never happened,\u201d spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Associated Press in November. \u201cThere was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.\u201dSince then, it has emerged that several members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign\u2014some of whom now serve in his administration\u2014did have contact with Russians. They include Mr. Sessions, former national security adviser       Mike Flynn       and Donald Trump Jr.The Russian Embassy announced on Twitter Saturday that Mr. Kislyak has concluded his assignment in Washington.The new meeting disclosed on Monday comes on top of three previously confirmed meetings Mr. Kushner has held with Russians. He also disclosed that in October he reported to a Secret Service agent an email he received from someone under the name \u201cGuccifer400\u201d that threatened to \u201creveal candidate Trump\u2019s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information.\u201d The agent advised Mr. Kushner to ignore the email, and Mr. Kushner said he wasn\u2019t contacted by the sender again.In June 2016, Mr. Kushner met with Russian lawyer      Natalia Veselnitskaya,        Mr. Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. in a meeting arranged by the younger Mr. Trump. Emails the president\u2019s son released earlier this month showed the meeting was held to discuss allegedly damaging information about Mrs. Clinton that the Trump campaign was told was being offered by the Russian government in support of the elder Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Mr. Kushner said Monday that he arrived late to the meeting and left early, sending his assistant an email that said: \u201cCan u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.\u201d He said that while he was there, the meeting didn\u2019t discuss \u201canything about the campaign\u201d and said there was no follow-up.Mr. Kushner disclosed the meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya earlier this year in a required form to obtain a security clearance. Mr. Kushner initially filed a disclosure that didn\u2019t list any contacts with foreign government officials, but the next day submitted a supplemental disclosure saying that he had engaged in \u201cnumerous contacts with foreign officials.\u201dHe said Monday that the omission of foreign contacts was an administrative error.Mr. Kushner has since submitted information about \u201cover 100 contacts from more than 20 countries,\u201d he said. That information hasn\u2019t been publicly disclosed.\u2014Shane Harris, Natalie Andrews and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Kushner Denies Collusion With Russians.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jared-kushner-releases-details-on-previously-undisclosed-meeting-with-russian-ambassador-1500890433", "keywords": ["election,investigation, ivanka trump,jared kushner,president donald trump,russia,russia ties, trump's son in law, trump's ties to russia, trump advisers, trump associates, trump campaign,Kushner Cos.,Jared Kushner,Sergei Kislyak,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,real estate transactions,real estate,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:23:00", "news_title": "\u2018Everything Now\u2019 by Arcade Fire Review: The Highs and Lows of Instant Gratification", "content": "\u2018Everything Now\u201d (Columbia) by Arcade Fire, out on Friday, is a curious album with a dual personality. The music springs from the rock-disco hybrid and synth pop of the late 1970s and early \u201980s; for the most part, it\u2019s irresistible dance funk produced by the band, Daft Punk\u2019s       Thomas Bangalter       and Pulp\u2019s       Steve Mackey.       But the storytelling is as dark and dour as the music is bright and inviting. Were the narratives any less compelling, the conflict may have seemed an artifice, an intentionally provocative disconnect. But it works well and in fact reflects the overarching theme.With \u201cEverything Now,\u201d the sextet\u2014Will Butler,       Win Butler,       R\u00e9gine Chassagne,       Jeremy Gara,       Tim Kingsbury       and       Richard Reed Parry      \u2014comments on life in a consumer society that, as the title states, can provide instant gratification that often makes the disposable appear indistinct from the valuable. In such a milieu, insincerity is coin.In the title track, which is performed three times in slightly different forms on the disc, Win Butler sings, \u201cAnd every song that I\u2019ve ever heard is playing at the same time / It\u2019s absurd,\u201d adding, \u201cTurn the speakers up til they break / \u2019Cause every time you smile, it\u2019s fake.\u201d Having everything now may provide \u201cInfinite Content,\u201d as a composition of the same name states, but not infinite contentment since \u201cAll your money is already spent on it.\u201d In \u201cPut Your Money on Me,\u201c he sings, \u201cAll my presents are broken before they\u2019re open / And the promises the second they\u2019re spoken.\u201dWhen values are devalued and life is a mere quest for acquisition and acclaim, despair sinks in. In \u201cCreature Comfort,\u201d a character decides she doesn\u2019t want to live without achieving celebrity. \u201cGod, make me famous / If you can\u2019t, just make it painless,\u201d she states bluntly. The song continues: \u201cShe dreams about dying all the time / She told me she came so close, filled up the bathtub and put on our first record.\u201d In 2004, Arcade Fire\u2019s debut album \u201cFuneral\u201d addressed the subject of death, but also recovery. Perhaps a hint of hope in an earlier verse by the group saved her from suicide.The scenario is repeated in \u201cGood God Damn\u201d: \u201cPut your favorite record on, baby and fill the bathtub up.\u2026It\u2019s always darkest before the dawn / But the sun never shows.\u201d But the narrator looks to God, though not without questioning his merit. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a good God, damn\u201d is a repeated line. Then a realization: \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a good God / If he made you.\u201d In \u201cWe Don\u2019t Deserve Love,\u201d the writers employ a scorched-earth metaphor: \u201cYou say I can\u2019t see the forest for the trees / So burn it all down and bring the ashes to me.\u201dThese grim, fatalistic tales are accompanied by music too alive to be mere cynical counterpoint, though one interpretation could be that those who are gleefully lost in ephemera are unaware of the tragedy that hovers nearby. As its live shows illustrate, Arcade Fire is an exceptional band, and on its previous album, \u201cReflektor\u201d (2013), it proved it\u2019s at ease with dance funk. Here, the group is joined by, among others, saxophonist       Stuart Bogie,        pianist       Owen Pallett      \u2014who, along with       Sarah Neufield,        arranged the strings\u2014and       Daniel Lanois,        who plays pedal-steel guitar on two tracks. All together, they make music that is proudly retro. One take of the title track recalls Abba, albeit with a pygmy flute and a chugging acoustic guitar peeking through, while the delightfully relentless \u201cPut Your Money on Me\u201d brings to mind Kraftwerk and       Giorgio Moroder.       \u201cInfinite Content\u201d is played twice, once as country folk with Mr. Gara brushing the snare drum, the other as booming four-beats-to-the-bar rock with a roller-rink-like organ in the mix. \u201cChemistry\u201d straddles early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and reggae. But in the main, the band is content to ride a dance-funk wave atop fat, unremitting bass tones as in \u201cGood God Damn.\u201dOn \u201cEverything Now,\u201d opposing forces seem a natural fit. An optimist might say the message is to wake up to the need to reprioritize but still enjoy the groove. A pessimist might insist that, in the face of a culture that values wealth and accumulation over principle, one might as well resign and keep dancing.

In 1992, the Iran-Contra special prosecutor reached the opposite conclusion regarding President       George H.W. Bush.Neither president took that step, and constitutional scholars say the question of the presidential self-pardon remains unresolved.But the U.S. Constitution, unlike many state governments, centralizes prosecutorial authority under the president. That means he could forbid the Justice Department from investigating or pursuing criminal charges against anyone, including himself, so he may never reach the point of having to pardon himself.The subject has come to the fore in recent days after reports emerged that President       Donald Trump       had asked his advisers about his ability to pardon various people, including himself.Trump officials say the issue won\u2019t come up because there was no wrongdoing.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if he has the right to [pardon] himself or not,\u201d White House communications director       Anthony Scaramucci       said Sunday on CNN. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, anyway, because that is another one of those stupid hypotheticals.\u00a0He\u2019s not going to have to pardon himself, because he\u2019s done absolutely nothing wrong.\u201dThe president himself tweeted Saturday, \u201cWhile all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS.\u201dThe Justice Department has taken the position that a president can\u2019t be prosecuted. Past special prosecutors have disagreed.\u201cIt is very likely that a president is subject to federal indictment. No one is above the law in this country,\u201d says       Ronald Rotunda,        a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., who worked both for the Senate Watergate Committee and later       Kenneth Starr,        the independent counsel whose investigation of President       Bill Clinton       led to impeachment and acquittal.Last week, the             New York Times                   reported on a memo obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in which Mr. Rotunda advised Mr. Starr that the president was subject to indictment.\u201cI have thought about these issues for years, beginning with my work on the Watergate Committee,\u201d Mr. Rotunda said. \u201cStarr\u2019s request for a legal opinion forced me to think about it more carefully and see what is most likely the law.\u201dBut past special prosecutors such as Mr. Starr operated under broad statutory authority that since has expired. Under current law, special counsel       Robert Mueller,        who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, only has the authority to recommend to higher-ups that indictments be sought, says       Frank Bowman,        a law professor at the University of Missouri who publishes the ImpeachableOffenses.net blog.Even if Justice Department attorneys obtained an indictment before the president issued an order canceling the investigation\u2014or defied such an order\u2014Mr. Trump could replace hostile officials with those willing to follow his orders. And if a \u201crunaway\u201d federal grand jury voted for an indictment on its own, a prosecution couldn\u2019t proceed without a signature from a Justice Department lawyer, Mr. Bowman says.\u201cThe judge has no independent power to create a prosecutorial authority,\u201d he says.A president attempting to derail an investigation could wreak havoc with traditional concepts of law and order, legal experts say. Because he has the power to pardon anyone for a federal crime, with the possible exception of himself, a president could in theory pardon individuals for obstructing an investigation if the offense took place under federal jurisdiction\u2014as is all of Washington, D.C.But there\u2019s a far easier course if Mr. Trump acts on his assertion that the investigation against him is an illegitimate \u201cwitch hunt\u201d: He could fire Mr. Mueller.\u201cIf Trump takes Mueller off the board, he can pretty much stop the whole thing,\u201d Mr. Bowman says. At that point, the inquiry\u2019s only avenue \u201cprobably rests on the midterm elections of 2018\u201d\u2014and whether the Democrats can seize a chamber of Congress, and with it the ability to pursue their own investigations.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/presidential-self-pardon-remains-a-murky-issue-1500931420", "keywords": ["donald trump,pardon,robert mueller,Anthony Scaramucci,Donald Trump,Frank Bowman,Robert Mueller,Ronald Rotunda,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:18:00", "news_title": "Dow Falls as Investors Await Another Round of Earnings Reports", "content": "Major U.S. stock indexes were mixed Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 posting their third straight session of declines while the             Nasdaq Co      mposite closed at a record.U.S. stock-trading volumes were below 2017\u2019s daily average.Some investors said they were awaiting a string of earnings results this week and a policy statement from the Federal Reserve due Wednesday.

PETERSBURG, Russia\u2014Internal discord among OPEC members and big oil-producing allies spilled into public view Monday as the group struggles with its efforts to raise prices for crude.Until now, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had largely blamed low prices on U.S. shale drillers, which are at the heart of an American oil boom that has decimated the group\u2019s power. Oil prices have actually fallen since OPEC\u2019s 14 members and 10 other big producers struck a deal in December to withhold 2% of global oil supply, in part because American producers ramped up output.OPEC officials said they were now looking inward and contemplating a crackdown on members that aren\u2019t keeping their promises to limit output. OPEC production rose again in July to over 33 million barrels a day, a Petro-Logistics report said last week, near the group\u2019s record levels of 2016.OPEC officials expressed frustration with a new truth of the oil market: The group no longer has much power to lift prices, but it can certainly send prices lower with too much production. Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and others haven\u2019t cut as much output as promised.\u201cWe are not doing this to allow other countries to free ride and undercut the agreement by overproducing,\u201d said       Khalid al-Falih,        the Saudi Arabian energy minister, in unusually blunt remarks following a meeting Monday with national representatives from oil-producing countries.Mr. Falih       said Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, announced it would go further than cutting its production and would also limit its exports at 6.6 million barrels a day in August. He said he wanted other countries to follow suit, noting troubling figures that showed some were still exporting huge amounts of oil even as they say they are cutting output.OPEC also secured a production commitment from Nigeria, a group member exempted from last year\u2019s deal, although that isn\u2019t likely to have an immediate effect on the crude market.\u201cWe are aiming to bring those who are slacking to full conformity,\u201d said Russian Energy Minister       Alexander Novak       in an interview. Russia isn\u2019t an OPEC member, but its commitment to limit output was crucial to securing an OPEC deal last fall.Crude prices rose modestly after Monday\u2019s meeting. U.S. crude futures were up 1.25%, to $46.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 1.12% to $48.60 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.Mr. Falih\u2019s focus on exports was new. He pointed to discrepancies between countries\u2019 production and export figures, calling the difference \u201ca matter of concern.\u201dFor example, OPEC\u2019s production fell by 920,000 barrels a day from October to June, according to the International Energy Agency. But its exports were only 120,000 barrels a day lower in June compared with October, according to Kpler, a ship-tracking firm.So even with OPEC cutting production, it was still sending roughly the same amount of oil into the global market in June as it was in October, the month used as the baseline level for the production deal.\u201cExports have become the key metric for financial markets, and we need to find a way to reconcile credible export data with production data,\u201d Mr. Falih said.The announcements came after meetings in St. Petersburg over the weekend and a gathering of big producers at the Four Seasons Hotel. It highlighted how worried OPEC members have become about the futility of their efforts.\u201cThis is a collective effort,\u201d Mr. Falih said after the meeting, saying he had held a teleconference with absent countries that haven\u2019t been cutting to \u201cforcefully demand participation and the same level of commitment\u2026We are not going to just sit back and watch.\u201dMr. Falih is under pressure to keep the OPEC deal from falling apart and raise prices, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The Saudi kingdom is preparing to publicly list its state oil company in 2018, and its valuation will depend in part on oil prices.Mr. Falih has become concerned about the deal as prices kept falling in recent weeks and bad news kept rolling in, according to people familiar with the matter. He said Saudi Arabia could support extending the production deal beyond its expiration in March 2018. It culminated last week with tanker-tracking firm Petro-Logistics reporting OPEC output rose above 33 million barrels a day this month, up 145,000 barrels a day from a month ago.Even if Monday\u2019s news gives oil prices a lasting lift, OPEC still has to worry about U.S. shale producers taking advantage and throttling up output. That is what happened after last year\u2019s OPEC deal, and the flood of new oil from the U.S. is one reason oil prices remain depressed.Giovanni Staunovo,        commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group AG, said the production deal has \u201ca 20%-30% probability of a breakdown.\u201cShould this happen, countries bound by the deal would likely immediately ramp up production back to predeal levels, the oil market would move from a deficit into oversupply, and prices may plunge heavily,\u201d Mr. Staunovo said.A new Saudi cut to its exports could have a real effect on the balance of supply and demand, said       Bjarne Schieldrop,        a commodity analyst with the Nordic bank SEB. The kingdom exported an average of 7.2 million barrels a day from January to May, he said, so the new action would theoretically remove an additional 600,000 barrels a day from the market.But Saudi Arabia generally reduces exports in the summer when it faces rising domestic demand for crude oil to be burned to create electricity for air conditioning.The limit on Nigeria, however, is less likely to result in helping reduce the oil glut. Nigeria has agreed to limit its production to 1.8 million barrels a day, OPEC officials said. The African country produced about 1.6 million barrels a day in June, giving it substantial room to keep increasing.Another OPEC member exempted from last year\u2019s deal, Libya, has a target of 1.25 million barrels a day, still higher than its June production of 820,000 million barrels a day.Beyond Libya and Nigeria, Iraq, OPEC\u2019s second-biggest producer, and the U.A.E. have been pumping more than their agreed-upon limits.\u201cWe\u2019ve had very serious discussions with those countries that are not performing as well as others,\u201d Mr. Falih said, saying there were unspecified \u201cmechanisms in place to bring those countries in line.\u201dAnalysts have warned that any new production cuts from OPEC would likely just help American shale producers. First, it would cede market share to the U.S. from OPEC. Second, any price rally would likely be quickly killed by new shale production, they say.\u2014       Sarah McFarlane       and Summer Said contributed to this article.Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com, Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'OPEC Takes Blame for Low Price.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-huddles-with-oil-allies-in-fight-against-glut-1500887769", "keywords": ["brent crude,cartel,crude oil,investors,khalid al-falih ,libya,nigeria,non-opec,oil glut,oil prices,oil production,opec,production cuts,the organization of the petroleum exporting countries,weak oil price,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Bjarne Schieldrop,Khalid al-Falih,Alexander Novak,output,production,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:13:00", "news_title": "JFK Cargo Shipments Drop More Than 20% ", "content": "Amid rising competition from other airports and major shifts in the way goods arrive to the U.S., cargo shipments into New York City\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport have dropped more than 20% during the past decade, a new report shows.The downward slide at JFK comes as cargo volume is rising at nearly every other major airport in the U.S., and as the air-cargo market is growing overall, according to a report released on Monday from the Manhattan-based Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan policy center.Air cargo coming in and out of the U.S. is expected to rise at a rate of about 3% a year through 2037, a recent report from the Federal Aviation Administration found.If New York\u2019s largest airport doesn\u2019t maintain its share of the market, it could lead to continued losses of middle-class jobs, said       Matt A.V. Chaban,        policy director for the Center for an Urban Future.The report found there are 34,041 jobs related to JFK\u2019s air-cargo industry now, 26% fewer since the airport hit a 2004 peak in jobs.Based on preliminary figures from Airports Council International - North America, a trade association, air-cargo shipments in metric tons dropped to 1,264,187 last year from 1,286,484 in 2015.During the past several years, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says it has invested about $10 million in infrastructure development in support of cargo growth at JFK. Moreover, the Port Authority has allocated an additional $50 million towards supporting any future third-party cargo development.Port Authority officials have noted that cargo tonnage is up 6% so far this year, including a 11.9% increase in May from a year earlier.JFK also still ranks highest nationally in the value of shipments it receives; $185.5 billion in 2015, according to a 2017 report from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\u201cThe pie is getting larger and there are some investments we have been making in our facilities to make sure JFK continues to be an attractive place to do business,\u201d said       Huntley Lawrence,        aviation director for the Port Authority.JFK opened to commercial flights 69 years ago and, with Los Angeles International Airport, was the premier international gateway for U.S. travel. JFK handled more cargo than any other airport up until 1990.Experts say two structural changes have contributed most to the drop in air-cargo shipments to JFK: Increasing trade with Asia and a decline in manufacturing. As the U.S. shifted trade from Europe to Asia, trans-Atlantic shipments began to slow. The Northeast, over several decades, also has lost manufacturing, and deliveries of large equipment have moved to other areas of the country.In addition, hub airlines have built up international gateways in different cities and increased belly capacity in passenger planes to carry more cargo, according to       Brian Clancy,        managing director of Logistics Capital & Strategy, a consulting firm based in Arlington, Va.\u201cAs we opened up our markets and allowed more foreign airlines to fly to more cities they naturally spread their network across multiple gateways,\u201d he explained.Still, the shift away from JFK primarily is driven by shippers looking to optimize costs. Analysts say that there is always a draw to bring goods into New York because it is a huge market\u2014especially for luxury products\u2014but they also point to JFK\u2019s aging facilities. Road tolls and the traffic in and out of the airport on the Van Wyck Expressway are additional barriers that can make other airports more attractive.Because JFK is a legacy gateway, its facilities, which range from state-of-the-art to Quonset hut, are fully built out. Cargo buildings would need to be rehabilitated or replaced, which is more complicated than starting fresh.Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport, has seen its cargo shipments rise 38% during the last five years, had open space upon which to build its new $220 million cargo center, the first part of which opened last December.It is tough to justify erecting new facilities at JFK when it appears \u201cyou are dealing with a market that\u2019s in decline,\u201d said       Michael Webber,        president of Webber Air Cargo Inc., an Austin-based consulting firm. \u201cThey need new facilities, though, because it might contribute to stopping the bleeding.\u201dOfficials for the New York City Economic Development Corporation and for the Port Authority say recent investments and policy changes have opened new opportunities for JFK.In 2014, a new truck stop opened at JFK and, in 2015, the city changed rules that allow for 53-foot trailers to take new routes into the airport.A year ago, Air France-KLM Cargo opened a new cargo-handling facility there. In late 2016, the city announced a new business-improvement district for the JFK area.A state-of-the art animal-cargo facility opened earlier this year and is attracting valuable horse and livestock shipments, which travel in cargo planes, rather than in the belly of passenger planes.Write to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jfk-cargo-shipments-drop-more-than-20-1500930822", "keywords": ["air cargo,air transportation,freight flights,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:13:00", "news_title": "Payless Reorganization Plan Wins Court Approval ", "content": "Payless ShoeSource Inc.\u2019s reorganization plan won court approval on Monday, moving the discount shoe retailer closer to exiting bankruptcy protection.The plan will allow Payless to eliminate 40% of its $838 million in funded debt from its balance sheet by giving lenders equity stakes in the company in exchange for debt forgiveness. Senior lenders, owed $506 million, will share in a 91% equity stake in the reorganized company, while junior lenders owed $145 million, are slated to take the remaining 9% stake.The country\u2019s largest footwear retailer, Payless sought bankruptcy protection in April, following a parade of retailers that have blamed their financial woes on declining foot traffic and the proliferation of online shopping. Unlike its competitors, Payless has closed only a portion of its 4,400 locations.Since the outset of the bankruptcy filing, Payless has planned to exit bankruptcy protection by August. The company will now be under the control of its senior and junior lenders, which include             Blackstone Group                   LP\u2019s GSO Capital Partners, Alden Global Capital LLC, Axar Capital Management LP, Credit Suisse Asset Management and Octagon Credit Investors LLC.Payless has experienced some hiccups on its path to plan confirmation, namely from the unsecured creditors\u2019 committee. Until late June, the creditors had opposed the plan due to the slim recovery it initially offered the group, as well as the broad releases for Payless\u2019s private-equity backers, Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital.The committee had initially said they were taking a hard look at whether Golden Gate and Blum increased Payless\u2019s debt load significantly for their own benefit. The committee pointed to the $382 million in new debt that Payless took on when Golden Gate and Blum took a 98.5% stake. Additionally, the committee took issue with Payless taking on new debt in the following years to pay $350 million in dividends to the firms.However, the creditors and private-equity firms smoothed over the conflict following negotiations that led to a higher recovery for the unsecured creditors. The settlement called for the firms and lenders to pay more than $20 million to Payless to settle any potential claims; in exchange, the releases stand as part of the plan.Nevertheless, Payless\u2019s plan didn\u2019t go before Judge Kathy Surratt-States of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in St. Louis uncontested on Monday. Judge Surratt-States overruled an objection from the U.S. Trustee regarding the broad releases of Payless\u2019s insiders from liabilities.\u201cThe court cannot ignore the overwhelming support from creditors for this plan,\u201d Judge Surratt-States said Monday. \u201cAs was noted, just a few weeks ago at the hearing for the disclosure statement, the creditors\u2019 committee was vehemently opposed to the plan as proposed.\u201dWrite to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/payless-reorganization-plan-wins-court-approval-1500930784", "keywords": ["bankruptcy ,chapter 11,exiting,pe restructuring,reorganization,restructuring,shoe stores,sneakers,Payless ShoeSource,plans,strategy,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,corporate restructuring,retail,wholesale,specialty stores"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:09:00", "news_title": "We Won\u2019t See You in Court: The Era of Tort Lawsuits Is Waning", "content": "Americans, reputed to be the most litigious people in the world, are filing far fewer lawsuits.Fewer than two in 1,000 people\u2014the alleged victims of inattentive motorists, medical malpractice, faulty products and other civil wrongs\u2014filed tort lawsuits in 2015, an analysis of the latest available data collected by the National Center for State Courts shows. That is down sharply from 1993, when about 10 in 1,000 Americans filed such suits.A host of factors are fueling the decline, including state restrictions on litigation, the increasing cost of bringing suits, improved auto safety and a long campaign by businesses to turn public opinion against plaintiffs and their lawyers.The nationwide ebb in lawsuits, which confounds the public perception of courts choked with tort claims, has broad ramifications for businesses, doctors, patients, lawyers and the courts themselves.Companies and insurers on the receiving end of such lawsuits welcome the decline of what they regard as a lawsuit culture in which lawyer-driven litigation increases costs to both business and consumers.Trade groups that represent these firms have long pushed for laws to raise the bar for filing lawsuits and rein in damages, portraying a large chunk of tort litigation as a drag on the economy that burns scarce judicial resources.Lisa Rickard,        president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, says that while state measures have \u201cweeded out some frivolous lawsuits,\u201d litigation abuse remains a problem. \u201cThe American public wholeheartedly agrees there are too many lawsuits in the country,\u201d she says.At the same time, the falling number of tort filings, coupled with the broader decline in civil jury trials, has some judges concerned that Americans with garden-variety cases no longer see courts as an affordable way to seek redress for their injuries.\u201cPeople are just not filing cases like they used to. They are not seeking trials like they used to,\u201d says Senior Judge       Gregory Mize       of the District of Columbia Superior Court, a local trial court. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive and time-consuming.\u201dThe Conference of Chief Justices, an association of state judicial leaders, has been working on tweaks to the civil justice system that officials hope will make many cases move more quickly and cost less. Judge Mize is assisting the committee studying the issue.Torts are civil wrongs that cause someone to suffer loss or harm. Most tort lawsuits seek damages for negligence rather than deliberate injury and fall into one of three categories: auto cases, medical malpractice or product liability.Tort lawsuits now account for less than 5% of all civil filings in state courts. Contract cases, including those filed by corporate plaintiffs such as debt collectors and banks foreclosing on homeowners, have increased in number and now represent about half of all civil cases.Most civil cases are filed in state courts\u2014more than 15 million in 2015, compared with 281,608 cases brought in federal courts that year, according to federal statistics and data collected by the National Center for State Courts, a research center for state courts.Federal courts have seen an increase in some types of mass tort cases in recent years, but the reality in state courts, where about 98% of all cases are filed, contrasts sharply with public perception of civil dockets awash in tort lawsuits. An election-night poll last November by Public Opinion Strategies showed that 87% of voters agreed that there are \u201ctoo many lawsuits filed in America.\u201dTort filings spiked in the 1980s, prompting the formation of groups like the American Tort Reform Association in 1986 and triggering a wave of legislation meant to impose new requirements for filing lawsuits or to reduce monetary awards to plaintiffs.Tort cases declined from 16% of civil filings in state courts in 1993 to about 4% in 2015, a difference of more than 1.7 million cases nationwide, according to an analysis of annual reports from the National Center for State Courts. Those estimates are based on case percentages recorded by more than 20 states that track tort filings.Contract cases\u2014a category that includes debt collection, foreclosure and landlord-tenant disputes\u2014grew from 18% of the civil docket to 51%, according to the center\u2019s data.The Fall of the TortTort lawsuits have declined sharplyover the past two decades, whilecontract suits have increased.Total civil filings in state courts15 million105", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-wont-see-you-in-court-the-era-of-tort-lawsuits-is-waning-1500930572", "keywords": ["civil litigation,civil suits,lawsuits,plaintiffs' lawyers,tort reform,torts,corporate crime,legal action,labor,personnel,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements,gross misconduct,malpractice,political,general news,crime,legal services,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:04:00", "news_title": "Venezuela Bonds Slide Following Sanctions Threat ", "content": "Venezuelan bond prices tumbled to their lowest levels of the year as default fears grew following U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       threat to impose sanctions on the country.State-owned oil producer Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA\u2019s bonds due in November fell 2.9% late in New York trading Monday and have tumbled 7.6% over the past six sessions, now at their lowest levels since December, according to Thomson Reuters data. The government\u2019s bonds due in 2038 were down 10% during the period after falling 4.3% on Monday.A selloff in the country\u2019s debt has accelerated since Mr. Trump\u2019s statement a week ago, which followed a referendum by millions of Venezuelans that rejected President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s       plan to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution. Mr. Trump called Mr. Maduro \u201ca bad leader,\u201d and said that the U.S. \u201cwill take strong and swift economic actions\u201d unless Mr. Maduro abandons plans to pick a new constituent assembly on July 30, which could bypass the current congress under the opposition\u2019s control.The statement has fueled concerns that the U.S. might unveil a new round of sanctions on Venezuela that could cripple the country\u2019s energy sector. Oil exports are the primary source of dollar revenues for Venezuela, analysts say. Meanwhile, the head of PdVSA\u2019s union is calling for oil workers to join an anti-Maduro strike, which could also lead to disruptions to the country\u2019s oil production.\u201cIf there\u2019s a sudden interruption in terms of cash flow, they are not going to pay anything,\u201d said       Siobhan Morden,        head of Latin America fixed-income strategy at Nomura Securities International. \u201cThe perception is for near-term default.\u201dSo far the U.S. administration hasn\u2019t detailed the possible sanctions, but a senior U.S. administration official said last week one option could be to ban Venezuela\u2019s crude-oil exports to the U.S.Buying Venezuelan debt was a winning trade last year, before it recently turned into a tough undertaking.For years, some investors have been scooping up near-term bonds issued by Venezuela at deep discounts, collecting coupon payments and betting that the government would service its debt as long as it can. That trade returned 53% in 2016, a top performer in emerging markets, according to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. For the first half of 2017, these bonds were up 2.5%, while emerging-market debt gained 6.2%.Lately, the combination of a challenging political environment and strained finances has raised questions over the government\u2019s willingness and ability to pay.Between its sovereign and PdVDA bonds, Venezuela still has about $5 billion in principal and coupon payments until the end of the year. Its total international reserves, including gold, have fallen to about $10 billion, a 15-year low, according to its central bank.In May, Venezuela sold bonds worth $2.8 billion to Goldman Sachs Asset Management at a 69% discount as a way to raise cash.Given the already-severe economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, some analysts say they are skeptical the U.S. will impose harsh sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector.Ms. Morden, who expects the sanctions to be on individuals, said \u201cuntil we have some definition, the market will remain jittery.\u201dWrite to Carolyn Cui at carolyn.cui@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Venezuela Bonds Fall After Sanction Threat.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-bonds-slide-following-sanctions-threat-1500930275", "keywords": ["bonds,debt,emerging markets,goldman sachs asset management,oil production,pdvsa,petroleos de venezuela,sanctions,Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,Siobhan Morden,government finance,government borrowing,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 17:03:00", "news_title": "Daimler Gets a Foothold in China\u2019s Self-Driving Car Market", "content": "SHANGHAI\u2014Mercedes-Benz parent             Daimler AG        DMLRY -0.80%       is investing in a Chinese self-driving startup, in another instance of a Western auto maker seeking out a Chinese partner to get a foothold in a challenging market.The Stuttgart, Germany-based automotive giant made its first ever investment in a Chinese startup this week, taking part in a $46 million funding round for Momenta, a Beijing-based firm providing road sensors and high definition mapping software.Other investors in Momenta include NIO, an electric-vehicle maker backed by             Tencent Holdings                   that has pledged to sell fully autonomous cars in the U.S. in 2020.Daimler declined to comment.It joins peers such as Hyundai Motors Co. in aligning with Chinese firms as the race to develop an autonomous vehicle revs up.Western auto makers face high hurdles entering China because the country considers the kind of mapping needed to make self-driving cars work a national security issue and limits it to domestic companies. Foreign software and car companies also could face difficulty gaining approval to conduct test drives in the country, The Wall Street Journal recently reported.China has made self driving cars part of its national agenda, setting autonomous vehicle targets and creating sandboxes to test such technology, as Beijing makes a big push to dominate the world\u2019s artificial intelligence industry by 2030.In a plan unveiled by the State Council on July 20, China pledged to invest and groom technologies from autonomous driving to computer vision for use in sectors such as national security and manufacturing.

But in the eyes of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the City Council has been a problem as well, with lawmakers taking up several high-profile bills in recent years scrutinizing officers and the work they do.Now, with most of the 51 lawmakers up for re-election this year, the police union is seizing on a chance to do something about it.The Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, or PBA, plans to play big in this year\u2019s City Council races, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on campaign ads in the hopes of reshaping the council to make it friendlier to its 24,000 police officers and some 25,000 retirees.\u201cWe need to have a city council that will speak up, defend New York City police officers, and dig into the issues so that they understand them,\u201d PBA President       Patrick Lynch       said in a phone interview. \u201cWe also need them to stand up to the [de Blasio] administration and speak up on behalf of police officers as allies.\u201dThe union plans to endorse candidates in about a dozen City Council races. Most of the council\u2019s 51 members are up for re-election this year.In East Harlem, the union plans to back state       Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez,        a Democrat running for the seat being vacated by City Council Speaker       Melissa Mark-Viverito,        who is term-limited. In Queens, the PBA will endorse Councilwoman       Elizabeth Crowley,        a Queens Democrat. In Brooklyn it plans to endorse       F\u00e9lix Ortiz,        a state assemblyman and Democrat hoping to unseat Councilman       Carlos Menchaca,        also a Democrat.In some cases, the union is targeting lawmakers it sees as openly hostile to police. Mr. Menchaca, for example, has supported legislation the PBA views as hostile, and has declined to meet with union officials, according to advisers familiar with the PBA campaign.Mr. Menchaca said he is focused on building \u201cstrong ties between the police and our community while fighting to end broken-windows policing,\u201d a reference to a policing strategy that focuses on small crimes with an aim in preventing more serious ones, which some critics have said unfairly targets minorities.\u201cI will never waver in my progressive values, especially when there\u2019s so much work to be done in communities of color in this city and across the country,\u201d he said in a text message.In recent years the City Council, one of the most unabashedly liberal groups of lawmakers the city has seen in decades, has introduced legislation curbing police powers.One bill would have made the use of chokeholds by officers, already banned, a misdemeanor crime. Another sought to require officers to obtain consent before conducting a street stop without probable cause. Still another would have forced officers to give their name, rank and command to anyone they stop when the encounter doesn\u2019t result in an arrest or summons. The bills were ultimately tabled, though some measures were adopted administratively.Mr. Lynch said the legislative efforts to constrain police were unreasonable.Councilman       Rory Lancman,        who sponsored the bill to criminalize chokeholds, said he isn\u2019t antipolice. \u201cAll of us who support police reform bills have been very clear about respecting and appreciating what police officers do for us while desiring to change broader policing policies,\u201d he said.Such legislation isn\u2019t the union\u2019s only beef. The union\u2019s feud with Mr. de Blasio and the City Council in recent years has unfolded against the backdrop of tense and protracted labor contract negotiations.The police union has for years sought higher pay, arguing that salaries for NYPD officers are low when compared with officers in the surrounding suburbs. The starting salary for NYPD officers is $42,500; for the New York state troopers working in New York City, it is $67,083, a difference PBA officials say is unfair and makes it harder to attract talented recruits.\u201cWe\u2019ve changed the city, we\u2019re keeping the city in good shape, and then we don\u2019t get the support that we need,\u201d Mr. Lynch said.A de Blasio spokeswoman said that was untrue. \u201cNew York City\u2019s police officers deserve the best, which is why their total compensation is among the highest in the country\u2014a package that was agreed upon by the City and the PBA through extensive negotiations,\u201d       Freddi Goldstein,        the spokeswoman, said in a statement.The PBA leadership has also long sought increased disability benefits for injured officers. When they didn\u2019t win that concession from the city, they got it in a deal signed by New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       this month instead. The state agreement will cost New York City an estimated $54 million over five years, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission.The PBA\u2019s City Council blitz is the latest campaign by a union that has played an outsize role in New York City politics for years. The union staged a rally against Mayor       David Dinkins       in 1992, protested Mayor       Rudy Giuliani       during a 2001 labor dispute and meted out the same treatment to Mayor       Michael Bloomberg,        picketing his Upper East Side townhouse during 2004 contract negotiations. The union has frequently used the specter of rising crime as a negotiating tactic, often with fruitful results.\u201cAsk anybody, \u2018Do you want to be protested by the PBA?\u2019 The answer is no,\u201d said       Ed Skyler,        who served as a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, and helped negotiate a labor contract with the group.Mr. Skyler said the union\u2019s political power has endured as the city has enjoyed economic gains thanks in part to a dramatic decrease in crime over the past two decades. \u201cThey\u2019re a very, very powerful\u00a0and influential union,\u201d he said.The labor contract the de Blasio administration reached with the police union earlier this year expires\u00a0July 31.

The fund borrowed heavily to buy acreage and drill wells but ran aground after oil-and-gas prices plummeted in 2014.Although the $263 million Mountain Capital-backed bailout EnerVest has been exploring would prevent investors from losing all their money, they would be left with just a sliver of the fund\u2019s assets.No deal has been completed yet, said people with knowledge of the matter.The struggles of the fund, EnerVest Energy Institutional Fund XII LP, illustrate how a prolonged slump in oil prices has hurt a small group of private-equity firms and the pensions, endowments and other institutions that invested with them. Although EnerVest has paid out about 65% of the money invested from this fund, the value of investors\u2019 positions in the remaining assets is close to being wiped out by debt, said people familiar with the matter.As part of the plan under consideration, Mountain Capital and other parties would launch a new oil-and-gas company to buy up the fund\u2019s assets, a chunk of which are located in Texas\u2019 Barnett Shale. The proposed deal would erase the fund\u2019s debt, according to a July 6 letter EnerVest sent to investors that was viewed by Dow Jones & Co.The original investors will be left with pennies on the dollar for their remaining interests, however, because the deal would slash their stakes in the fund\u2019s oil-and-gas holdings down to 3%, according to the investor letter.Still, that is a less costly outcome for investors than if the fund filed for bankruptcy: Their investments likely would be wiped out entirely under such a scenario, since bank lenders wouldn\u2019t recover all they are owed, the firm told investors.Under the proposed deal, lenders to the EnerVest fund would get back 70% of outstanding debt.             Wells Fargo & Co.                   was a crucial lender to the fund, according to investor documents and people close to the matter.The pension, endowment and other fund investors were asked to vote on the deal earlier this month and were invited to put money into the new company alongside Mountain Capital. There is no guarantee a deal will go through, and if enough investors or lenders reject the deal, it will fall apart.The EnerVest fund\u2019s difficulties are an illustration of how oil price swings are creating a moment of reckoning for energy investors that piled debt into assets that later went sour.The fund struggled to meet its debt requirements after a fall in energy prices caused the value of its underlying assets to decline. Because the debt was collateralized against a pool of assets, rather than individual businesses, risks of default weren\u2019t ringfenced\u2014meaning that if just a few bets went awry, the entire pool risked sinking into the red.The fund isn\u2019t the only EnerVest pool in trouble: Another $2 billion fund EnerVest raised in 2013 was written down to essentially nothing by investors.Mountain Capital\u2019s bid demonstrates how the distress that some energy investors experience has become fertile ground for new bets by others. The Houston firm, launched in 2015, has collected more than $600 million so far for its debut fund, said one of the people.Mr. Oh was involved in some of Apollo\u2019s most prominent energy investments, including EP Energy and Athlon Energy Inc. before he left the private-equity firm about three years ago.Write to Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-apollo-executives-firm-offers-to-buy-out-troubled-energy-fund-1500925094", "keywords": ["Wells Fargo &,WFC,EP Energy,Athlon Energy,bankruptcy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,management buyouts,political,general news,personal finance,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,support activities for oil,gas,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 16:42:00", "news_title": "Dollar Soft With Fed, U.S. Politics in Focus", "content": "The dollar wavered Monday as investors looked ahead to U.S. politics and the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting this week.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was essentially flat at 86.51.

The price rose to $1,259 a troy ounce earlier in the session, the highest level since late June.Write to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/copper-trades-higher-on-china-data-1500914006", "keywords": ["base metals,copper,gold,industrial metals,precious metals,Federal Reserve,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,metals markets,gold markets,commodity,financial market news,copper markets,non-ferrous metals markets,precious metals markets,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 16:04:00", "news_title": "A Look at the Health-Care Provisions Senators May Vote On ", "content": "Senate Republican leaders are pushing for a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d to debating their health-care legislation. But as of Monday, it remained unclear what that legislation would be. And if there is a debate, it\u2019s likely to include a flurry of amendments that could reshape the bill. Here are some of the elements senators could vote on, either as part of the underlying bill or as amendments.Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) and others favor a proposal to largely repeal the Affordable Care Act, with a two-year expiration date so lawmakers could craft a replacement. Some Republicans worry this would create chaos in the insurance markets and it\u2019s unlikely to pass, but Senate leaders could allow a vote on the measure to placate conservatives.Other conservatives support a provision by Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas) allowing insurers that sell plans complying with ACA rules\u2014like the requirement that certain services be covered\u2014to also sell plans that don\u2019t. They say this would drive down premiums by letting people buy cheaper plans. Critics say premiums would rise for older people or those with pre-existing conditions.The Senate bill would significantly cut Medicaid money to the states, and would phase out the enhanced ACA funding that let 31 states expand Medicaid. To appease senators whose states have large Medicaid populations, one proposed amendment would use funds from the ACA\u2019s taxes to help some people who lose Medicaid coverage.An early version of the bill repealed some but not all of the current health law\u2019s taxes. Taxes on generous employer plans and on prescription drugs would be repealed, but to pay for some of the bill\u2019s provisions, it would retain an investment income tax and a payroll tax. Given the chance, conservatives will likely offer amendments rescinding the rest of the ACA taxes.Debate is also likely to focus on the bill\u2019s relaxation of ACA regulations. One measure would let states opt out of many regulations, such as the rule that insurance plans must cover certain services. The bill would also end the requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have coverage. Other requirements would likely stay, for example one protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions.The Senate bill is likely to retain but change the ACA\u2019s strategy of providing tax credits to help lower-income people afford coverage. More people would be eligible for the credits based on income, but the size of the credits would be smaller. Amendments are likely to be offered on the nature and scope of the credits.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-look-at-the-health-care-provisions-senators-may-vote-on-1500926698", "keywords": ["affordable care act,health law,obamacare,senate vote,ted cruz,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,health care,life sciences"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 16:03:00", "news_title": "Trump Calls Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2018Beleaguered\u2019 ", "content": "President       Donald Trump       on Monday referred to Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       as \u201cbeleaguered,\u201d in one of a series of tweets in which he criticized the current probes of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.Mr. Trump expressed displeasure with his attorney general last week, telling the New York Times in an interview that he wouldn\u2019t have appointed Mr. Sessions to his job if he had known Mr. Sessions would remove himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Mr. Trump has alleged that the Russia probe is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d driven by Democrats to explain losing the White House in November.

Martin O\u2019Malley,        have visited the lot, which is about 13,500 square feet, and paid their respects.Now that a permanent building is set to be constructed there, preservationists hope the archaeological probe might finally answer their questions regarding the fate of the soldiers known as the \u201cMaryland 400.\u201dThey died in one of the bloodiest battles of the American Revolution. Though the battle was a win for the British, the Marylanders\u2019 sacrifice stopped them from reaching the main force of American troops that were retreating from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Gen.       George Washington,        watching the battle unfold from afar, reportedly said, \u201cGood God, what brave fellows I must this day lose.\u201dParts of the battle took place in what is now Prospect Park, and a monument to the soldiers, which includes Washington\u2019s quote, already exists there.Robert Furman,        president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council and an early proponent of the archaeological probe into the lot, said human remains have been found in the area before, which is why he is hopeful the investigation will find evidence of the mass grave\u2019s existence.Mr. Furman, who has researched the history of the Maryland 400 in Brooklyn for years, said if soldiers\u2019 remains are found, the city should build a memorial for them.\u201cThere would be a necessity by law and by obvious public demand to treat the remains respectfully,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about some of the first American soldiers to die in the war for independence.\u201dThis potential discovery, Mr. Furman said, also would mean \u201call bets are off\u201d on the planned prekindergarten. He expects results from the probe to be released in September. An Education Department spokesman said testing is ongoing and there is no set date for when the results will be released.Other historians, however, don\u2019t believe the investigation will find proof of a mass grave.       Kimberly Maier,        executive director of the Old Stone House and Washington Park in Brooklyn, said \u201cthere are a couple of issues\u201d with the theory that the grave exists. \u201cOne is that the area has been significantly disturbed over the years, there is a lot of landfill in the area, there was a road that ran right through the site,\u201d she said.Moreover, Ms. Maier said, at the time of the battle, it was likely the British would have buried the soldiers where they fell and not in a mass grave.At the Maryland State Archives, researchers are compiling historical records of the soldiers in a project called \u201cFinding the Maryland 400.\u201d Historian and project leader       Owen Lourie       also is skeptical of the existence of a mass grave. That is why their project, he said, looks to go beyond trying to find the soldier\u2019s\u2019 remains, and instead to develop biographies of them, so records of their lives remain.Back in Brooklyn, the       Michael A. Rawley, Jr.       American Legion Post #1636 sits next to the vacant lot. For the group of veterans, the land serves as reminder of the power of U.S. troops.The Legion memorializes the soldiers with a plaque, a sign and a flag placed at the front of its building. A large mural on the Legion\u2019s wall bordering the lot displays a group of American soldiers fighting British troops.The Legion\u2019s location is purely coincidental, said       John Lonergan III,        Legion commander and a U.S. Coast Guard veteran. Each year, however, the Legion commemorates the \u201cMaryland 400\u201d by reading their names aloud on the Aug. 27 anniversary of the battle.\u201cWe were hoping maybe Maryland, they could\u2019ve bought the property and we could\u2019ve put a memorial park here,\u201d Mr. Lonergan said. \u201cThat was the goal and our ideal, but it doesn\u2019t look like it is going to happen, and we accept that.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/archaeologists-hope-to-solve-mystery-of-maryland-400-with-brooklyn-dig-1500926506", "keywords": ["american history,american revolution,battle of brooklyn,battle of long island,brooklyn,george washington,maryland 400,new york history,prospect park,political,general news,history,sciences,humanities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 15:56:00", "news_title": "Greece Returns to International Bond Markets ", "content": "Greece said it would return to international bond markets for the first time in three years, seeking to swap a bond coming due in 2019 for a new one that will mature in 2022.The country on Monday offered holders of a 2019 bond with a 4.75% coupon the potential option to cash in their securities; it will complete the deal if it gets enough demand for replacement bonds. It hasn\u2019t determined the price and terms for the replacements.The deal is expected to close Tuesday.Greece isn\u2019t expected to raise extra debt in the deal; the stretching out of maturities is meant as a show of confidence\u2014and a way to deal with a big hump of debt repayments in 2019.The 2019 bond has just over \u20ac4 billion ($4.67 billion) outstanding, and bondholders who participate in the swap will have made a hefty return: Greece will pay \u20ac102.60 per \u20ac100 face value\u2014close to the market price on Friday.

The move aims to build on the positive momentum created since the government concluded the bailout negotiations with its international creditors, recent upgrades by credit-rating firms and a rally in Greek bonds in recent weeks.All told, Greece has about \u20ac34 billion in outstanding euro-denominated bonds in private hands\u2014a mere 10% of its total debt load.The government is hoping that the swap, along with a few more similar moves before the end of its bailout, could mark the beginning of the end of eight years of economic and social upheavalGreece\u2019s current bailout program ends in July 2018. After that, the country needs to be able to fund itself from the capital markets, or it would require another bailout to remain solvent. The European Union, including Germany, would like to bring to an end the bailouts that have caused great political friction for the currency bloc, according to EU officials.Greece tapped the markets in 2014 with five-year and a three-year bond issues in April and July 2014. The first transaction exceeded expectations and the issue was seven times oversubscribed, raising \u20ac3 billion at a yield of 4.95%, but the next sale just found enough buyers, raising \u20ac1.5 billion. Later in 2014, Greece also persuaded some Treasury-bill holders to exchange their bills for the bonds.Before its bailout era begun, Greece was last in the markets in April 2010, when it sold seven-year debt at a 6% yield. That issue was barely covered by investor demand, and within weeks Greece was forced to seek aid from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund. It has since then agreed to three bailout programs.Greece still has a giant volume of debt, though the lion\u2019s share of it is owed to its rescuers, doesn\u2019t come due for many years and sports a low interest rate.Corrections & Amplifications   A three-year bond issue in July 2014 raised \u20ac1.5 billion.

Yields rise when bond prices fall.Analysts attributed the modest decline in bond prices mostly to profit-taking and caution ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting and Friday\u2019s report on second-quarter U.S. economic growth.\u201cThe market has rallied pretty significantly over the past couple of weeks,\u201d said       Ian Lyngen,        head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see a bit of consolidation here.\u201dBefore bond yields started to fall two weeks ago, they had been rising sharply, with the yield on the 10-year note nearly reaching 2.4% after falling below 2.2% in June.Investors and analysts say the recent rally has been driven in part by a shift in tone from Fed officials, who have suggested that tepid inflation could cause the central bank to raise interest rates more slowly than previously anticipated. European Central Bank officials have also tamped down speculation about an imminent shift toward less monetary stimulus.One factor that could depress bond prices this week is a trio of Treasury note auctions, starting with a $26 billion sale of two-year notes Tuesday, continuing with a $34 billion sale of five-year notes Wednesday, and ending with a $28 billion sale of seven-year notes Thursday. New debt sales sometimes weigh on the prices of outstanding bonds.While the Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates Wednesday, it could still move the market through signals contained in its policy statement, analysts said. The central bank, for example, could provide more detail about when it will start reducing its balance sheet, which includes more than $2 trillion of Treasury debt.Fed officials have said the process will begin this year, and many investors anticipate a start in the late summer or early fall, before the Fed raises rates again.A reduction in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet could lead to lower prices on outstanding government debt, as the central bank allows some of its bondholdings to mature without replacing them with new bonds.Fewer bond purchases by the Fed means more Treasury debt sold to the public. Still, many investors believe that the pullback by the Fed will take place slowly enough that it will have little effect on the market. Its impact on longer-term bond yields could also be mitigated if the Treasury Department responds mostly by selling more short-term debt, analysts say.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-edge-lower-after-recent-rally-1500907582", "keywords": ["bond yields,interest rates,monetary policy,treasury auctions,treasurys,treasury yields,u.s. bonds,Federal Reserve,economic news,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,commentaries,opinions,routine market,financial news,treasury bond prices,commentary"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 15:33:00", "news_title": "Washington, Berlin and the Problem With Russia\u2019s New Pipeline", "content": "Amid allegations that Washington is using the cover of sanctions to advance its own commercial interests, Germany has been furiously lobbying against a Russian sanctions bill that passed the U.S. Senate and goes to vote in the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday.In a recent joint statement, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister       Sigmar Gabriel       and Austria\u2019s Chancellor       Christian Kern       blasted the Senate version of the bill as aimed at \u201cselling American liquid natural gas and ending the supply of Russian natural gas to the European market.\u201d This position confuses U.S. national and commercial interests, and fails to recognize how European gas markets work.The focus of German concern is the prospect of sanctions targeting the construction of new Russian export pipelines, and in particular the Nord Stream 2, which would give Russia\u2019s Gazprom the capacity to bring 55 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia to Germany through two 1,200 kilometer pipelines beneath the Baltic Sea.Together with the existing Nord Stream 1, total export capacity traveling the Nord Stream Baltic Sea route would be doubled as a result.But Nord Stream 2 isn\u2019t meant to increase Russia\u2019s export capacity. Gazprom has substantial existing capacity via the Yamal pipeline going through Belarus and Poland and the Brotherhood pipeline through Slovakia and Ukraine. Nord Stream 2, just like Nord Stream 1, is intended to be a diversionary pipeline.If U.S. sanctions are addressed specifically to Nord Stream 2, they won\u2019t have any material impact on the flow of Russian natural gas to Europe. And while it\u2019s true the sanctions against Russian export pipelines as drawn in the U.S. bill have been drawn broadly, they have also been drafted in the form of a grant of discretionary powers to the U.S. president. In reality, any executive order giving effect to the sanction powers would have to be narrowly drawn to focus on Nord Stream 2.In its lobbying on Capitol Hill, Berlin has significantly played down the damage that Nord Stream 2 would inflict on the security of Central and Eastern Europe. This is because having most of Russia\u2019s gas exports to the EU come through its market would lower natural-gas prices in Germany and make it an energy hub for the rest of Europe. It would also help the German and Austrian corporate partners of Nord Stream 2, including OMV, Uniper and             BASF                  -Wintershall, ensure their continued access to upstream Russian energy assets. All of which sets the stage for greater Russian-German cooperation in the future.Concentrating supply along the two Nord Stream routes reduces supply diversity and makes it easier to cut off those states that no longer provide transit services along the Yamal and Brotherhood routes. It also increases Gazprom\u2019s market dominance, and further reduces supply alternatives, for Central and Eastern Europe. This significant loss of supply security will further weaken and isolate the states in these regions, all NATO members and partners of the U.S.The development of Nord Stream 2 also raises two important security concerns for the U.S. that Messrs. Gabriel and Kern overlook.First, the U.S. has a clear foreign-policy interest here: the survival of Ukraine as an independent, sovereign state. Nord Stream 2, a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned Gazprom, would remove Kiev as a transit route. This would strip Ukraine of $2 billion in transit fees, reduce its importance to the rest of Europe and restore Russian gas leverage across the Continent.Second, with the completion of Nord Stream 2, the two Nord Stream pipelines would together supply 25% of total European Union gas consumption and make up 70% of the EU\u2019s gas imports. Russia is in effect proposing, with Germany\u2019s support, to place 70% of the EU\u2019s non-European gas imports in a 2-kilometer channel in one of the world\u2019s shallowest seas. This would create a choke point in the Baltic Sea analogous to the Middle East\u2019s Strait of Hormuz.Aside from the prospect of a shipping or munitions accident\u2014the pipelines run through two World War II munitions dumps\u2014there is a clear security threat in putting so much energy resource in one vulnerable spot. It would be an open invitation to terrorists to undertake a spectacular act of energy sabotage.Assuming that Messrs.

Concerned that their party has lost support among middle-class workers, top Democrats have chosen a location heavy with symbolism. According to the Associated Press:Specifically, this is Virginia\u2019s 10th congressional district. Underlining the commitment of Democratic leaders to show Middle America that the party elite is not out of touch with the concerns of average voters, the suburban district lies almost entirely outside the Washington Beltway.\u201cToo many Americans are struggling with a rigged economy,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote on Twitter this morning. But she probably hasn't met too many of them at today\u2019s event. If an economist had to pick the one place in America that has benefitted most from a rigged economy, it would probably be Virginia\u2019s 10th congressional district. It includes both a significant number of government employees and a heavy concentration of the lobbyists who are paid to influence them.According to the Almanac of American Politics, the median income of more than $110,000 in Virginia\u2019s 10th district is the highest in the nation. Including McLean\u2019s leafy suburbs and the horse farms further west, this district is among the most popular places to spend money earned in the swamp. By tradition it skews Republican because Democrats tend to favor more close-in suburbs or living in Washington itself, but Ms. Pelosi probably figures that whatever their party affiliation, many voters of the 10th see an upside to bigger government.This is perhaps instructive as voters in other parts of the country contemplate whether there is anything new in the latest effort to rebrand a party that has for years been at war with the private economy. The Democrats have chosen to take their case today to a community that has witnessed explosive growth in recent decades along with that of the federal budget, regardless of how most of blue-collar America was doing.One could argue that Virginia\u2019s 10th is a place where people work with their hands, whether it be signing for expense-account lunches, dialing the number of a favorite congressional aide, or typing out political talking points. To be fair, the area does have a large local technology industry, though much of that too is driven by federal contracting.Along with some new advertising slogans, Democrats today are once again emphasizing themes of tougher business regulation that have been staples of their party\u2019s message for decades, though perhaps now with a more populist edge. Unveiling the new communications strategy in the             New York Times                   today, Sen. Schumer writes:Mr. Schumer intended that description to apply to his opponents. But he\u2019s likely finding that his party\u2019s continuing emphasis on government intervention in the economy sings to today\u2019s audience of special interest rule-writers.But will the Democrats\u2019 new messaging play in the rest of the country, for example in the 10 Trump states from 2016 where Democratic senators are seeking re-election in 2018? According to the A.P., \u201cParty strategists say that for most Senate candidates, in particular, a national party message has little value, and instead each candidate must fight on their own terms and issues.\u201d It seems that the new rebranding campaign may be useful, except in many of the places where Democrats need to win.***Speaking of Sen.

Chris Froome is a tremendous bike racer\u2014and now, with four Tour titles, he\u2019s one for the ages. During his run with Team Sky, he\u2019s shown not only a technical mastery of Grand Tour racing\u2014he really doesn\u2019t have a weakness, from climbing to descending to the time trial\u2014but also a talent for making savvy moves when the race goes sideways. He might not be one of the most stylistic riders ever, but I\u2019m not one of those \u201cFROOME IS A ROBOT\u201d haters. Froome ran up a mountain last year. Find me a robot who does that. Froome\u2019s one of the best ever. Chapeau.2. This wasn\u2019t a boring Tour de France. Crazy stuff happened. Cycling\u2019s mancrush Peter Sagan got booted out of the race entirely after a contentious crash in a sprint. Americans Taylor Phinney and Nate Brown took early turns in the \u201cKing of the Mountains\u201d polka-dot jersey. Froome got dropped in the closing meters of a climb in the Pyrenees. Germany\u2019s Marcel Kittel took five sprint stage wins, and French rider Romain Bardet finished third overall. Most impressively, the Journal\u2019s lanky Joshua Robinson polished off 6,000 calories in one day for a story about Tour rider diets. Check out the video; Josh should get a James Beard Award and a Master cleanse.3. We also got The Aero Nun, my favorite cycling moment of the decade:But\u2026I can\u2019t escape the nagging feeling that something is out of whack in cycling\u2019s signature event. Though Froome\u2019s win was the narrowest in years, it really looks as if Froome\u2019s team, Sky, has cracked the code of Grand Tour racing, and unless steps are taken to level the playing field somehow\u2014steps that are taken in many other sports we all love, let\u2019s not forget\u2014we\u2019re going to be looking at an even longer stretch of dominance, if not by Froome, then by Froome 2.0.If you like long displays of dominance, great. I like it when a bike race goes haywire. I want a fork fight on the mountain.Money is the driver here, of course. Froome\u2019s Sky is one of the richest teams in cycling, with a budget that\u2019s as much as four to five times as big as lower-level Tour outfits, and a lot of that spending goes into talent. During his titles, Froome\u2019s been surrounded by well-paid helpers who would be the No. 1 Dude on other squads. (Froome himself was once a lieutenant to Sky\u2019s first Tour winner, Bradley Wiggins.) This year Froome lost a top teammate (Geraint Thomas) to a crash and barely missed a beat\u2014Sky continued to take a boxer\u2019s entourage into the final climbs. Froome has a world champ (Michal Kwiatkowski) playing back-up guitar, and his top associate, Mikel Landa, missed third place by just one second. It\u2019s insane. Sky\u2019s roster makes the Kevin Durant-Steph Curry Warriors look like a schlubby pick-up team at the Y.Yes: big money doesn\u2019t assure victory. There are fat spenders who had letdown Tours, like Katusha, Astana and BMC (though BMC lost its leader, former Froome/Sky helper Richie Porte, to a crash.) You can have all the money, but if you\u2019re dingbats, it\u2019s meaningless. Sky\u2019s smart and focused. They arrive at the Tour utterly locked on one goal\u2014they\u2019re there to win the yellow jersey, and not mess around with sprints or even stage wins. It\u2019s a ruthless approach, and Sky\u2019s gotten a bit cranky (with its performance under the microscope, they\u2019ve become unnecessarily snippy with the media) but it\u2019s hard to argue with the final result.Or is it? One of the most thrilling developments during this year\u2019s tour was the emergence of Rigoberto Uran, a former Sky rider (they\u2019re everywhere!) now with the American team Cannondale-Drapac. Uran\u2019s a past Giro d\u2019Italia runner-up, but Cannondale is a modestly-budgeted operation, and Uran couldn\u2019t rely on a fancy-pants all-star escort up the final climb. He still managed to come within a minute of a brilliant upset.And yet it felt a little inevitable. Froome and Sky were just too deep, too good\u2014and the one of the closest Tours was a little less close than it appears. It makes one wonder what cycling\u2014a sponsor-driven sport which is basically an advertising buy\u2014would look with some kind of salary cap or spending structure in which money could be more equally distributed. What would it have looked like if Froome, Uran and Bardet spent longer stretches isolated and alone? What if more players could join in the party? Would the Tour be less predictable? Maybe. More exciting? Definitely.Again, none of this is to diminish Froome, who\u2019s got zero to prove. But I think The Tour would benefit from spicing up: financial fairness, inventive stages, maybe smaller teams. For an event that literally began as a publicity stunt (for a newspaper, no less), the Tour in 2017 is quite traditional, even fuddy-duddy. (Like when it sent Sagan, the sport\u2019s pop star, packing in a weird decision.) Re-examining the old way of doing things isn\u2019t an insult\u2014it\u2019s smart, modern, forward-thinking strategy. You know who\u2019d agree?

GOOGL -0.38%       is scheduled to announce second-quarter earnings after the market closes\u00a0Monday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:EARNINGS FORECAST: Alphabet is expected to report per-share earnings excluding certain items of $10.24, according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with $8.42 on that basis a year earlier. On a GAAP basis, analysts expect per-share earnings of $4.44, compared with $7 a year prior.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect revenue of $20.91 billion excluding payments to advertising partners, compared with $17.53 billion on the same basis in the year-earlier period.WHAT TO WATCH:AD REVENUE: Around the end of the first quarter, a series of major brands pulled their nonsearch advertising spending from Google after their ads appeared alongside racist or hateful YouTube videos. The financial impact of the boycott could be clear with\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a0results.Analysts expect the\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0growth rate\u00a0of advertising revenue\u00a0to have slowed to 16.5% in the second quarter, from 18.8% in the first quarter, yielding revenue of roughly $22.3\u00a0billion.\u00a0Still, analysts have played down the controversy\u2019s impact on Google\u2019s massive ad business.\u00a0Investors will be watching the ad-revenue figure to see how big of a dent the advertiser boycott left. And with some advertisers still not spending on YouTube ads, a lower ad-revenue number than expected could signal\u00a0more hurt in the second half of the year.AD CLICKS: Google\u2019s core business is about getting users to click on ads. Recent quarters suggest the company is still getting better at it, even after 19 years in business. In the past two quarters, Google said clicks on its ads rose 36% and 44% respectively over a year earlier, the highest rates in years. That growth is fueled by consumers\u2019 increasing shift to smartphones, which enable users to search the internet more often than traditional computers. Users are also more likely to tap on search ads on phones\u2019 smaller screens. Google has also added more ads to its search results. The downside of that greater ad supply, however, has been declining prices for clicks. The cost per click advertisers paid Google fell by 15% and 19%, respectively, the past two quarters, the biggest declines in years.OTHER REVENUES: Despite its push into health care, energy and autos, Alphabet is still primarily an advertising company. Ad sales accounted for 88% of the company\u2019s $90.27 billion in revenue last year. But there is one business the company believes could eventually eclipse its ad sales: the cloud. Google is making a major push to sell its massive computing infrastructure to other companies, storing their data and running their systems on its remote computers housed in\u00a0data centers across the world. While the Google Cloud unit faces stiff competition from\u00a0its two bigger rivals,\u00a0            Amazon.com Inc.       and             Microsoft\u00a0Corp.      ,\u00a0it is making progress. Google reports its cloud sales in its \u201cother revenues\u201d segment, which also includes hardware and app sales. The segment has been Alphabet\u2019s fastest-growing in recent quarters, posting a 49% increase in sales to $3.1 billion in the first quarter. Analysts expect that rate to slow slightly in the second quarter, forecasting a 43.7% increase to about $3.12 billion.Write to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-earnings-what-to-watch-1500890400", "keywords": [" ad revenue,earnings preview, what to watch, youtube ad boycott,Alphabet Inc.

It also calls for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and more regulation of Wall Street.Sen.

Security officials said the country\u2019s spy agency doesn\u2019t use minibuses to shuttle employees to work.Monday\u2019s attack comes at a time of escalating violence in Afghanistan, as the Taliban have launched simultaneous assaults across the country, including in the provinces of Faryab, Ghazni, Ghor, Helmand, Herat and Paktia, a spokesman said.The Afghan government has ceded swaths of territory to the Taliban since most foreign troops withdrew in 2014, leaving fledging local forces to fight with only limited U.S. military assistance.The Afghan defense ministry on Monday said the situation was under control despite the increased pressure on its troops.\u201cThis is war. If a check post collapses, that does not mean the whole country is collapsed. We have a system and we have a government,\u201d spokesman Dawlat Waziri said.In recent months, the U.S. military has sought to prevent further territorial losses by dramatically increasing airstrikes in support of Afghan troops, as the Trump administration continues to debate a new strategy for the 16-year war.Over the past week, at least two U.S. airstrikes have struck the wrong target, adding to public frustration with the intensifying violence.On Sunday, a U.S. airstrike killed least eight civilians attending a gathering after a funeral in eastern Nangarhar province, local residents said.In a separate incident on Friday, a U.S. airstrike in Helmand province accidentally killed at least 16 Afghan police officers.In a sign violence is worsening, a United Nations report last week showed a surge in civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2017.The U.N. recorded a rising number of casualties in Kabul, where the Taliban and a local branch of Islamic State have sought to carry out high-profile attacks to undermine a weak unity government that has been hobbled by internal rivalries and corruption.On May 31, a massive truck bomb killed more than 150 people at the entrance to Kabul\u2019s diplomatic enclave, in the worst attack in the city since 2001.\u2014Habib Khan Totakhil  contributed to this article.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/suicide-bombing-kills-at-least-24-in-kabul-1500876110", "keywords": ["afghanistan,kabul,suicide bomber,suicide bombing,terrorism,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,military action"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 14:45:00", "news_title": "Adrian Beltre Just Keeps Getting Better With Age", "content": "Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre is likely to join one of baseball\u2019s most exclusive clubs in the next week or two. After going 4 for 4 on Monday, he needs just seven hits to reach 3,000 in his career, a milestone that should cement his eventual induction into the Hall of Fame.At this point, nobody can deny Beltre\u2019s all-time greatness. For 20 major-league seasons, he has quietly combined prodigious power\u2014he went into Monday with 453 lifetime home runs\u2014and elite-level defense, winning five Gold Gloves.But despite all of that, Beltre\u2019s achievements often still go unnoticed, with his candidacy for Cooperstown only emerging in recent years. Even after a decade in the major leagues, the idea seemed laughable, and it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Beltre was considered something of a bust. Now, with all due respect to Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson and so many others, Beltre very well could go down as the best third baseman in history by the time he retires.A heralded prospect when he came up as a 19-year-old with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998, Beltre initially struggled to live up to the hype. Even with a 48-homer, 121-RBI breakout in 2004, Beltre only had a .779 on-base-plus-slugging percentage in his first 12 seasons, barely better than the league average.When Beltre signed with the Boston Red Sox in 2010 for his age-31 season, everything changed. He hit .321 with 28 homers and 49 doubles that year, taking full advantage of the Green Monster at Fenway Park. That performance earned him a five-year, $80 million contract with the Rangers in 2011, and he has been nothing short of brilliant ever since.It has added up to Beltre posting numbers virtually unseen at his position.In terms of hits, Kansas City Royals legend George Brett is the all-time leader for third basemen at 3,154, a figure Beltre could pass by the end of next season. Catching Schmidt\u2019s 548 homers might be difficult, but he certainly should top Chipper Jones\u2019s 468 and could challenge Eddie Mathews\u2019s 512. Meanwhile, Beltre entered Monday with 1,602 RBI, just 21 behind Jones for the most ever for a player whose primary position was third base.And he\u2019s not stopping yet. The 38-year-old Beltre is signed for another $18 million for 2018, when he will continue his assault on the record books.

Together with the domestic arm, formed in 2010, the foundation entities now own more than 50% of HNA Group.Other large stakeholders include HNA founders and chairmen of the board       Chen Feng       and       Wang Jian,        who each own nearly 15%.       Adam Tan,        HNA Group\u2019s chief executive and vice chairman, who is seen as the man behind HNA\u2019s sprawling investments, holds almost 3%. HNA says it plans to update its ownership disclosures annually.The changes in shareholding, which took place this year, put the ownership of HNA Group entirely in the hands of HNA-related entities and individuals, and eliminate stakes that had been held by private investors outside the group, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s strategy.They also move the ownership of nearly a third of the company outside of China. And they shed more light on HNA as the group\u2014as well as other Chinese conglomerates that have aggressively invested overseas\u2014faces scrutiny by regulators at home and abroad about its large acquisitions and the way they were financed.\u201cIt is only natural that as we touch many more stakeholders, there is a great deal of interest in who we are and how we are structured,\u201d HNA said in the document.The company decided to disclose the new structure after accumulating large stakes in companies such as             Deutsche Bank AG       and             Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.,       according to the person familiar with the company\u2019s strategy.The changes nearly double the holdings by the arms of HNA\u2019s charitable foundation\u2014Hainan Province Cihang Foundation and Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation\u2014which disclose little about how they are operated, who controls them and what they do. HNA initially established the domestic foundation with a $3 million donation, which it focused on disaster relief, medical care and education, according to a 2015 Harvard Business School-funded case study. In 2013, HNA donated 22% of its shares to the foundation.In the U.S. and Europe, bodies that approve foreign investment are becoming wary of Chinese investors, probing their ties to government as well as the motives for their purchases. In China, the government is investigating the debt levels of several big closely held conglomerates that have invested heavily overseas, including HNA, property company Dalian Wanda Group and Anbang Insurance Group.The Chinese government has banned state-owned banks from making new loans to Wanda, which has announced plans to unload the bulk of its domestic hotels and theme parks. HNA, which announced $5.68 billion of overseas investments this year following $20 billion last year, has told some people involved in its deals to put a hold on them for now, people familiar with the matter say.Meanwhile, HNA has been bedeviled by questions of who owns the company and how that ownership is structured, along with concerns over how funds move within the group\u2019s labyrinthine structure. HNA\u2019s acquisitions have used a host of entities to take stakes and acquire companies abroad. Filings with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, for instance, show Hainan Cihang Charitable Foundation as one of the parties involved in the acquisition of a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide, for which HNA paid $6.5 billion last year.It is unclear whether the group\u2019s latest shareholding changes will affect such transactions.Uncertainty about HNA\u2019s ownership has led some U.S. investment banks to avoid doing business with it.             Citigroup Inc.       isn\u2019t allowed to advise it on deals, while             Morgan Stanley                   has provided financing for one of HNA\u2019s subsidiaries but doesn\u2019t work with the company, according to people familiar with the matter. HNA recently asked             Bank of America Corp.       whether the U.S. bank plans to continue working with it, according to a letter viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\u201cBoth directly and through its subsidiaries, HNA Group partners actively with many global investment banks and continues to do so,\u201d HNA said in a statement.HNA\u2019s ownership structure has continuously evolved in recent years, regulatory filings show.Recent corporate filings from HNA Group subsidiaries and affiliates show it had been owned by eight companies and organizations stacked in several layers, with the Hainan Province Cihang Foundation and an entity called Tang Dynasty Development Co. Ltd. near the top.A Beijing resident named Jun Guan had a stake of about 12% of HNA Group, according to a filing from 2016, while       Bharat Bhise,        CEO of Hong Kong-based private-equity and investment advisory firm Bravia Capital, held roughly 17%.Bravia Capital has invested alongside HNA in several transactions, and more recently it has acted as a financial adviser to HNA on some of its acquisitions, including its $6 billion purchase of technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc. last year. Mr. Bhise has subsequently held a seat on the board of Ingram Micro, according to a filing in December last year.In the new ownership structure, Jun Guan and Bharat Bhise no longer have their combined stake of roughly 29%. Instead, Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation has a stake of that size. Representatives for Bravia Capital couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.HNA says it expects the Cihang Foundation to eventually own 100% of the group, because its shareholders have \u201chave pledged to donate all of their shares to the Foundation upon resignation or death.\u201dWrite to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com and Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'HNA Details New Owner Structure.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hna-group-details-new-ownership-structure-1500908529", "keywords": ["china,cihang foundation,hna,hna group,ownership,shareholders,stakes,Anbang Insurance Group,Citigroup,C,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,Morgan Stanley,MS,Hilton Worldwide Holdings,HLT,Ingram Micro,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,Deutsche Bank,DBK.XE,DB,Tang Dynasty Development,Cihang Foundation,HNA Group,Bravia Capital Partners,Bharat Bhise, Wang Jian,Adam Tan, Chen Feng,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,charities,philanthropy,society,community,airlines,diversified holding companies,air transport,business,consumer services,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 14:27:00", "news_title": "U.K. Opens Corruption Probe of Rio Tinto Activities in Guinea ", "content": "LONDON\u2014The U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office said Monday it opened an investigation into suspected corrupt activities by mining giant Rio Tinto PLC in Guinea.Rio Tinto said in November it had notified authorities in the U.K., U.S. and Australia about its concerns over a $10.5 million payment the company made to a consultant with close ties to Guinean President Alpha Conde while trying to maintain mining rights there in 2011.The SFO -- Britain\u2019s main law-enforcement agency for white-collar crime -- didn\u2019t say what investigators were looking into. A call seeking comment wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\u201cRio Tinto will fully cooperate with the Serious Fraud Office and any other relevant authorities, as it has done since it self-reported in November 2016,\u201d a Rio spokesman said.The investigation comes during a long-running scandal surrounding the iron-ore deposits in the West African nation\u2019s Simandou range, considered one of the mining world\u2019s most coveted prizes.In November, Rio Tinto said it fired one of its top executives,       Alan Davies,        after a $10.5 million payment related to Simandou came to light. The British-Australian company also fired legal and regulatory affairs group       executive Debra Valentine.Internal Rio Tinto emails from 2011, seen by The Wall Street Journal, showed that Mr. Davies sought and received high-level company approval to make the payment to       Fran\u00e7ois de Combret,        a former Lazard Fr\u00e8res managing director who was close to Mr. Cond\u00e9. At the time, the company was negotiating to retain the rights to mine parts of Simandou.Mr. Davies wrote that Mr. de Combret had provided significant help in obtaining rights to mine two large pieces of the Simandou concession from the Guinea government and noted his \u201ccloseness\u201d to Mr. Cond\u00e9.Mr. Davies in November said in a statement that there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for his termination and he had been given \u201cno opportunity to answer any allegations.\u201d Earlier this year, Mr. Davies was named chief executive of U.K. mining outfit Moxico Resources PLC.Mr. Davies didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Valentine and Mr. de Combret couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Rio did secure the rights to Simandou after making a $700 million payment to the Guinea government.Despite the huge payment, Rio never developed Simandou as the price of iron ore declined following cooling demand in China.Last year, Rio sold its remaining stake in Simandou to             Aluminum Corp. of China                   for about $1.3 billion.Write to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-opens-corruption-probe-of-rio-tinto-activities-in-guinea-1500920844", "keywords": ["bribery,guinean president alpha conde,investigation,iron ore,mining,payments,rio tinto,serious fraud office,sfo,simandou range,Rio Tinto,RIO,U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office,corporate crime,legal action,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,fraud,metal ore mining,basic materials,resources,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 14:07:00", "news_title": "McDonald\u2019s Earnings: What to Watch", "content": "McDonald\u2019s Corp.

The company is expected to report revenue of $5.96 billion, compared with $6.26 billion a year earlier.WHAT TO WATCH:UPGRADES: McDonald\u2019s recently scored a coup when a majority of its franchisees approved a multiyear growth plan that entails upgrading restaurants with self-order kiosks, new dessert counters and other elements. McDonald\u2019s said it would put up 55% of the cost of the upgrades\u2014which can range anywhere from $150,000 to $700,000 per restaurant\u2014if franchisees agreed to fund an advertising campaign for a national value menu. Investors will be eager to learn more about the timing and scope of the improvements.OWNERSHIP: McDonald\u2019s has said it plans to encourage underperforming franchisees to sell their restaurants to better-performing operators, resulting in fewer, better franchisees.

An experimental treatment, known as nucleoside therapy, has been used to treat patients with similar but less severe diseases than Charlie\u2019s and hasn\u2019t been tested on mice or humans with his illness.A U.S. doctor, Michio Hirano of Columbia University Medical Center, had proposed the treatment could have a 10% chance of improving Charlie\u2019s muscle function, but after meeting the child last week and seeing new scans of his muscles, came to the conclusion they were too far gone.Grant Armstrong, an attorney for Ms. Yates and Ms. Gard, said the case had reached a point akin to a \u201cGreek tragedy.\u201d\u201cJust as the parents were on the verge of satisfying the court\u201d that the new treatment was in Charlie\u2019s best interests \u201cthey must withdraw their application,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.Ms. Yates said she and Charlie\u2019s father believe he isn\u2019t brain dead and that if he had started the new therapy months ago he would have had a better chance.\u201cA whole lot of time has been wasted,\u201d Ms. Yates said. \u201cCharlie did have a real chance of getting better if it was started sooner.\u201dGreat Ormond Street Hospital, where the boy has been in intensive care since October, has said he was likely in pain and his brain damage was irreversible. It says it investigated using nucleoside treatment but decided it wouldn\u2019t work after he suffered a series of seizures.In a statement, the hospital said the \u201cagony, desolation and bravery of [Charlie\u2019s parents\u2019] decision command [its] utmost respect and humble all who work there.\u201dThe child\u2019s parents will now go through mediation with the hospital to decide how to proceed with end-of-life care for Charlie, the judge said.The decision brings to a close an increasingly bitter battle in successive courts between the hospital and Charlie\u2019s parents. Courts in the U.K. have the final say when parents and doctors disagree over the treatment a child should receive.The European Court of Human Rights declined to intervene in the case in June after the U.K. Supreme Court upheld Judge\u2019s Francis\u2019s ruling against Charlie\u2019s parents. The hospital asked the High Court to re-examine the case after Dr. Hirano suggested there was new evidence on treatment.Charlie\u2019s doctors and nurses have come under intense public pressure, including death threats, the hospital said in a statement Saturday. Mr. Gard and Ms. Yates said through a spokesman that they didn\u2019t condone such threats toward medical staff or anyone connected with their son.Ms. Yates said she and Mr. Gard were \u201cnow going to spend our last precious moments with our son Charlie, who unfortunately won\u2019t make his first birthday in just under two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cMummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn\u2019t save you,\u201d she said.Write to Joanna Sugden at joanna.sugden@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Pair Halt Fight Over Son\u2019s Treatment.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-gards-parents-abandon-fight-to-take-ill-child-to-u-s-1500905427", "keywords": ["brain dead,charlie gard,donald trump,end of life care,gosh,gosh hospital,great ormond street hospital,ill baby,parents,pope francis,treatment in u.s.,uk baby,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 13:25:00", "news_title": "Investor Makes Mammoth VIX Bet That Could Pay Out $265 Million", "content": "One investor has bet on a powerful resurgence in market turbulence\u2014a wager that could net a profit of about $265 million if Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge more than doubles in the next three months.An unknown investor made a massive trade via the options market Friday, as the             CBOE                   Volatility Index, the so-called fear gauge that tracks investor expectations for equity volatility, fell to its lowest since December 1993.About 1 million options contracts changed hands on a bet that the CBOE volatility gauge, called VIX, will rise to 25 by October. That\u2019s a level the VIX hasn\u2019t reached since June 2016, when the U.K. surprised global markets by voting to exit from the European Union.If he or she is correct, Friday\u2019s investor could see a payout of about $265 million, according to       Stefan Wintner,        vice president who covers volatility strategies at the commodity trading adviser Dunn Capital Management, which is based in Florida.In the three-legged trade, the investor bought about 260,000 calls, or bullish options, that expire in October with a strike price of 15, according to Trade Alert. The strike is the level at which the contracts can be exercised.The investor also sold roughly the same number of October puts, or bearish contracts, with a strike of 12. On top of those two trades, the investor sold more than 500,000 calls expiring in October with a strike of 25.He or she collected about $5 million on the contracts that were sold, according to a Trade Alert note. The calls with a strike price of 15 were bought at $1.45 each. The investor collected premiums on the puts and calls that were sold for 75 cents and 45 cents, respectively.Should the prolonged calm that has dominated markets continue\u2014and the VIX stay at its recent lows\u2014the investor could get burned and lose about $60 million, according to Mr. Wintner, since he or she is essentially short the puts that were sold. The investor could also lose money if the VIX climbs far above 25, he said, because of the 500,000 calls that were sold.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything bigger,\u201d said Mark Caffray, a managing director at PTR Inc., a floor broker at the Chicago Board Options Exchange specializing in the VIX and S&P 500. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty aggressive, and very bullish on VIX.\u201dHe added that the bet was particularly remarkable given where the VIX has been trading. The index has been below 10 for its longest stretch ever.\u201cI\u2019m just shocked that a trade like that came up,\u201d Mr. Caffray said.The VIX is a measure of expectations for market swings over the next 30 days and is based on options prices on the S&P 500 index. It tends to rise along with investor anxiety, as stocks fall.October has historically been a more turbulent month for the stock market. The investor may expect volatility to pick up after the summer, an outlook shared by others in the market, according to       Pravit Chintawongvanich,        head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors.Because the VIX tends to rise when the S&P 500 declines, some investors use it to protect against declines in the stock market. In the last year, the trader dubbed \u201c50 Cent\u201d by market watchers has been periodically scooping up bullish options on the VIX, paying a price of about 50 cents for each contract. It doesn\u2019t appear that trader is at work in this instance, said Mr. Chintawongvanich.Mr. Chintawongvanich said in a note Monday, \u201cIt could be a highly rewarding trade, but highly risky.\u201dWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Investor Shows No Fear, Bets Big on VIX.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-makes-mammoth-vix-bet-that-could-pay-out-265-million-1500917145", "keywords": [" cboe vix, fear guage, fear index, october vix, vix bet, vix calls,vix index, vix options, vix puts, volatility index,Pravit Chintawongvanich,Stefan Wintner,Mark Caffray,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,equity derivatives"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 13:13:00", "news_title": "\u2018With You in Mind: The Songs of Allen Toussaint\u2019 by Stanton Moore Review: Homage to a New Orleans Great", "content": "In 2015, Allen Toussaint died unexpectedly at age 77. As a composer, arranger, producer, pianist and singer, his career reached far and wide. The hits he crafted for a broad range of stars spanned genres and generations, earning him a National Medal of the Arts and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame. Yet Mr. Toussaint\u2019s music spoke most clearly of and to New Orleans, where styles freely mix, and where he was born in 1938 and remained, save for temporary relocation to New York after the flood that resulted from the levee breaches following Hurricane Katrina.When news of Mr. Toussaint\u2019s death arrived, drummer Stanton Moore was scheduled for a recording session of original songs. He and his trio mates, pianist       David Torkanowsky       and bassist       James Singleton      \u2014all three standouts of the New Orleans scene with direct connections to Mr. Toussaint\u2014scrapped their plan. They dove into Mr. Toussaint\u2019s rich catalog.Mr. Toussaint was known for writing out precise arrangements. On \u201cWith You in Mind: The Songs of Allen Toussaint\u201d (Cool Green Recordings/Mascot Label Group), the musicians were \u201cflying by the seats of our pants,\u201d Mr. Moore told me. Nevertheless, none of these 10 tracks sound tossed-off. Rather, the album is a thoughtful homage reflecting a careful blend of reverence and imagination. In spirit and sound, it achieves one especially challenging goal: Mr. Toussaint\u2019s signature balance of erudition and grit. And it explores the fine gradations of possibility, in both rhythm and feel, implied by Mr. Toussaint\u2019s song title, \u201cEverything I Do Gonh Be Funky (From Now On).\u201d That song gets covered here, sung with persuasive conviction by       Cyril Neville      ; his declaration of funkiness arrives with fresh emphasis because it lands without a hiccup, even though the song\u2019s 4/4 boogaloo is tethered here to a five-beat rhythm.Mr. Neville, who sings on several tracks, is among an extended cast of musicians, nearly all drawn from New Orleans\u2019s ranks, most notably alto saxophonist       Donald Harrison Jr.       and trumpeter       Nicholas Payton.       Mr. Toussaint provided material for many a singer\u2019s glory, yet his compositions make for equally powerful instrumental statements. \u201cJava\u201d reached No. 4 on Billboard\u2019s pop chart in 1963 as recorded by trumpeter       Al Hirt.       Here, Mr. Moore\u2019s band hews closer to the loose-limbed rhythm of Mr. Toussaint\u2019s version (from his 1958 solo debut), giving rise to richly textured collective improvisation from Messrs. Harrison and Payton along with Trombone Shorty. On \u201cRiverboat,\u201d originally sung by       Lee Dorsey       in 1970 and performed here as an instrumental, Messrs. Harrison and Payton exchange solo passages that extend the song\u2019s harmonies and deepen its sense of longing.Throughout, Mr. Moore\u2019s trio plays with appropriate effervescence or restraint. The group emboldens Mr. Toussaint\u2019s grooves less through force than with finely wrought details. As did Mr. Toussaint, it uses subtle cues to bring out the best in others. A stately swing enables singer       Jolynda Kiki Chapman\u2019s       tender and direct delivery on \u201cAll These Things,\u201d a ballad first sung by another Neville brother, Art, in 1962, when Mr. Toussaint was just beginning an early hot streak. On \u201cNight People,\u201d Mr. Torkanowky\u2019s greasy Wurlitzer electric piano figures urge on both Cyril Neville\u2019s vocal and alto saxophonist       Maceo Parker\u2019s       pithy solo. On the ballad \u201cWith You in Mind,\u201d the trio shines on its own: Mr. Torkanowsky\u2019s gentle touch and sense of proportion lend shape; Mr. Singleton solos with a full and soulful tone; and Mr. Moore strokes his snare with brushes as if stoking a slow-burning fire.The final track opens with actor       Wendell Pierce       reciting the lyrics of \u201cSouthern Nights\u201d to Mr. Moore\u2019s drumbeats. This might have seemed mere affectation, were it not for the loveliness of Mr. Toussaint\u2019s words (\u201cfree as a breeze, not to mention the trees\u201d). Near the end of his career, on his 2013 solo \u201cSongbook\u201d album, Mr. Toussaint reclaimed this song from the bombast of       Glen Campbell\u2019s       version, which topped 1977\u2019s pop chart.

The new drug is the second non-branded version of             Johnson & Johnson\u2019s        JNJ -0.71%       blockbuster drug Remicade to hit the U.S. market. Renflexis will sell for one-third below Remicade\u2019s list price. That is significantly cheaper than the first biosimilar to Remicade, which sells at a 15% discount to list price.The news would appear problematic for Johnson & Johnson. The company booked more than $2.2 billion in U.S. Remicade sales in the first half of this year, which accounted for more than a fifth of total U.S. pharmaceutical sales over that period. In a normal commercial market, a product that does the same thing and sells with a big discount would fly off the shelves.But sales of the first Remicade biosimilar were just $17 million in the first quarter. And while U.S. Remicade sales were down nearly 14% in the second quarter, Johnson & Johnson said biosimilar sales have been weaker than they expected. It is more likely that the company has lost market share to rivals in what is the best-selling class of drugs in the world,             AbbVie\u2019s       Humira and Amgen\u2019s Enbrel. Both companies report results this week.Biosimilars are fairly new to the U.S., and unlike traditional generic drugs, aren\u2019t exact copies of the prescription drugs. That could limit enthusiasm among doctors and patients for switching treatments. Yet biosimilars have long been sold in Europe, and there is no evidence they haven\u2019t worked just as well as branded drugs.A much bigger obstacle to biosimilar use is the convoluted U.S. system of rebates and discounts from the sticker price.\u00a0It is impossible to tell from the outside what kind of savings these new drugs actually offer, despite the high list discount.\u00a0A recent paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association said that rebates offered by drug companies to payers such as insurance companies could halve the price of the branded drug for a patient. But if a payer does use the biosimilar, the drugmaker could pull its rebate for all of its patients.That means if some, but not all patients switch to the cheaper drug, the payer\u2019s total drug expense could actually rise. And for all the outrage over high profile episodes of generic price gouging, U.S. sales of Remicade and its two branded peers were nearly $21 billion last year.Politicians of all sorts have spent the past two years investigating and decrying the high price of prescription drugs. One answer to their criticisms could be to pull the veil off rebates and other efforts by drugmakers to obscure how much their products really cost.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Rebates Help to Explain High Pharma Costs.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-blockbuster-drugs-fight-off-cheaper-competition-1500916037", "keywords": ["biosimilar,drugmaker,generic drug,heard on the street,pharmaceutical,Johnson & Johnson,JNJ,Merck,MRK,MRK.XE,AbbVie,ABBV,Amgen,AMGN,commodity,financial market news,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,drug discovery,development"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 12:53:00", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Misguided Approach to China", "content": "Officials from China and the U.S. met in Washington last week for the so-called Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, but the results were meagre. The two sides are no closer to solving Beijing\u2019s $340 billion trade surplus with the U.S., but focusing on the bilateral trade balance was always going to be a fool\u2019s errand.Freeing up U.S. beef exports or curbing Chinese steel production won\u2019t bring trade into balance. That requires addressing thorny structural issues such as America\u2019s persistent budget deficits and China\u2019s low household-consumption rate. Neither can be achieved overnight. Addressing investment-related concerns would have been a more productive use of the delegates\u2019 time.The conventional wisdom is that too much U.S. foreign investment is landing in China, taking jobs and competitiveness away from America. Yet the official statistics show that only 1% to 2% of U.S. investment has gone to China over the past decade, while only 2% to 3% of China\u2019s outward investment has entered the U.S.Data deficiencies partially explain these low numbers. Much of the global flow of foreign investment is channeled through tax havens that blur their origins. But country comparisons can help neutralize this distortion.Consider the European Union, which is comparable to the U.S. in economic size. Over the past 10 years, annual flows of the EU\u2019s foreign investment to and from China have been two to three times that of the U.S., although they both began the decade around the same level.The difference is that the EU\u2019s manufacturing strengths complement China\u2019s market needs. Stroll through any major shopping mall in China and you\u2019ll notice that 80% of the products are European.The EU\u2019s top exports to China are dominated by machinery and transport as well as high-end consumer goods. These products require FDI flows to support market penetration and servicing.Meanwhile, a visit to China\u2019s major cities shows a plethora of U.S. brand names such as Apple, Marriott and             McDonald\u2019s.       Many of these are operated as franchises with fees paid by Chinese investors. The actual investment is local. Or, as in the case of Apple, the investment is Taiwanese; Apple invests very little in China.Manufactured exports and related investments are largely welcomed in China\u2019s domestic market and cater more to the EU\u2019s strengths. Meanwhile the country\u2019s closed services sector hinders investment from the U.S., whose strengths lie in higher-value services, notably in information technology and finance. China\u2019s long list of activities restricted to foreign investors is dominated by services. Getting Beijing to significantly liberalize entry has been a tough battle.But economic factors only explain part of the EU\u2019s higher levels of Chinese FDI. Other sensitivities also play a significant role.Politically, the EU represents a much easier market for Chinese companies to penetrate. If one member country restricts access to its market, a Chinese company can enter the EU through a different member country.Partnerships with individual U.S. states are possible, but the more agglomerated nature of U.S. companies and the overarching nature of federal policies is a challenge for Chinese investors.Security concerns are also more contentious in the U.S. Although China accounts for only a few percent of America\u2019s foreign investment, it makes up nearly 25% of the reviews by the U.S. committee that deals with national-security concerns.Such concerns led Huawei, China\u2019s major telecommunications company, to largely give up on the U.S. market. Instead, it has secured a foothold in Europe and now accounts for about a quarter of the mobile-network infrastructure spending in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.For the U.S., encouraging more bilateral investment flows and improving market access in high-value services while dealing with legitimate security concerns would benefit both sides.The Trump administration may want to resist any agreement that would encourage U.S. firms to invest more abroad, but a bilateral investment treaty should be high on its agenda, even if it isn\u2019t politically expedient.Mr. Huang is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and the author of \u201cCracking the China Conundrum: Why Conventional Economic Wisdom Is Wrong\u201d (Oxford, 2017).", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-misguided-approach-to-china-1500915180", "keywords": ["china, comprehensive economic dialogue, donald trump, european union, foreign direct investment, huawei, trade surplus,economic performance,indicators,trade figures,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,primary metals,iron,steel,ferroalloys,basic materials,resources"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 12:51:00", "news_title": "Arconic Weighs in on London Fire", "content": "Arconic Inc.        ARNC -1.27%       said Monday it had no control over the use of the aluminum composite panels in the exterior of a London apartment block where a fire last month killed 80 people, but will continue to refrain from selling the product for use in high rise buildings.Investigators suspect that Arconic\u2019s Reynobond PE panels contributed to the spread of the June 14 fire at Grenfell Tower. The panels\u2019 polyethylene cores are believed to have ignited during the fire, which investigators suspect started in an apartment and spread to the building\u2019s exterior cladding.The potential fallout from the fire has added to the pressures on a company that also had to fight a proxy battle and address quality issues related to parts used in aircraft engines, a key growth market.Interim Chief Executive       David Hess       said Arconic continued to support the Grenfell investigation. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve been compliant in the sale of our product.\u201d he told analysts after Arconic reported forecast-beating profits and boosted its full-year guidance.Arconic announced June 26 that it will stop selling Reynobond PE panels for use in high-rise buildings, though the company continues to sell the panels for use in low-rise structures. The company also markets panels with fire-retardant cores that can be used in high rises. World-side sales of Reynobond PE panels for building applications were less than $60 million last year, Arconic said. The U.K. accounted for about 5%, or $3 million, of those sales.The company said the Reynobond PE panels are certified for use as a construction material in the U.K. and other countries and the company sells them with the expectation that they\u2019re used in accordance with local building regulations.Mr. Hess sidestepped a question about the company\u2019s ability to handle potential liability costs for the Grenfell fire, saying only that \u201cwe have appropriate insurance coverage. I really can\u2019t speculate on our exposure.\u201d Concerning the fire, Mr. Hess said, \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to those who have lost so much.\u201dNew York-based Arconic has stressed the Reynobond panels were one component of a wall cladding assembly on Grenfell Tower featuring insulation and other materials that were put together by architects, contractors, fabricators and others, who are responsible for complying with specific regulations.\u201cWhen we sell that material, we don\u2019t know where that material is headed when it\u2019s sold.\u201d Mr. Hess said. \u201cWe supply the building material. We do not control the ultimate design and installation.\u201dMr. Hess said the search for a permanent CEO remains under way, and an executive search firm has been hired to help the board. Activist investor Elliott Management agreed in May to call off its proxy fight in exchange for additional appointments to the Arconic board. It is believed that Elliott\u2019s preferred candidate for the job, veteran aerospace executive Larry Lawson, is among those under consideration. Mr. Hess declined to comment on the candidates or the selection process.Former CEO       Klaus Kleinfeld       left abruptly in April after heavy pressure from Elliott, which blamed him for lowering profit targets and failing to cut expenses.Arconic raised its full-year performance outlook, lifting the range of expected sales to $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion from previous guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Arconic also boosted the floor on its adjusted per-share earnings forecast by 5 cents, to a range of $1.15 to $1.20.The company has been under pressure to cut costs since splitting from aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. in November of last year. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings margin before taxes rose to 14.9% from 14.7%.Arconic reported profits of $212 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $135 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.

That means more boomers than ever are becoming sexagenarians at a rough rate of 491 an hour. That\u2019s a lot of candles.Two of them, teenage sweethearts Mike and       Robin Hamlin       threw an \u201c120\u201d party in honor of each reaching that milestone birthday this year. They invited about 100 people, had a live band and danced to       Bruno Mars      \u2019 Uptown Funk.\u201cI could care less if people know I\u2019m 60,\u201d says Ms. Hamlin. The only time it bothers her is when she enters her age on the treadmill in the morning. \u201cThen I think: \u2018I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t feel different than 40.\u2019 \u201dToday\u2019s 60-year-old is generally in better health and has more education than their mom and dad. They look younger thanks to cosmetic surgery, better nutrition, exercise and skin creams. They are also more active. They volunteer, backpack, FaceTime with grandchildren if they have them, take more cruises than their parents and take vitamin supplements, especially vitamin D. They are on the brink of what one aging expert called an emerging \u201cgerontolescence,\u201d a new period of transition.But for the most part, people in the U.S. prefer to tiptoe past their 60th birthday because they don\u2019t want anyone to know that they are that old. Among the best possible birthday gifts for a 60th birthday: \u201cThat people would forget I am 60,\u201d according to a 2006 study by AARP Inc. For good reason: Those under 30 say old age begins at 60, according to a 2009 Pew Research Center report.Part of the trepidation is the social clock\u2014a cultural timeline of expectations of what you should do at a certain age, says       William Doherty,        director of marriage and family therapy at the University of Minnesota.At 60, people ask, \u201cWhen do you plan to retire?\u201d which is unsettling for many men whose self-image and identity is dominated by work, says Dr. Doherty, who is 72 and still working. People began asking, \u201cAre you still working?\u201d when he was in his late 60s, which was followed by, \u201cYou\u2019re not still working are you?\u201d when he reached 70. And that still happens even though nearly 9 million Americans aged 65 and older were working in May 2016, more than twice the number of people that age in 2000.Men at 60 also tend to think they look better than they do, while women are more critical of their appearances from an earlier age. Dr. Doherty remembers being offended when an 18-year-old             McDonald\u2019s                   clerk asked him if he wanted a discount when he was 62. He said \u201cNo,\u201d and told himself, \u2018I\u2019ve crossed the divide.\u2019\u201cI had the image that I looked so much younger than my age,\u201d he says.Craig Lambert,        a marriage therapist in San Diego, wanted a quiet dinner when he turned 60 last year, nothing like the big 50th birthday bash he had. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to focus on the number. I just wanted to get beyond it,\u201d says Mr. Lambert. Many men, he says, feel that by 60 they have peaked in their career and that the best years are behind them. He exercises and is in good shape. But when he looks in the mirror, \u201cI honestly can\u2019t believe what I look like. My hair is totally gray,\u201d says Mr. Lambert, who had cosmetic surgery around his eyes.Women, he says, seem to have a better outlook. \u201cThe kids are grown and out of the house. They have a new lease on life and feel a greater potential to grow and expand in ways they haven\u2019t before,\u201d he says.His fianc\u00e9e,       Debbie Seid,        turns 60 Aug. 13. She thought of a big party but is now thinking of having a pool party with her 10 close girl friends and inviting a psychic. Her daughter is flying in from New York.Turning 60 doesn\u2019t bother her as much as 59, which was her last birthday in her 50s. \u201cI hung onto 58 like crazy,\u201d she says. In recent months, she has been trying to get used to being a sexagenarian by telling people \u201cI\u2019m going to be 60.\u201dIt isn\u2019t so bad, she says. \u201cI\u2019m younger now that I am ever going to be for the rest of my life. That makes me feel young.\u201dIan Brown,        a journalist and author, decided to keep a year-long daily diary, starting with the day he turned 60, in large part because he realized life was short and he needed to pay closer attention to its details. He wrote in the resulting book, \u201cSixty: A Diary of My Sixty-First Year: The Beginning of the End, or the End of the Beginning?\u201d about his growing baldness and memory lapses, not accomplishing what he thought he would and the fear of what he calls \u201cerasure,\u201d which is something women have dealt with for a long time, and learned how to compensate. His wife, who is eight years younger, threw him a big party. They drank Tamarind Sours. \u201cThey go down easily,\u201d he says.The 120 party was       Mike Hamlin\u2019s       idea. Mr. Hamlin, who owns Wing-Hamlin Co., a manufacturing representative agency in Elmhurst, Ill., turned 60 in March. He and his wife went to their daughter\u2019s home in Boston. They had a nice quiet dinner. His 5-year-old grandson made him a toolbox.A month later, they were in Florida, visiting Ms. Hamlin\u2019s parents. Her father is 94 and her mother is 88. The Hamlins have made several trips back and forth and the last one was especially stressful. They thought it would be better for her parents to move into assisted living and provided several options. Her parents declined.On the way to the airport, Mr. Hamlin told his wife, who was turning 60 in May, \u201cwe need a big blowout.\u201d Part of it was the stress involved in trying to care for aging parents. In the back of his mind, too, he says, was his business partner who died of a heart attack when he was 60 and his dad, who died at 70. \u201cWe need to really make sure we don\u2019t let the next 10 years slip by,\u201d he remembers telling his wife, who has lost two dear friends to cancer.They picked May 20, the Saturday after Ms. Hamlin\u2019s 60th birthday. She worried at one point during dinner when the band played recorded music, including \u201cClose to You\u201d by the Carpenters. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God. This is going to be so lame,\u2019 \u201d she says.Later, the band, named Enough Said, played \u201cRaise your Glass\u201d by Pink. Everyone danced.

The trade office is a South Korean equivalent of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.The trade deal calls for talks to begin within 30 days after either side requests such a Joint Committee session. Mr. Paik said officials from both sides should consult and determine such details as a date for talks and concrete agenda to be discussed.South Korean officials have said they are willing to address U.S. concerns and discuss changes to the free trade pact, but wouldn\u2019t rush into renegotiations because they still believe the deal has been \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d over the past five years.But Mr. Lighthizer said in his earlier letter that the U.S. overall deficit with Korea had increased since the agreement took effect. The U.S. imported $69.9 billion in goods from South Korea last year but exported only $42.3 billion.While Mr. Trump denounces the trade agreement as widening trade deficits, most economists say the trade imbalance stems from broad economic factors and that the U.S. benefits from its imports as well as its exports.Write to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-responds-to-u-s-offer-to-discuss-trade-pact-changes-1500913497", "keywords": ["asia-pacific,deficit,korus fta,south korea,trade agreement,Donald Trump,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,weapons programs"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 12:23:00", "news_title": "Patients Make More Medication Mistakes", "content": "The number of serious medication errors people make is on the rise, leaving about one-third of such people in the hospital.Every two minutes someone calls a U.S. poison control center about a medication error. They took the wrong dose, took their medication twice or accidentally took someone else\u2019s, among other mistakes.About 14 of those calls a day are serious medication errors that typically require medical treatment and may result in hospitalization or even death, according to a recent study published in the journal Clinical Toxicology earlier this month. The study analyzed calls to poison control centers across the county, focusing on serious medication errors that took place outside of the hospital.The researchers found that serious medical errors doubled between 2000 and 2012, said Nichole Hodges, first author of the study and a research scientist with the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.The most common medication mistakes involved cardiovascular drugs, such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which made up 20.6% of serious errors. Pain medications such as opioids and acetaminophen (brand name, Tylenol) were involved in 12% of errors, and hormone therapies, mainly insulin, were associated with 11% of serious mistakes.The usage of these types of medications is going up, said Dr. Hodges. \u201cSo we\u2019re likely to see more errors. But we can\u2019t tell for sure whether the errors are increasing or whether they\u2019re just being reported more often.\u201dCalcium channel blockers, commonly used for high blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias, can be especially dangerous when extra doses are accidentally taken, because they can cause blood pressure to drop to abnormally low levels. They can also cause arrhythmias and other heart issues, said       Henry A. Spiller,        a co-author on the study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children\u2019s.\u201cBecause older people may be on multiple medications, they are sometimes used to swallowing several pills at a time,\u201d said Dr. Spiller. \u201cIf you take six of these you have a week\u2019s worth of the drugs, and that becomes dangerous.\u201dTaking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage and high doses of opioids can cause breathing problems and lead to coma, he said.A common problem for diabetics is when they confuse their morning dose of insulin with their evening dose. Diabetics typically take two different doses of insulin each day, a faster-acting and larger dose that is supposed to be taken in the morning and a lower dose that is for the evening.\u201cThe good news is most of these errors are highly preventable,\u201d said Dr. Hodges.She advises that parents and caregivers keep a log, noting the time and day a medication is given. Weekly pill planners can be helpful, but make sure they are child-resistant and stored out of sight of children, she said.And make sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist about your medication so you\u2019re clear on dosage, she said.Hospital-based medication errors have also been a focus of concern for years, with efforts under way to reduce such errors. \u201cMedication errors are common in hospitals, but fortunately only about one in 100 result in harm,\u201d said       David Bates,        chief of general medicine at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.Dr. Bates said electronic health records have helped reduce such errors. Overdoses are the most common error in hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to have a three or five or even 10-fold overdose,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd older patients are particularly susceptible to getting too much medication, as are patients with kidney problems.\u201dAdding bar codes to medications and the creation of smart pumps for medicines that are given intravenously have also helped reduce medication errors in the hospital, said Dr. Bates.

These \u201cno code\u201d solutions render traditional coding irrelevant for many of the users who would have learned to create software applications in Microsoft Access or similar solutions.Cullen CoatesLincoln, Calif.The world is not headed toward one language. The fact that we see signs in English around the world doesn\u2019t mean the Japanese or Chinese or Egyptians are abandoning their native languages. Rather, they are learning English and becoming bilingual. The U.S., on the other hand, is in danger of becoming the largest pot of monoglots in the world, and our citizens risk losing out on the many benefits that bilingualism brings. In the Program For International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings of international education, virtually all of the many countries ranking above the U.S. raise their children bilingually. Those countries ahead of us in the PISA rankings use languages to learn subjects like history and math. Some smart U.S. states are starting to do that too, notably Utah.Steve LeveenDelray Beach, Fla.My advice to a student who wants to pursue a career in technology is to get an engineering degree and minor in Hindi or Mandarin, so he or she can relate to future colleagues or, better yet, future employees.

German officials argue the visits are part of a mandate governing German military deployments abroad.Last month Berlin ended German operations from nearby Incirlik air base, relocating troops to Jordan, after Ankara blocked a visit by German lawmakers.Other NATO members and allies including the Netherlands, the U.S. and Austria have also gotten into their own spats with Turkey, unsettling relations inside the 29-country alliance.NATO Secretary General       Jens Stoltenberg       last week was\u00a0in contact\u00a0with the Turkish and German foreign ministers seeking a compromise in the current dispute, a NATO official said.On Monday,\u00a0NATO announced a compromise in which the German legislators visit the Konya air base as part of a NATO delegation under the alliance\u2019s flag,\u00a0spokesman       Piers Cazalet       said.\u00a0Turkish officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the NATO proposal.German lawmakers welcomed the compromise. Henning Otte, a lawmaker and defense expert with Chancellor       Angela Merkel\u2019s       conservatives, said, \u201cThis is the only way to regain normal relations in the alliance.\u201dTurkey, an early member of NATO and its second-largest military behind the U.S., long played a pivotal role in the security alliance because of its border with the Soviet Union and its anticommunism stance. Today, its position bordering Syria puts it on the front lines of fighting Islamic State and other terror groups.NATO diplomats want to keep the German contingent at the Konya air base because Germany provides roughly one-third of the air crew for the NATO AWACS surveillance planes. NATO isn\u2019t directly involved in fighting Islamic State but provides valuable surveillance and air-traffic management to NATO member forces.NATO is no stranger to quarrels between members, mainly border disputes, but has long managed to limit them. The latest disagreements are different, current and former NATO officials say. Turkey and its NATO allies are now sniping over fundamental policy issues including human rights, designations of terrorist organizations and decisions on how to fight Islamic State.The situation is alarming, NATO officials and diplomats said.\u201cWe cannot afford to have disagreements destroy what has been created over decades to preserve security,\u201d said Lithuanian Foreign Minister       Linas Linkevi\u010dius,        an advocate for accommodating Turkey. \u201cLet\u2019s go and talk.\u201dTurkey\u2019s relations inside NATO have\u00a0deteriorated\u00a0over the year since a failed coup attempt there. President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       responded with a crackdown that expanded from coup-plotters to opposition lawmakers, journalists, academics and human-rights advocates.Some NATO members are increasingly critical of how Mr. Erdogan has consolidated power.\u00a0Mr. Erdogan has responded by attacking NATO allies for supporting Kurdish and other terrorist organizations hostile to Turkey.Turkish officials have been particularly upset with European allies granting asylum to alleged coup-plotters, as well as Kurdish rallies against Mr. Erdogan and in support of the separatist PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Ankara and NATO. Ankara\u2019s Western critics, such as Germany, have cited free speech for allowing the demonstrations and a deterioration in Turkey\u2019s rule of law for refusing to extradite suspected putschists.\u201cThe government that shelters terrorists from Turkey in Germany must first account for that,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said\u00a0Friday\u00a0in Istanbul. \u201cGermany must pull itself together.\u201dTurkish officials have leveled similar criticism at the U.S., long one of Turkey\u2019s closest allies. An adviser to Mr. Erdogan last year suggested a ban on U.S. operations from Incirlik over Washington\u2019s support for Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara considers terrorists.U.S. officials have played down the rift, saying relations are strong out of public view. Still, the publication last week by a Turkish state-run news agency of a map purportedly showing the locations\u00a0of U.S. forces deployed in Syria drew a warning from the Pentagon.Wrangling with Turkey is being intensified by domestic politics in some European countries. Germany holds national elections in September and Austria\u00a0one month later.NATO in May delayed\u00a0exercises with all of its partners\u00a0due to a dispute between Turkey and Austria after Austrian politicians criticized Mr. Erdogan\u2019s policies. NATO agreed to Turkey\u2019s demands to put on hold its relationship with Austria, which isn\u2019t a member.Former NATO Deputy Secretary-General       Alexander Vershbow       said the latest fights are particularly difficult because many are rooted in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s belief that he and his country are being slighted by Europe. The Turkish president has repeatedly criticized NATO allies for being slow to condemn the coup and offer him their support.\u201cIt got much more personal,\u201d said Mr. Vershbow, now a senior adviser at Rasmussen Global, a consulting firm run by previous NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. \u201cThat is what is different from some of the substantive issues of past.\u201dThe latest fight between Germany and Turkey emerged over recent weeks after\u00a0Germany announced its exit from Incirlik. Turkey offered to allow German lawmakers to visit troops in Konya but contested the presence of politicians Ankara says support Kurdish terrorists. German officials said politicians from all political parties must be allowed to visit the troops.Diplomatic back-channeling failed and a public war of words grew. Turkey\u00a0last Tuesday detained a German human-rights activist pending a trial.\u00a0Berlin summoned Turkey\u2019s ambassador, threatening to cut EU financial support, issuing a travel\u00a0alert\u00a0and questioning German investments in Turkey.The disputes between Turkey and Germany are largely not about NATO, but the spillover from recurring tensions are now putting an important mission\u2014providing air surveillance to the anti-Islamic State\u2014at risk. They also threaten the steady flow of intelligence from reconnaissance flights that help Turkey protect its 565-mile border with Syria, where it actively fights both Islamic State and Kurdish militias.\u201cIf the Turks and Germans don\u2019t sort this out it could precipitate a termination of the AWACS flights,\u201d Mr. Vershbow said.\u2014Ned Levin in Istanbul and Andrea Thomas in Berlin contributed to this article.Write to Julian E.

The Samsung-developed drug will be marketed to health-care providers by         Merck               & Co.\u2019s U.S. sales team and will be sold for about a 35% discount off Remicade\u2019s current list price.The move follows an April approval by the Food and Drug Administration. It is the Samsung business empire\u2019s debut treatment in the world\u2019s biggest drug market and reflects its desires to diversify beyond electronics.Samsung Bioepis Co., the group\u2019s new biotechnology company, is targeting the creation of near replicas of so-called branded biologic drugs, like Remicade, which are made out of living cells and address complex diseases including cancer or arthritis. These \u201cbiosimilars\u201d are sold more cheaply than brand-name treatments that often cost tens of thousands of dollars a year.The lucrative biologic drug market will gradually open up as patent protections of those treatments expire, creating opportunities for biosimilars made by Samsung and others. Biologics had $202 billion in world-wide sales last year, and the drugs are expected to have $214 billion in sales this year, according to EvaluatePharma, a source of pharmaceutical market data and analysis. It estimates sales will reach $276 billion in 2020.Samsung said in a statement its new drug, called Renflexis, would be priced at about $750 per vial.Pfizer Inc.       and partner         Celltrion Inc.       launched their own Remicade near-replica in November, selling it then at 15% below J&J\u2019s list price. But J&J has said patients pay a significantly lower price for Remicade after discounts.What remains unclear is to what extent U.S. doctors and patients will embrace these new types of medication amid concerns about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars.But adoption across Europe, where biosimilars have been available for years, has \u201cdrastically\u201d improved, while perceptions are getting better among U.S. health-care providers, said Klaus Falk, a Samsung Bioepis vice president who heads commercial strategy, in an email.\u201cI am convinced that the good experiences we\u2019ve seen in Europe will be repeated in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said. \u201cThat said, there is still a way to go in educating the relevant stakeholders about the science behind biosimilars.\u201dA vial of J&J\u2019s Remicade lists for more than $1,100, with a year\u2019s treatment typically listed then at more than $30,000. It is among the top-selling drugs in the U.S. with $4.5 billion in sales last year.Adoption of the Pfizer-Celltrion copy of Remicade\u2014called Inflectra\u2014has been limited. Pfizer reported the biosimilar generated just $17 million of U.S. sales in the first quarter. In its second quarter earnings call last week, J&J CFO       Dominic Caruso       described the impact of biosimilar competition on Remicade sales as less than J&J expected. Pfizer declined to comment.Samsung, whose biotechnology push is five years old, has muscled into the drug world on an unusually fast timeline, industry analysts say. Its association with South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate gives the Bioepis unit deep pockets to invest heavily in research and development, as well as the ability to price aggressively.Pfizer has offered just small Inflectra discounts so far, opting not to lower prices to spur sales, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Ronny Gal.Mr. Gal said Merck and Samsung would probably have to discount Renflexis even further, during contract talks with health plans, if the biosimilar was going to succeed in getting Remicade patients to switch over. J&J is already heavily discounting off Remicade\u2019s list price. J&J says the average sales price of Remicade, after discounts, is a little more than $800 a vial or $21,000 a year, about a third less than the list price.J&J has acted forcefully to protect its franchise by, for instance, negotiating exclusive contracts with the managed-care organizations that pay for the drug and giving rebates on other company products to hospitals that keep using Remicade, according to Mr. Gal.J&J said Remicade has a long history of safe, effective use, and that the company was working to make sure patients who are doing well on Remicade can stay on it and aren\u2019t forced to switch to one of the copies.\u201cWe are confident in our competitive strategies to win in a market with multiple biosimilars,\u201d the company said.Samsung sells two of its drugs already in Europe. Last month, a third received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency.

But at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 3D technology is there not for entertainment but pain relief.Patients in chronic or acute pain have put on special goggles and traveled virtually through Iceland\u2019s waterfalls and valleys, floated among dolphins or meditated beside an idyllic coastline.Brennan Spiegel, a Cedars-Sinai researcher, says a virtual-reality experience can reduce pain by 24% or more, according to clinical trials he conducted in the past two years. VR eased different types of pain, from cancer to orthopedic injuries to abdominal discomfort.An immersive virtual-reality experience can commandeer a patient\u2019s brain so it no longer focuses on pain, says Dr. Spiegel, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work on everybody, but when it works, it really, really works.\u201dAt a time when doctors are scrambling to curb the use of addictive painkillers, he and others say VR could be an effective alternative or complementary treatment.Virtual-reality technology engages a person in a 360-degree visual experience. It has been used in medical research for more than two decades, to treat trauma, anxiety and even burn pain. The fact that it can now be accessed with headsets and mobile phones is fueling hospitals\u2019 interest.Researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital are using virtual reality in studies on pain and anxiety in youngsters and adolescents.

The company also has sold virtual-reality equipment to about 100 hospitals. Chief Executive Matthew Stoudt says the firm has created or acquired a library of more than 20 experiences, as the VR scenarios are called.Virtual reality holds promise in alleviating psychological and physical pain, says Albert \u201cSkip\u201d Rizzo, a psychologist who has run his own virtual-reality laboratory at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since the 1990s.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have any illusions that you are going to have open-heart surgery and you are going to slap on the headset and do it without anesthesia,\u201d says Dr. Rizzo, a research professor in USC\u2019s psychiatry department.But virtual reality can have \u201cdramatic effects\u201d on reducing pain, he says.Years back, it was hard even to get funding. \u201cA lot of the agencies thought it was \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 \u201d he recalls. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the past year or two, and he believes that \u201cclinical virtual reality\u201d will be used more broadly in patient care. In 2015, Dr. Rizzo received a consulting fee of $1,200 from appliedVR.\u201cIt is Christmas time for virtual-reality researchers,\u201d says Hunter Hoffman, a VR pioneer and research scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has used virtual reality to help burn victims for the past 20 years.Once upon a time, it was a costly research niche. \u201cWe used $90,000 computers and the helmet weighed 8 pounds,\u201d Dr. Hoffman remembers. Yet it was effective, and he and a research partner, Dr. David Patterson, used it to ease the pain burn victims felt. They designed a VR experience known as SnowWorld which was \u201cthe antithesis of fire,\u201d and used colors such as white and blue.\u201cVirtual reality hasn\u2019t been used as widely as it should be,\u201d Dr. Hoffman says. But now, he believes, \u201cwe are at the transition phase between research and clinical practice.\u201dAt Cedars-Sinai, patients in Dr. Spiegel\u2019s trials used an $800 kit consisting of a             Samsung                   headset and a Galaxy phone to access VR \u201cexperiences.\u201d The gear was provided by appliedVR, in partnership with Samsung.For some of the studies, the experiences included a tour of Iceland\u2019s terrain and a game called \u201cBear Blast,\u201d where participants shoot balls at animated teddy bears. In another experience\u2014a guided relaxation and meditation session alongside a waterfront\u2014an unseen narrator soothingly intones: \u201cSee if you can offer loving kindness to yourself by saying or thinking these words: May I be healthy. May I be happy.\u201dA study published in March about a group of 50 Cedars-Sinai patients who were offered the virtual-reality teddy bear game for their pain found \u201cstatistically significant and clinically relevant\u201d improvement. Another 50 patients, who were offered a relaxing video with scenes of lakes and running streams, experienced less relief. The paper, which appeared in the Journal of Medical Internet Research Mental Health, concluded that virtual reality \u201cmay be an effective adjunctive therapy\u201d for hospital patients. Dr. Spiegel was the senior author.In a new trial, Dr. Spiegel took 120 patients who were in pain and randomly assigned half to try VR experiences and half to watch a relaxation channel on hospital TV. Preliminary results show a larger drop in pain among the VR group than the TV one, he said.He now plans to measure whether there was a drop in the patients\u2019 opiate use. Dr. Spiegel says he received a $1,250 consulting fee from appliedVR and was reimbursed $889 for transportation; he has no other financial ties to the company. Samsung, in partnership with appliedVR, partially funded the most recent Cedars-Sinai clinical trial.Ernest \u201cBuck\u201d Shearer, a 40-year-old Cedars-Sinai patient who has endured considerable pain related to Crohn\u2019s disease, took part in a trial last spring and found relief with virtual reality. \u201cIt distracts your mind completely,\u201d he says. Mr. Shearer, who says he was on the opioid drug Dilaudid while hospitalized, says he would reach for the goggles during rough stretches between doses of the painkiller. \u201cIt helps you get through the hump,\u201d he says. Playing Bear Blast was a welcome distraction. \u201cOnce, I played the game and forgot it was time for my pain medicine.\u201dJoAnn Difede, a psychologist and professor at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill-Cornell Medicine, recently began testing VR on burn victims having staples removed after surgery. AppliedVR is funding her pilot study. \u201cBurn pain is extraordinarily difficult to control,\u201d says Dr. Difede, even using opiates.Dr. Difede, who has used virtual reality to treat trauma victims of the 9/11 attack and in the military, believes in its potential. \u201cThere is a lot of evidence it does reduce pain,\u201d she says. She hopes one day \u201cthe equipment is in every patient\u2019s room\u2014that VR is as ubiquitous as TV.\u201dAt Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, a trial led by Jeffrey Gold, a pediatric psychologist, offered patients a VR experience\u2014playing Bear Blast\u2014while they had their blood drawn. This simple procedure can be distressing for children who have complex diseases such as cancer. \u201cThey have been stuck numerous times and every needle poke is another trauma,\u201d Dr. Gold says. The study involved more than 100 patients ages 13 to 21, some of whom were offered VR, while others were given the usual care. The trial was funded by appliedVR. Dr. Gold says he has been an unpaid scientific adviser to the company and is negotiating to acquire options in it.Brandon Taitai has leukemia and has been a Children\u2019s Hospital patient since 2014. The 15-year-old says he isn\u2019t afraid of needles or having his blood drawn but enjoyed the VR experience. While playing Bear Blast he was \u201ca lot more focused on the game\u201d than on the blood test.Boston Children\u2019s Hospital has been using virtual reality to help calm children before they receive medicine intravenously or undergo endoscopies or colonoscopies. Kate Donovan, the hospital\u2019s Innovation Technology Coordinator, says children like the goggles. \u201cIt is a new toy for them,\u201d Dr. Donovan says. While the headsets aren\u2019t intended for anyone under 13, Boston Children\u2019s has offered them to patients as young as 8 whose parents have consented. The hospital is investing in more headsets from appliedVR and wants to study if VR can reduce reliance on pain medicine.To Dr. Spiegel of Cedars-Sinai one big advantage of virtual reality is that it has no side-effects other than possible dizziness. \u201cThe worst that happens is they [the patients] are entertained, but there is very little risk.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The Dolphin Swim Club is a virtual-reality experience. An earlier version of this article incorrectly called it the Swim Club (July 24, 2017)Appeared in the July 13, 2017, print edition as 'A Virtual Approach to Real Pain.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/enlisting-virtual-reality-to-ease-real-pain-1499869442", "keywords": ["Cedars-Sinai,political,general news,medical research,health,sciences,humanities,technology,virtual reality technologies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 11:05:00", "news_title": "How Democrats Lost Voters to Trump\u2014and Might Win Them Back", "content": "This is a column about how Donald Trump won the White House.Well, more precisely, it\u2019s a column about how       Hillary Clinton       lost the White House. That\u2019s particularly relevant right now because Democrats on Monday released a new road map showing how to recover from that 2016 loss.Democratic leaders are calling their new agenda \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d and it\u2019s heavy on populist economics: a higher minimum wage; more working-class access to government health programs; and expanded broadband for rural areas.A deeper look back at the 2016 outcome suggests that approach is at least on the right track. The key for Democrats isn\u2019t simply to turn out more young, liberal voters, or to win over Republicans who don\u2019t like President Trump. Rather, Democrats need to win back working-class voters who defected to Mr. Trump. To do that, many in the party believe, Democrats will have to craft a more effective economic message as well as convince skeptical voters that the party isn\u2019t locked into an unpopular Washington status quo.Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, finds in a new report that about six million people who voted for       Barack Obama       in 2012 abandoned the Democrats to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. That\u2019s twice as many as voters who went for Republican       Mitt Romney       in 2012 and then flipped to Mrs. Clinton four years later.The voters who flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump are key. But why did they leave? Some answers are found in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey released earlier this month that looked at a broad cross-section of counties Mr. Trump carried last year.There\u2019s no escaping that people in Trump country simply didn\u2019t like Mrs. Clinton. In some places, she was practically toxic. Across all Trump counties, just 27% hold a positive view of her. Among independent voters in those counties, only 16% view her positively.But much of Trump country is so deep red that it is beyond Democrats\u2019 reach. It\u2019s more instructive to look instead at a subset of Trump counties: those that Mr. Obama carried in 2012 but went for Mr. Trump in 2016.In these \u201cflip counties\u201d Mrs. Clinton also is personally unpopular; just 30% view her favorably, while 50% have an unfavorable view. Interestingly, though, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who challenged Mrs. Clinton from the left with an antiestablishment populist message, is far more popular there. In the flip counties, 44% have a positive view of Mr. Sanders, while just 29% have a negative view.In other words, in counties that moved from Democrats to Mr. Trump, feelings toward Mrs. Clinton are a net 20-percentage points negative, while they are a net 15-points positive for Mr. Sanders.That suggests Mrs. Clinton, the ultimate representative of the party establishment, was a particularly ill-suited candidate for 2016. It further suggests that a populist economic message of the kind Mr. Sanders brought to the table has resonance in the areas that moved away from the Democrats.That notion is supported by some more specific findings in the Journal/NBC survey. In the flip counties, more than half said they think the political and economic systems of the country are stacked against them. A whopping 71% said they aren\u2019t confident their children\u2019s generation will have a better life.There is much about Mr. Trump\u2019s style that flip-county residents don\u2019t like, but they particularly like the suggestion that he is \u201cshaking things up in Washington,\u201d and that he is twisting corporate arms to keep jobs in the U.S. That may be because they are feeling economic strain; 66% say someone in their household has lost a job in the last five years, and 75% say someone in the household has more than $20,000 in student debt.Yet there also are signs that many voters in this slice of Trump country have impulses that are more Democratic than Republican. Six in 10 say government should be doing more to solve problems, while just 37% say the government is doing too many things. They are slightly more inclined to want Democrats to control Congress than Republicans, and they have positive views overall of Mr. Obama. They don\u2019t like Republicans\u2019 health-care plans.Mr. Trump won these places with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic and cultural messages. But Mrs. Clinton just as surely lost them because she was seen as part of the political establishment in a year of surging antiestablishment sentiment, which\u00a0Mr. Sanders tapped into quite effectively from within her own party.These numbers suggest Democrats should be able to recapture this slice of the Trump coalition. They also suggest something else: Don\u2019t be surprised if Republicans try to hold on to those voters in next year\u2019s midterm elections by portraying Democratic House Speaker       Nancy Pelosi       as a replica of Mrs. Clinton, an out-of-touch embodiment of a hated political establishment.Write to Gerald F.

Adjusted for inflation, prices remained about 9% below the 2006 peak.Sales have essentially been flat since March, when home purchases reached the highest level since 2007. A number of indicators suggest demand is surging due to a strong economy and millennials entering the housing market in force for the first time.But severe supply shortages are depressing sales.\u201cThe demand for buying a home is as strong as it has been since before the Great Recession. Listings in the affordable price range continue to be scooped up rapidly, but the severe housing shortages inflicting many markets are keeping a large segment of would-be buyers on the sidelines,\u201d said NAR Chief Economist       Lawrence Yun.There was a 4.3-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, down from 4.6 months a year earlier.Existing home sale have been bumpy throughout the critical spring selling season. Sales rose modestly in May but declined in April, according to NAR.First-time buyers are looking to make purchases, according to economists and recent housing-market data, but are finding few affordably priced homes. Owners, meanwhile, have been more inclined to stay put and renovate rather than brave bidding wars and prices that are significantly higher than what they paid a few years ago.\u201cThe musical chairs phenomenon of people not wanting to actually list their own home because they don\u2019t want to be buyers again means that they have to make their own homes work,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at home listings site Zillow.First-time buyers accounted for 32% of sales in June, down slightly from 33% both in May and a year ago. NAR said the annual share of first-time buyers in 2016 was 35%, a significant improvement from recent years.Foreign buyers also are putting pressure on demand. NAR revealed a surprising jump in Canadians buying U.S. properties in the year ending in March. In all, foreign buyers and recent immigrants purchased $153 billion of residential property in the U.S. in the year ended in March, a nearly 50% jump from a year earlier, according to a National Association of Realtors report released Tuesday. Foreigners purchased roughly 10% of existing U.S. homes, compared with 8% a year earlier.Construction is showing signs of improvement, which could begin to ease supply shortages in the next year or so.

Some people might not even notice them. \u201cThere are so many peculiar things in the desert,\u201d observes their creator, Rachel Whiteread, the London-based conceptual artist. \u201cThese would just be two more peculiar things.\u201d Other passersby might recognize the structures\u2014casts of the interiors of two small cabins from the 1950s\u2014as part of Whiteread\u2019s distinctive body of work, more than 30 years in the making and the subject of a survey that opens at London\u2019s Tate Britain on September 12.These concrete sculptures sit on land owned by Jerry Sohn, a Los Angeles\u2013based publisher of artists\u2019 books, who has been building a collection of site-specific art since he bought his first desert parcel in 1993. In recent years, he has installed pieces by Lawrence Weiner and Richard Long as well as the architect Arata Isozaki. The Whiteread works, which the artist herself has seen only in photos, are the newest additions. Casting the interiors of the two shacks took workers employed by Sohn nearly five years, with Whiteread relaying detailed instructions via email and phone. Everything on the buildings\u2019 interior surfaces, from light switches to door hinges, was captured in concrete. Projections became indentations and vice versa. The original exteriors were then stripped away, leaving the \u201cghost\u201d cabins exposed. \u201cThey have a double-edged feel,\u201d says Whiteread, 54. \u201cThere\u2019s something sinister about them, which is fine.\u201d\u2018\u2018[The cabins] have a double-edged feel. There\u2019s something sinister about them, which is fine.\u2019\u2019Sohn, 61, met Whiteread in 2010, when she had a drawing show at the Hammer Museum, near his L.A. home. He was moved, he says, by the directness and simplicity of her work, and he imagined adding a Whiteread or two to his remote property. Sohn, his wife, Eba, and their 7-year-old twins, Ayea and Mikey, visit the desert most weekends. The family owns a rudimentary home there, but when weather permits, they sleep outside on Isozaki\u2019s concrete platforms.Around the time of the 2010 show, Sohn drove Whiteread out to the desert. She was smitten with a landscape of sculptures that preceded them by millions of years\u2014giant piles of rocks and twisty Joshua trees. Not surprisingly, the area has long attracted artists, including Sohn\u2019s neighbor Ed Ruscha. Installations by Doug Aitken and Andrea Zittel are area attractions.When Sohn showed Whiteread the larger of the two cabins, he recalls, \u201cShe said, \u2018Would you mind if I destroyed it?\u2019 and I answered, \u2018That\u2019s what I was hoping for.\u2019 \u201dThe cabins were far from the first buildings the artist has deconstructed. In 1993, Whiteread, a member of the Young British Artists generation, was awarded Britain\u2019s prestigious Turner Prize for House, a concrete cast of a Victorian home in London\u2019s East End. (It was the last property standing in an urban-renewal area, and Whiteread\u2019s cast, which was meant to be temporary, was also torn down, a few months after it was built.) In New York, Whiteread became known in the late \u201990s for a resin water tower, commissioned by the Public Art Fund, that appeared on a SoHo roof and later atop the Museum of Modern Art.Molly Donovan, a curator at Washington, D.C.\u2019s National Gallery of Art, where the Tate Britain show will travel next year, admires Whiteread\u2019s devotion to casting familiar objects, some small enough to fit on a tabletop, others large enough to anchor multi-acre sites. \u201cShe\u2019s continued to go deeper and deeper into her own vision,\u201d Donovan says. \u201cThere\u2019s something rewarding and frankly remarkable about an artist doing that today.\u201dWhiteread agreed to supervise the casting of the two structures without remuneration. Even so, Sohn spent a not-small fortune on them. (He declined to say how much, only that the cabins were \u201cunbelievably expensive to produce.\u201d) Builder Jason Scharch and his crew devoted almost five years to the project, including a year searching for the right kind of concrete and another year looking for a company that could spray it with the required precision. Each cabin \u201clooks so simple, but its making belies that,\u201d says Donovan.Before casting could begin, breakable glass windows had to be refitted with plastic, cracks in the exterior walls had to be filled and projections such as doorknobs and light switches had to be replaced with rubber replicas that could be removed once the concrete hardened around them.But that was just the little stuff. For each cabin, Scharch had to build a new foundation, incorporating tunnels to allow workers to enter the structure from underground. Inside he added new steel frameworks so that the finished concrete casts, really just hollow shells, would stand up to the elements (and to the inevitable climbers, who have already included both Sohn children).The spraying itself, within the sealed cabins, was harrowing. \u201cWhen you turn on the machines,\u201d Scharch recalls, \u201cyou can\u2019t hear anything; you can hardly see anything. It was rather surreal.\u201d Scharch devised a series of hand signals that were conveyed by what he called a \u201cdaisy chain\u201d of up to seven workers, leading from outside the cabins, via the underground tunnels, to the interiors, where \u201cnozzlemen\u201d in full protective suits and masks maneuvered 4-inch hoses. Complex ventilation and lighting systems were required, in a part of the desert where there is no easy way to get water, electricity or even a cellphone signal. The spraying was followed by months of painstaking work removing the molds\u2014the original cabins\u2014without cracking the concrete casts. Sohn says he loves the finished pieces, which he sees as \u201cboth found objects and careful constructions.\u201dWhiteread likes the fact that the cabins are hard to get to\u2014she compares them to a similar piece of hers on Governors Island, in New York Harbor, that can be seen only five months a year, when the island is open to the public via ferry. \u201cThe slowness of the journey is about the slowness of seeing the piece,\u201d she explains. Someday, she says, she may authorize a book about Sohn\u2019s cabins, with a map directing people to the site. Meanwhile, Sohn shares them with his large circle of friends.Whiteread and Sohn have agreed that the pieces will neither be sold nor moved. As for working without a fee, Whiteread says that she won\u2019t \u201cmake a habit of this; they were very particular circumstances.\u201d Though Sohn is persuasive, the cabins aren\u2019t gifts to him. As Whiteread puts it, \u201cThey are gifts to the place.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-joshua-tree-two-giant-new-works-of-art-1500906674", "keywords": ["Tate Britain,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 10:22:00", "news_title": "How to Hang a 28-Foot-Tall Masterpiece", "content": "A 17th-century painting that towers almost three stories high has the Metropolitan Museum of Art rolling out the red carpet with a handful of scissor lifts and more than 16,000 pounds of sand.The picture, completed in 1683, is the showstopper of \u201c      Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando      : Mexican Painter of the Baroque\u201d an 11-painting exhibit opening July 25 in New York.Even for the Met, which is adept at operations that marry the logistics of D-Day with the polish of a royal wedding, this was a tall order. For starters, only a few places in the museum could house Villalpando\u2019s 28-foot-tall work, \u201c      Moses       and the Brazen Serpent and the Transfiguration of Jesus.\u201d The Met settled on Gallery 963, the skylit atrium of its       Robert Lehman Wing.       To display the painting, which is about 14 feet wide, the museum built a wall-like structure and base reinforced with metal and sand.Until this year, the painting had never left its original site in a chapel of Mexico\u2019s Puebla Cathedral. Before coming to the Met, it was restored for the first time under the aegis of       Agust\u00edn Espinosa Ch\u00e1vez,        a Mexico-based conservator. The job included removing \u201ckilos of dust from the back with a vacuum,\u201d he says. He and his team replaced the painting\u2019s original wood stretchers with ones of wood laminate over steel. They also cleaned the elaborate frame, which is made of cedar bedizened with gold leaf.For the journey to New York, the canvases were cushioned in felt and a paper-like material and rolled on to tubes. The painting was elastic enough to roll without cracking or shedding any original paint, Mr. Espinosa Ch\u00e1vez explained, thanks in part to Villalpando\u2019s thin layers of color as well as his chiaroscuro technique of using light and dark hues to add depth to the work. The new stretchers and the cedar-and-gilt frame were dismantled and packed in padded crates.Mr. Espinosa Ch\u00e1vez and members of his team helped with the five-day installation at the Met. The painting was reattached to the stretchers, with Mr. Espinosa Ch\u00e1vez gauging the proper degree of tautness by gently placing his palm on the back of the canvas. \u201cAs a conservator, you organize the tension,\u201d he said, so the painting doesn\u2019t appear wavy or uneven when displayed.\u201cIt\u2019s among the largest paintings I\u2019ve installed,\u201d said       Taylor Miller,        the Met\u2019s Buildings Manager for Exhibitions. Mr. Miller, who has worked at the museum for more than a decade, pointed out that while the size of the work is unusual, the installation procedures and equipment\u2014as well as the dozens and dozens of people involved in the planning and execution\u2014aren\u2019t. \u201cWe used the same ropes and pulleys that we use for smaller painting and tapestries,\u201d he said.About 16 riggers, machinists, carpenters and technicians rehearsed the effort, including synchronizing the scissor lifts on which some of them perched to install the work. \u201cThey\u2019ve done several dry runs,\u201d said       Ronda Kasl,        a curator in the American Wing at the Met. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually work off of 30-foot lifts.\u201d The canvases were hoisted on to the specially reinforced structure with cloth straps attached to the stretchers.In his time, Villalpando was one of Mexico\u2019s most prominent artists. \u201cThis was by far the most important commission he had received to date that we know of, and it was his opportunity to shine,\u201d said Ms. Kasl, who began work on the exhibit four years ago. The work initially appears to be two paintings, a biblical twofer of scenes that have been tackled through the ages by Rubens,       Michelangelo       and other artists. The bottom half of the painting depicts an Old Testament story of repentance and the top is a portrait of an effulgent Christ from New Testament accounts.

Instead the scandal seems to be spreading to the other German car giants.The latest allegation is that Volkswagen, Porsche and             Audi        NSU 0.04%      \u2014all owned by the Volkswagen Group\u2014together with Mercedes-maker Daimler and             BMW        BMW -0.40%       have engaged in collusive practices since the 1990s, including on emissions-reducing technology linked to the VW fraud revealed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2015. The European Union\u2019s top antitrust regulator has confirmed that it is investigating the industry following a tipoff from VW last year. More than \u20ac11 billion ($12.8 billion) has been wiped off the combined market value of the three listed groups since the weekly magazine Der Spiegel published details of what it labeled \u201cthe cartel\u201d on Friday.The Der Spiegel report describes how teams from each of the big five German car makers met to coordinate answers to questions posed by new technology or regulations. Notably, a crucial component for the reduction of noxious nitrogen-oxide emissions from diesel engines was allegedly downscaled for commercial reasons. This eventually led VW and Audi to pass tougher U.S. tests by cheating.Antitrust penalties can theoretically be as much as 10% of sales, which for the German car makers would be \u20ac46 billion. In reality any charge is likely to be far lower. The $2.7 billion fine announced last month against Google for skewing internet searches to favor its own comparison-shopping service works out at 2.9% of parent company Alphabet\u2019s sales.The largest cartel fine yet issued by the EU was to the truck industry: Four manufacturers, including Daimler, were forced to cough up about $3.3 billion last year following a five-year investigation into price-fixing. The car industry is larger, but the practices unearthed by Der Spiegel imply fixing technical standards rather than the more serious business of fixing prices.The other worry is that the diesel scandal just won\u2019t die. Early last week Daimler issued a commitment to recall and update over 3 million diesel cars in Europe at a cost of \u20ac220 million, even as it admitted no guilt. On Sunday, BMW denied accusations of collusion or underpowered emissions technology, but it also committed to update its older diesel cars.German car makers are in a bind. To meet tightening European regulations they need to rehabilitate diesel\u2019s image with customers and regulators. But doing so increases the cost of engines\u2014and with it the relative appeal of Tesla-style battery-driven cars. It is hard not to see the latest stock-market selloff as an overreaction, particularly since car company valuations are already at rock-bottom. Given the challenge of technology transition, however, any opportunity is one for traders, not long-term investors.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-industrys-diesel-woes-just-wont-die-1500905670", "keywords": ["Volkswagen,VOW.XE,Audi,NSU.XE,BMW,BMW.XE,European Union,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,crime,natural environment,environmental crime,living,lifestyle,commodity,financial market news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,printing,publishing,magazine publishing,automotive,media,entertainment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 10:12:00", "news_title": "NXP Semiconductors CFO Leaves for Applied Materials", "content": "The chief financial officer of             NXP Semiconductors        NXPI 0.20%       NV is leaving after three years to serve in the same role at a company that provides manufacturing equipment to the semiconductor industry.NXP said Monday that       Daniel Durn,        50 years old, will leave the company Aug. 6 to become finance chief of             Applied Materials.

The defeat left the future of the program in question as Congress prepares to go on recess.Democrats and many veterans groups complained that the proposal would fund a privatization drive by drawing on money from elsewhere in the department. But Republicans and backers of the proposal said the proposal would help veterans and provide them more choice in where they get their health care.\u201cThese are investments for our veterans that should be supported from both sides of the aisle,\u201d said Erin Perrine, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), in a statement. \u201cInstead, House Democrats are choosing to pick a floor fight at their expense.\u201dThe top Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, Rep. Tim Walz (D., Minn.) said he withdrew support for the legislation after veterans groups voiced their concerns. A spokesman for Mr. Walz said the congressman found the bill to be lopsided, funding private care but neglecting other parts of the VA.\u201cThe House Majority did not build the necessary consensus among Democrats, Republicans, and our nation\u2019s well-respected veterans service organizations,\u201d Mr. Walz said in a statement.A White House spokesman said: \u201cPresident Trump and his administration remain committed to modernizing the VA and ensuring our nation\u2019s heroes are a priority.\u201dEight veterans advocacy groups, including some of the largest veterans organizations in the country, had called on House members in a letter over the weekend to oppose the measure.\u201cWe oppose legislation that includes funding only for the \u2018choice\u2019 program, which provides additional community care options, but makes no investment in VA and uses \u2018savings\u2019 from other veterans benefits or services to pay for the choice program,\u201d said the letter from a coalition of veterans advocacy groups sent to lawmakers on Saturday.Republican leaders brought the measure to the floor Monday under a rule requiring that it win votes from two-thirds of the House. A spokeswoman for Mr. McCarthy said the bill was introduced under the special-rules suspension because House leaders presumed support from the Democrats.\u201cLast week, during a bipartisan member meeting, members of both parties came together and agreed to fund the Choice program for six months while Congress worked on other reforms,\u201d said Rep.       Phil Roe       (R., Tenn.) the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs in a statement, adding that he was disappointed that the agreement fell apart.\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see that House listened to the voices of millions of members across the veterans organizations that were united in opposition to this bill,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an official with the Vietnam Veterans of America, one of the groups that opposed the measure.The House plan would have provided $2 billion for approximately six months of stopgap funding for what is known as the Veterans Choice Act, a program first passed in 2014 and designed primarily to help veterans obtain health care in the private sector when appointments aren\u2019t available at government-run medical centers.The Choice Act is likely to run out of funding sometime between Aug. 7 and Aug. 15 because the number of appointments was higher than expected, according to VA Secretary       Dr. David Shulkin.       But legislation to replace it has yet to be introduced, leaving stopgap funding as one of the few options.Dr. Shulkin and House Veterans Affairs Committee leaders have said they hope to introduce legislation in the fall that would overhaul and replace the current version of the program. They have also said they oppose plans to privatize the VA, while also moving to expand veterans\u2019 ability to seek care in the private sector as needed.Some of the veterans groups who opposed the funding proposal said the expansion of private-sector appointments is tantamount to gradual privatization.Since January, the VA has authorized more than 8 million appointments in the private sector, 2.6 million more than the previous year, or a nearly 50% year-over-year increase, Dr. Shulkin testified before a Senate panel in late June. With this increased use of private-sector appointments, the Choice program has used more money than anticipated, leading to budget shortfalls and what backers call the need to inject additional funding as soon as possible.\u201cThe chairman\u2019s priority is making sure the Choice fund doesn\u2019t run dry because of the real and disastrous effect it would have on veterans\u2019 health care,\u201d said Tiffany Haverly, a spokeswoman for Dr. Roe, before the vote.Veterans groups, including Veterans of Foreign Wars and Vietnam Veterans of America, issued their letter over the weekend opposing the measure, saying the funding boost would only benefit the Choice program, which pays for private-sector appointments but doesn\u2019t build the VA\u2019s ability to treat patients within the system, and it does so by drawing funds from elsewhere within the VA.Write to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Groups Oppose VA Fund Plan.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-gears-up-for-vote-on-funding-measure-opposed-by-many-veterans-groups-1500905324", "keywords": ["choice program,privatization,veterans,veterans affairs,veterans choice act,Department of Veterans Affairs,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,veterans affairs department"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 10:04:00", "news_title": "Caterpillar Earnings: What to Watch ", "content": "Caterpillar Inc.

In April, Caterpillar said it expects earnings per share for the full year to be $2.10 at the midpoint of its revenue outlook.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect $10.9 billion of revenue in the quarter, up from $10.3 billion a year earlier. For all of 2017, Caterpillar said in April it was predicting revenue of $38 billion to $41 billion, compared with $38.5 billion in 2016.TURNAROUND: Caterpillar saw signs of a recovery in a number of its mining and construction markets around the world in the first quarter. The manufacturer\u2019s monthly retail data suggest a continued turnaround.

Wagner is co-founder and chief executive of Omnia Family Wealth in Aventura, Fla. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Jacob Meade.When adult children of an affluent family don\u2019t learn the extent of their wealth until it passes into their hands, the influx of millions in assets can make them anxious or overwhelmed. This \u201csudden wealth syndrome\u201d is akin to the stress on people who win the lottery, some of whom run through their funds and wind up bankrupt in just a few years.To help prevent high-net-worth clients\u2019 children from going down a similar path, advisers should promote family meetings in which the children learn details of their future wealth and discuss those details in relation to their own long-term goals. My multifamily office encourages clients to have these conversations while both parents are alive and active\u2014giving parents the chance to reveal to their adult children the scope of the family\u2019s business and wealth and what they are going to inherit.The power of these discussions was emphasized during a first family meeting my firm hosted for a large client with a successful business. The parents had decided to move 30% of the business to their two adult children within the next three years. The children were unaware of this plan, so my firm used the meeting to unveil it along with some figures about the company\u2019s cash flow, tax issues and corporate structures. On learning their future large stake in the company, both children were astonished. But the meeting\u2019s somewhat dramatic start led to a calmer conversation and education process, by which the children learned about their parents\u2019 objectives and gained a comfort level in talking about their own future obligations and options.Most important, through this process we discovered that the two children had different views on their future with respect to the family business. While both currently worked there, only one wished to stay long term, while the other planned to exit and pursue a separate career path. We could see how these differing plans might introduce tension later on when the siblings acquired equal ownership. To help avoid a conflict, my firm then worked with each individual, along with their attorneys, to help negotiate and structure a plan that would serve all parties\u2019 interests.My firm enjoys facilitating these conversations because they allow us to engage clients not just on questions of investment performance, but also on an issue that matters to them most: their children\u2019s future. By promoting discussion of that future in open family meetings with parents present, advisers can enhance the value of services they offer, as well as the depth and tenure of relationships they build with their clients.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-avoid-sudden-wealth-syndrome-1500904073", "keywords": ["banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 09:28:00", "news_title": "White House Signals Support for Bill on Russia Sanctions", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The White House on Sunday indicated President       Donald Trump       was likely to support legislation that would punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, after months of questioning assertions about Moscow\u2019s involvement.The Trump administration\u2019s response to the sanctions bill is being closely watched, because a failure to sign it could prompt criticism that Mr. Trump is siding with President       Vladimir Putin       amid investigations into the Russian interference in the election and into possible ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia.Mr. Trump\u2019s, son, Donald Trump Jr., his son in law,       Jared Kushner,        and his former campaign chairman       Paul Manafort       are scheduled to appear before Senate committees this week in connection with Russia. The House is scheduled to vote on the sanctions package on Tuesday.\u201cWe support where the legislation is now,\u201d White House press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Ms. Sanders had said previous versions of the bill contained provisions that eroded the president\u2019s power to conduct diplomacy.Ms. Sanders\u2019s boss,       Anthony Scaramucci,        struck a more cautious tone. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d he said Mr. Trump \u201chasn\u2019t made the decision yet to sign that bill,\u201d but suggested he wasn\u2019t sure what would happen because it his \u201csecond or third day on the job.\u201d Mr. Scaramucci was named the White House\u2019s new communications director on Friday.The Trump team\u2019s messages have diverged at times, not just on the sanctions bill but also the president\u2019s inquiries about pardons and whether Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed by the Justice Department to handle the Russia probe, and his attorneys have conflicts of interest that would taint the investigation.In an interview following Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s CNN appearance, Ms. Sanders said there was no discrepancy between her comments and Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s. She said the administration supported the bill but wouldn\u2019t commit to signing it until a final version passes Congress. \u201cThere could still be more changes,\u201d she said.Congressional negotiators reached a deal late Friday to advance the bill, so such changes are unlikely.Mr. Trump has questioned the findings of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and Russia has denied the accusations. Investigators are also looking into any potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russians, and the president has said no such collusion occurred.In an interview last week, John Dowd, one of the main outside lawyers representing Mr. Trump in the Russia investigation, dismissed the notion that the Trump team would try to undermine Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation by highlighting alleged conflicts of interest, calling it \u201ccollateral nonsense.\u201dOn Sunday, Jay Sekulow, another member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Mr. Trump\u2019s attorneys are \u201calways looking at the issue of potential conflicts.\u201dMr. Sekulow also disputed a report that the president has been asking advisers about his authority to pardon former campaign officials, family members and himself.\u201cWe have not, and I continue to not, have conversations with the president of the United States regarding pardons,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cPardons have not been discussed, and pardons are not on the table.\u201dSpeaking around the same time on Fox News Sunday, Mr. Scaramucci said he had talked to the president in the White House about his power to pardon officials as it related to the Russia probe. \u201cI\u2019m in the Oval Office with the president last week, we\u2019re talking about that,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cHe brought that up\u201d while saying he doesn\u2019t need to be pardoned, Mr. Scaramucci said.\u201cThere\u2019s nobody around him that has to be pardoned,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci added. \u201cHe was just making the statement about the power of pardons. So now all of the speculation and all the spin and, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s going to pardon himself and do all this other nonsense.\u2019 The president does not need to pardon himself.\u201dMr. Trump tweeted about the Russia investigation Sunday afternoon, saying \u201cAs the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their president.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, will meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors. On Wednesday, Donald Trump Jr. and Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, are scheduled to meet privately with the Senate Judiciary Committee.The three men, part of the Trump campaign\u2019s inner circle, attended a meeting with Russians during the campaign. The person arranging the meeting told Mr. Trump Jr. that the Russians could provide negative information on Democrat       Hillary Clinton       as part of Moscow\u2019s effort to help Mr. Trump get elected.The White House says nothing of significance occurred at the meeting. \u201cIt was a nonevent,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said Sunday on CNN. \u201cIt had no impact on the campaign.\u201dThe House is slated to vote Tuesday on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to guidance released by House Majority Leader       Kevin McCarthy       (R., Calif.). The new Russian sanctions, which passed the Senate last month in a 98-2 vote, have been held up in the House over disputes about a provision that would have prevented the House minority from introducing legislation to block the president if he chose to remove the sanctions.On Sunday, Ms. Sanders said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that necessary changes had been made to the legislation.\u201cLook, the administration is supportive of being tough on Russia, particularly in putting these sanctions in place,\u201d she said. \u201cThe original piece of legislation was poorly written, but we were able to work with the House and Senate.\u2026And we support where the legislation is now.\u201dThe new deal is a compromise between Republican and Democratic leaders. It also makes some concessions to oil-and-gas companies. The compromise legislation, which must pass the House and Senate, would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities and limit Russian businesses in the energy and defense sectors from partnering with U.S. citizens. It also would require the president to seek Congress\u2019s permission to relax any sanctions against Russia.The European Union raised alarm over the sanctions deal, urging Congress to coordinate with its G-7 partners.

The bank saw strong growth in assets under management in the first six months of this year, which boosted fees and commissions at a time when revenue from trading fell almost a quarter versus the first half in 2016.This was due to a continuing lack of activity among clients, which has been apparent at rivals             Credit Suisse                   and UBS since last year, and reflects the wider malaise for financial trading in global markets beset by low volatility. That hit U.S. bank trading revenues, which were down overall in first-half results last week.At Julius Baer, the growth in assets came largely from Asia and the Middle East, where the Swiss bank focused a heavy round of hiring last year, expanding its total number of advisers by more than 160, or close to 14%.Such hires are meant to bring a large chunk of their clients (and their clients\u2019 assets) with them from former employers. This doesn\u2019t always happen, and those who fail to bring in new money over their first few years will be let go. This year, Julius Baer has been weeding out such underperforming advisers, which has led to a slight net reduction in numbers so far.The competition for good relationship managers is fierce, especially in Asia, where many banks are scrambling to up their game. This could make client assets more difficult or more costly to gather for all.Julius Baer has been well rewarded by investors for not being an investment bank and for the lower volatility of its results.

Pay your correct taxes. Your failure to do so will be your undoing and your eventual ruin,\u201d he said.Three-month nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange rose about 1.2% to $9,640 a ton in early European hours. Nickel is mainly used in the manufacture of stainless steel.The president\u2019s possible measures echo those of another large raw material exporter: Indonesia. In 2014, the government there sought to move Indonesia up the value chain by forcing mining companies to refine their products prior to export. The move kicked off a bitter battle with the industry, including big foreign players such as U.S. mining company             Freeport-McMoRan Inc.Earlier this year Indonesia relaxed the ban, allowing mining companies to export as long as they show progress toward building smelters in a five-year period. Many companies struggled to stump up the sizable investments necessary to invest in smelters, which can take years to build.The Philippine mining industry thought it had won a battle against Mr. Duterte\u2019s administration in May, when the president\u2019s nominated environment secretary,       Gina Lopez,        was rejected by a confirmation committee. Ms. Lopez put dozens of mines in the Philippines under review during her 10 months in office, threatening them with closure due to alleged violation of environmental regulations.Her defeat, after sustained lobbying from the mining industry that questioned her technical understanding, was seen by her supporters as a win for big business over the interests of consumers and the environment.Nickel prices surged last year at around the time Ms. Lopez took office. The Philippines also exports other metals such as copper and gold. The majority of the minerals it produces are exported unrefined.In his speech, Mr. Duterte also addressed his bloody antinarcotics campaign, a hallmark of his presidency that has put him under fire from human rights groups and foreign governments. Thousands of people have died in the year since he took office, most killed during drug bust operations by police or by suspected vigilantes.Mr. Duterte said he has resolved \u201cthat no matter how long it takes, the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in.\u201dWrite to Jake Maxwell Watts at jake.watts@wsj.com and Biman Mukherji at biman.mukherji@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Philippine Leader Threatens Nation\u2019s Mining Firms.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/philippines-duterte-threatens-mining-companies-to-behave-or-suffer-eventual-ruin-1500901914", "keywords": ["ban,copper,drugs,duterte,environment ,environmental regulations,exports, gold,human rights , miners,mining companies,nickel,nickel ore,nickel prices ,philippines president, raw materials, state of the nation address, tax,Rodrigo Duterte,regulation,government policy,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,economic news,political,general news,natural environment,environmental protection,politics,international relations,domestic politics,metal ore mining,copper ore,nickel ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 08:58:00", "news_title": "HNA Group Questions Bank of America\u2019s Stance on Working With the Company", "content": "Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. has told             Bank of America Corp.

Western Union\u2019s mobile app is already available around the clock in Australia for sending money using a credit card, but customers will now be able to set up a transaction using the app and then pay in cash at the gas stations.The Englewood, Colo., company is facing competition from financial-technology startups such as TransferWise, which are eating into its core business by making it easier for consumers to transfer money internationally using mobile phones or home computers.The service will be enabled in 302 BP stores\u2014150 with a stand-alone kiosk; in the rest customers will use the app\u2014as Western Union seeks to squeeze more growth out of its bricks-and-mortar retail network. The company says the kiosks are its first globally at gas stations, and if they are a hit, similar programs could be rolled out in other countries.With a population of 24 million, Australia is a small market for Western Union, but international companies frequently test services or products here for developed markets.The new service aims to increase convenience for customers who prefer to send money outside of normal business hours, said       Simon Millard,        Western Union\u2019s country director for Australia. Many of the company\u2019s retail agents in post offices, travel agencies or currency-exchanges outlets are closed at night and on weekends; many gas stations, by contrast, are open 24 hours a day. Potential customers being targeted include taxi and Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants and often send money to family overseas.Western Union has enhanced its retail presence elsewhere with kiosks at         Walgreens               stores in the U.S.,         WHSmith               bookstores in the U.K. and Franprix supermarkets in France. It has also explored ways to boost its online-transfer business by partnering with messaging apps Viber and         WeChat.Hikmet Ersek,        Western Union\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview in Sydney that a lot of growth will come from these digital offerings, which in the first quarter generated 26% more revenue than a year earlier but remain relatively small. Revenue from consumer-to-consumer transactions\u2014which make up 78% of the company\u2019s total\u2014were roughly flat in the first quarter.Another potential challenge for Western Union is the pending acquisition of rival MoneyGram International Inc. by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Ant Financial. The deal would create a bigger international competitor with a significant footprint in China and the U.S., but the purchase still awaits approval from U.S. regulators.Shares of Western Union\u2014which has a market cap of $9 billion\u2014have fallen more than 12% this year, even as the broader U.S. market recently hit record highs.

The catch also tends to come in smaller. That lowers prices and hurts profits for fisherman, pinching an industry that accounts for 15,000 jobs and an annual economic activity of $1.3 billion, according to the Louisiana Seafood Board.The dead zone is the result of runoff of fertilizers from farms up the Mississippi River combined with treated sewage from urban centers that is released into waterways. When those flows of nutrients reach the Gulf of Mexico, they stimulate the growth of algae, which sinks and decomposes in the ocean in a process that consumes oxygen.The resulting hypoxic, or low-oxygen, zone, which typically lasts through the fall, can kill stationary marine life like oysters and prompt mobile species like fish and shrimp to flee.A research team including the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium is setting out this week to conduct an annual study to measure the dead zone more precisely.In May, the U.S. Geological Survey recorded large flows of water and high levels of nutrients in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River system\u2014a gush equivalent to about 2,800 train cars of fertilizer pouring into the Gulf.As a result, the agency, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, predicted that this summer\u2019s dead zone would be the third-largest since monitoring began 32 years ago, an area roughly the size of New Jersey sitting off the coast of Texas and Louisiana.A study released in January that was funded by NOAA and led by Duke University found that the Gulf dead zone results in fishermen catching more small shrimp, making them cheaper, and fewer large ones. A reduction in the volume of more-prized large shrimp could lead to a net economic loss for fishermen, the study said.The area covered by recent dead zones was prime fishing ground in the 1960s, said Alan Lewitus, supervisory oceanographer at NOAA. As the use of fertilizer grew in subsequent decades, hypoxia occurred more frequently, he said.Since the mid-1990s, the size of the dead zone has fluctuated year to year. The largest was in 2002, when it measured 8,497 square miles\u2014about 300 miles greater than the size projected for this year\u2014according to data from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium and others.Gulf of Mexicodead zoneSelected yearsHow 2017 comparesDead zone area, square milesNew OrleansDetail2002: 8,4972017: 8,185*", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gulf-narrows-for-louisiana-shrimping-industry-1500897601", "keywords": ["National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,political,general news,natural environment"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 08:00:00", "news_title": "Underwater Lab Helps Fight Lake Erie Algae ", "content": "An underwater lab has joined the fight against toxic algal blooms in western Lake Erie, and scientists say the refrigerator-size capsule can help warn water-treatment-plant operators if a dangerous bloom drifts toward intake pipes.A key goal is to avoid a recurrence of the 2014 crisis when a cyanobacteria bloom shut down the drinking-water supply to more than 400,000 residents in the Toledo, Ohio, area for about two days.The $375,000 lab, sitting in 18 feet of water, tests water quality daily and emails results four hours later\u2014far faster than a ship-based system in which scientists take weekly samples and get results two days later.\u201cWe are going to be able to provide much better data faster and earlier,\u201d said National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration molecular ecologist Timothy Davis, who leads an algal bloom monitoring team.Scientists use satellites to spot blooms and models to forecast their path, but water testing is key because a bloom\u2019s size doesn\u2019t directly equate to its toxicity, said aquatic ecologist Tom Johengen, associate director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research.Similar devices operate off the U.S. East and West coasts to protect the shellfish industry.

The great       Michael Phelps       lost to a shark named Larry.When the Journal asked me to review Sunday night\u2019s televised, hugely-hyped \u201cPhelps vs. Shark\u201d race on the Discovery Channel, I hesitated. I\u2019m having a perfectly enjoyable summer chasing rich, toned seals off the Hamptons. Why should I get involved in this human nonsense?But then I watched it, and I thought: This is so dumb. Somebody\u2019s got to speak for the sharks here.And speak for Larry, too. The Discovery Channel narrator kept saying Phelps was racing a computer generated shark, but Discovery can bite me. I know Great Whites, and that was Larry. Good shark. Used to have a condo up this way. Low-key guy. Fast. Couple of kids, both grown-ups now. Divorced. Looks like he\u2019s lost a couple of pounds.Discovery also said they filmed it in South Africa. I know for a fact they did it off the coast of suburban Connecticut. Yes: we\u2019re everywhere this summer. Connecticut is delicious.Anyway, we\u2019re all proud of Larry here, but no shark is surprised that he beat Phelps by two seconds in a 100-meter race. Watch the tape again: Larry took it easy. He toyed with Phelps. He\u2019s always in control. He could have completely crushed the guy.But that wouldn\u2019t have been good for your silly little TV show, would it?So Larry slowed down and teased Phelps and made it a lot closer than it should have been. I wonder if Larry got paid. Did Discovery say the shark was \u201ccomputer generated\u201d in order to skip out on paying Larry? I\u2019m starting to get really steamed.To be clear: Nobody in the shark community has a problem with Michael Phelps. That dude can swim. He\u2019s old and fierce, and prefers water to land, what\u2019s not to like? He doesn\u2019t have to prove anything to sharks.Phelps had to know he would lose. I bet he got a sweet check from Discovery. Good for him. He should throw a little over to Larry.As a whole, the \u201cPhelps vs. Shark\u201d special pretty much drove me nuts. The marine biologist nerds kept criticizing sharks for not being able to swim in a straight line. What? We can totally swim in a straight line. We just choose not to. Those marine biologists better be careful, or one day I\u2019m going to swim in a straight line right up to their boat.Another thing that really annoyed me was how they kept rhapsodizing about Phelps\u2019s Olympic glory and how competitive the guy is.\u201cHe just loves to win,\u201d somebody said.Please. I\u2019m going to throw up. Humans always make everything about themselves. Sharks are competitive! Sharks also want to win. You think we watch \u201cJaws\u201d and root for       Richard Dreyfuss      ?And Discovery gave Phelps every conceivable advantage. They filmed it during the day. They let Phelps wear a wetsuit. He also got to put some kind of \u201cmonofin\u201d on his feet for propulsion. I\u2019m not so sure about that monofin. It looked like a pair of bike shoes attached to a spatula from             Williams-Sonoma.And Larry still kicked his behind.Phelps was respectful about the whole thing, saying he\u2019d always dreamed of swimming among the sharks. That was nice, but I kept waiting for the announcer to go to Larry for his post-race interview, and they never did. What the heck, Discovery?It\u2019s demoralizing. First \u201cSharknado\u201d and now this. Sharks are always stereotyped as villains, or toothy extras. Where\u2019s our Shark \u201cLa-La Land\u201d or Shark \u201cMad Men?\u201d We can do prestige stuffI\u2019ve spent the morning listening to Shark Sports Radio, and \u201cPhelps vs. Shark\u201d is all anyone is talking about. Well, that and Kyrie Irving. What is Kyrie Irving thinking? He wants to leave LeBron? Humans are crazy, I\u2019m telling you.I know humans are irritated about \u201cPhelps vs. Shark,\u201d calling it a cheesy publicity stunt, but you suckers got what you deserved.You never had a shot.

It\u2019s tech earnings week. Google-owner Alphabet kicks us off later today, where we may find out whether YouTube\u2019s brand safety snafu had any real impact on its financials. Facebook is reporting Wednesday. Then look out for Amazon (analysts: please ask about its budding advertising unit on the earnings call), Verizon and Twitter on Thursday.A landmark trial that starts today in Brooklyn federal court is thought to be the first ever click fraud case in the U.S. to go to trial, The Wall Street Journal reports. Prosecutors are accusing Fabio Gasperini, a 34-year-old Italian information technology professional who was extradited from Amsterdam last year, of being the criminal mastermind behind a global network of computer servers infected with malicious software, known as a botnet. The indictment claims Mr. Gasperini installed scripts that caused the servers to imitate humans by automatically \u201cclicking\u201d on website ads, earning him money for fake clicks.--Why this is one to watch--One of the reasons click fraud has become such a massive global issue is that it\u2019s very hard to identify the perpetrators -- indeed, defense lawyers for Mr. Gasperini (who pleaded not guilty to five charges) have argued \u201canyone can open an email account with any name.\u201d This could be a test case of whether U.S. laws have kept pace with cybercriminals because the statute used to charge Mr. Gasperini hasn\u2019t been amended since 2008. Another reason this case is worth keeping an eye on: the testimony could include some major U.S. advertisers. In a court filing last week, the defense asked the judge to stop jurors from hearing any evidence related to approximately two dozen companies, including Disney, P&G and Nike. If convicted on all counts, Mr. Gasperini could face up to 70 years in prison.Vice Media is laying off around 2%, or 60, of its 3,000 staffers, Variety first reported. In an all-too-familiar \u201cstate of digital media in 2017\u201d story, Vice is cutting down some traditional roles in both sales and editorial, while expanding its video operations, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The job cuts come only a month after TPG invested $450 million, in part to further Vice\u2019s investment in scripted programming. As with other similar moves in this space, the decision appears to be one of advertising economics. Media companies can charge higher ad rates for video and can make more money from licensing their original content to TV or streaming companies than they often can from text-based journalism. Not everyone is impressed. One Twitter user wrote: \u201cQuit doing this. No one wants video. We all read faster than people talk, it eats up data, and you can\u2019t watch video on the toilet at work.\u201d That objection earned more than 7,000 retweets and almost 25,000 likes (it\u2019s worth reading the entire thread for both sides of the debate).The New York Times profiled Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes as he prepares to exit the company after its $85 billion acquisition by AT&T. Highlights from the piece include Mr. Bewkes saying he doesn\u2019t believe the speculation that the White House will interfere with the takeover, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeat attacks on Time Warner\u2019s CNN. \u201cI think statements out of high political office ought to be considered statements,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. Regrets? He has a few. Mr. Bewkes acknowledged Time Warner\u2019s $850 million acquisition of social networking site Bebo was a bad idea (although it would have been difficult to argue otherwise). He wishes Time Warner had bought Netflix in the early years and taken full control of Comedy Central when it had the opportunity. And poor Mr. Bewkes says he still gets around 10 calls a day from people complaining about Time Warner Cable, even though that unit was spun off back in 2009 and is now a part of Charter Communications.More M&A! Private-equity firm KKR has agreed to pay approximately $2.8 billion to acquire WebMD, the U.S. media company that owns the site of the same name that millions of people around the world visit to check their health symptoms and make sure they\u2019re not dying. The deal combines WebMD\u2019s suite of brands with those of another KKR company, Internet Brands, which owns health-related media sites including FitDay.com and DentalPlans.com. WebMD, which also owns medical news site MedScape.com, put itself up for sale earlier this year, having seen a slowdown in advertising revenue from pharmaceutical companies. According to recent chatter around this year\u2019s upfronts, it appears those marketers may be redirecting their money back to TV.

That\u2019s one of the largest totals for insurance-tech on record, and more than double the total raised by such startups in the same period a year ago.Startups are focusing on a chance to improve the consumer experience along with other aspects of insurance using technology, investors say.Large rounds dominated the deal activity in the quarter, with two health-insurance companies getting the bulk of the money.\u201cYou are kind of seeing a natural maturation,\u201d said Patricia Kemp, general partner at Oak HC/FT, which counts insurance startups Trov and Insureon in its portfolio. \u201cThe focus is on the startups that were funded two or so years ago and seeing those grow.\u201dIn the second quarter, Clover Health raised a $130 million round and Bright Health closed on $160 million. In both cases, investors ignored the turbulence surrounding health-care federal legislation and backed the companies.\u201cUltimately, our investment is predicated on the Medicare Advantage market,\u201d said       Ian Sigalow,        partner at Greycroft Partners, an investor in Bright Health\u2019s recent round. And Medicare \u201cis not changing from a regulatory standpoint,\u201d he added.For all the investment that has gone into the sector, even the more mature private companies haven\u2019t proven that their businesses are sustainable, whether on the cost side, or in terms of customer acquisition and retention, several VCs said.It remains \u201can open question\u201d whether consumers would buy directly from startup insurers, for example, or will need intermediaries and agents, as has been the traditional way to sell insurance, said       Hans Morris,        managing partner at Nyca Partners. In June Nyca backed Covr Financial Technologies, which sells insurance through banks or brokerage partners.Funding levels are staying strong because many insurance startups require a lot of money to get going. Lemonade Insurance Co., for example, which provides homeowners and renters insurance, is an insurance carrier, not a broker. That means that it needs to set aside capital in reserve to comply with industry regulations.             Allianz SE                   said that it backed Lemonade in April.Strategic investors are playing a big role in the sector overall. Munich Re AG, for example, led a $45 million round in Trov.Seed activity in insurance has slowed, meanwhile, said Sheel Mohnot, a partner at 500 Startups\u2019 fintech fund. He said that\u2019s partly because most types of insurance, from life to homeowner plans, already are stacked with several competing startups.That doesn\u2019t mean that early-stage activity is nil. The 500 Startups fintech fund recently invested in a seed round for homeowners\u2019 insurance provider Kin Insurance.Even as existing insurance startups continue challenging the industry, some investors are moving away from backing startups that try to find and retain consumers online. Oak HC/FT, for example, sees opportunity in startups that are helping existing insurance companies use technology for better customer onboarding, account management, claims processing and other internal functions, Ms. Kemp said.Write to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-tech-startup-dollars-leap-1500895813", "keywords": ["fintech,insuretech,insurtech,Clover Health Investments,Bright Health,analyses,commentaries,opinions,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading industry news,suggested reading \u2013 insurance,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,alternative investments,financial services,financial technology,investing,securities,technology,venture capital"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 07:30:00", "news_title": "Digital Health Startup Hinge Targets Back Pain", "content": "Hinge Health Inc. has raised $8 million in a fresh venture round for the provider of a digital health platform that guides people in nonsurgical tactics to resolve joint and bone pain.The Series A was led by London-based venture f\\irm Atomico.

He also displayed his mastery of a centuries-old text that combines the tedium of legal fine print with the complexity of the federal tax code: The Rules of Golf.The pivotal sequence of the final round\u2014how Spieth recovered from a horrendous tee shot on the 13th hole at Royal Birkdale\u2014wasn\u2019t merely an exercise in shot-making under duress. It was also a test of Spieth\u2019s ability to consider a multitude of options under the rules and determine which ones would give him the best odds of mitigating the damage to his score.The process took more than 20 minutes, sent hordes of spectators and cameramen scrambling to keep up, required the help of rules officials and marshals and included the surreal sight of Spieth navigating his way around equipment trucks. It also proved to be a defining moment in Spieth\u2019s career, which is on a trajectory to put him among the game\u2019s all-time greats.Here are the key questions Spieth had to work out in real time as he teetered on the brink of collapse:1. Could he play the ball as it lay?It\u2019s hard to overstate just how bad Spieth\u2019s tee shot was. The ball appeared to veer around 100 yards right of the fairway, ricocheted off a spectator\u2019s head and landed on the upslope of a massive sand dune. It would have been highly difficult for Spieth to make strong contact with the ball as it lay\u2014mired in thick, tall grass. And with so much rough to clear to get back to the fairway, he needed the ball to carry a long way.To the rescue: the unplayable lie rule, which allows players to declare a ball unplayable and, with a one-stroke penalty, drop it in another spot no closer to the hole. But where?2. What could he do with an unplayable lie?The rule gives players three options. The simplest, and the one most other players likely would have chosen here, is to play the ball from its previous location, which in this case would have been the tee box. Another would have been to drop the ball within two club lengths of its lie, which in this case was no option at all, since Spieth was surrounded by treacherous rough.The third option allows players to take the ball back as far as they want on a straight line running from the flagstick through the original lie. This didn\u2019t look immediately appealing, since there was thick stuff in every direction. But as Spieth looked further down the hill, past a walkway and over a gate, he spotted an oasis of pristine, short grass, someplace he had hit from just a few hours earlier.It was the driving range.3. Where to drop the ball?Once Spieth confirmed with a rules official that the range was in bounds, his decision was made. But there was another issue. His line from the range was blocked by a row of equipment trucks, which all the major club makers send to tournaments to tweak or replace players\u2019 clubs as needed.As Spieth was keenly aware, there is a rule for that, too. The trucks fell under a category known as temporary immovable obstructions. That entitled Spieth to take relief by dropping his ball no closer to the hole, between one and two club lengths from the point at which his line is no longer obstructed\u2014in this case, just right of the back of the Titleist truck.Got all that? Good, because Spieth wasn\u2019t done calculating yet.4. Where to aim?When he finally took a drop, it was hard to tell with much precision how far Spieth was from the hole. The yardage books caddies use don\u2019t cover such far-flung spots. Spieth took out two clubs to choose from, a 3-iron and a 3-wood, figuring he could get the ball \u201csomewhere near the green,\u201d he said. But where was that, exactly? Spieth couldn\u2019t see it over the dune, and the whole process had been somewhat disorienting.He sent his caddie, Michael Greller, scampering up the hill with Spieth\u2019s bag on his back to estimate how far from the front of the green he was.For a minute, the two of them shouted back and forth.\u201cTry to give me a round number,\u201d Spieth said. Greller looked at his yardage book. \u201cMichael!\u201d Spieth yelled. \u201cNumber?\u201dGreller gave Spieth his best estimate, 230 yards, and recommended the 3-iron. But before the recovery shot that sparked Spieth\u2019s dramatic win\u2014landing just off the green en route to a bogey\u2014there was one more rules issue he encountered.As Greller stood on top of the hill, on or close to Spieth\u2019s line, he became a human alignment aid. That\u2019s fine to help a player line up a shot beforehand. But had Greller remained in place when Spieth swung the club, Spieth would have been subject to a two-stroke penalty.Just before the shot, Spieth shouted, \u201cYou cannot stand there, Mike,\u201d one more rule he was glad he knew.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'How an Obscure Rule Lifted Spieth.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jordan-spieth-saved-the-open-by-mastering-an-obscure-golf-rule-1500895611", "keywords": ["british open,claret jug,golf,jordan spieth,royal birkdale,spieth,spieth 13th hole,the open championship,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 06:54:00", "news_title": "Ryanair Profit Soared 55% in Latest Quarter, Topping Expectations", "content": "LONDON\u2014            Ryanair Holdings                   PLC Monday said net profit rose 55% in its fiscal first quarter, bolstered by strong ticket prices, but warned that overcapacity will continue to pressure fares.Ryanair said April-June profit reached \u20ac397 million ($463 million), up from a year-earlier \u20ac256 million, beating expectations. Sales rose 13% to \u20ac1.91 billion.Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, said average ticket prices were up 1%, aided by strong bookings during the Easter-vacation period, which last year didn\u2019t fall in the first quarter. With packed planes, Ryanair raised to 131 million from 130 million its projection for passengers it will carry for the full year.Even so, the airline stuck to its outlook that ticket prices in the first half, including the busy July-September travel period, could fall on average 5%, and be down 8% in the October-March period.Ryanair\u2019s outlook echoes rivals\u2019.

But both carriers cautioned that fares would remain under pressure giving continued growth in seats for sale.\u201cWe expect the pricing environment to remain very competitive,\u201d said Ryanair Chief Executive Officer       Michael O\u2019Leary.The three carriers are among the principal drivers of capacity growth in Europe; they all have big orders placed for new planes from either             Boeing Co.       or             Airbus SE.       Ryanair said it recently extended 10 plane leases to boost seats for sale this summer and next before it takes delivery of new Boeing 737 Max 200 planes. At last month\u2019s Paris Air Show it ordered 10 more of the new planes for delivery in 2019 and 2020, raising its order book for the model to 110 aircraft.After a strong run for airline stocks, concern about overcapacity and yield decline spooked investors last week. Shares in big-name European airlines such as Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM SA retreated around 10%. Ryanair shares fell 2.4% last week, though they remain up more than 24% for the year.Ryanair said it had taken advantage of recent weakness in oil prices to lock in more of its costs for next year, which will allow it to discount ticket prices to attract passengers.The discount carrier stuck to its guidance for the year ended March 31, forecasting a profit of \u20ac1.4 billion to \u20ac1.45 billion\u2014up from \u20ac1.24 billion last year\u2014with nonfuel unit costs set to fall 1%.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ryanair-profit-soared-55-rise-in-latest-quarter-topping-expectations-1500872411", "keywords": ["airline earnings,airline overcapacity,airlines,budget airlines,budget carriers,easyJet,EZJ.LN,UK:EZJ,Wizz Air Holdings,WIZZ.LN,UK:WIZZ,Ryanair Holdings,RYAAY,RYA.ln,financial performance,earnings,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,scheduled passenger airlines,air transport,low cost airlines,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 06:53:00", "news_title": "The 10-Point.", "content": "Good morning,Jared Kushner,        President       Donald Trump\u2019s       son-in-law and a senior adviser, released a lengthy account on Monday morning of his contacts with Russian officials.

He insists there was no collusion between him and Russian officials about the presidential election and he says the four contacts\u2014including one newly revealed instance, a brief encounter with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at a hotel event where Mr. Kushner also met several emissaries of other countries\u2014weren\u2019t improper.

But aspects of the Dodd-Frank law signed in 2010 by President Obama, along with changes in the economics of the banking industry, have already resulted in tighter controls. Last week, regulators including the SEC dropped efforts to craft tougher pay provisions. In theory, a regulatory pullback now could prompt banks to resume some precrisis practices, such as cash bonuses that are free from multiyear vesting periods. But big banks have already moved to rein in pay, as they face pressure by shareholders seeking higher dividends and bigger stock buybacks and face tougher capital requirements.The legal front widening against makers of opioid painkillers has something in common with landmark tobacco litigation of the 1990s: attorney       Mike Moore.

But in the worst-offending sectors, including global trade flashpoints like steel, aluminum and petrochemicals, the picture is brightening at last. That could help put a floor under commodity prices, even if Chinese overcapacity is far from cured.The recent improvement partly stems from an uptick in construction at home taking in more steel and cement. But there is also evidence that China\u2019s endless campaigns against dirty steel and aluminum plants have been working, slowing the country\u2019s reckless overinvestment.One way to tell things are different is that gross profit margins for producers of metals like aluminum and copper are no longer declining. Those margins had halved between 2011 and mid-2015 to just 6%, dragging that of global competitors down with them.At that point, though, investment in areas like metals smelting, cement and chemicals turned negative and hasn\u2019t recovered since. Beijing appears to have realized that allowing China\u2019s army of small producers to keep spewing dust and chemicals into the faces of unhappy middle-class citizens, while simultaneously crushing margins at key state-owned companies, was no longer viable.With investment in superfluous capacity stalling, the decline in margins in the coal and steel sectors appears to have bottomed out. Aluminum is now in the crosshairs: an April directive to shut illegal smelters by this fall could cut capacity equal to 9% of China\u2019s total 2017 output, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Such trends should give investors confidence that, for example, the 10% rally in aluminum prices this year is sustainable. The remaining worry is that longstanding distortions in China\u2019s financial sector will keep money flowing to places it doesn\u2019t belong\u2014signs of increasing overinvestment in the oil-refining sector is one example.It is too soon to declare the war against Chinese industrial overcapacity is over.

It\u2019s a seemingly modest action that marks a big step in warehouse automation, and WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Brian Baskin writes the advance is part of the work that retailers and logistics companies are counting on to keep pace with the explosive growth in online sales. The e-commerce surge has raised the role that backroom handling plays in the sales supply chain, and pushed warehouse operators to fine-tune operations that have long been geared toward handling industrial-scale materials while human workers took over for the \u201cpicking\u201d of individual items to fulfill orders. With companies under pressure to deliver online orders faster, warehouse bottlenecks have become the focus of more research.

The competitors aren\u2019t gathering up stock warrants simply because they want add to their investment portfolios: both are using the stakes to ensure they have a seat at the table as new technology is developed for a critical physical piece of their supply-chain-operations. Wal-Mart is already Plug Power\u2019s biggest customer, providing a full third of the company\u2019s revenue. By investing in Plug Power, both Wal-Mart and Amazon also are signaling they want to maintain their prominent places on the company\u2019s customer list.The heat from wildfires in Canada is reaching home construction sites in the U.S.. Blazes that have been spreading across British Columbia have left many U.S. lumber wholesalers short-handed and prices for the building material soaring, the WSJ\u2019s Benjamin Parkin and David George-Cosh report. It\u2019s the latest example of extreme events rattling supply chains tied together by producers, traders, wholesalers and end users, and the disruption in cross-border lumber flows comes at a particularly sensitive time. Lumber dealers ran down their inventories this year as a trade spat between the Trump administration and Canada officials sparked wild price swings. Now, Western Canada\u2019s worst wildfires in more than a decade have left U.S. home builders facing escalating higher costs on top of higher U.S. tariffs on timber imports.

Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. is jumping into the competition with a new development division aimed at pushing forward the company\u2019s own software and hardware, the WSJ\u2019s Greg Bensinger reports. The move marks a broadside at Lyft\u2019s competitor Uber Technologies Inc. as that company stumbles through a tough corporate period, but it also adds big new wrinkles to developing autonomous-vehicle supply chains. Lyft has favored partnerships with developers including             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Waymo, NuTonomy Inc.,             General Motors Co.       and others. Lyft insists its own efforts to develop driverless cars won\u2019t conflict with those partnerships. But the move indicates Lyft is hedging its bets as an increasing array of tech companies and auto makers jockey for position as the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. automotive industry evolves. And it suggests that more companies now teaming up in development may split apart as the technology nears the streets.\u2018This thing could run 24 hours a day.

Speaking Thursday, ECB President       Mario Draghi       said the currency area is \u201cfinally experiencing a robust recovery.\u201dHowever, a survey of purchasing managers at 5,000 manufacturers and service providers across the currency area suggests the recovery may already have peaked.Data firm             IHS Markit                   on Monday said its composite Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone fell to 55.8 in July from 56.3 in June. That was below the 56.2 reading expected by economists who were surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week, and a six-month low. A reading above 50.0 signals an increase in activity, while a reading below signals a decline.The decline in the composite PMI follows the release of a survey by the European Commission Thursday that showed consumer confidence weakened in July for the first month since February.The decline in the PMI is unlikely to signal the start of a sharp slowdown, since the surveys found that new orders remain strong and businesses are continuing to hire. But it does suggest growth may moderate, while remaining above the rates that were typical of the four-year recovery until the start of this year.One potential drag on growth over the second half of the year is the euro, which has gained over the weeks since Mr. Draghi hinted in a June speech that the ECB may soon consider a reduction in its bond purchases, a stimulus program known as quantitative easing.The survey of purchasing managers recorded few signs of unease over the currency\u2019s gains, and instead found that the growth of export orders had remained \u201crobust.\u201dThere are also some reasons to expect growth may speed up again as the year progresses, with German elections due in September marking an end for this year at least to a busy schedule of votes that confronted businesses with high levels of uncertainty about the outlook for economic policy.\u201cNear term, there is the possibility of even stronger growth in continental Europe, as political risks have diminished,\u201d said       Maurice Obstfeld,        the IMF\u2019s chief economist.The survey of purchasing managers also indicated that inflationary pressures remain weak, as businesses raised their prices at the slowest pace since January. Speaking Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the central bank would be motivated by the desire to reach its inflation target, rather than settle for stronger growth and lower unemployment without meeting that goal.\u201cThe slowing pace of economic growth signaled by the surveys and the accompanying easing of price pressures adds to the belief that ECB policy makers will be in no rush to taper policy, and will leave options open until the central bank sees a clearer picture of the sustainability of the upturn,\u201d said       Chris Williamson,        chief economist at IHS Markit.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-economy-slows-in-july-survey-shows-1500886280", "keywords": ["ecb bond buying, ecb qe, ecb stimulus,ecb tapering,eurozone growth,European Central Bank,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,industrial production,euro zone,currency,economic news,purchasing managers index,surveys,polls"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 05:30:00", "news_title": "Expedia, Priceline Home In on Airbnb\u2019s Turf", "content": "Big travel portals             Expedia Inc.        EXPE 1.53%       and             Priceline Group Inc.        PCLN 0.81%       are racing to catch up to Airbnb Inc. as the vacation-rental market explodes in popularity.Expedia and Priceline, which have dominated hotel bookings for two decades, are now betting big on the rental sector by boosting their inventory of home-rental options that can be booked similarly to a hotel, with just a few clicks.The home-rental market is about one-fifth the size of the hotel market based on revenue in the U.S., but it has been growing faster than hotels since 2015, according to data from travel industry-research group Phocuswright. Revenue in the U.S. private accommodation market\u2014which includes vacation rentals, homes or rooms rented out on a short-term basis\u2014grew 11% last year from the year earlier, and is projected to grow 8% this year to more than $34 billion. The U.S. hotel industry grew 5% last year to $151 billion and is projected to do the same this year, according to the data.As the vacation-rental sector has expanded, online intermediaries such as Airbnb, Priceline, Expedia and TripAdvisor have grabbed larger shares of the listings.Airbnb remains the leader, particularly for rentals in urban locations, with an estimated 15% of global room nights in private accommodations last year, compared with 12% for Expedia and 9% for Priceline, according to Susquehanna International Group. But Priceline Group and Expedia are increasingly displaying vacation rental properties alongside hotel rooms on their sites. Executives said the goal is to provide travelers with the most comprehensive listings for any destination.\u201cWe think vacation rentals are at the very early stages of being wired up on a global basis,\u201d said Expedia Chief Executive       Dara Khosrowshahi.       \u201cTo the extent that you as an e-commerce player can wire up these fragmented marketplaces, you can add significant value to both the supplier and also to consumers.\u201dExpedia\u2019s 2015 purchase of vacation rental site HomeAway Inc. has given the company about 1.4 million online bookable listings that it is beginning to roll out on sites such as Expedia.com and Hotels.com. HomeAway saw a 48% increase in online vacation rental bookings in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, to nearly $2.7 billion.Priceline Group\u2019s Booking.com has expanded its vacation rental inventory by 50% to 613,000 properties and 2.5 million listings over the past year, according to its most recent filing. Booking.com, a dominant player in Europe, has seen its inventory of vacation rentals grow at more than twice the rate of other properties, including hotels, over the past year.\u201cFor a very, very long time people have wanted to have this type of product,\u201d said Priceline Group CEO       Glenn Fogel.       \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that people have changed. I believe technology has enabled this type of rental property to be so much easier for people to find.\u201dAn Airbnb spokesman distinguished the company\u2019s platform from others, saying a vast majority of listings on the site can only be found there.\u201cUnlike the more conventional places to stay offered by others, Airbnb offers the unique accommodations and experiences travelers want,\u201d said spokesman Nick Papas.There are growing pains as the vacation-rental sector increases in size and sophistication. Perhaps most important, a home is a very different kind of asset than a hotel.Hotels vary widely in amenities, but most customers know what to expect.Homes, however, come in all shapes and sizes, making direct comparisons trickier. There is no 24-hour front desk attendant on hand, and owners often have extensive lists of special instructions about properties.As online travel sites seek to transform vacation rentals into a hotel-like commodity, owners increasingly are handing over control of their businesses in exchange for the online exposure.Brian Harris of Harris Properties Management Inc., which manages about 90 vacation rental properties along the Alabama Gulf Coast, has listed on home rental site VRBO (now owned by HomeAway and Expedia) since the mid-2000s. The business model has shifted from a listings site, where property owners pay an annual fee to advertise, into a booking platform where travelers pay a fee to book on the site.Mr. Harris said he feels increasingly distanced from his customers. Rather than listing a phone number to contact owners with questions before booking, HomeAway recently started listing the number for a company call center.The switch has presented challenges. Mr. Harris said a recent guest was trying to book a home near family in Gulf Shores, Ala., and was told by a customer service agent that the listing was close by. It turned out to be 20 miles away, and the customer was upset, Mr. Harris said.\u201cOne of the main advantages we\u2019ve got is this staff that\u2019s knowledgeable about the properties,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more about VRBO and HomeAway keeping that guest in their pipeline and getting the guest fee, rather than what the guest wants.\u201dHomeAway President John Kim said the goal is to prevent fraud and give guests a consistent customer-service experience.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of consumers who get lost in the conversation\u201d if emails are coming from a property manager they don\u2019t recognize, he said. The company said the guest can still contact an owner directly after the property is booked, and can communicate through a secure messaging system before booking.Another challenge is the move toward home rentals that can be booked instantly, which bypasses the typical approval process between owner and guest. Booking.com\u2019s vacation rental inventory is all instantly bookable.Airbnb has more than doubled its instantly bookable properties over the past year while HomeAway has increased them more than fourfold, according to lodging search website AllTheRooms.com.Write to Chris Kirkham at chris.kirkham@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Travel Giants Trek Onto Airbnb\u2019s Turf.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/expedia-priceline-home-in-on-airbnbs-turf-1500888600", "keywords": ["airbnb,hotels,vacation rentals,vc industry news,Airbnb,Expedia,EXPE,Priceline,PCLN,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,etailing,restaurants,lodgings,online tourism reservation services,travel agencies,e-commerce,online service providers,leisure,arts,hospitality,technology,sharing economy services,tourism"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 05:30:00", "news_title": "Governance Woes Plague Europe\u2019s Banks", "content": "Corporate governance shortcomings are common in Europe\u2019s banks, experts say.For example, when two Italian banks decided to merge last year, the lenders wanted to cut the newly combined board to 24 members from 47. After a monthslong battle between the European Central Bank and the two lenders, the ECB forced the banks to cut the total number of directors down to 19.Peter Nathanial,        co-director of a program on banking governance at Europe\u2019s INSEAD business school, said while there is no rule, boards should typically have between eight and 15 directors, depending on the complexity of the business.At unlisted Italian lenders Banca Popolare di Vicenza SpA and Veneto Banca SpA, which had been liquidated by the government on June 25, boards of both banks had assigned prices to their shares that analysts and other bankers considered generous.While the practice was legal, analysts said the assigned share prices were unrealistic. Executives and board members at the banks had previously said shareholders had signed off on the assigned prices.And in Germany, state lender HSH Nordbank is looking to find a buyer or could face liquidation after suffering massive losses on souring shipping loans.Those loans were given out for years under the supervision of politicians and shipping magnates who sat on the bank\u2019s supervisory board and encouraged it to become the world\u2019s biggest shipping lender.Experts say the setup created a conflict of interest and exposed the lender to too much risk in one sector.A HSH Nordbank spokesman declined to comment.Write to Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com and Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Problems at Banks Prevalent in Europe.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/governance-woes-plague-europes-banks-1500888621", "keywords": ["banca popolare di vicenza,banco popular,banco santander,banking,ecb,european central bank,european markets,europe markets,governance,hsh nordbank,veneto banca,Banca Popolare di Vicenza,INSEAD,economic news,commercial banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 05:30:00", "news_title": "Board Practices Hurt Banco Popular, Experts Say ", "content": "When Europe\u2019s central bank orchestrated an overnight rescue of Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol SA in June, the immediate spark was a bank run that left the Spanish lender close to collapse.But Banco Popular\u2019s problems ran deeper, touching an area that has been devilishly difficult for European regulators to address: poor governance.The bank\u2019s problems, governance experts say, included board members who weren\u2019t independent enough from management and deals with companies that had ties to the board.Corporate governance shortcomings are more common in European banks compared with the U.S., experts say. Some attribute the difference to a fragmented continent where countries\u2019 capital markets are in varied stages of development and have different rules and regulations.\u201cIn Europe, you have 28 different banking systems, which were created nationally under different mandates,\u201d said       Tom Kirchmaier,        deputy director of corporate governance at the London School of Economics.Since the European Central Bank assumed supervision of major eurozone banks in November 2014, it has stepped up the focus on corporate governance, pressing lenders, for instance, to ensure boards include a sufficient number of independent directors. Since then, the ECB conducted 94 on-site visits to examine governance issues, the second-highest number of inspections after loan risk.When the ECB began to regulate Banco Popular, Spain\u2019s No. 6 lender by assets, it inherited a bank that analysts say was riddled with governance problems.In its 2016 annual report, the bank said seven of 15 board members were independent. However, four had longstanding links to Banco Popular, ties that governance experts say undermined their ability to challenge executives\u2019 decisions.One had served as finance director and chief executive at the bank immediately before becoming a board member. Governance experts say there should be at least a few-years\u2019 \u201ccooling off\u201d period for a director in that situation to be considered independent.Another member sat on the board for nearly 10 years, a duration governance experts consider too long to be deemed independent.A third filled in for her father when he stepped down from the board after serving for more than two decades.A fourth previously had been a nonindependent director representing an investor who remained a significant shareholder.A Banco Popular spokeswoman said Spain\u2019s securities regulator reviewed and had no objection to the bank\u2019s designation of the board members as independent. A board member can be considered independent for up to 12 years under Spanish law, she noted.Analysts say that coziness between the board and management contributed to the board\u2019s slowness to remove \u00c1ngel Ron as executive chairman, despite investor concern the bank wasn\u2019t doing enough to shed roughly \u20ac37 billion in sour loans. Mr. Ron was replaced in December after 12 years at the helm and more than a 90% drop in the bank\u2019s share price.The bank spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Ron\u2019s departure.Mr. Ron has said the liquidity problems that ultimately triggered Banco Popular\u2019s takeover began after he stepped down, according to people familiar with his reasoning.\u201cTruly independent board members are key to avoid conflicts of interest that end up impacting stakeholders,\u201d said       Carlos Garc\u00eda,        an analyst with financial services firm Kepler Cheuvreux SA. \u201dPopular is an example of why governance matters.\u201dAnother issue for Banco Popular was its relationships with firms that had representation on its board.For example, on June 2 French lender Banque F\u00e9d\u00e9rative du Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel SA, which had one seat on the board, nearly doubled to 100% its stake in a retail bank it managed with Banco Popular. The same day, the French lender\u2019s representative stepped down from the board of the bank. Five days later, Banco Popular was rescued and sold to Spain\u2019s             Banco Santander SA       for a token \u20ac1.Mr. Kirchmaier said unless the purchase of the stake was ordered by regulators amid the resolution process\u2014which remains unclear\u2014the move raises questions about whether Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel used information garnered in its board capacity to do the deal.Representatives for Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel declined to comment.A spokesman for Spain\u2019s market regulator said the ties between Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel and Banco Popular were disclosed and detailed to investors in the bank\u2019s annual reports.A Banco Popular spokeswoman declined to comment on corporate governance issues. The ECB declined to comment on specific cases.Banco Popular\u2019s board members also approved deals that made it appear the bank was on sounder financial footing than it was, according to analysts.In mid-2014, as Banco Popular was struggling to recover from Spain\u2019s financial crisis, the bank sold the rights to the future profits generated by some of its insurance and pension products. The buyer was a newly created firm managed by a sole administrator who was also an employee of Banco Popular, according to the bank\u2019s 2014 and 2015 annual reports.Banco Popular booked a \u20ac97 million profit from the sale.The bank had also financed 48% of the deal, according to its annual reports. That means Banco Popular was financing its own profits.That approach can mask the true value of a transaction and is often done when a company is in financial trouble, said       James Shein,        a professor and corporate governance expert at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\u201cAlmost 100% of time there are bank failures, first there was a governance problem,\u201d Mr. Shein said.Banco Popular said in its annual reports that the deal was done at arm\u2019s length and evaluated by an independent expert.The bank\u2019s spokeswoman declined to comment.\u2014Giovanni Legorano in Rome contributed to this article.Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com and Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.comAppeared in the July 25, 2017, print edition as 'Lax Governance Cited in Spanish Bank\u2019s Collapse Board\u2019s Lax Governance Cited in Bank\u2019s Collapse.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/board-practices-hurt-banco-popular-experts-say-1500888617", "keywords": ["banco popular,banco santander,banking,banking practices,corporate covernance,corporate structures,european central bank,european markets,europe markets,governance,spain,Banco Popular Espa\u00f1ol,European Central Bank,London School of Economics,James Shein,Tom Kirchmaier,\u00c1ngel Ron,central banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-24 04:19:00", "news_title": "Apple Supplier Foxconn Looks at Producing Display Panels in Wisconsin", "content": "Taiwan\u2019s             Foxconn Technology        2354 0.88%       Group, which assembles             Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPhones, is nearing a decision to invest in Wisconsin and could hold an event in Washington, D.C., as soon as this week to discuss U.S. investment plans, people familiar with the matter said.In Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking at producing display panels that can be used in large-screen television sets, three people briefed on the plans said.The investment, if confirmed, would be the latest by Asian manufacturers in the U.S. as President       Donald Trump       seeks to revive manufacturing there.Foxconn, formally known as             Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.        2317 2.16%      , has said publicly that it is looking at seven states in the U.S., where it would invest a total of $10 billion or more\u00a0to manufacture flat-panel screens and related equipment. In June, a company executive identified the seven as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.In addition to Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking in the Detroit area for a possible plant, two people familiar with the plans said. It wasn\u2019t clear what that plant would make.The people cautioned that a final decision hasn\u2019t been set and that Foxconn could make last-minute changes. They said Foxconn was contemplating events in Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin to discuss its plans.In an emailed statement, Foxconn said it was reviewing \u201cpotential locations for establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S.\u201d but declined to name them.In June, Foxconn Chief Executive       Terry Gou       said his company would work with             Sharp Corp.      , a Japanese electronics maker in which Foxconn acquired a controlling stake last year, to develop U.S. manufacturing plans. A Sharp spokeswoman declined to comment.Mr. Gou has been meeting U.S. political leaders to discuss possible sites, people familiar with the talks said. House Speaker       Paul Ryan,        a Republican who represents a district in southeastern Wisconsin, said earlier this month that he has met Foxconn officials.Foxconn is the world\u2019s largest electronics contract manufacturer, assembling iPhones, videogame machines and other products. Its factories are mostly in China, and previous discussions to expand manufacturing to the U.S. haven\u2019t materialized.In 2013, Foxconn said it might invest $40 million in Pennsylvania for manufacturing and research facilities. In 2014, Mr. Gou said he was studying the feasibility of an advanced-display manufacturing plant in the U.S., because it was expensive to ship large-screen TV sets from Asia. Neither idea made headway.Foxconn is building an $8.8 billion flat-panel factory in southern China\u2019s Guangzhou province, where the company will build advanced liquid-crystal displays with technology from Sharp.Sharp\u2019s display panels are used in a wide variety of products including large-screen TV sets, smartphones and tablet computers. If Foxconn decides to make displays in the U.S., it would need to find customers among makers of those products or perhaps build its own factories for the products.A number of other Asian manufacturers have been looking at expanding U.S. production. In June, Samsung Electronics Co. announced a $380 million investment\u00a0to expand its U.S. home-appliance manufacturing operations in South Carolina.

After an earlier protest in March, Mr. Urban said his brother was warned by a colleague in local law enforcement that Mr. Urban \u201cshould stop this nonsense.\u201dLeonid Kondakov, head of domestic political affairs for the local administration in Izhevsk, said there are no official commands to pressure Mr. Navalny\u2019s supporters. \u201cSome people may be taking things too far, but it doesn\u2019t come from authorities,\u201c he said.But Mr. Kondakov said young people should work with authorities to solve problems. \u201cWe want to encourage people in the right direction,\u201d he said.Mr. Navalny\u2019s online investigations of official corruption have reinvigorated Russia\u2019s opposition, which has long been divided and under pressure from authorities. He has used the internet to circumvent state-controlled media, which largely ignores the movement.He has also traveled around the country visiting supporters. Nearly 1,000 people showed up for a meeting he held in Izhevsk on June 10, Mr. Urban said, two days before nationwide protests, including the one in Izhevsk.The movement has energized Russia\u2019s youth, who make up the bulk of protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s our future. If our whole country is covered in the filth of corruption, how will we live?\u201d said Maria Lumpova, a 21-year-old student at Udmurt State University in Izhevsk.But Mr. Navalny faces hurdles in his potential long-shot campaign against Russian President       Vladimir Putin       in next year\u2019s elections.Mr. Navalny has been convicted of embezzlement, a decision he has called politically motivated. People convicted of serious crimes are barred from running for president under Russian law. Mr. Navalny is still hoping to run.And his movement is encountering other challenges. The June 12 protest was one of the largest in Izhevsk that Mr. Urban and other local activists can recall. But protests are still relatively small.Opposition leaders say people are preoccupied with their own problems, as living standards have fallen in recent years, and are influenced by Russian state-controlled television, which frequently cites the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria as a warning of where protests can lead.\u201cApathy is the main problem. People are told: \u2018You in any case won\u2019t be able to change anything. What can you do? It\u2019s all pointless,\u2019\u201d said Timofei Klabukov, a 33-year-old entrepreneur in Izhevsk and a supporter of Mr. Navalny.Activists are also under pressure. Oleg Vasiliev, an organizer of the June protest in Izhevsk, said police filed a misdemeanor charge against him for starting the rally early. He said the rally started sooner than anticipated because the march beforehand lasted only three minutes instead of 10, as stipulated in the permit.Mr. Vasiliev said a court will consider the charge against him on Monday, as well as another for not halting the protest after someone allegedly called \u201cPutin is a thief,\u201d which apparently went beyond the bounds of the official topic of the protest\u2014corruption\u2014and may be considered slanderous. He said he is resigned to paying a fine of as much as 10,000 rubles, around $167, as he can\u2019t afford a lawyer. Regional police didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Opposition offices across the country, including in Izhevsk, have been raided by police and had materials confiscated.Mr. Urban said that reaching out to local authorities has helped avoid more-serious problems that have affected activists in other cities, including one who was attacked with a knife and another whose car was torched in June.Pro-Kremlin groups are also mobilizing. When Mr. Navalny visited Izhevsk in June, several dozen protesters, including military veterans and former border guards, gathered outside his local office and chanted, \u201cNavalny, get out of Izhevsk!\u201d\u201cNo one paid us to do it,\u201d said Alexander Kiselev, a leader of Patriots of the Border, a border-guard veterans organization. \u201cWe were expressing our position.\u201dWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Across Russia, Kremlin Hamstrings Its Opposition.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/across-russia-protesters-and-kremlin-backers-seek-the-upper-hand-1500721201", "keywords": ["alexei navalny,navalny movement,navalny protests,putin's russia,putin russia,russian opposition,russian oppression,russian protests,vladimir putin,Alexei Navalny"]}]
