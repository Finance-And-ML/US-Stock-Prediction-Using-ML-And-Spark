The S&P;/ASX 200 index, which fell 1.2 percent on Thursday, was up 0.3 percent, or 15.11 points, to 5,778.3 by 0319 GMT, helped by a rise in consumer staples, utilities and telecom stocks. For the week, the index was up 1.7 percent, and positioned for its best week since the one ended March 31. Analysts attribute some of this week's gain to self-managed super funds (SMSF) buying into the market and net purchases by international participants. Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities, said individuals have been buying shares ahead of July 1, when superannuation regulations change. The day's gains were driven by financial stocks, with the 'Big Four' banks rising between 0.2 to nearly 1 percent.  We've got the bank levy and other uncertainties, but at the moment I think there's a degree of confidence that profit numbers pre-bank levy were quite solid and dividend yields were still solid to retail investors,  Farnham said. The financial index is set to post a weekly gain. The telecom index was 0.5 percent higher, in line with gains in Telstra shares. Australia's largest telecom company on Wednesday said it would lay off 1,400 workers in a fresh round of job cuts. Woolworths pushed up the consumer staples sector, while utilities were buoyed by a 0.7 percent gain in AGL Energy . Basic materials shares remained pressured by continuing weakness in commodity prices, compounded by poor outlook. While copper prices fell for a fourth day, iron ore prices rose sharply tacking steel futures, though demand outlook remained shaky.

After a disastrous opening round 78 on Thursday, 'home' may be where the world number two is headed. McIlroy was two-under through two after a par-eagle start, but his accuracy from the tee then seemed to desert him. He hit just five of 14 fairways for his round and ended six-over par, leaving him with a mountain to climb to make the cut on Friday.   You cannot play this golf course if you're not in position off the tee, and I wasn't in position,  he said.  Obviously, I paid the price for it today.  Before the tournament began, four-times major winner McIlroy, one of the game's best drivers of the ball, had spoken about how eager he was to attack the long, links-styled, rolling farmland course off the tee. McIlroy has played just six tournaments this year after battling through a rib injury but said pain was not to blame for  his performance on Thursday.  Rust was more of an issue, he added.  I was hacking around in the rough out there and didn't feel it one bit. So, no, that's totally fine,  he said.   I started missing some left on the course and tried to sort of correct it on the way in and missed a couple right,  he said.   So a little bit of timing, and a bit of rust as well.  The 28-year-old acknowledged that it would be a steep climb to get back into the tournament after a day when 17 competitors broke 70, but he said he was up for the challenge.  I watched some of the coverage earlier on and saw what Rickie (Fowler) did and Brooks Koepka and some of those guys,  he said.   I thought I was on course to do that after being 2-under through two, and didn't work out that way.

On Thursday night, Kelly laced a pinch-hit RBI double down the left-field line in the eighth inning to spoil Chris Sale's strong outing and end the Phillies' eight-game losing streak with a 1-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Citizens Bank Park.  I just threw the worst pitch of the game at the wrong time,  Sale said. To have that type of a hit against a five-time All-Star and MLB's strikeout leader? Even better.  I would that that result against anybody,  Kelly said.  But it feels good against him. I don't know -- maybe more of my friends will text me tonight.  Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at PhilliesBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchThe Phillies avoided being swept by Boston in a four-game, home-and-home interleague series with their first win since June 6. The Red Sox (37-28) fell to 16-8 since May 21. Kelly, who Philadelphia acquired April 22 from Toronto, is now 6-for-28 as a Phillie but 2-for-13 as a pinch-hitter with two doubles. He was 2-for-3 as a pinch hitter in three games against Boston this week. He had a pinch-hit single Tuesday in the 12th inning of Philadelphia's 4-3 loss to the Red Sox.  In Boston, Kelly got that hit for us late in the game,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  It's always huge to get a pinch hit and it happens to win the game for you.  Sale (8-3) threw a complete game in suffering his first loss since April 27. He allowed one run, four hits and struck out 10. It's his 44th career double-digit strikeout game and ninth of the season.  We've seen that type of performance a number of times,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  Nearly 10 times he's walked out and struck out double digits. He's one of the best pitchers in baseball. That's not an uncommon performance from the mound standpoint.  Sale, who said he never hit in college, was 1-for-3 at the plate too. He led off the eighth with a double then advanced to third on a sacrifice fly but Phillies right-handed pitcher Pat Neshek got out of the jam.  It's tough. They picked me up my last handful of starts,  Sale said,  I wanted to pick them up. It's not a matter of if, it's when with this team. I really would have liked to get that one.  Phillies right-hander Nick Pivetta turned in the best outing of his career. He threw seven shutout innings and struck out nine batters -- both career highs. He allowed four hits and two walks in pitching past the fifth inning for the first time.  He's a real competitor. He really likes to compete,  Mackanin said.  He hit 107 pitches and asked (pitching coach Bob) McClure why I was taking him out of the game.   I said that's enough,  Mackanin added. Pivetta didn't get a decision and is 1-3 with a 4.46 ERA in seven starts. Neshek improved to 2-1 while Hector Neris earned his sixth save. In the second inning, Pivetta escaped trouble after loading the bases with two outs. Sale had a chance to help himself and almost got a ball past Howie Kendrick, but the Phillies' second baseman's throw beat Sale in a bang-bang play at first.  (Pivetta) had good stuff,  Farrell said.  Good fastball, kept the ball down. Had two types of breaking balls -- actually, a four-pitch mix, changeup to lefties, backdoor curveball, threw a slider against some right-handers. He threw the ball very well.  The Phillies mustered two runners -- a second-inning double from Maikel Franco and a fourth-inning single from Tommy Joseph -- through five innings. Sale struck out nine of the first 15 batters he faced. Joseph's single extended his hitting streak to 11 games. NOTES: The Phillies are 13-31 against Boston since 2004. Thursday's win is their first against the Red Sox since April 8, 2015. They're 2-10 in their last 12 games versus Boston. Philadelphia is 10-17 against the Red Sox at Citizens Bank Park since it opened in 2004. ... Boston 1B Mitch Moreland has a fractured big toe but plans to play through the injury. He was in the lineup Thursday and was 1-for-4. ... The Red Sox placed LHP Brian Johnson on the 10-day disabled list Thursday because of left shoulder impingement. ... Boston heads to Houston for a three-game set. LHP Drew Pomeranz (6-4, 4.48 ERA) faces RHP Mike Fiers (4-2, 4.29) on Friday. ... Philadelphia opens a three-game series with the Diamondbacks on Friday. RHP Aaron Nola (3-4, 4.40 ERA) opposes Patrick Corbin (5-6, 5.38).","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED6GMAPHQC"},

Playing the back nine first at the links-style Erin Hills layout, Hadwin was sputtering along at two-over par through eight holes when he suddenly clicked into gear with a birdie at the par-five 18th. He then roared through the turn with five straight birdies from the first before the streak came to a screeching halt with a bogey at the par-three sixth. He would add one more birdie, at the eighth, for a four-under 68, three back of pacesetter Rickie Fowler. Hadwin becomes just the third golfer to string together six birdies at a U.S. Open, joining George Burns (1982) and Andy Dillard (1992), who both accomplished the feat at Pebble Beach.  You don't often see that in a U.S. Open,  Hadwin told reporters.  But there's way too many holes out here where one bad shot could be a double bogey quickly.   So I did a really good job of staying present, staying focused on the next shot.  I was a couple over early, but I hit some good shots, made a couple putts and next thing you know I got it back on par.  Jun 15, 2017; Erin, WI, USA;  Adam Hadwin walks to the 9th green during the first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament at Erin Hills. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY SportsThe 29-year-old has only one PGA Tour title on his resume, getting his maiden win at the Valspar Championship earlier this year, but he showed in March he can get hot quickly. The Canadian finished second at the CareerBuilder Challenge thanks in part to a sensational 59 in the third round.  I've done a good job of getting myself in position to win some golf tournaments,  said Hadwin.  I finally was able to close the deal this year at Valspar.  I think the next thing is contend at big events with the best players in the world, and that would be majors, WGCs, and thankfully I'm off to a good start this week.  While his round featured seven birdies, Hadwin said it was a actually a par that was the turning point. Scrapping along at two over, Hadwin was in danger of falling further off the pace when he found himself in the knee-high fescue on the 15th. Instead of being aggressive, Hadwin played conservative, laying up and salvaging par.  Hit it in the hay and contemplated going for it a little bit,  said Hadwin.  Chose to lay up and hit it to six feet.  That turned things around for me a little bit. Got on a hot streak there and turned the corner.

In his first two years running Australian packaging group Amcor Ltd, Canadian-born MacKenzie replaced 75 percent of the firm's top 80 managers. He implemented an aggressive turnaround plan, oversaw a company-changing $2 billion acquisition of the Alcan packaging businesses and pushed through a spin off of its Australian boxes and bottles arm.  He comes from a very strong background, very focused on shareholder value creation, very disciplined in his approach there. On that basis he's a very sensible, sound appointment,  said Rohan Walsh, a portfolio manager at Karara Capital, which owns shares in both BHP and Amcor. Named on Thursday to succeed Jac Nasser as BHP chairman from Sept. 1, MacKenzie's early challenge will be to deal with calls for a revamp at the world's biggest miner from activist shareholders. U.S.-based fund Elliott Management has released a roadmap for change, accusing the BHP board of approving  disastrous acquisitions and poorly timed share buybacks , and pushing for an exit from its U.S. oil and shale businesses. MacKenzie's track record, which included a near doubling of Amcor's return on capital to 20 percent and boosting its share price 150 percent over 10 years, could put him in good standing with Elliott.  A trained engineer with a passion for sailing, he implemented a turnaround plan at Amcor called  The Way Forward . It was billed as  an aggressive get-fit program  for the company. The objective was simple: Amcor's different businesses were to have strong positions in their markets. Businesses in weak positions were to be fixed, sold or closed. In 2010, he snared Alcan's packaging arm from then-distressed Rio Tinto for what was considered a very attractive $2 billion price and then built on that business.  The Alcan acquisition was very much his crowning glory,  said Macquarie analyst John Purtell, who covered MacKenzie's reign over Amcor. Investors saw the acquisition as extremely well timed, greatly increasing Amcor's scale and diversification. MacKenzie, 53, was also responsible for the demerger in December 2013 of Amcor's Australasian paper and packaging and U.S. distribution businesses, which has allowed Amcor to focus on higher-returning businesses.  His track record in terms of boards is probably a little bit untested at the moment, but as a CEO I think he was very effective,  said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, a shareholder in both BHP and Amcor. Still, MacKenzie, a French and German speaker who only joined the board of BHP last year, is taking on a company with its hands in many pies around the world.  BHP's a large complex diverse business. It's not an easy ship to manage. There are challenges in this role, clearly,  Karara's Walsh said.

Around 10 very large crude carriers (VLCCs), all between 16 and 20 years old, have been chartered since the end of May to store crude for periods ranging from 30 days to around six months, brokers told Reuters. Each VLCC can carry 2 million barrels of oil. These vessels are in addition to around 30 supertankers used for long-term storage around Singapore and Linggi, off the West coast of peninsula Malaysia. One of the main drivers for storing oil in tankers is that crude prices for immediate delivery are cheaper than for future sale, a market condition known as contango. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, have fallen by 13 percent since late May, to around $47 per barrel. Brent for delivery at the end of 2017 is $1.5 per barrel more expensive <0#LCO:>.  Floating storage does seem ... viable assuming time charter rates of under $20,000 per day,  said Rachel Yew, oil and tanker market analyst at Oceanfreightexchange. Current rates to charter a five-year-old 300,000 DWT for one year are $27,000 per day, according to shipping services firm Clarkson. Rates for VLCCs at least a decade-old are much cheaper.  It makes a lot of sense for a trader to pay $16,000-$19,000 per day to take an older VLCC for 30-90 days to store oil,  said a Singapore-based supertanker broker, asking not to be identified. The festering supply glut comes even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pushes to withhold production until the end of the first quarter of 2018.     Waiting for China Floating storage is an indicator of oversupply.  Too much unsold oil is headed to Asia,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum. A shortage of spare onshore storage in China, as well as an expectation that new Chinese crude import quotas for independent refineries will be announced soon, are also playing a role in putting crude into tanker storage in Southeast Asia.  Once China's quota are released, you want to have oil close to China. Because onshore storage there is pretty full, the next easiest location is around Singapore and Malaysia,  said one trader.

India, Iran's top oil client after China, shipped in 487,600 barrels per day (bpd) in May, about 9 percent less compared with April and nearly 40 percent less than a peak registered in October, according to ship tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts. Most Western-led sanctions against Tehran's nuclear programme were lifted in January last year, and India's Iranian crude imports began climbing two months later in March. In the fiscal year to March 2018, though, India has said it plans to order about a quarter less Iranian crude due to a snub over development of Iran's Farzad B gas field.  We stood by them in difficult times. We still buy substantial amounts of oil from them, and we expect reciprocity from Iran,  Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters on Wednesday when asked if India was still hopeful of getting the development rights for the Farzad B field. Following years of seeming rapprochement over the field, Iran has likely reached an agreement on the concession with Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, Russian and Indian media have reported. Iran last month said India had not offered an acceptable proposal on the Farzad B development. Sri Paravaikkarasu of energy consultancy FGE said India's lower Iran imports were a  reaction of Iran's decision to award the gas field to Russia and the availability of cheaper grades like those from Russia.  India was one of four countries - China, Japan and South Korea being the other three - that continued to import large amounts of Iranian oil after sanctions were toughened in 2012. Some of the drop in imports from Iran may be due to lower demand. Overall, India imported about 4.2 percent less oil in May, compared with April, due to a shutdown of the 180,000-bpd Bathinda refinery for upgrades. In the first five months of 2017, India's oil imports from Iran still jumped about 64 percent, the data showed. While Iran's oil exports to India are stalling, supplies to Europe and Turkey hit their highest level since the lifting of sanctions in 2016. Iraq continued to be India's biggest oil supplier for the second month in a row in May, followed by Saudi Arabia. Middle Eastern oil in May accounted for 65 percent of India's overall imports, compared to 71 percent a year ago, while the import share of Africa and Latin America have risen, the data showed. The shift is likely a result of an effort led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production to prop up oil prices.

When told the five-times major winner, who was attending his daughter's high school graduation, had officially withdrawn, Diaz was thrust into his first U.S. Open and more than held his own, a birdie at the last capping a respectable even-par 72. Mickelson's only chance of making his tee time was bad weather but when it became clear there would be no delays the PGA Tour confirmed his absence.

Diaz showed up at Erin Hills at 6:15 a.m. to await word on his playing prospects. After getting the good news, he returned to his hotel for a nap before going back to the course for his 2:20 p.m. tee time. Diaz said he received a lot of attention on the course when he set off with Wisconsin favorite Steve Stricker and Stewart Cink.

Trading in Takata Corp stock was suspended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after media reported that the company is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as next week as the safety equipment manufacturer attempts to manage the world's largest safety recall. Takata is working toward a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto-parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc. By midmorning the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent to 19,936.61, poised for its first daily gain in five days. The benchmark index is on track to fall 0.4 percent for the week. Markets are focused on the Bank of Japan's policy decision later in the day, followed by a news conference with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The central bank is set to keep monetary policy steady and signal its confidence in a strengthening economy. The Japanese market languished on Thursday after weak U.S. inflation data overshadowed an interest hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. But traders said that concerns about the U.S. economy have receded for now, as solid U.S. indicators strengthened the case for the Fed to continue tightening monetary policy this year.  The U.S. data overnight triggered shortcovering,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 111.11 yen after data showed that the number of Americans filing unemployment claims fell more than expected last week. It suggested that slack in the labor market was shrinking, and the New York manufacturing and Philadelphia Fed business conditions indexes for June beat expectations. But Fujito added that although excess pessimism over the U.S. economy seems to have receded, the market needs fresh catalysts for investors to chase the Nikkei back to the 20,000 level. The Japan Exchange Group, operator of the Tokyo bourse, said foreign investors last week turned net sellers of Japanese cash stocks for the first time in nine weeks. They sold a net 35.4 billion yen in Japanese cash stocks during that week, after buying 1.86 trillion yen from the second week of April through the last week of May. Friday's notable gainers were financial stocks, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rising 1.7 percent, Nomura Holdings soaring 2.7 percent and insurer T&D; Holdings advancing 1.6 percent. Tech shares underperformed, hit by weak weakness in their U.S. counterparts. Tokyo Electron shed 1.1 percent, Advantest Corp declined 0.1 percent, TDK Corp shed 0.4 percent and Sharp Corp was flat. The broader Topix gained 0.6 percent to 1,596.90 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.6 percent to 14,216.02.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-stocks-midday-idUSL3N1JD1IA"},

Around 10 very large crude carriers (VLCCs), all between 16 and 20 years old, have been chartered since the end of May to store crude for periods ranging from 30 days to around six months, brokers told Reuters. Each VLCC can carry 2 million barrels of oil. These vessels are in addition to around 30 supertankers used for long-term storage around Singapore and Linggi, off the West coast of peninsula Malaysia. One of the main drivers for storing oil in tankers is that crude prices for immediate delivery are cheaper than for future sale, a market condition known as contango. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, have fallen by 13 percent since late May, to around $47 per barrel. Brent for delivery at the end of 2017 is $1.5 per barrel more expensive <0#LCO:>.  Floating storage does seem ... viable assuming time charter rates of under $20,000 per day,  said Rachel Yew, oil and tanker market analyst at Oceanfreightexchange. Current rates to charter a five-year-old 300,000 DWT for one year are $27,000 per day, according to shipping services firm Clarkson. Rates for VLCCs at least a decade-old are much cheaper.  It makes a lot of sense for a trader to pay $16,000-$19,000 per day to take an older VLCC for 30-90 days to store oil,  said a Singapore-based supertanker broker, asking not to be identified. The festering supply glut comes even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pushes to withhold production until the end of the first quarter of 2018.     Waiting for China Floating storage is an indicator of oversupply.  Too much unsold oil is headed to Asia,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum. A shortage of spare onshore storage in China, as well as an expectation that new Chinese crude import quotas for independent refineries will be announced soon, are also playing a role in putting crude into tanker storage in Southeast Asia.  Once China's quota are released, you want to have oil close to China. Because onshore storage there is pretty full, the next easiest location is around Singapore and Malaysia,  said one trader.  This expectation of new Chinese orders also helps explain why future crude is more expensive than current crude. That's why we store it for later sale,  he added.

A spokesman for the acquisitive insurance giant, which made headlines with its 2015 purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, said banks were still distributing its products. Bloomberg earlier reported that Chinese authorities had asked lenders to suspend some business dealings with Anbang. That report cited an unnamed source and did not give details on what type of business dealings with Anbang banks were asked to suspend. China's banking regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Anbang, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets, said early on Wednesday that Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties. Last week, the company denied reports that Wu had been barred from leaving China. Wu was detained by authorities last Friday, people familiar with the matter said. None of the sources wanted to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. Two days earlier, Wu had presided over a large internal meeting that appeared to be business as usual, said a person who was there. Anbang, which said it is operating normally in Wu's absence, distributes insurance through multiple channel types. According to its annual report, 88 percent of its insurance sales last year were through banks. The insurer has spent more than $30 billion in the past two years acquiring insurers, luxury hotels and other property assets. But it has faced increasing pushback in its offshore deal-making amid a broader decline in Chinese outbound acquisitions. Beijing has strengthened curbs over capital outflows after China's leadership vowed to curb risk in its financial system.  Industry Scrutiny China's big insurers have attracted regulatory attention for their aggressive acquisitions of overseas assets, while using client money derived from high-yield investment products sold to consumers. This has particularly jarred with authorities concerned about an economy over-reliant on credit. In a speech late last year, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Liu Shiyu criticized the prevalence of  abnormal  highly-leveraged acquisitions by insurers and other financial companies, and that in some instances, their use of funds of  improper origins  represented the  retrogression and decay  of human nature and business ethics. In April, President Xi Jinping ordered more to be done to rid Chinese financial firms of excessive risk.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters building of Anbang Insurance Group are pictured in Beijing, China, August 25, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoZhuang Deshui, deputy director at Peking University's Clean Government Center, said the anti-corruption crackdown directed at the financial industry was aimed at breaking up vested interest groups, including Communist Party officials, who had abused their power for financial gain while obstructing key reforms. 'Sold Out' Employees at several Chinese banks contacted by Reuters on Thursday said they had stopped selling some Anbang products, in some cases several months ago and also because the products had  sold out . The head of a Beijing branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (601398.SS) said Anbang's 3-year universal insurance products with guaranteed principal and interest were very popular last year, with interest rates at 3-4 percent.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters building of Anbang Insurance Group are pictured in Beijing, China, August 25, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoBut since receiving a notice from its headquarters in the third quarter of 2016, it had stopped selling Anbang products, the bank official said, adding that reasons behind the suspension were not disclosed.  A sales representative at a sub-branch of CITIC Bank (601998.SS) in the eastern city of Hangzhou said sales of nearly all Anbang products had been suspended since late May. Only a 5-year insurance product with a relatively low yield of more than 4 percent was being sold, the agent said. ICBC and CITIC Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The head of a Beijing branch of Bank of Hangzhou (600926.SS) said it had not received any notice on suspending sales of Anbang products, which were still for sale. The bank did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Last month, Anbang Life Insurance (IPO-ABLF.HK) was barred from issuing new products for three months for  disrupting market order  by designing a product that bypassed regulations aimed at curbing growth in risky, short-term, universal life insurance products. Anbang Life at the start of the year had begun to shift its sales away from universal life to traditional products, generating premiums in the first quarter that topped full-year 2016 totals.   Anbang has 1.97 trillion yuan ($290 billion)in assets, according to its website.

The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because  there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.  An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced.  They shouldn't be very worried,  Trump said of DACA recipients in a January ABC News interview.  I do have a big heart.

Slideshow (3 Images) We are living in a time when our national security environment has deteriorated. Unfortunately, we have seen, through terror attacks in Australia that illegal guns have been used,  said Keenan. Australia's has some of the world's toughest gun control laws, introduced after the country's worst mass murder, when a gunman killed 35 people at Port Arthur in the island state of Tasmania in 1996. Australia, which has banned all semi-automatic rifles and all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, and as a restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls, has had no mass shootings since 1996. It is held up by many abroad as an example of the need for tighter gun controls in the United States.. But a 2016 report estimated there were 260,000 illegal firearms in Australia, some of which have been used by radicalized locals to commit attacks. In Australia's most deadly incident inspired by the Islamic State group, a gunman used an illegal firearm in a 2014 Sydney cafe siege in which three people, including the hostage taker, were killed. Earlier this month, gunman Yacqub Khayre used an illegal firearm to kill a man in an apartment block in Melbourne and then held a woman hostage before police shot him dead.

I was hoping and praying if I could get the same kind of conditions, and hoping and praying I would be half as good as Rickie Fowler. So to be right behind him, I'm ecstatic.  Casey was joined at 66 by 23-year-old American Xander Schauffele. One shot behind them were England's Tommy Fleetwood and Americans Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman. The Englishman said watching Fowler take apart the 7,845-yard links-style layout helped him read some of the putts, capitalize on hole locations and confirm the game plan he already had set up with his caddie.  I'd like to think we learned a little bit and thank him for that this morning.   Jun 15, 2017; Erin, WI, USA;  Paul Casey tips his hat after his putt on the 9th green during the first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament at Erin Hills. Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY SportsCasey started his afternoon round with a bang, eagling the par-five first hole and adding a birdie at the second. He made the turn at four-under 32 and ended the round with a flourish with a birdie at the par-five last. Slideshow (2 Images) It was just a really fun round,  said Casey, who said he was far from perfect and made errors.  I don't know that I've ever played a U.S. Open where I've had that much enjoyment.   I prefer a golf course where we can make some birdies, for sure,  Casey added after a record-setting first round that featured 44 scores under par, shattering the previous record 39.  We're all interested to see where the pin positions are going to be tomorrow and if there's a knee jerk reaction.  Casey said conditions could also be radically different for the second round.  Just because we had the deluge yesterday and the days leading into this, it's pretty benign and receptive,  he said.  It's not going to last. If the sun shines and the wind blows, it's going to dry out. It will be treacherous.  Editing by Rory Carroll","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-casey-idUSKBN19707B"},

Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) from the city state dropped 1.2 percent in May from a year earlier, data from trade agency International Enterprise Singapore (IE Singapore) showed on Friday, after declining 0.7 percent in April for the first time in five months. Analysts, who had expected a 3.7 percent year-on-year decline last month, attributed the latest fall to the high base effect in the year-ago period when exports jumped a revised 14 percent.  Last May was a very high base,  Selena Ling, head of treasury research & strategy at OCBC Bank said, adding,  these will skew the numbers somewhat.  On the plus side, the electronics sector - a key support for the economy with solid shipments in recent months - continued to show strong growth in May, jumping 23.3 percent from the year before.  There is greater optimism, that the electronics uptick is going to last a little bit longer, it's not a flash in the pan kind of story,  Ling said. Moreover, on a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, Singapore's exports grew 8.1 percent last month, turning around from the 9 percent contraction in April. Singapore's economy has struggled over the past two years. In the first quarter of this year, it shrank 1.3 percent from the previous three months and grew 2.7 percent from a year earlier. The robust electronic exports in the last few months provided a cushion for the trade-dependent economy, prompting economists to raise their forecasts for Singapore's growth this year. Ling, however, warned about risks in China and the potential ripple effects down the global supply-chain.  In terms of headline growth, we see a sharper slowdown in the second half because of the deleveraging and regulatory concerns that is going there (China),  she said. The city state's central bank held its policy steady in April but warned of risks to the global outlook, including from a potentially sharper credit squeeze in China, Brexit and U.S. economic policy.

DiCaprio has also initiated the return of other, unidentified items that the actor said he accepted as gifts for a charity auction and which originated from people connected to the 1MDB wealth fund, they said in a statement. In July, Hollywood production company Red Granite was accused in a U.S. civil lawsuit of using $100 million that prosecutors said had been diverted from the 1MDB fund to finance DiCaprio's 2013 film  The Wolf of Wall Street,  in which he starred. DiCaprio said in October he was cooperating with the probe and would return any gifts or donations if they were found to have come from questionable sources.  Mr. DiCaprio initiated return of these items, which were received and accepted by him for the purpose of being included in an annual charity auction to benefit his eponymous foundation,  Thursday's statement said.  He has also returned an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando, which was given to Mr. DiCaprio as a set gift by Red Granite to thank him for his work on 'The Wolf of Wall Street,'  the statement added.

Los Angeles-based Red Granite Pictures said in a statement on Thursday it was  actively engaged in discussions with the Justice Department aimed at resolving these civil cases and is fully cooperating.

The Outlook is Positive. Fitch has also assigned the 'BBB-' rating on SMRP BV's existing senior secured bonds. A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. SMRP BV's rating reflects strong linkages with its shareholders, Motherson Sumi Systems Limited (MSSL) and Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SMIL). SMRP BV is a leading global supplier of rear-view vision systems and interior and exterior modules to the automotive industry. It has long-standing customer relationships with financially strong original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and its global operations are located close to the OEMs. This helps the company achieve above-market growth and shield profitability from sector-specific risks arising from high dependence on large OEM customers. Our rating also reflects MSSL's disciplined and de-risked approach to expansion, which has helped it grow with sustained improvement in profitability while limiting financial leverage. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that SMRP BV's financial profile will improve over the next two years, based on a strong order book and completion of its expansion capex. The notes are rated one notch above the IDR as they are secured against assets in key subsidiaries within the SMRP BV group. KEY RATING DRIVERS Linkages to Samvardhana Motherson Group: Fitch analyses MSSL, its largest shareholder SMIL and their 51:49 joint venture, SMRP BV, as a single economic entity because SMIL effectively controls more than 50% of economic interest in the MSSL group and because of the companies' senior management overlap. Fitch assesses the operating, financial and strategic linkages between SMRP BV and SMIL as strong and has based SMRP BV's IDR on SMIL's consolidated financial profile, which has been adjusted to include 100% of the businesses of MSSL and SMRP BV to take into account the sizeable minority shareholders in MSSL. Leading Player with Integrated Capabilities: MSSL's business in India supplies wiring harnesses for a dominant share of the passenger vehicles manufactured in the country. The company's acquisition of PKC Group Plc in March 2017 has given MSSL leading positions in commercial-vehicle wiring harness markets across North America, Europe, South America and China. SMRP BV's mirror business under Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec (SMR) is one of the top suppliers of exterior mirrors globally with a 24% market share by sales. Samvardhana Motherson Peguform (SMP), the polymer business, accounts for 20% of global bumper sales, 11% of dashboards and 28% of door panels in the premium segment. MSSL's market shares have grown over the last several years, supported by its ability to provide a full spectrum of solutions (including R&D;, tooling, manufacturing and assembly) in meeting customers' complex supply chain needs with high quality and reliability. Well-Diversified Business Profile: MSSL's businesses serve more than 750 vehicle programmes across more than 50 OEMs globally. Each business is diversified across OEM customers, vehicle programmes within an OEM and different geographies for each programme. This is an important business strength given the cyclical and competitive nature of the automotive industry. MSSL has a balanced geographic presence: 20.7% of sales came from the Americas, 53.7% from Europe and 25.7% from Asia-Pacific and Africa in the financial year ended March 2017 (FY17), including full year revenue from PKC. Customer diversification has improved, with the top-five customers making up 47% of sales in FY17 (including PKC), compared with 53% in FY14. Strong Relationship with OEMs: SMRP BV has decades-long relationships with 14 of the top-15 global OEMs, which underscores its consistent quality and R&D; record. This is important, as global OEMs are increasingly dependent on external auto-component providers and retain only high value-added parts to optimise capital. The company's solid customer relationships are a key business strength and help SMRP BV mitigate sector-specific risks, such as competition and weak negotiating power against large OEMs in pricing and pass-through of volatility in raw material prices. Strong Order Book: SMRP BV had an order book of about EUR12.8 billion at FYE17 (EUR7.7 billion at FYE14), which in Fitch's view, supports revenue visibility in excess of 90% over the next three to four years, including 60%-70% that comes from models already in production. The order book is diversified across OEMs and vehicle programmes, which mitigates uncertainty over the market reception of a new launch. Moreover, the association with top OEMs reduces this risk, as the manufacturers typically try to improvise and relaunch new platforms - which require significant upfront investment - rather than writing-off the initial investment altogether. Low-Risk Growth Strategy: SMRP BV has achieved strong, profitable growth over the years through successful integration of attractively priced acquisitions and a low-risk organic expansion strategy. The company has been able to improve profitability at SMR and SMP by focusing on cost efficiency and investing to expand in-house manufacturing capabilities. SMRP BV's expansion plans benefit from orders already secured from customers, which reduces risks. MSSL is likely to pursue sizeable acquisitions in line with its strategic vision, but Fitch expects the company to adhere to its announced long-term leverage target. Improving Financial Profile: MSSL has maintained reasonable financial leverage, with an adjusted net debt to operating EBITDAR ratio of 2.6x in FY14-FY16, while achieving healthy growth and steady improvement in margins. This highlights its disciplined approach in evaluating investment opportunities. The company has low maintenance capex requirements (INR6 billion-7 billion annually) and a dividend policy that pays less than 40% of net income. FCF generation has been negative due to the organic expansion of the SMR and SMP businesses, but Fitch expects FCF generation to improve once capex normalises over FY18-FY19. Fitch expects MSSL's robust order book to support continued increases in EBITDA, which should lead to lower financial leverage that will be commensurate with a low investment-grade rating over the next two to three years. Solid Financial Flexibility: MSSL benefits from a robust liquidity profile, fairly long-dated debt maturities as well as diversified access to banks and capital markets. MSSL's strong financial flexibility allows it to support customers when they set up production facilities in new markets as well as get involved in the early design and development work. DERIVATION SUMMARY MSSL's sizeable scale, leading market position in its product categories as well as good degree of diversification across OEM customers, geographies and products, positions it well with respect to peers such as Metalsa, S.A. de C.V. (BBB-/Stable), Nemak, S.A.B. de C.V.(BB+/Positive) and Faurecia S.A. (BB/Stable). MSSL appears more leveraged than its peers because of its expansion capex, but Fitch's forecasts for the company's FCF profitability and leverage profile in the post-expansion years (FY20 onwards) compare well against that for its peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - High single-digit revenue growth (except FY18 when full-year consolidation of PKC will lead to around 21% growth) supported by a strong order book. -  Gradual improvement in EBITDA margin to 10%-11% over the next two to three years driven by increasing scale and investments to further improve in-house value addition. - Capex intensity (measured as percentage of sales) to remain high at around 5.5%-6.0% through to FY18 before declining to around 4.0% in FY19. - MSSL dividend payout to remain at below 40% of net income. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - MSSL consolidated adjusted net leverage (defined as total adjusted net debt to operating EBITDAR, after Fitch's adjustment for minorities and factored receivables and suppliers' acceptances) improving to below 2.0x on a sustained basis. - MSSL consolidated FCF margin improving to greater than 1.0% on a sustained basis. - MSSL maintaining or improving its business diversification. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to the Outlook being revised to Stable: - Inability to achieve the positive guidelines above. LIQUIDITY MSSL has a robust liquidity position with no significant debt maturities before FY22. At 31 March 2017, MSSL had INR49.9 billion of unrestricted cash and INR32.9 billion of available committed bank facilities (MSSL: INR8.9 billion; SMRP BV: INR24 billion), which were more than sufficient to meet INR10.6 billion in near-term debt maturities and the modest level of FCF deficit through to FY18. The liquidity profile is strengthened by Fitch's expectation of positive FCF from FY19 and SMRP BV's access to both bank and international debt capital markets.

A dozen or so women, in their 60s to 80s, stand watch each day around the clock to make sure no military vehicles enter the deployment site through the only road to it -- a former golf course owned by a leading conglomerate, the Lotte Group. The vigil has forced the U.S. military to use helicopters instead to shuttle fuel and supplies to the site hosting the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. South Korea's former conservative government agreed with the United States to deploy the battery to counter growing threats from North Korean missiles. New liberal President Moon Jae-in had promised to review the controversial decision during his successful campaign for the May 9 election. Last week, Moon ordered full deployment be suspended while the government reviews how the system will affect the area's environment. But there is no intention to change the deployment decision and elements of the battery, including two launchers already installed at the site, will stay, his government said. The women, who brandish canes and umbrellas at the military helicopters and shout for them to go away every time one flies through the village, say they have no interest in the politics of the deployment. But they protest, longing for the peace they had before.  I can't sleep. I'm taking sedatives at night but I still get only two hours of sleep,  said 87-year-old Na Wi-bun, who lives within a kilometer (0.62 mile) of the site and says she can hear the generator that powers THAAD humming around the clock. Na goes to the town hall every day, a refuge to a group of women as well as a number of civic groups protesting the deployment.  During the daytime, we used to farm and later go to the town hall and us grandmothers would spend time together. Now there's no day and night for us. I live at the town hall now,  said 81-year-old Do Geum-ryeon. Most of the villagers are farmers of chamoe, or Korean melon. Do, who moved to the village 61 years ago, said she sustained bruises fighting against police in late April, trying to keep U.S. military trailers full of THAAD components from passing through the village at early dawn.  On my dying breath, I'm going to tell them to take THAAD away,  she said. Villagers are blocked by South Korean policemen as they march during an anti-THAAD proest near an entrance of a golf course where a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is deployed, in Seongju, South Korea, June 14, 2017.  Picture taken on June 14, 2017.Kim Hong-JiLong Fight Ahead On the site now are two launchers and a powerful X-band radar that constitute THAAD. The launchers are visible to the naked eye from a mountain peak roughly two to three kilometers away and the generator can be heard from the mountain. Visitors who scale the 600-meter (0.37 mile) peak to look at THAAD are shooed away by South Korean police holed up in a guard post near the summit. Soseong-ri town head, Lee Seok-ju, said he has warned villagers of a long fight ahead. Slideshow (17 Images) I see this going on for at least two years, and at longest, even five. If this was going to end in one or two days, we would have fought tooth and nail, but we're saving our energy for the long run,  Lee said. Soseong-ri is part of North Gyeongsang Province, long known for being a conservative stronghold. With THAAD, that has changed. When conservative candidate Park Geun-hye was elected as president in 2012, voter support stood near 90 percent for her in Seongju County, where Soseong-ri is located. In the most recent presidential election in May, support for the conservative candidate from Park's party fell to 56 percent. Most Soseong-ri villagers voted for Moon or the other liberal candidate, Ahn Cheol-soo, Lee said. That includes 67-year-old Kim Jeom-sook, who farms chamoe with her husband.  THAAD must go. Sometimes I look up and I am so frightened some of things dangling from the helicopters will fall on us,  Kim said. Her 73-year-old husband, Lee Mu-hwan, said their business has not been affected by THAAD yet but prices have declined in past years due to oversupply and so they cannot risk another hit. They earn roughly 10 million won ($8,901.55) a year from melon farming, after expenses. Kim, whose grandfather died in the 1950-1953 Korean War, said THAAD would be of no use if North Korea is determined to strike the South.   If North Korea wants to boom boom boom, they can hit everywhere and create a sea of fire. I'm sure this area will turn like that too if they want,  said Kim.

In his first two years running Australian packaging group Amcor Ltd, Canadian-born MacKenzie replaced 75 percent of the firm's top 80 managers. He implemented an aggressive turnaround plan, oversaw a company-changing $2 billion acquisition of the Alcan packaging businesses and pushed through a spin off of its Australian boxes and bottles arm.  He comes from a very strong background, very focused on shareholder value creation, very disciplined in his approach there. On that basis he's a very sensible, sound appointment,  said Rohan Walsh, a portfolio manager at Karara Capital, which owns shares in both BHP and Amcor. Named on Thursday to succeed Jac Nasser as BHP chairman from Sept. 1, MacKenzie's early challenge will be to deal with calls for a revamp at the world's biggest miner from activist shareholders. U.S.-based fund Elliott Management has released a roadmap for change, accusing the BHP board of approving  disastrous acquisitions and poorly timed share buybacks , and pushing for an exit from its U.S. oil and shale businesses. MacKenzie's track record, which included a near doubling of Amcor's return on capital to 20 percent and boosting its share price 150 percent over 10 years, could put him in good standing with Elliott.  A trained engineer with a passion for sailing, he implemented a turnaround plan at Amcor called  The Way Forward . It was billed as  an aggressive get-fit program  for the company. The objective was simple: Amcor's different businesses were to have strong positions in their markets. Businesses in weak positions were to be fixed, sold or closed. In 2010, he snared Alcan's packaging arm from then-distressed Rio Tinto for what was considered a very attractive $2 billion price and then built on that business.  The Alcan acquisition was very much his crowning glory,  said Macquarie analyst John Purtell, who covered MacKenzie's reign over Amcor. Investors saw the acquisition as extremely well timed, greatly increasing Amcor's scale and diversification. MacKenzie, 53, was also responsible for the demerger in December 2013 of Amcor's Australasian paper and packaging and U.S. distribution businesses, which has allowed Amcor to focus on higher-returning businesses.  His track record in terms of boards is probably a little bit untested at the moment, but as a CEO I think he was very effective,  said Andy Forster, a portfolio manager at Argo Investments, a shareholder in both BHP and Amcor. Still, MacKenzie, a French and German speaker who only joined the board of BHP last year, is taking on a company with its hands in many pies around the world.  BHP's a large complex diverse business. It's not an easy ship to manage. There are challenges in this role, clearly,  Karara's Walsh said.

(Reuters) - The jurors in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial concluded their fourth day of deliberation on Thursday, unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the three charges against the entertainer. Judge Steven O'Neill in Norristown, Pennsylvania, sent the jurors, many of whom looked exhausted, back to their hotel a few minutes after 9 p.m. on Thursday after praising them for their efforts. The jury has completed about 40 hours of deliberations, including three consecutive 12-hour days, without reaching an unanimous verdict and will return on Friday. O'Neill had instructed the jurors to continue trying to deliver a verdict around 11:30 a.m., following a note in which they said they could not agree on a verdict on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Cosby, 79, once beloved for his brand of family-friendly comedy, is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, then 31, at his home near Philadelphia in 2004.  Constand and other accusers say Cosby, the star of the 1980s hit TV comedy  The Cosby Show,  often plied them with pills and alcohol before assaulting them in a series of incidents over four decades. Constand's allegations are the only ones to result in criminal charges, with many of the others too old to allow for prosecution. Cosby has denied every claim, saying his encounters with Constand and others were consensual. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby (L) leaves Montgomery County Courthouse with his attorney Brian McMonagle after the fourth day of deliberations in his sexual assault trial in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 15, 2017.Brendan McDermidA hung jury would represent a clear victory for Cosby, who would avoid what could have been years in prison. Prosecutors would have the option of seeking a retrial if the jury cannot reach a verdict. Following the jury's morning note, one of Cosby's accusers, Jewel Allison, began crying. Soon after, Cosby protesters and supporters faced off in verbal confrontations outside the courthouse. O'Neill rejected a motion from Cosby's lawyers for a mistrial on Thursday morning. The judge and the lawyers met in private just before 9 p.m. outside the presence of reporters gathered in the courtroom, so it was unclear whether defense lawyers renewed their request. Slideshow (18 Images)The jurors have spent days wrestling with which version of the night in question was accurate: Constand's or Cosby's. They have spent days asking to have testimony read back, including Constand's trial testimony as well as the first report she made to police in 2005. The jury also revisited Cosby's description of the night from sworn depositions he gave in 2005 and 2006 during a civil lawsuit by Constand and a police interview he conducted in 2005. Cosby did not testify. Defense lawyers during the trial emphasized discrepancies in Constand's statements to police in 2005 in an effort to undermine her credibility. Prosecutors, meanwhile, used her testimony as well as the words of a second accuser, Kelly Johnson, to portray Cosby as a serial predator. Johnson told jurors Cosby sexually assaulted her in strikingly similar fashion in 1996. In his decade-old depositions, Cosby said he gave Constand Benadryl, a common allergy drug whose side effects can include drowsiness. He called the pills her  friends  without telling her what they were, and admitted to giving other young women Quaaludes, a sedative, in the 1970s.

Macquarie this month had declined to rule out an overseas move after the government introduced the surprise tax on certain bank liabilities including corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit at Australia's five biggest banks. Moore on Friday said he could not guarantee Macquarie's headquarters would remain in Australia in the longer term as that would be subject to the broader needs of the organisation.  As a longstanding position going back to 2007 we say that the location of all our businesses are a matter of ongoing review,  he said.  Tax rates do have an impact of course. We look to the return for our shareholders and that is an after-tax return.  Analysts and investors have said an eventual move to the United States or Europe could make sense as it grows in those regions.

The proposal will mark the first from the administration under President Donald Trump for the controversial Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law aimed at cutting U.S. oil imports and boosting renewable fuel use. The EPA is broadly expected to hold its proposed requirements for conventional biofuel, which is mainly corn-based ethanol, unchanged at 15 billion gallons, the maximum under the RFS, said four Washington sources representing oil and biofuels interests. The persons spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. “We are expecting a modest increase in advanced and no change to the 15 billion” for conventional ethanol, said a U.S. biofuels industry source. Biofuels credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) were gyrating in active trade ahead of the announcement, with prices of the biomass-based diesel RINs jumping as much as 4 cents each, according to traders. The credits are used by fuel companies to meet the annual requirements from EPA for the volumes of ethanol and biodiesel that need to be blended in gasoline and diesel used by American drivers.  The proposal went from EPA to the White House for review last month. It includes targets for conventional and advanced biofuel for 2018 and for biomass-based diesel for 2019.

Mining firms in the world's top platinum producer have complained about a lack of consultation over revisions to an industry charter that sets targets for black ownership and participation in the powerful sector. The charter is part of a wider empowerment drive across Africa's most industrialized economy designed to rectify the disparities of apartheid that persist more than two decades since the end of white minority rule in 1994. The Chamber of Mines, which represents mining firms, said it would take the government to court over the charter because it had not been consulted sufficiently and feared the new rules would create regulatory uncertainty and scare off investors. Announcing the new rules on Thursday, Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said companies had 12 months to meet the new 30 percent target. The rand fell 2 percent after Zwane announced details of the revisions. Johannesburg's Mining Index ended the day more than 3 percent lower, underscoring investor concerns about the charter and the uncertainties it raises.  The value destruction is hard to quantify and the uncertainty will persist. What is certain is that South Africa continues to be a terrible destination for mining investment and assets in South Africa will continue to trade at a discount,  said Ben Davis, an analyst at London-based Liberum Capital.  The government has said in the past that companies must stick to ownership targets even if black shareholders sell their stakes but Zwane said it had not yet decided whether mining firms must maintain the threshold permanently. The Chamber of Mines said it would also take this issue back to courts. It argues that a company should only be obliged to meet its black ownership targets once. The Mining Charter was introduced in 2002 to increase black ownership of the mining industry, which accounts for about 7 percent of South Africa's economic output. Black South Africans make up 80 percent of the 54 million population, yet most of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population.   Not Our Charter  Zwane told a news conference in the capital Pretoria that he had consulted widely with businesses.  We will engage with business going forward in a respectable manner. We will never take them to court,  he said. The new charter stipulates that mining firms must pay 1 percent of their annual turnover to the Mining Transformation and Development Agency, which helps black communities. Under the new rules, prospecting rights must be 50 percent black owned and mining rights should be 30 percent black owned. Mining firms are required to procure 70 percent of goods and 80 percent of services from black-owned companies. This could prove difficult for many companies, as much of the expensive and sophisticated equipment used on South Africa's increasingly mechanized mines is imported from foreign manufacturers.   The new rules also state that half of the members of mining company boards must be black, and a quarter of the overall board must be women. Officials at the Chamber of Mines said they hoped legal action would force the government back to the negotiating table.  We will not sign this charter because it is not our charter,  Chamber of Mines CEO Roger Baxter told a news conference in Johannesburg. The chamber, which represents companies such as Anglo American and Sibanye Gold, did not take part in the launch of the new charter because of what it said was a lack of prior consultation.

But now, two years later, the 61-year-old is showing no sign of easing into retirement. In fact he plans to oversee an ambitious expansion plan and stay at the helm of the British oil major until at least the end of the decade, according to sources familiar with the matter. The American CEO has told his leadership team that it is in his family's tradition to not retire until 65 - which would take him to 2020 - and that he could perhaps work even longer than that, the sources said. In another signal that there is unlikely to be a change at the top anytime soon, there has been no imminent succession planning at the firm, according to the sources, one of who said succession was  not a live project . When Dudley finally decides to go, there will no shortage of candidates to take his place, however.  BP's chief financial officer, British national Brian Gilvary, 55 and the head of upstream, Irishman Bernard Looney, 46, have been cited as possible successors. There has been persistent industry speculation about when Dudley will call time on his BP career since he struck the 2015 settlement deal under which the company agreed to pay out a total of about $60 billion over the disaster that left 11 dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.  He had been made CEO in 2010 - the first American to lead BP in its 108-year-old history - to steer the company through the swathe of U.S. litigation, and the deal represented a milestone.  But rather than stepping back from the fray, he has since embarked on the biggest expansion plan in a generation for BP, even in the face of a collapse in oil prices.  'Safe Hands' The company has become the fastest-growing oil major in the world. It will launch seven oil and gas fields this year - more than any other year in its history - and will launch nine more before the end of the decade, adding 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and gas to its production. By 2020 the company, including its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, will be producing as much as 4 million bpd - the same as before the Deepwater Horizon spill and up from the 3 million bpd it was producing after offloading assets to cover the litigation costs.  We are firing on all cylinders,  Dudley told a shareholders meeting in May as he aims to catch up with production volumes of its biggest rivals Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Whether this strategy will prove effective in the long-term is by no means certain; BP's large liabilities linked to Deepwater Horizon mean it requires a significantly higher oil price - than the present price and compared with rivals - to pay for its operations and dividends. A sluggish recovery in oil prices could also lead to its already high debt rising further.  Rating agency Moody's upgraded BP's credit rating last week for the first time in 19 years while, in another sign of confidence, 97 percent of BP shareholders voted to approve Dudley's new pay package last month.  Bob hasn't done anything that we wouldn't agree with so far. When times are hard and bad, I would want someone who is pretty sensible and conservative,  said Rohan Murphy from Allianz, which holds BP shares.  Dudley is a safe pair of hands. He won't do anything too maverick,  Murphy added.  The recent rating upgrade shows the story hangs together.   Oligarch Battle The calm and softly spoken Dudley was stress-tested more than once before getting the top job. His career included three punishing years fighting a corporate war with Russian oligarchs at the firm's giant Russian venture TNK-BP that forced him to flee the country and go into hiding. He became BP chief executive when his predecessor Tony Hayward's tenure ended abruptly following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Dudley was given a task of steadying the ship as BP struggled with a firestorm from the U.S. government, victims of the spill, environmental groups and shareholders. Over the next five years, the company shed more than $55 billion worth of oil fields, refineries and infrastructure to pay for the spill clean-up. BP was abandoning low-margin projects and mature markets like Venezuela or Vietnam, often getting top dollar for its sales as oil prices hovered above $100 per barrel.     In retrospect, BP had unknowingly stolen a march on most of its rivals who had to embark on similar asset sales much later when crude prices began to collapse in 2014.     Debt Pile Just as BP was slowly emerging from the spill fallout, the collapse in oil prices drove it to its biggest loss ever in 2016. Like its peers, BP responded by slashing thousands of jobs and tightening budgets. The efforts bore fruit. In the first quarter of 2017, its profits tripled and its production rose to a five-year high thanks to higher production. Dudley's team argues that this will only improve over time as the company's strategic change of tack means it is producing more profitable oil and gas from a smaller number of fields. Another metric investors are also closely watching is BP's debt, standing at $38.6 billion, or 28 percent of its total equity including debt - the highest figure among oil majors. That ratio is set to improve as Deepwater Horizon cash payments decline over the coming years. They amounted to about $7 billion in 2016 and $4.5 billion in 2017 but will fall to $1-$2 billion from 2018. BP can currently balance its books only at $60 per barrel, compared to $50 for most of its rivals, but that figure should also fall as Deepwater Horizon payments decline.  Bob Dudley is building something that could be very interesting in the future ... he just gets on with business and that's what investors want,  said James Laing, equities fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds BP shares.  The dividend is still sustainable, debt levels are high but will come down, the cash breakeven has been lowered, the resource base is still increasing,  he added.  It doesn't feel like there is a lot of criticism to be made.  Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-ceo-idUSKBN19614U"},

High exports and production from other countries, including Russia and the United States, are also contributing to the ongoing glut. Top producer Russia, not an OPEC-member but participating in the deal, is expected to export 61.2 million tonnes of oil in the third quarter (around 5 million bpd), against 60.5 million tonnes in the second quarter, via pipelines, according to industry sources and Reuters calculations. Add in Russia's tanker shipments and its total exports are likely above 9 million bpd. In the United States, which is not participating in any deal to hold back production, oil output C-OUT-T-EIA has risen over 10 percent over the past year to 9.3 million bpd, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that figure to rise above 10 million bpd in 2018. In a sign of the ongoing supply overhang, traders are increasingly hiring tankers again to store unsold crude, waiting to sell later at a higher price.

The case of Ray Bingham, until recently Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) second-highest paid board member and executive chairman at U.S. chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY.O), shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire. The 71-year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China’s central government last fall. In November, the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O), another U.S. chip manufacturer, for $1.3 billion – a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham. But the chip deal is in doubt over U.S. national security concerns. On Monday, Lattice and the buyout fund, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal has also cost Bingham personally. His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham, recipient of a 2009 Financial Times ‘Outstanding Director’ accolade, to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles. On Sunday, Bingham resigned from Cypress' board of directors after the company's founder and sixth-largest shareholder - T.J. Rodgers - sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board. Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge.  Bingham, in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down, cited this contest as a distraction. It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle's board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge. “Throughout the process (of joining Canyon Bridge), Ray conducted himself with transparency. He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress' board and outside legal counsel, who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join,” a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters. Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment.  Bingham’s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge, regulatory filings show. Bingham was offered a $1.2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge, a $2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself. That is in addition to the $890,902 in 2016 he received from Oracle, making him the second-highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison, and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth $900,000, as well as equity grants worth $4.5 million. Related CoverageTimeline: Canyon Bridge's bid for Lattice SemiconductorThe income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge. Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies, Flex Ltd (FLEX.O) and TriNet Group Inc (TNET.N). A Compromising Relationship  U.S. board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds. This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships. This was the case with Bingham, who had done business with China-born U.S. citizen, Benjamin Chow, when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago. Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management, a Chinese state-owned investment firm, which became Canyon Bridge's sole investor, according to Lattice’s regulatory filings. For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal, click Chow approached Bingham last August. He believed that a U.S.-based buyout fund with a U.S. partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, Reuters reported in March.  Canyon Bridge’s Chinese state links, first revealed by Reuters in November, were a bone of contention at Oracle. Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge, according to Bingham’s deposition in Rodgers’ lawsuit. In response, Bingham decided to step down.  Oracle expressed concern that Bingham's affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle's relationship with the United States government,  Andre Bouchard, the judge presiding over Rodgers' lawsuit, said at Delaware's Court of Chancery earlier this month, citing Bingham's deposition.  Oracle declined to comment. Chow, approached through Canyon Bridge, declined to comment. A Matter of Interest for the Board Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016, taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham’s name, a quote from him, and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3, according to regulatory and court filings. Bingham was even given signatory authority on a $30 million Canyon Bridge bank account.  Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge, and had not let Cypress’ board know. On Oct. 20, Bingham contacted Cypress' outside counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to ask if he should tell Cypress’ board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge, according to a regulatory filing from Cypress. Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time, according to Cypress. Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment.  Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members, and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd,   said Alan Seem, a corporate partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case. On Nov. 4, at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release, Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner, according to Cypress.  At the same meeting, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gave a presentation to Cypress' board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names.  Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer, most recently last September, but it turned both opportunities down, according to Cypress. Nonetheless, Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge.  But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems.  On Nov. 7, Eric Benhamou, Cypress’ lead independent director at the time, told another director that Bingham’s role with Canyon Bridge was “ripe for conflicts [of] interest,” according to a Cypress regulatory filing. In December, Cypress’ board amended the company’s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target, then any conflicted director would recuse themselves. “Duty of loyalty issues are corrosive. They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level,  said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

Trump on Thursday reiterated his call for unity in the aftermath of the shooting in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia. But Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, criticized some Republicans who have blamed the shooting on vitriol from the political left. Scalise, a congressman from Louisiana who is the No. 3 House Republican, suffered injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in the left hip on a baseball field where he and other lawmakers were practicing for a charity baseball game. Scalise underwent a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg - his third procedure overall - and remained in critical condition but had shown improvement, MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement on Thursday. Scalise, 51, and three others were wounded when a man identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire on the lawmakers. The others wounded were a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist. Hodgkinson, who had a history of posting angry messages against Trump and other Republicans on social media, died after being wounded by police. The U.S. Capitol Police said Hodgkinson used a 9 mm handgun and a 7.62-caliber rifle in the shooting, and traces run by investigators showed he evidently acquired the weapons legally.  Both were purchased by the shooter from federal firearms licensees,  the Capitol Police said in a statement.  We currently have no evidence to suggest that the purchases were not lawful.  The FBI recovered a cellphone, computer and camera from Hodgkinson's van and was examining them for evidence, the statement said. Trump, who visited Scalise at the hospital on Wednesday, said the congressman was  in some trouble but he's going to be okay, we hope.    It's been much more difficult than people even thought at the time,  Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday, adding he also visited the wounded Capitol Police officer at the hospital. Vice President Mike Pence earlier on Thursday said he visited the hospital where Scalise was being treated. Police investigate a shooting scene after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice near Washington in Alexandria, Virginia.Joshua RobertsRepublican members of Congress played their Democratic colleagues in a charity game on Thursday night at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team, with thousands of spectators attending. The lawmakers took the field with many wearing hats to honor Scalise. When the members of the Republican team were announced, mention of Scalise's name drew a standing ovation throughout the stadium. The shooting has raised questions about lawmakers' security, renewed the nation's contentious debate over guns and drawn new attention to the harsh rhetoric that reflects America's political polarization. Trump, in a video message played at the game, said the event had  a much deeper level of meaning  because of the shooting.

That’s the source of unity and more than ever we must embrace it.  Pelosi Criticizes Republicans Many lawmakers in both parties called for unity after the shooting. But at a news conference, Pelosi bristled at comments made by a few Republicans and conservative activists who blamed heated Democratic rhetoric for the incident.  The comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous, beneath the dignity of the job that they hold, beneath the dignity of the respect that we would like Congress to command. How dare they say such a thing,  Pelosi said. She said Republican vitriol and caricatures of her had resulted in  calls to my home constantly, threats in front of my family, really predicated on their comments and their paid ads.  Pelosi also cited past remarks by Trump, saying:  You have a president who says: 'I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care.'  She did not specify which comments by Republicans she objected to. Among others, Republican Representative Steve King wrote on Twitter that  violence is incited by the leading cultural voices of the Left  and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich cited an  increasing hostility on the left.

Trump will lay out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami that will roll back parts of former President Barack Obama's opening to the communist-ruled island after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. Taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, Trump will outline stricter enforcement of an existing ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. The new policy will ban most U.S. business deals with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make exceptions related to air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island. But even as he curbs Obama’s détente with Cuba, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, U.S. officials said. He will also leave in place some other tangible measures implemented by his Democratic predecessor, including the resumption of direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights, though Trump’s more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. And, according to one White House official, the administration does not intend to “disrupt” existing business deals such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel. There are also no plans to reinstate the limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that American can bring home for personal use, one White House official said. As a result, the changes – though far-reaching – appear to be less sweeping than many pro-engagement advocates had feared. Human Rights Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obama’s easing of U.S. restrictions has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a “bad deal” struck by Obama with Havana, one U.S. official said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free and fair elections and the release of political prisoners. FILE PHOTO: Tourists pass by the U.S. Embassy in Havana, February 18, 2016.Alexandre MeneghiniInternational human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into political reforms in exchange for diplomatic engagement. At home, Trump’s critics have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while insisting that in other parts of the world it will not lecture other countries on the issue. Trump will issue a presidential memorandum when he delivers his speech at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami’s Little Havana district, the heart of America’s Cuban-American and Cuban exile community. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castro’s revolutionary government. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was played a key role in pushing for Trump’s changes, was expected to attend along with U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of “people to people” educational trips for visitors, a classification that a White House official said was “ripe for abuse” by those looking for beach vacations. Trump’s new policy will eliminate such visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, the official said. But Trump’s planned rollback of Obama’s policy has drawn opposition from American businesses and the travel industry, which have begun making inroads on the island, as well as many lawmakers, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans. The new policy has come together after contentious meetings within the administration. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community.

Shale firms have hired an extra 425 rigs to drill for oil since the end of May 2016, more than doubling the active rig count, oilfield services company Baker Hughes says. Producers have continued adding rigs even though benchmark oil prices have fallen almost $10 per barrel since the middle of February and are now almost $4 below year ago levels. Rigs have been added at rates comparable to the height of the shale boom between 2012 and 2014 ensuring output will continue growing significantly through the rest of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts onshore production from the Lower 48 states will grow by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and another 500,000 bpd in 2018. As a result, U.S. shale producers together with other non-OPEC suppliers are expected to capture all of the increase in global oil demand in 2018 and raise their share of the market significantly at the expense of OPEC. Shale producers and OPEC are now on a collision course, with OPEC curbing production to try to raise prices and shale drillers adding rigs to boost output. The contradiction will likely be resolved through a drop in oil prices to rein in shale growth.     Oil prices have already declined significantly to curb the drilling boom and put output on a more sustainable trajectory. Past experience shows changes in the U.S. oil rig count typically lag 15-20 weeks behind changes in WTI oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2svJfUd). The decline in WTI prices since February should cause the rig count to level out or even start to fall sometime between the middle of June and the end of July (tmsnrt.rs/2s4kBZ8). If the rig count starts to level off or fall in the next few weeks, it could offer some support to beleaguered oil prices. However, if the rig count continues rising relentlessly, fears about overproduction will grow, and prices are likely to come under even more pressure. Many shale producers hedged a large proportion of their planned production in 2017 at prices above $50 per barrel which has given them some protection from the recent downturn. Shale firms have benefited from the plentiful availability of fresh capital from private equity investors taking an optimistic long-term view of the prospects for both prices and output. But only a small proportion of output has been hedged for 2018, which will leave shale producers progressively more exposed to low prices as existing hedges mature. The calendar strip of monthly WTI futures prices for 2018 is trading just below $47 per barrel ensuring any new hedges for 2018 executed now will be well below $50. The calendar strip for 2018 has fallen by more than $9 from its recent high over $57 per barrel at the start of the year and has fallen to its lowest level for more than a year (tmsnrt.rs/2s4ut5m). The low level of forward prices is likely to discourage hedging -- unless shale producers really are profitable at much lower prices, or fear prices will slide even further. Eventually the reduction of both spot and forward prices should curb the drilling boom, which will in turn provide a floor for oil prices. But until the boom shows real signs of moderating, oil prices are likely to remain under pressure.  Edited by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-shale-kemp-idUSL8N1JC37I"},

The case of Ray Bingham, until recently Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) second-highest paid board member and executive chairman at U.S. chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY.O), shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire. The 71-year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China’s central government last fall. In November, the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O), another U.S. chip manufacturer, for $1.3 billion – a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham. But the chip deal is in doubt over U.S. national security concerns. On Monday, Lattice and the buyout fund, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal has also cost Bingham personally. His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham, recipient of a 2009 Financial Times ‘Outstanding Director’ accolade, to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles. On Sunday, Bingham resigned from Cypress' board of directors after the company's founder and sixth-largest shareholder - T.J. Rodgers - sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board. Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge.  Bingham, in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down, cited this contest as a distraction. It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle's board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge. “Throughout the process (of joining Canyon Bridge), Ray conducted himself with transparency. He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress' board and outside legal counsel, who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join,” a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters. Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment.  Bingham’s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge, regulatory filings show. Bingham was offered a $1.2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge, a $2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself. That is in addition to the $890,902 in 2016 he received from Oracle, making him the second-highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison, and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth $900,000, as well as equity grants worth $4.5 million. Related CoverageTimeline: Canyon Bridge's bid for Lattice SemiconductorThe income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge. Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies, Flex Ltd (FLEX.O) and TriNet Group Inc (TNET.N). A Compromising Relationship  U.S. board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds. This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships. This was the case with Bingham, who had done business with China-born U.S. citizen, Benjamin Chow, when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago. Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management, a Chinese state-owned investment firm, which became Canyon Bridge's sole investor, according to Lattice’s regulatory filings. For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal, click Chow approached Bingham last August. He believed that a U.S.-based buyout fund with a U.S. partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, Reuters reported in March.  Canyon Bridge’s Chinese state links, first revealed by Reuters in November, were a bone of contention at Oracle. Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge, according to Bingham’s deposition in Rodgers’ lawsuit. In response, Bingham decided to step down.  Oracle expressed concern that Bingham's affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle's relationship with the United States government,  Andre Bouchard, the judge presiding over Rodgers' lawsuit, said at Delaware's Court of Chancery earlier this month, citing Bingham's deposition.  Oracle declined to comment. Chow, approached through Canyon Bridge, declined to comment. A Matter of Interest for the Board Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016, taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham’s name, a quote from him, and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3, according to regulatory and court filings. Bingham was even given signatory authority on a $30 million Canyon Bridge bank account.  Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge, and had not let Cypress’ board know. On Oct. 20, Bingham contacted Cypress' outside counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to ask if he should tell Cypress’ board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge, according to a regulatory filing from Cypress. Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time, according to Cypress. Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment.  Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members, and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd,   said Alan Seem, a corporate partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case. On Nov. 4, at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release, Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner, according to Cypress.  At the same meeting, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gave a presentation to Cypress' board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names.  Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer, most recently last September, but it turned both opportunities down, according to Cypress. Nonetheless, Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge.  But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems.  On Nov. 7, Eric Benhamou, Cypress’ lead independent director at the time, told another director that Bingham’s role with Canyon Bridge was “ripe for conflicts [of] interest,” according to a Cypress regulatory filing. In December, Cypress’ board amended the company’s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target, then any conflicted director would recuse themselves. “Duty of loyalty issues are corrosive. They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level,  said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, added 0.1 percent to 97.474, and was up 0.6 percent for the week. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates as widely expected, and also released some preliminary details of its plan to begin paring its $4 trillion-plus debt holdings. Ahead of the central bank's announcements, however, downbeat inflation and retail sales data earlier sent the dollar into a tailspin.  The dollar now seems to be getting over its shock from the core CPI release,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. He noted that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was relatively hawkish, releasing its plan for balance sheet reduction earlier than expected and keeping the interest rate outlook unchanged - despite market expectations for a slowing in the tempo of rate hikes.  It will be increasingly difficult to short the dollar, he added. Thursday's run of U.S. economic data gave dollar bulls some reason for cheer. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, lower than the 242,000 that economists had predicted. June readings of the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index also both surpassed economists' expectations. Higher yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was last at 2.169 percent in Asian trade, above its U.S. close of 2.162 percent. They had fallen as low as 2.103 percent on Wednesday after the downbeat data was published. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 111.11 yen, on track to gain 1 percent for the week, as investors awaited the outcome of a Bank of Japan meeting later on Friday, followed by a news conference with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The BOJ is widely expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy and reassure markets that it has no plans to hasten to follow the Fed's tapering example. The euro was steady on the day at $1.1147, well below a seven-month high of $1.1296 touched on Wednesday, and down 0.6 percent for the week. Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2762, getting a lift overnight after as many as three members of the Bank of England's policy committee surprised financial markets by voting for a rise in interest rates. It was still down 1.4 percent for the week so far. The unexpectedly tight 5-3 vote came despite signs of a slowdown in Britain's economy, and uncertainty over Britain's political outlook since Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election.

Macquarie this month had declined to rule out an overseas move after the government introduced the surprise tax on certain bank liabilities including corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit at Australia's five biggest banks. Moore on Friday said he could not guarantee Macquarie's headquarters would remain in Australia in the longer term as that would be subject to the broader needs of the organisation.

The EU, in return, is pushing for Japan to cut or scrap import tariffs on agricultural products such as pork, cheese and wine, the paper said, putting Tokyo in a tight spot given strong domestic political opposition against opening up these areas to outside competition. Japanese and European negotiators are continuing talks in Tokyo to reach a broad deal on signing an economic partnership agreement (EPA) in early July, the paper said without citing sources. Signing an EPA with the European Union, which comprises roughly 10 percent of Japan's total foreign trade, is among key goals of premier Shinzo Abe's  Abenomics  stimulus programs and growth strategy to revive the country's stagnant economy. The EU now imposes a tariff around 3-4 percent on auto parts and a 10 percent tariff on cars imported from Japan. The EU is ready to scrap tariffs for more than 90 percent of auto parts imported from Japan immediately after the EPA takes effect, the Nikkei said. The two sides remain at loggerheads on how long the EU would take to eliminate tariffs on cars. Japan wants them to be scrapped in seven years, while the EU is pressing to have more than 10 years to phase them out, the paper said. Japan and the EU have been negotiating the EPA since 2013 to promote bilateral trade and investment by eliminating tariffs and improving investment rules.

Takata, one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers, has been working for months to complete a deal with Key Safety. A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Key was expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy.

Takata declined to comment. Michigan-based Key, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had suspended trading in shares of Takata following media reports of preparations for a bankruptcy filing.

The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said. Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators.

In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. They also have been blamed for more than 180 injuries worldwide. A federal grand jury in January indicted three former Takata executives for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the safety defect. Takata has already paid a $25 million fine and $125 million to a victims' compensation fund, including for future incidents. Takata has until early 2018 to pay the $850 million owed to automakers, or within five days of securing a financial backer.

The Nikkei business daily reported that a new company created under Key will purchase Takata operations for about 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and continue supplying air bags, seat belts and other products, leaving liabilities behind in a separate entity. Takata declined to comment. Michigan-based Key, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had suspended trading in shares of Takata following media reports of preparations for a bankruptcy filing. At its previous close, it had a market value of $360 million.  Also at stake is $850 million owed by Takata to major global automakers under a settlement agreed to earlier this year stemming from the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall. Sources familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said a final deal with Key may not be reached before Takata files for bankruptcy. The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said.  Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata air bag inflators in the United States have not been repaired.

Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. They also have been blamed for more than 180 injuries worldwide. Slideshow (2 Images)A federal grand jury in January indicted three former Takata executives for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the safety defect. Takata has already paid a $25 million fine and $125 million to a victims' compensation fund, including for future incidents. Takata has until early 2018 to pay the $850 million owed to automakers, or within five days of securing a financial backer.     Then-U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said in January that if Takata filed for bankruptcy, the Justice Department would be a creditor in the restructuring. Key was chosen by Takata earlier this year as the favored buyer for the company. Since then, Key has been working with Takata on a restructuring plan.  Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Tesla Inc. Recalls are to continue through at least the end of 2019. Last month, four automakers including Toyota Motor Corp agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with Takata inflators.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered in last year's presidential campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. Trump, who hired his own lawyer last month for probes by a special counsel and congressional committees, lashed out on Thursday after a report that he was under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. He dismissed as  phony  the idea that his campaign colluded with any Russian effort to sway the 2016 election. Moscow denies meddling in the campaign. Pence hired Richard Cullen, chairman of law firm McGuireWoods, to help him respond to inquiries from special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokesman said. Cullen is a former federal prosecutor who has long ties to former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9. He represents former FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the corruption probe into world soccer's governing body. U.S. prosecutors have not accused Blatter of wrongdoing. Cullen, who supported Trump's rival Jeb Bush during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, also represented Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican and former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, during the investigation into corrupt Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. DeLay was not charged. Pence had been looking at hiring his own counsel for several weeks, and made his decision earlier this week after interviewing several candidates, his office said.  The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the president's agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter,  Pence spokesman, Jarrod Agen, said in a statement. Pence has seldom addressed the Russia issue, which has overshadowed Trump's efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs - priorities that Pence has worked on intensively with Republican lawmakers. The Washington Post first reported the Cullen hire. Just before the story broke, Trump wrote a pair of angry tweets, suggesting that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the election, should be under investigation instead of him. Earlier on Thursday, Trump called the probe a  witch hunt  on Twitter.  They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,  Trump wrote. Lines of Inquiry Mueller is investigating whether anyone on Trump's campaign, or associated with it, with him or any of his businesses, may have had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin, said one U.S. official familiar with the rough outlines of the probe and who spoke on condition of anonymity. That includes the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, and is a senior adviser at the White House, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing unnamed officials familiar with the matter. Mueller is also looking at a second line of inquiry: whether, if any potential offenses were committed, Trump or others attempted to cover them up or obstruct the investigation into them, the source said. An examination of possible obstruction of justice charges was  unavoidable  given testimony by Comey, although the issue may not become the main focus of the probe, the source said. Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the FBI's Russia probe. He also told the Senate Intelligence Committee in his June 8 testimony that he believed Trump had directed him to drop a related agency investigation into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. White House officials, including Pence, initially gave differing reasons for Comey's dismissal, including that he had lost the confidence of the FBI. Pence said on Twitter on May 10 that Trump had  made the right decision at the right time to remove Comey as the head of the FBI  and praised him for showing  strong & decisive leadership to restore trust & confidence of the American people in the FBI.  Trump later contradicted his own staff, saying on May 11 he had the Russia issue in mind when he fired Comey. Examining the possibility of obstruction charges will allow investigators to interview key administration figures including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and possibly Trump himself, said the source familiar with the Mueller investigation. While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.

The EU, in return, is pushing for Japan to cut or scrap import tariffs on agricultural products such as pork, cheese and wine, the paper said, putting Tokyo in a tight spot given strong domestic political opposition against opening up these areas to outside competition. Japanese and European negotiators are continuing talks in Tokyo to reach a broad deal on signing an economic partnership agreement (EPA) in early July, the paper said without citing sources. Signing an EPA with the European Union, which comprises roughly 10 percent of Japan's total foreign trade, is among key goals of premier Shinzo Abe's  Abenomics  stimulus programs and growth strategy to revive the country's stagnant economy. The EU now imposes a tariff around 3-4 percent on auto parts and a 10 percent tariff on cars imported from Japan. The EU is ready to scrap tariffs for more than 90 percent of auto parts imported from Japan immediately after the EPA takes effect, the Nikkei said. The two sides remain at loggerheads on how long the EU would take to eliminate tariffs on cars. Japan wants them to be scrapped in seven years, while the EU is pressing to have more than 10 years to phase them out, the paper said. Japan and the EU have been negotiating the EPA since 2013 to promote bilateral trade and investment by eliminating tariffs and improving investment rules.

The Republican governor said he approved the measure even though the legislature  missed an opportunity to substantially improve the K-12 funding system.  The Republican-controlled legislature faced a June 30 deadline set by the Kansas Supreme Court in March to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitution's requirement for adequacy. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed.  We're grateful for the effort, but it's not enough to achieve constitutionality,  he said, noting that the Kansas State Board of Education had proposed an $893 million, two-year funding increase. Now that the bill has become law, Rupe said he expects the supreme court to set up a process for the state to demonstrate how the measure complies with the constitutional requirement.  Besides finding more money for schools, Kansas lawmakers also had to plug budget holes largely caused by falling tax revenue.

A2 Milk has lifted its online brand recognition among Chinese parents to over 40 percent, double that of rival Bellamy's, according to a February report by UBS.

In an interview before the annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in South Korea this weekend, Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told Reuters multiple factors have contributed to soaring household debt, which now equals more than 90 percent of South Korea's gross domestic product.  It would be an exaggeration, or too strong to say that low interest rates are themselves the cause of the household debt,  said Kim, formally appointed by President Moon Jae-in on June 9 as chief architect of South Korea's economic and fiscal policies. Runaway home prices, fueled by cheap mortgage borrowing, have raised questions over whether South Korea's central bank may start to end its five-year easing cycle that has cut borrowing rates to a record low 1.25 percent. For the first time, the average price of a Seoul apartment in March exceeded 600 million won ($534,000), an increase of more than 20 percent from four years earlier. Most analysts still expect the Bank of Korea to hold rates through 2017, but some traders boosted their rate hike bets on Monday after the bank's chief said policy tightening is possible if recovery continues. The debt burden and the pace of its increase, along with concerns that higher U.S. interest rates could steepen borrowing costs in Korea, have prompted calls for policy responses. 'A Delicate Issue'  Kim said the challenge in addressing escalating home prices is not to harm the construction sector, which grew almost five times faster than the overall economy in the first quarter.  It is a delicate issue. If we go overboard (with property regulations) it could affect the economy,  while insufficient responses to scorching home prices could risk market stability, Kim said.  With about half of South Korea's economy reliant on exports,  Kim faces tough challenges dealing with protectionist sentiment in the United States and a row with China over security issues.  China, upset over Seoul's decision to host a U.S. missile defense system out of fear its powerful radar could see deep into Chinese territory, has banned group tours to South Korea and closed more than 70 percent of the Lotte Mart stores (023530.KS) in China among a series of other boycotts and bans.[nL3N1J62TY]  South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon speaks during his inaugural ceremony in Sejong government complex in Sejong, South Korea, June 15, 2017.Kim Hong-JiSouth Korean conglomerate Lotte Group offered an abandoned golf course in the southeastern county of Seongju to the government for deployment of the radar system.  U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to either terminate or renegotiate what he called a  horrible  bilateral free trade agreement with South Korea. With Beijing, Kim plans to make use of the ongoing channels with China to resolve troubled economic ties, starting with Chinese counterpart Xiao Jie and other officials visiting South Korea this weekend. Lines of Communication  Slideshow (3 Images) Marking the annual meeting of the AIIB, (China's) finance minister is coming, which will naturally open up lines of communication, so I'll take advantage of it actively,  Kim said. He will chair the two-day meeting of the China-led fund in the southern island of Jeju. Washington has not yet approached Seoul about the Korea deal that took effect in 2012, but Kim expects there will be talks after the U.S. administration completes ongoing talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.  We will closely monitor and respond to various issues the U.S. could raise,  Kim said.  But there is numerous evidences that shows the deal is mutually beneficial,  he added, saying that any discussions will lead to a stronger bilateral trade relationship. On reviving economic cooperation with North Korea, as envisioned by the new South Korean administration, Kim made it clear that embarking on projects with Pyongyang will be difficult unless the isolated neighbor takes steps to address concerns over its nuclear and missile programs. During his successful election campaign, Moon pledged to revive economic ties with the North, including reopening a joint industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the border. The complex was shut by South Korea's government in February 2016 after Pyongyang tested a long-range rocket in defiance of international sanctions. But Moon's overture has been complicated by North Korea's defiant pursuit of nuclear and missile programs. It has conducted four missile tests since his election.  Our basic principle is to stick to sanctions and regulations imposed by the international community,  Kim said.  So it's difficult for now to break away from those international consensus to cooperate (with the North), whatever form the effort takes.

This followed Canyon Bridge partner Ray Bingham's resignation from two corporate boards, Cypress Semiconductor Corp and Oracle Corp, over claims of potential conflict of interest. Here's a look at the latest twist and turns in Canyon Bridge's attempted acquisition of Lattice: - February 2016: Lattice approaches Cypress Semiconductor Corp to gauge its interest in making an acquisition offer. Cypress declined. - April 8, 2016: Financial advisers for China Reform Fund Management Co contact Lattice's advisers to express interest in discussing  a strategic transaction involving Lattice.  - May 5, 2016: Lattice CEO Darin Billerbeck and the company's financial adviser Morgan Stanley meet with Benjamin Chow, a representative of China Reform to discuss a potential deal. - August 2016: Ray Bingham meets Chow and discusses serving in an advisory role for a private equity fund. - August 2016: Lattice and China Reform discuss China Reform's most recent deal proposal. During those talks, Chow states that, after discussions with China Reform, he was considering leaving China Reform to form a new private equity fund, which one of China Reform’s affiliates, CVC, had agreed to invest in. This fund eventually became Canyon Bridge. - September 2016: Chow informs Bingham that Canyon Bridge had received an initial $1.5 billion funding commitment, and that it was in active negotiations with a potential target in the United States. - September 2016: Cypress turns down another opportunity to make an acquisition offer for Lattice. - October 2016: Cypress Semiconductor Corp executive chairman Ray Bingham reaches an understanding with Ben Chow about how they would work together. - November 2, 2016: Lattice's board holds a meeting with its advisers where they discuss the proposed merger agreement at length, including the experience and reputations of Canyon Bridge’s co-founders, Bingham and Chow. Morgan Stanley informs Lattice that the $8.30 per share offer from Canyon Bridge is a fair price to the company’s shareholders. - November 3, 2016: Canyon Bridge's $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice is announced. Bingham is quoted in the press release as a co-founder of Canyon Bridge praising the transaction. Cypress first learns of Bingham's status as a partner of Canyon Bridge from the press release. - November 4, 2016: Cypress' board holds a meeting where Bingham tells the board he is considering joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner part-time. Cypress' board finds no apparent conflict of interest for Bingham, but agrees to continue monitoring the situation. - December 23, 2016: Bingham joins Canyon Bridge as a partner. His employment is backdated to October 18. - January 27, 2017: T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of Cypress, files a lawsuit against Bingham, alleging he had an  irreconcilable conflict of interest  in joining Canyon Bridge, which he says competes  head-to-head  with it. - March 2017: Bingham resigns from Oracle's board after being told to choose between the technology giant and Canyon Bridge. Oracle expressed concern Bingham's relationship with Canyon Bridge could compromise Oracle's business with the United States government, according to court documents. - March 24, 2017: Lattice and Canyon Bridge refile their CFIUS application, seeking more time to secure U.S. approval of the deal with CFIUS beyond the standard period of 75 days. - June 9, 2017: After the 75 days lapsed from its previous CFIUS application, Lattice and Canyon Bridge agree to refile their CFIUS application for the second time. They extend their merger agreement from August 1 to September 30, to allow more time for the deal to be approved. - June 11, 2017: Bingham resigns from Cypress' board.

Washington is pushing the violent countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, known as the Northern Triangle, to enact economic reforms to lift private investment and stem the flow of migrants at a meeting of Latin American leaders in Miami.   The Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America began with the Inter-American Development Bank announcing $2.5 billion in funding for infrastructure projects in the nations which make up the bulk of migrants crossing the U.S. border. Trump's administration hopes tax and regulatory changes in the region will boost growth and encourage companies to invest, filling the gap left by less aid to the region. He sent Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to oversee talks in Miami. The U.S. 2018 budget proposal plans cutting aid to Guatemala by almost 40 percent compared with 2016, and by nearly a third to Honduras and El Salvador - two nations which have competed for the title of the world's most murderous in recent years. Still, leaders from the region told the conference organized by the U.S. and Mexican governments that they are committed to local integration and improving common infrastructure.  For every dollar provided by the United States, Honduras will provide four,  Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told the conference.  We Hondurans must be the ones who most invest in these objectives,  Hernandez added.  We're the ones that have to invest in the private sector, we have to make sure that every dollar is well focused on the challenges.  Trump took office vowing to slash illegal immigration to the United States, and pledged to build a massive border wall to realize his plan that he said Mexico would pay for. That has caused repeated diplomatic strains with Mexico, which Trump accused during his election campaign of sending drug traffickers and criminals across the U.S. border. Jimmy Morales, the president of Guatemala, said the region needed to make the most of U.S. support to build on advances in battling organized crime and production of illegal narcotics.  We're saying that we, the Central American countries of the Northern Triangle, don't just have the ability to do what we need to do to help in the fight against these emerging threats, but that we're also ... absolutely willing to help,  he said. Ahead of the meeting, State Department officials said the commitment to the region was still  substantial,  with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Creamer saying that over the last two years, the United States has committed $1.3 billion and in fiscal 2017, the U.S. pledged an additional $650 million. Asked at a news conference if there was resistance to the U.S. aid cuts, Tillerson said  direct aid  had not been a major issue.  No one came to our meetings with their hand out,  he said.

The asset sales required by U.S. antitrust enforcers were similar to what the companies had agreed to give up in a deal they struck with European regulators in March. The deal is one of several big mergers by farm suppliers, and the antitrust approval was quickly denounced by the head of the National Farmers Union, saying that farmers would face higher costs. The Justice Department said the asset sales would prevent price hikes or lost innovation. Dow and DuPont announced the deal in December 2015 in what was billed as an all-stock merger valued at $130 billion. According to the filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the assets to be sold include DuPont's Finesse herbicide for winter wheat and Rynaxypyr insecticides, which the Justice Department said had U.S. annual sales of more than $100 million. In addition, Dow will sell its U.S. acid copolymers and ionomers business. The products are used to make food packaging and other goods. The president of the National Farmers Union, Roger Johnson called the antitrust approval  deeply disappointing.   Clearly, the Trump administration is content allowing our country’s consolidation complex to continue,  Johnson said in a statement.  The combination of Dow and DuPont, coupled with other pending mergers, ... drives up costs for farmers’ inputs, and it reduces the incentive for the remaining agricultural input giants to compete.  The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which share the work of antitrust enforcement, have reviewed or are reviewing no fewer than four deals involving corporate titans that supply U.S. farmers. In addition to Dow and DuPont merger deal, Bayer has a deal to buy Monsanto, and ChemChina is purchasing Syngenta. In addition, fertilizer companies Potash Corp and Agrium are planning a merger. After Dow completes the merger with DuPont, the companies have said that they would split into three separate companies specializing in material sciences, specialty products, and seeds and agrochemicals.  As originally proposed, the merger would have eliminated important competition between Dow and DuPont in the development and sale of insecticides and herbicides that are vital to American farmers who plant winter wheat and various specialty crops,  acting Assistant Attorney General Andrew Finch said in a statement, adding that the merged company would have also gained a monopoly over ethylene derivatives used to manufacture food packaging and other products. Finch said the settlement  will preserve vigorous competition.  Analyst Brett Wong of Piper Jaffrey Co said he did not foresee another round of consolidation in the agricultural supply business in the near future.  It's going to take some time for the current dust to settle,  he said. Dow and DuPont have already received clearance to merge from Europe, China and Brazil. They are now awaiting approval from just a handful of countries, including Canada and Mexico.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/du-pont-ma-dow-idUSL1N1JC1R0"},

The 47-year-old South African, known as 'The Big Easy' for his mellifluous swing, reached four-under after 16 holes in the 117th U.S. Open before fading a touch at the end with a pair of closing bogeys to finish the opening round at two-under-par 70. The U.S. Open often brings out the best in Els, who otherwise has struggled through a difficult season, beset by nagging injuries.  The way I've been scoring has been awful this year. But physically I wasn't great,  said Els, who has missed more cuts than he has made this year.  A lot of times I had a couple of niggles, and the lower back, hip and shoulder and knee.  I feel good this week. I've got my trainer Vern here, and I'm feeling a bit better. So I'm feeling really loose. That's been nice. It's nice to play pain free.  Els is accustomed to rising to the occasion at the U.S. championship, having tied for fourth in 2013, finished ninth in 2012 and third two years earlier.  I felt that some of my game is coming back. My putting's back and the short game's pretty good. So I've just got to play golf,  he said. The four-times major winner made his four birdies on the front nine to make the turn in 32, and then ran off seven pars including some challenging par-saves before his late stumble. Els' caddie, Cayce Kerr, said the Erin Hills course suited the South African.  There's a little bit of a cushion underneath the grass where the club can just slide underneath perfectly so the texture of the grass for him is just fantastic,  Kerr told Reuters.  He loves the way there is a little bit of a cushion.  As for the greens, he just loves bentgrass greens. He won at Congressional and Oakmont (the 1994 U.S. Open) on this type of surface.

Otto Warmbier, 22, who arrived in the United States on Tuesday, is stable but  shows no sign of understanding language, responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surrounding,  said Dr. Daniel Kanter, medical director of the neuroscience intensive care unit at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.   He has not spoken,  Kanter said at a news conference.  He has not engaged in any purposeful movements or behaviors.  He said Warmbier was breathing on his own.  Read the Reuters backstory Warmbier, from Wyoming, Ohio, has been in a coma since March 2016, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea, his family said on Tuesday.  He was arrested for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan, North Korean media reported. He was visiting North Korea with a tour group.  On Thursday, North Korea said that it had released Warmbier  on humanitarian grounds.   The University of Virginia student's father, Fred Warmbier, said at an earlier news conference that his son had been  brutalized and terrorized  by the North Korean government.  Fred Warmbier said the family did not believe North Korea's story that his son had fallen into a coma after contracting botulism and being given a sleeping pill.  Doctors said on Thursday that there was no sign of botulism in Otto Warmbier's system.  Kanter said that Warmbier had suffered  extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain,  but he declined to discuss Warmbier's prognosis at the request of his family.  While doctors are uncertain as to what exactly caused the condition, cardiac arrest that stops the flow of blood to the brain is generally seen as resulting in the death of brain tissue.

Mandatory creditKyodoCardiac arrest in young, healthy people is rare and generally caused by either intoxication or traumatic injury, Dr. Jordan Bonomo, a specialist in neurosurgery and neurocritical care at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said at the news conference.  Although doctors had no information about the type of medical treatment Warmbier received while in North Korea, they did receive MRI images from North Korea dated April 2016, Kanter said. Based on those images, doctors estimate the brain injury likely occurred in the preceding weeks, he said.  Doctors said there was no evidence that Warmbier suffered any broken bones.  On Thursday, the State Department said that its special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, who negotiated Warmbier's release during a visit to the country this week, had also met with three other U.S. citizens being held in North Korea.  Slideshow (5 Images)Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been heightened by North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests. Pyongyang has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.  Fred Warmbier said he was stunned when told of his son's condition one week ago.   I don't know what being in shock is, but I'm pretty sure I was,  he said.   There is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his condition secret and denied him top-notch medical care for so long.   He said his wife, Cindy, had not left their son's side since his return to the United States and that he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday night.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Thursday,  We're glad he's home.  He said officials would not comment on Warmbier's health or how he came to be in his current condition.  Tillerson said on Wednesday that U.S. officials were considering some type of travel visa restriction to North Korea.  U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill last month that would ban U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea as tourists and require them to obtain special permission for other types of visits, following the detention of at least 17 Americans there in the past decade.  In Wyoming, a northern Cincinnati suburb of about 8,000 people, Warmbier's return to the United States was marked by blue and white ribbons, representing the colors of the local high school, tied around trees and telephone polls.

The Japanese, sharing the number seven TS050 hybrid car with Britain's Mike Conway and Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin, went round the Circuit de la Sarthe in three minutes 14.791 seconds during the day's second session. The time, at an average speed of 251.882kph, was more than two seconds quicker than the previous record of 3:16.887 set by Switzerland's Neel Jani for Porsche in 2015 qualifying. It was also faster than German driver Hans Stuck's 1985 pole of 3:14.800 set on a shorter track with fewer corners. Kobayashi had already put Toyota on provisional pole on Wednesday after lapping in 3:18.793 in the opening night session.  Mike Conway told me the car was perfect, so I set off fully confident ... I had 100 percent confidence in the car and when you're in that frame of mind, you can do great things,  said Kobayashi.  It was an incredible lap, the car was amazing, and we went after it without any trouble whatsoever with traffic. It surpassed all our hopes. It's rare to be able to say this, but it was a perfect lap.  When I saw the time as I crossed the line, I said to myself, wow!  Only one Japanese manufacturer has won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991, and Toyota -- five times runners up -- have made winning the world's greatest sportscar race their main motorsport target after losing to Porsche for the past two years. The number eight Toyota, driven by Britain's Anthony Davidson, Japan's Kazuki Nakajima and Switzerland's Sebastien Buemi, qualified second in a time of 3:17.128 with Nakajima at the wheel. In an endurance race where pace is nothing without reliability, qualifying is more about bragging rights ahead of a gruelling weekend. Champions Porsche filled the second row, with Jani the fastest of their drivers in the number one 919 hybrid car he shares with Germany's Andre Lotterer and Britain's Nick Tandy. The German carmaker won last year's race after Toyota had victory snatched from their grasp by a last lap power failure just as Nakajima had seemed destined to take the chequered flag in front of 263,000 spectators.

Stock ETFs listed in the United States attracted $17.7 billion during the week ended June 14, according to the research service, while their mutual fund counterparts recorded $6.8 billion of outflows in their largest week of withdrawals since April. Mutual funds are heavily favored by retail investors, while ETFs draw an increasingly diverse set of clients, including fast-trading hedge funds. The result came as investors grappled with pressure on oil prices, soft economic data and an interest-rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the second rate hike this year.  Mom and pop are easily scared: they've been hearing about the market meltdown, and it's overvalued, and it's time to sell, cash is your friend - stuff like that,  said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.  On the flip side, there was really no reason for the meltdown.  Taxable bond funds, an ostensibly safer alternative to stocks, managed to pull in $3.5 billion. Yet thanks to ETF buyers, domestic-focused stock funds pulled in $11.4 billion, the most since February. The selloff was  overplayed,  said Roseen, adding that  some people saw it as a buying opportunity.  A massive rotation out of technology shares, such as the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - and into beaten-down sectors, including financials, that began last Friday and resumed this week. U.S.-based financial sector funds pulled in $2.3 billion, the most since November, as the Fed hiked rates in a boon for bank lending rates. But technology sector stocks posted $444 million in withdrawals during the week, the most since September, according to the research service. Tech stocks took over as the leaders of the ongoing stock rally as market segments popular in the immediate aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's November election, such as financials and small-company stocks, faltered earlier this year. Now by contrast, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund is on course to deliver higher one-month returns for June than the tech-heavy PowerShares QQQ ETF for the first time since February.

Already suffering a severe economic crisis, Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has recently been convulsed by clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters.  We need only look to the nation of Venezuela to see what happens when democracy is undermined,  Pence told the gathering of leaders in Miami.  That once-rich nation's collapse into authoritarianism has pushed it into poverty and caused untold suffering for the Venezuelan people.  Stepping up Washington's war of words with Caracas, Pence added:  We must all of us raise our voices to condemn the Venezuelan government for its abuse of power and its abuse of its own people, and we must do it now.  At least 69 people have died in the unrest in Venezuela since early April, with hundreds injured. Opposition has been fanned by Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in his favor. The Maduro government calls the protesters violent coup-mongers, supported by the United States.  I tell the vice president of the United States, get your nose out of Venezuela, there will be no gringo, Yankee, imperialist intervention in Venezuela,  Maduro said in a TV broadcast with members of the armed forces. Maduro added that he read Pence's comments  and it provokes nausea that a man who doesn't know where Venezuela is on the map gives his opinion about our country.  Earlier this month, the United States denounced Venezuela for suppressing protests and called for free elections, saying Maduro must not be allowed to follow a  dictatorship  path like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Pence was at a conference to discuss improving security and economic prosperity in Central America, specifically in the violent nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.  Foreign ministers from across the hemisphere will travel to Cancun, Mexico, next week for a meeting of the Organization of American States, where Venezuela will be discussed.

Sharif was speaking after being grilled by a powerful panel investigating him and his family in an inquiry ordered by the Supreme Court that has gripped Pakistan and become increasingly politicized.  What is happening here is not about corruption allegations against me, it is about slandering the businesses and accounts of my family,  a defiant Sharif, clad in traditional shalwar kameez tunic and trousers, said as he read from a statement. Sharif, 67, spent about three hours at the offices of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) in the capital, Islamabad, becoming the first Pakistani prime minister to be questioned by an investigative agency.      No corruption charges have been proven against me in the past and, inshallah (God willing), it will not be so once again,  he said. The Supreme Court agreed last year to investigate the Sharif family's offshore wealth after the opposition threatened protests after the leaking of the  Panama Papers .     Documents leaked from the Panama-based Mossack Fonseca law firm appeared to show that Sharif's daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy luxury properties in London. The Supreme Court ruled in April there was insufficient evidence to remove Sharif from office over corruption allegations leveled by the opposition, but it ordered further investigations.     Sharif, whose father was a prominent industrialist, has said his family wealth was acquired legally. A three-time prime minister, Sharif was ousted twice in the 1990s, including in a 1999 military coup. He later lived in exile, mostly in Saudi Arabia. Hussain Nawaz (C), the son of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arrives to appear before the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed by the Supreme Court to investigate the Sharif's family offshore firms and properties linked with the Panama leaks, in Islamabad, Pakistan, May 30, 2017.Faisal MahmoodHe swept back to power in an election in 2013 but rumors of tension between his government and the powerful military, which oversees the foreign relations and national security, occasionally circulate. 'Suspicious' Sharif suggested that unidentified enemies acting behind the scenes should be stopped from trying to subvert the wishes of the electorate that handed his party victory in a 2013 general election.  If the factories that produce agendas and silence the decisions of the people are not closed, then not only the law and constitution, but the safety of this country will also be jeopardized,  he said. Pakistan has been plagued by pervasive corruption for decades, with politicians often accusing rivals of underhand dealings. The Supreme Court has given the panel two months to investigate the family and then deliver its findings. The six-man panel, made up of members of civilian investigative agencies and military intelligence officers, are examining three generations of Sharif family wealth. The team has accused government departments of tampering with old records, but Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday rejected such allegations, adding that the team's claims meant the process was becoming  suspicious , media reported. Sharif's camp has sought to remove two members of the investigation team  and his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party voiced outrage over a leaked photograph taken from security camera footage showing Sharif's son, Hussain, appearing before the panel.

As a fiduciary, I have no idea how anyone can invest in China.” Famed for his successful bet against the U.S. housing market during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Bass said Hayman’s short position in the yuan, or renmimbi (RMB), is a “core” position and has “always been meaningful.” Bass, who has long argued that the Chinese yuan is set to fall 30 percent against the U.S. dollar, identified fresh warning signs that China’s credit problems have spread. These include how the five-year MTN yield, trading at 5 percent, has exceeded the bank loan rate, about 4.75 percent, for the first time, and that Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bass also highlighted concerns about China's capital controls and the country's shadow-banking system.  Indeed, CBRC vice-chairman Cao Yu said China established 12,836 creditor committees by the end of last year, to help manage credit of 14.85 trillion yuan. Bass said this amount represents 20 percent of the loans in Chinese banks, net of mortgages. Bass said he believes non-performing loans at Chinese financial institutions are running at a 20 percent rate, not the 1.7 percent rate that has been widely reported. “In fact, 14.85 trillion is more than all of the equity in the entire banking system,” he said. “The Chinese have masterfully swept all of this under the rug.” As credit conditions have tightened in the world's second-largest economy, borrowing costs for companies have been rising. Banks are raising lending rates, including mortgage rates, and are wary of taking on more exposure to overheated sectors such as property. That trend will set the stage for a gradual slowdown in economic activity in coming months, analysts believe, though no one foresees a sharp decline as stability is the watchword ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year Bass said China's Anbang Insurance Group, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets whose chairman has been detained by the police, illustrates China business risks.     Anbang has raised money by selling high-yielding, high-risk, short-term life insurance policies with death benefits,  Bass said.  They have the ultimate problem with extremely short-term liabilities funding very long-term assets. Anbang is just the beginning of a very large problem with asset-liabilty mismatches in China's financial system.  Bass noted that he has not always been a China bear and said China has been looking to force out one-way bearish bets on the yuan with second change this year in how the currency's guidance rate is calculated. “This fixing mechanism throws a bit of unknown into the calculation,” he said.  Still, he said he was not throwing in the towel on his short position. “The PBOC wants you to do that,  Bass said.  I don’t know how they can hold this all together. The numbers are telling me that we are right. The numbers are getting so bad so quickly.” Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by David Gregorio","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-funds-hayman-idUSKBN1962IN"},

(Reuters) - James Hodgkinson ate at local restaurants and complained about the prices, shared donuts with strangers at the YMCA where he hung out, stared into his laptop for hours, and generally drew little attention to himself, said people who encountered him before he opened fire on a congressional baseball team. The shooting on Wednesday in which four people were wounded and Hodgkinson died after being shot by police, erupted after several unremarkable weeks of homeless wandering by the 66-year-old Midwesterner through the historic Virginia city, where the Republican lawmakers' team practiced regularly for an annual charity ballgame versus the Democrats. In Alexandria, across the Potomac River from Washington, the YMCA is a neighborhood hub across the street from the field where Hodgkinson shot Republican Representative Steve Scalise, a congressional aide, a lobbyist and a police officer. Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille, a YMCA regular, said he spoke to Hodgkinson numerous times and even offered him job advice.  He was always there when I arrived, sitting at one of the tables near the coffee machine and on a laptop,” Euille told Reuters.  On the third or fourth day, as I was sitting there having my coffee ... we greeted each other and exchanged names.  Hodgkinson arrived in Alexandria from Belleville, Illinois. It was unclear how or why he made his way to Virginia. The FBI said on Wednesday they had reason to believe Hodgkinson had been in the area since March, living out of his white van. He seemed to spend his days in the YMCA lobby, Euille said.  After the two became acquainted, Euille said, Hodgkinson started asking about where to go for breakfast, for happy hours in the evening and for weekend activities. Euille said he suggested some eateries. One was Joe Theismann's Restaurant, where staffers said one waitress recalled seeing Hodgkinson. He complained about the prices. Euille, who was mayor until early 2016, said Hodgkinson asked for job advice, saying he was a home inspector. Euille said he referred him to the City of Alexandria’s website because local governments often hire inspectors. The two men never talked about politics, Euille said. It became apparent after the shooting that Hodgkinson had posted angry messages against President Donald Trump and other Republicans on social media. Euille said Hodgkinson usually only spoke routinely with him and with the front desk manager on the morning shift at the YMCA.  If he was on his laptop and he came across something that was funny or a joke, he would say 'Hey Bill! Come over here! I want to show you something!'  Hodgkinson's daily routine was to sit for hours in the YMCA, looking at his laptop, not using the exercise equipment, but sometimes using the sauna, Euille said. At the time, Euille said he did not realize Hodgkinson was living out of his van. He said he noticed one day that Hodgkinson's gym bag contained not only gym gear,  but all of his worldly possessions,  including toiletries, books, and street clothes.  I didn’t sense anything ill about him. He was always rational ... I just felt sympathy for him,  Euille said. He said Hodgkinson brought powdered donuts and cookies and pastries into the YMCA,  like he was trying to become friends with other members,  he recalled.  He had them sitting out on the table ... and he would say 'Hey please join and have a pastry. Have a donut.'  Euille said he spoke to the FBI on Wednesday about his encounters with the shooter. Residents of Del Ray, the Alexandria neighborhood where Hodgkinson opened fire, said the white van was discovered by police in the YMCA's parking lot next to the field. The area was roped off as part of an active crime scene investigation on Thursday. Reporting by Sarah N.

Already suffering a severe economic crisis, Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has recently been convulsed by clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters.  We need only look to the nation of Venezuela to see what happens when democracy is undermined,  Pence told the gathering of leaders in Miami.  That once-rich nation's collapse into authoritarianism has pushed it into poverty and caused untold suffering for the Venezuelan people.  Stepping up Washington's war of words with Caracas, Pence added:  We must all of us raise our voices to condemn the Venezuelan government for its abuse of power and its abuse of its own people, and we must do it now.  At least 69 people have died in the unrest in Venezuela since early April, with hundreds injured. Opposition has been fanned by Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in his favor. The Maduro government calls the protesters violent coup-mongers, supported by the United States.  I tell the vice president of the United States, get your nose out of Venezuela, there will be no gringo, Yankee, imperialist intervention in Venezuela,  Maduro said in a TV broadcast with members of the armed forces. Maduro added that he read Pence's comments  and it provokes nausea that a man who doesn't know where Venezuela is on the map gives his opinion about our country.  Earlier this month, the United States denounced Venezuela for suppressing protests and called for free elections, saying Maduro must not be allowed to follow a  dictatorship  path like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Pence was at a conference to discuss improving security and economic prosperity in Central America, specifically in the violent nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.  Foreign ministers from across the hemisphere will travel to Cancun, Mexico, next week for a meeting of the Organization of American States, where Venezuela will be discussed.

Stock ETFs listed in the United States attracted $17.7 billion during the week ended June 14, according to the research service, while their mutual fund counterparts recorded $6.8 billion of outflows in their largest week of withdrawals since April. Mutual funds are heavily favored by retail investors, while ETFs draw an increasingly diverse set of clients, including fast-trading hedge funds. The result came as investors grappled with pressure on oil prices, soft economic data and an interest-rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the second rate hike this year.  Mom and pop are easily scared: they've been hearing about the market meltdown, and it's overvalued, and it's time to sell, cash is your friend - stuff like that,  said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.  On the flip side, there was really no reason for the meltdown.  Taxable bond funds, an ostensibly safer alternative to stocks, managed to pull in $3.5 billion. Yet thanks to ETF buyers, domestic-focused stock funds pulled in $11.4 billion, the most since February. The selloff was  overplayed,  said Roseen, adding that  some people saw it as a buying opportunity.  A massive rotation out of technology shares, such as the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - and into beaten-down sectors, including financials, that began last Friday and resumed this week. U.S.-based financial sector funds pulled in $2.3 billion, the most since November, as the Fed hiked rates in a boon for bank lending rates. But technology sector stocks posted $444 million in withdrawals during the week, the most since September, according to the research service. Tech stocks took over as the leaders of the ongoing stock rally as market segments popular in the immediate aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump's November election, such as financials and small-company stocks, faltered earlier this year. Now by contrast, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund is on course to deliver higher one-month returns for June than the tech-heavy PowerShares QQQ ETF for the first time since February.

A week ago, President Donald Trump's administration and 14 Republican U.S. senators said they wanted the spying authority to be renewed without any changes before it expires at the end of the year. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act adopted by Congress in 2008, including a controversial part known as Section 702, broadened the U.S. government's legal authority to conduct surveillance of phone calls, emails and other communications belonging to foreigners who live overseas. U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. allies consider the law vital to national security, but privacy advocates have criticized Section 702 for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to an unknown number of Americans without a search warrant.  Government surveillance activities under the FISA Amendments Act have violated Americans' constitutionally protected rights,  the group of about three dozen lawmakers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement.  We oppose any reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act that does not include substantial reforms to the government's collection and use of Americans' data.  The caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has already had success in challenging the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership on other policy issues. It opposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on grounds that it did not do enough to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare law, earning concessions on a bill that passed the House in May. The intraparty dissent among Republicans in Congress over Section 702 resembles a debate that took place two years ago, when lawmakers disagreed sharply over whether to curtail a National Security Agency program that collected U.S. call metadata in bulk - a practice exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The dispute led to the brief expiration of the USA Patriot Act before lawmakers passed a law effectively terminating the bulk collection practice. The extent of Section 702 spying was also revealed in disclosures by Snowden, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. On Wednesday, a declassified court document, made public in response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, revealed that an unidentified U.S. technology company objected in 2014 to participating in a Section 702 program, but was ordered by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to comply.

The lawsuit, filed this week in a New Jersey state court, targets Joe Pisarcik, who played quarterback for the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles in the 1970s and 1980s before becoming CEO of the NFL Alumni Association. He retired from the group this year. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey-based NFL Alumni Association declined to comment on the lawsuit and Pisarcik and a spokesman for the NFL could not be reached. The civil action was filed on Monday by Carolyn Slickmeyer, who was Pisarcik's executive assistant, and by the association's former marketing manager, Rebecca Kelly, and former membership representative Brianna Greco. All three were hired in 2015. The association  not only tolerated, but encouraged, a grossly sexist culture in which their highest-level employee, the chief executive officer Joseph Pisarcik, freely subjected plaintiffs to outrageous and degrading sex-based conduct,  the lawsuit said. Pisarcik  made it clear  to the three women that he was attracted to them and  wanted to engage with them sexually,  it said. He once smacked Slickmeyer on her backside with mail, the suit said. On another occasion, when she was in his office, he smacked her buttocks with his hand, it said. He also is accused of massaging the women's shoulders and backs and braiding two of the women's hair. The women submitted complaints about Pisarcik to association officials in March, accusing him of sexual harassment. Later that month, the company announced Pisarcik's retirement, saying he wanted to spend more time with family. Their suit seeks compensatory damages but does not specify an amount.  When Pisarcik played for the Giants, he was at the center of a bizarre play in November 1978 known as  The Miracle in the Meadowlands  or  The Fumble.  With the Giants winning against the Philadelphia Eagles and the game almost over, spectators had expected Pisarcik to kneel with the ball to run out the clock. Instead he tried to hand it off to a running back and fumbled the ball. An Eagles player picked it up and ran for the winning touchdown.

I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now - short term - at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,  Bezos, one of the world's richest people with a net worth of more than $76 billion, said in a Twitter post.  If you have ideas, just reply to this tweet with the idea (and if you think this approach is wrong, would love to hear that too.)  The request signaled a shift for Bezos, who has invested in longer-term bets like space exploration and kept quieter about other givings. The e-commerce executive has said he will sell about $1 billion of Amazon stock annually to fund his company Blue Origin, which aims to cut the cost of space travel and kick off entrepreneurship in the cosmos. For philanthropy, Bezos has supported a foundation run by his parents that focuses on education. His family has also given more than $40 million to Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, not far from Amazon's headquarters. Still, Bezos has yet to make charity a cornerstone of his work, like Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Bill Gates or Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Mark Zuckerberg have. Bezos has not joined them and 167 other of the world's richest people in pledging to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropy. Asked in an interview with Charlie Rose last year if he one day would rival Gates' magnanimity, Bezos joked,  Well, yeah, if there is anything left after I finish building Blue Origin.

Home runs in four consecutive games will bring that kind of attention, but the Chicago White Sox rookie designated hitter is taking it all in stride.  I'm just trying to ignore everything outside and take every pitch for what it's worth and be relaxed up there,  said Davidson, who went 2-for-4 with a home run and scored twice on Thursday in a 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.  It proves that (with) all the hard work you've done that it can happen and it can happen consistently.  Melky Cabrera also went 2-for-5 with two RBIs as the White Sox (29-36) took three of four in the series while the Orioles (32-33) slipped back below the .500 mark with their seventh loss in eight games. Baltimore starter Chris Tillman (1-5) suffered his fifth straight loss while Chicago starter David Holmberg had no decision after allowing just one run in a 4 1/3-inning outing.  Chris has a good track record and he's going to pitch better and hopefully today's the start of that,  said Orioles manager Buck Showalter.  They made him earn everything. He gave us a chance, we're just not scoring any runs.  Right-handed reliever Anthony Swarzak (3-1) worked 1 2/3 innings for the victory. Chicago got off to a slow start despite early scoring opportunities. The White Sox loaded the bases in the second inning and had runners on first and second but came up empty in both innings. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at White SoxBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchDavidson gave Chicago a 1-0 lead with a solo home run to left to lead off the last of the fourth. It was his team-leading 14th of the season.  It's something the whole organization has been hoping that he's capable of doing so he's showing signs obviously that he can do it,  said White Sox manager Rick Renteria. Holmberg, meanwhile, was sharp through the first four innings, allowing just three baserunners while recording three strikeouts. But the Orioles threatened in the fifth with runners at first and second with none out, and Holmberg departed after Ruben Tejada flied out to center. Catcher Caleb Joseph greeted Swarzak with a double to center to score Jonathan Schoop from second base to tie the game 1-1. But Swarzak limited further damage as he struck out Joey Rickard and got Adam Jones to line out to right. Holmberg was charged with the run.  Everything went pretty good, I tried to keep them off the bases for the most part,  said Holmberg.  They've got pretty big power all throughout the lineup. A couple guys got on there in the fifth and I think we did a pretty good job of keeping it to one run there.  In the bottom of the fifth, Renteria and right fielder Avisail Garcia were ejected by first base umpire Paul Emmel after arguing a third strike call on Garcia's one-out at-bat. Chicago loaded the bases on Tillman for the second time in the game in the sixth, this time with none out as the White Sox scored four times. Cabrera bounced a one-out single up the middle to score Davidson and Yolmer Sanchez for a 3-1 lead. That spelled the end for Tillman, who was replaced by right-handed reliever Jimmy Yacabonis. He walked Tim Anderson to again load the bases and issued a base on balls to Jose Abreu to bring home Kevan Smith to make it 4-1. Leury Garcia's sacrifice fly to deep center drove in Cabrera, and Yacabonis then walked Frazier -- the third of the inning -- to again put three runners on base. Right-handed reliever Miguel Castro got Davidson on a called third strike to finally end the inning. Tillman gave up five runs on a season-high 11 hits through 5 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked one.  I never really felt like I was in a huge jam, I feel like from the get-go I was able to make pitches,  Tillman said.  Guys got on base early, but I know that most of those situations you're just one pitch away and you've got to focus on making that pitch.  Welington Castillo slammed a leadoff solo home run in the ninth off Chicago reliever David Robertson. NOTES: Baltimore took the seven-game season series from Chicago, winning four games.

In remarks on Wednesday, Yellen called an emerging debate over raising global inflation targets  one of the most important questions facing monetary policy,  as central bankers grapple with an economic rut in which low growth, low interest rates and weak price and wage increases reinforce each other.     The aim would be a change of households' and businesses' psychology, convincing them that prices would rise fast enough  in the future that they would be better off borrowing and spending more today. Success in anchoring inflation in the 1980s and 1990s defined central banking throughout the developed world. It has  become a core aim of the Fed and an article of faith for Germany's Bundesbank and later the European Central Bank, founded in 1998 with the mandate of maintaining price stability defined as inflation under 2 percent. That 2 percent target, which translates into prices doubling roughly every 35 years and is considered both offering stability and a sufficient buffer from deflation, is now common for the developed world's central banks.  Raising that target to 3 or even 4 percent as some economists have suggested would shift the outlook of firms in particular, allowing them to charge more for goods and pay more for labor without the fear that a central bank would step on the brakes. To be effective, the Fed would have to back that new target with a slower pace of any rate increases than it would otherwise deem appropriate. That could prove risky for the central bank that has repeatedly missed its present target and conditioned people to expect subdued price and wage increases, said Moody's Analytics analyst Ryan Sweet.  The Fed would have to clearly and convincingly communicate the rationale for raising the inflation target and the potential economic benefits. Otherwise the central bank will lose in the court of public opinion.   In a sense, the Fed may be a victim of its own success and Yellen in the past has been skeptical the Fed could change expectations that were anchored by its ability to keep actual inflation low for years by simply raising its goal.  It's a paradox,  said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  There is less response of inflation when the Fed is successful.  By allowing inflation to run higher, the Fed would create more room for nominal interest rates to rise later without crimping economic growth, advocates say. With rates expected to remain historically low, Yellen and her peers are worried that even a mild recession will force them to cut interest rates to zero and deploy crisis-era tools, such as asset purchases, something they could avoid if rates in general were higher. Skeptics, however, question whether lifting the inflation target would have any lasting effect on economic activity. To Lift or Not to Lift During the current eight-year recovery the Fed has steadily marked down its estimates of U.S. economic potential, the interest rate needed to achieve it, and generally failed to get inflation back to 2 percent. Yellen on Wednesday said it may be time for a rethink.  We've learned a lot,  Yellen said about the time since 2012 when the Fed set the inflation target. One conclusion was that interest rates will be stuck at historically low levels unless something changes. Whether to raise the inflation target hoping it could be a catalyst of change  is one of our most critical decisions,  she said in what was the clearest indication of a debate taking shape inside the Fed. Central bankers in Europe, Japan, Britain and elsewhere have begun exploring the option as well, while the Bank of Canada reviews its inflation target every five years Any move is unlikely in the near term.  Policymakers may not like missing their targets, but they also recognize the benefits of only modest price increases brought by central bank policies and a globalizing world economy that helped drive manufacturing costs down. Since the early 1990s median U.S. household income and overall consumer inflation have marched in virtual lock step. Health care and education cost have grown faster, but prices for clothes, furnishings and food have generally increased less or no more than household incomes - benefiting the poor who suffered the most during bouts of high inflation. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2t6NKld) But that may also have created a  sticky  psychology.  Modern monetary policy rests heavily on a central bank’s ability to shape expectations, and the Fed and others have been so successful in keeping inflation down that now they seem unable to shift sentiment in the opposite direction. The Fed is also no longer quite sure about how some basic aspects of the economy are working these days.  At 4.3 percent, the jobless rate is at a 15-year low, yet wage growth is weak and inflation has recently slipped further away from the Fed's goal.  Quite how far it is prepared to go will depend on what Yellen noted was an assessment of  the potential costs that could be associated  with a higher inflation target. Such assessment, however, probably will not be ready during her term, which ends in February 2018.

Henderson recorded an eagle and six birdies at Blythefield Country Club. On a day when new world number one Ariya Jutanugarn carded a pedestrian 70, Henderson had control of all facets of her game. “I felt great from the start,” the 19-year-old Henderson, already a triple winner on the LPGA circuit, told reporters. “Everything was going my way. I was hitting the ball really well and some putts were dropping, which (was) kind of a change from the past few weeks. “I had a really good feeling and made a lot of birdies, a lot of putts. I feel my game is in a really good place.”  Thompson, coming off a crushing playoff loss on Sunday, got straight back in the saddle with five consecutive mid-round birdies en route to her 64. The American frittered away the Manulife LPGA Classic in Ontario on Sunday by three-putting the final two holes of regulation before falling to Ariya in a three-way playoff. Noted as a strong driver, she was in control off the tee again on Thursday. “This is definitely a great layout for my game,” she said. (I) hit a lot of drivers, which is nice. That’s my strength.

Apple <AAPL.O., Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O), the five largest U.S. technology stocks, have seen their combined market capitalization fall by about $120 billion since last Thursday.  By Thursday the S&P; 500 technology index .SPLRCT had seen its largest five-day drop in a year.  The slide was again led by sector heavyweights Apple and Alphabet, as investors moved away from what had been the year's best-performing sector and rotated portfolios into stocks that pay higher dividends amid some signs that U.S. economic weakness.  “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,  said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts.     Among technology stocks hit, shares of Google's parent Alphabet fell 0.8 percent Thursday after broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to  hold  from  buy.  The broker downgrade triggered a broader technology sector selloff according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.   Apple shares slid 0.6 percent on Thursday, extending their five-day decline to 6.9 percent. Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which  could mean a bumpy ride lower  if the prospects for sales of its next phone disappoint.  Shares of social media company Snap Inc (SNAP.N) closed at their initial public offering price of $17 for the first time. Some investors were selling technology shares to rotate into other sectors, such as beaten-down energy stocks, said Russ Koesterich, co-portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund. “It’s more the winners into the losers, rather than a broader move toward safety,” he said. The recent decline notwithstanding, the technology sector remains the best performing so far this year, up 17.4 percent versus the overall S&P; 500 index gain of 8.6 percent. FILE PHOTO --  The audience assembles before the start of Apple's annual developer conference in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.Stephen Lam/File PhotoRotation to Value Amid Weak u.s. Economic Data  Companies including Apple and Google parent Alphabet have seen their stock prices soar in 2017, and their heavy weightings in benchmark stock indexes prompted concerns that overall market gains are too concentrated in a handful of large technology firms.   We had sensed over the last 4-5 weeks that clients were becoming uncomfortable with the clustering of returns to the S&P; 500 , said Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS Securities.  It felt to us that you had the elixir for a correction in the (technology) sector.  Concern over the earlier gains in technology stocks this year has been compounded by some recent weak U.S. economic data. Last month, the U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs, well below the expected gain of 185,000. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in May, marking the largest one-month decline since January of last year. Also, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, the second drop in inflation in three months. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November. U.S. Treasury yields tumbled to their lowest since early November on Wednesday on the weak data.  Tech is one of the losing sectors when the interest rate trade is dominating because rates are falling,  said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen, because investors need to look for higher yield in dividend paying stocks. Resilience in S&P; 500 Benchmark Despite the 3.7 percent drop for technology stocks .SPLRCT over the past five sessions, the S&P; 500 .SPX index has barely budged, slipping just 0.05 percent over the same period. The resilience in the S&P; 500 benchmark has resulted from investors rotating their portfolios into other sectors such as financials and the more defensive sectors like real estate .SPLRCR.   It definitely feels like a rotation that's gone on for a few days with tech being weakened,  said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.  What's done well in the last few days is the more bond-like plays.

As the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) praised New Zealand for its  enviable  robust growth, official data showed the economy expanding just 0.5 percent in the first quarter, barely over half the central bank's forecast. Construction activity fell for the first time since June 2015, highlighting how the shortage of skilled labour and other capacity constraints impede the country's ability to build houses fast enough to match record migration and contain soaring prices. The OECD said high household debt levels were a concern, as it published its biennial country report, and called on authorities to add debt-to-income limits (DTI) on home loans to the  macro-prudential  policy toolkit. The OECD saw the economy growing 3.1 percent in 2017, in line with central bank forecasts, but said New Zealand needed to tackle labour productivity that lagged those of its OECD peers.  I would say that the fact that we've had moderate GDP growth now for the last six months is a reminder to everyone not to take the New Zealand economic performance for granted,  Finance Minister Steven Joyce said at a news conference in Wellington, held with OECD Chief Economist Catherine Mann. New Zealand has been among the fastest-growing economies in recent years but there is an increasing discrepancy between official forecasts and those of private economists who see capacity constraints retarding rapid growth. Softer growth is seen as likely to add to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's determination to keep interest rates at record lows for years, as it focuses on stoking inflation. First-quarter growth was below the central bank's 0.9 percent forecast and the 0.7 percent forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Annual growth was 2.5 percent, undershooting market expectations for a steady 2.7 percent. Construction fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter but was still up 9.3 percent on the year, reflecting the sector's strong growth in 2016, Statistics New Zealand said. The New Zealand dollar fell to $0.7246 from around $0.7265 before the data, and was last at $0.7218. Construction Drag The fall in construction activity comes at a time when New Zealand's housing market, which has soared more than 50 percent in value in the last decade, has sparked fears that high mortgage debt could pose a systemic risk in the event of a sharp downturn in property prices. Even though price growth has slowed in recent months, the RBNZ said in a consultation paper last week it saw  significant net benefits  in debt-to-income limits on home loans. Finance Minister Steven Joyce said DTI limits needed to be examined closely because they demanded a tricky balancing act between supply and demand:  There's no free lunch in economics in that demand management tools can also soften supply responses.  OECD's Mann called on the New Zealand government to add DTI restrictions to its policy arsenal, but also urged officials to consider consequent costs and benefits, noting that while DTI limits could protect the most financially vulnerable they could also freeze low-income earners out of the housing market.  It needs to be in the toolkit,  she said.  It seems that the banks themselves have started to look more carefully at some of these indicators whether or not it's required. Especially in an environment where interest rates in the global economy are probably on the rise, banks are making those judgements.

In a move that could complicate U.S. President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow, the Senate backed the measure by 98-2. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two  no  votes. The measure is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for Syria's government in the six-year-long civil war. If passed in the House of Representatives and signed into law by Trump, it would put into law sanctions previously established via former President Barack Obama's executive orders, including some on Russian energy projects. The legislation also allows new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways and targets Russians guilty of conducting cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syria's government.  The legislation sends a very, very strong signal to Russia, the nefarious activities they've been involved in,  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as lawmakers debated the measure. If the measure became law, it could complicate relations with some countries in Europe. Germany and Austria said the new punitive measures could expose European companies involved in projects in Russia to fines. Related CoverageWhite House says existing sanctions against Russia are effectiveThe legislation sets up a review process that would require Trump to get Congress' approval before taking any action to ease, suspend or lift any sanctions on Russia. Trump was especially effusive about Russian president Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, though his openness to closer ties to Moscow has tempered somewhat, with his administration on the defensive over investigations into Russian meddling in the election. Putin dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washington's policy of imposing sanctions on Moscow had always been to try to contain Russia. National flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe bill also includes new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers. Uncertain Path in House To become law, the legislation must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. House aides said they expected the chamber would begin to debate the measure in coming weeks.  Eric ThayerHowever, they could not predict if it would come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess. Senior aides told Reuters they expected some sanctions package would eventually pass, but they expected the measure would be changed in the House. The Trump administration has pushed back against the bill, and his fellow Republicans hold a commanding 238- to 193-seat majority in the chamber. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson questioned the legislation on Wednesday, urging Congress to ensure that any sanctions package  allows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation.  Previously, U.S. energy sanctions had only targeted Russia's future high-tech energy projects, such as drilling for oil in the Arctic, fracking and offshore drilling. They blocked U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil, where Tillerson was chairman, from investing in such projects. The new bill would slap sanctions on companies in other countries looking to invest in those projects in the absence of U.S. companies, a practice known as backfilling. Also included for the first time are discretionary measures the Trump administration could impose on investments by companies in Western countries on Russia energy export pipelines to Europe. The Senate also voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to add provisions to the bill allowing the U.S. space agency NASA to continue using Russian-made rocket engines and the 100 senators voted unanimously for an amendment reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.

The Justice Department informed a Booz Allen unit of the investigation earlier this month, Booz Allen said in the brief regulatory filing, adding that it was cooperating with the government. The company declined to comment beyond the filing and an identical statement it posted on its website. Public affairs representatives at the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment, but the agency as a rule does not make statements about ongoing investigations. The firm said its audit processes had not identified any material weaknesses or  significant erroneous cost charging.  (bit.ly/2rB0v5C) Headquartered in McLean, Virginia near the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. capital, Booz Allen generates almost all its revenue from government work. According to its latest annual report, the company receives nearly half of its revenues, $2.7 billion, from defense contracts, and nearly a quarter, $1.3 billion, from intelligence offices such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It also brings in about $1.6 billion from contracts with Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Veteran Affairs, Treasury and Justice and other domestic departments. Booz Allen gained attention for its NSA work. It employed Edward Snowden, who exposed the agency's vast domestic and international surveillance operations by leaking a trove of secret files to news organizations in 2013. Then, for the second time in three years, an employee working under an NSA contract was charged last year with stealing classified information.

More than $3 billion, or over 4 percent, has been wiped off the collective market value of six companies - Wesfarmers Ltd (WES.AX), Woolworths Ltd (WOW.AX), JB Hi-Fi Ltd (JBH.AX), Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd (HVN.AX) Super Retail Group Ltd (SUL.AX) and Myer Holdings Ltd (MYR.AX) - and Morgan Stanley analysts predict Amazon's entry will knock 2-15 percent off what their annual sales would have been by 2026. But some fund managers, who have since increased their retail holdings, reckon the sell-down was overdone, and dire warnings in some media that the $460 billion U.S. e-commerce giant would  destroy  Australia's traditional retail industry were overblown. That's largely based on Amazon making no mention - yet - of when it might sell its array of goods directly in Australia, let alone launch its star business: the $99 a year subscription shopping club Prime, whose members, Amazon says, buy more goods, more often. That contrasts with other countries, including Spain and Mexico, where Amazon launched many product categories and Marketplace at around the same time. The logic of not initially introducing Prime to Australia seems straightforward, logistics experts say. Prime's big selling point in most markets is that it guarantees delivery of ordered goods within 48 hours. Australia's sheer size puts this, literally, out of reach for now. While most of the country's 24 million population live on the coastal fringes of an island almost the size of the United States, there's little infrastructure in place to deliver packages to the more remote western and northern states.  Given they haven't set up yet, and Australians already use the internet quite a lot for some purchases, it's a bit of an over-reaction,  said Anton Tagliaferro, investment director at Investors Mutual Ltd, which has since increased its stake in department store chain Myer. Similarly, fund manager Martin Currie Australia has raised its stake in electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi to 7 percent after Amazon's announcement. Companies like JB Hi-Fi  are very dominant, and profitable retailers in Australia with leverage to population growth and housing will be well placed when Amazon begins to operate,  said Reece Birtles, the fund manager's chief investment officer. Shares in Wesfarmers, which owns the Coles grocery chain, have slipped 8 percent since April amid concerns about the impact of Amazon's arrival on its Kmart and Target discount department stores. For grocery, Amazon has struggled to bring produce sales online in the United States. James McGlew, executive director at Argonaut Ltd, which owns Wesfarmers stock, said there was  still a case to be made for owning Wesfarmers in the longer term, but we're cognitive of standing in front of trains and trying to stop them.  Wesfarmers, which last month cited market conditions for cancelling a spin-off listing of its Officeworks stationary business, has said its 4,000-store network leaves it well placed for when Amazon arrives. Myer CEO Richard Umbers said in an email,  We are firmly focused on delivering the New Myer strategy, which we believe is the best response to any competitor,  noting an emphasis on  memorable in-store experiences , popular brands and investment in a  strong growth  omnichannel offer. FILE PHOTO: The Amazon Books store is seen in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in New York City, New York, U.S., May 25, 2017.Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoA spokeswoman for JB Hi-Fi declined to comment. Amazon, which is advertising dozens of jobs in Australia, referred to a statement it made in April that it was planning a retail business in the country with low prices and fast delivery, without offering more details. Travel Fatigue Marketplace's appeal to third-party sellers is access to Amazon's vast pool of shoppers, who have been hooked on a large product catalog and speedy shipping. The two Australian freight firms seen most likely to deliver locally for Amazon - government-owned Australia Post and Japan Post's (6178.T) Toll Group - do not guarantee regular two-day parcel delivery to anywhere in Western Australia beyond the city of Perth, or to the Northern Territory. Those two areas, about the size of Western Europe, are home to 800,000 people who would have to be reached if Prime were launched nationwide.  They don't have the infrastructure yet,  said a former Amazon executive who didn't want to be named.  If I don't have any infrastructure there, to start with the hardest problem wouldn't make sense,  the person said of last-mile delivery. To deliver to Broome, a town of about 16,000 people in Western Australia, for example, a freight firm typically trucks or flies a package to Perth from a warehouse 1,700 miles (2,736 km) away on the other side of the country, then drives it another 1,400 miles north. Australia Post says it can fly a package from Sydney to Broome in a day, but its standard air freight time for that route, by plane and truck via Perth, is three days. Toll and Australia Post declined to comment on Amazon.  I can see exactly why any of those majors would be reticent to stump up a guarantee that they can do it in that (two-day) timeframe,  said Brendan Richards, a logistics specialist at corporate restructuring firm Ferrier Hodgson.  It's a big country to service with not much infrastructure taking freight into the middle of it.   Amazon may get around that by offering an express delivery service to some cities but not others, said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon Marketplace manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group.  Historically, Amazon has opened new markets without Prime initially,  Jacobson noted.  The products eligible for Prime, which tend to be the fastest selling items, can differ from market to market; and so part of launching a market is identifying the most important products to include.  The company has also shown it can bend its two-day rule for important markets, saying last year it would offer Prime in China with estimated shipping of 5-9 days. If it wants to bring the shopping club to Australia without compromising its two-day guarantee, Amazon may need to open distribution centers on the west and north coasts, or pay for daily air deliveries, said Carl Hartmann, CEO of logistics software maker Temando.  If they're planning a true nationwide Prime offering, there's some cost considerations to do it carte blanche,  he said.  There are challenges with the unit economics in that model which either challenge profitability or feasibility.

(Reuters) - The scene outside the courthouse where 12 jurors are determining Bill Cosby's fate at his sexual assault trial devolved on Thursday into a circus-like atmosphere, complete with dramatic confrontations, marching drummers and a bubble machine. Cosby, 79, was inside the courthouse waiting for the jury verdict on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, then a college administrator, in 2004.  The jury told Judge Steven O'Neill earlier in the day it was deadlocked after more than 30 hours of deliberations but he ordered them to continue. On the steps of the courthouse, plenty of people had already made up their minds.  It went from being a joke to all of this calamity,  said a man holding a sign that read  Free Mr. Cosby  who would only give his first name, Garvey.  Everything I heard points to him being innocent.  The once-beloved comedian has been accused of sexual abuse by approximately 60 women, but only Constand's allegations have led to criminal charges. Cosby has denied all of the claims. Two drummers join a demonstration in support of victims of sexual violence outside the Montgomery County Courthouse where Bill Cosby is waiting for deliberations to finish in his sexual assault trial in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 15, 2017.Lucas JacksonSeveral of the women, who have been awaiting a verdict all week, got into arguments with a number of Cosby supporters who appeared at the trial for the first time on Thursday. With television cameras capturing every moment, Lili Bernard, who has accused Cosby of raping her while she was a guest star on his 1980s hit TV series  The Cosby Show,  read a Bible passage aloud to Cosby defenders before tearfully hugging a friend.

Allison held the woman's hand as she tried to persuade her to change her mind and told the woman she would have had the same opinion if she had never been alone in a room with Cosby. Minutes later, the sound of drumming filled the air as a woman carrying a sign reading  Perseverance To All Survivors  pranced down the sidewalk firing a bubble machine. Two men wearing dark plastic masks and carrying drums marched behind her. Earlier in the week, the woman had driven a U-Haul truck around the courthouse with a drawing of a middle finger with Cosby's name on it plastered to the outside. As the rhythmic drumming continued, Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy bunny from the 1960s who says Cosby assaulted her decades ago, danced to the music on the courthouse steps.

The Justice Department informed a Booz Allen unit of the investigation earlier this month, Booz Allen said in the brief regulatory filing, adding that it was cooperating with the government. The company declined to comment beyond the filing and an identical statement it posted on its website. Public affairs representatives at the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment, but the agency as a rule does not make statements about ongoing investigations. The firm said its audit processes had not identified any material weaknesses or  significant erroneous cost charging.  (bit.ly/2rB0v5C) Headquartered in McLean, Virginia near the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. capital, Booz Allen generates almost all its revenue from government work. According to its latest annual report, the company receives nearly half of its revenues, $2.7 billion, from defense contracts, and nearly a quarter, $1.3 billion, from intelligence offices such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It also brings in about $1.6 billion from contracts with Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Veteran Affairs, Treasury and Justice and other domestic departments. Booz Allen gained attention for its NSA work. It employed Edward Snowden, who exposed the agency's vast domestic and international surveillance operations by leaking a trove of secret files to news organizations in 2013. Then, for the second time in three years, an employee working under an NSA contract was charged last year with stealing classified information.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 3859 which allows faith-based groups working with the Texas child welfare system to deny services  under circumstances that conflict with the provider's sincerely held religious beliefs.  It was supported by several Christian groups. The bill's sponsor, Republican Representative James Frank, said on social media, HB 3859 bans no one  and has a mechanism for the state to offer alternative providers to anyone denied the right to be adoptive or foster parents because of the provider's religious beliefs. He said the legislation would help troubled children find homes. Abbott's office was not immediately available for comment. Democrats and civil rights groups said the bill could allow private, faith-based agencies to block parents who practice a different religion or who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. LGBT rights groups have said they would challenge the adoption bill in court, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state.  This law's clear intent is to allow service providers that receive state tax dollars to misuse religion as a license to discriminate against LGBT families and children in the state’s child-welfare system,  said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a civil rights group.

Minnesota's AA-plus general obligation and other credit ratings were placed on a watch list by S&P; in the wake of Governor Mark Dayton's line-item veto of funding for the state legislature in the fiscal 2018-2019 budget. The veto left $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a legislative office facility without money to make rental and debt payments next due in November and December, according to S&P.;  If the stalemate continues and increases, in our view, the likelihood of nonpayment or the nonappropriation leads to a termination of the lease and an extraordinary mandatory redemption of the bonds, then we could lower our ratings on the state as well as associated ratings by several notches,  S&P; said in a statement. It added if the state is able to meet its contractual obligation for the debt over the next three months, the ratings would remain at their current levels. However, the ratings' outlook, which had been positive, would likely be revised to stable due to the state's departure from  very strong budget management.  Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Myron Frans defended the governor's veto, saying it was aimed at urging the legislature to reduce some tax cuts that could hurt the state's financial stability going forward.  As the state’s chief financial officer I want to express the state’s commitment to fiscal integrity and financial obligations generally,  Frans said in a statement, adding that Dayton is working to resolve the matter. Lawmakers in the Republican-controlled legislature sued the Democratic governor on Tuesday, claiming his May 30 veto of nearly $130 million for salaries, benefits and operating expenses was unconstitutional.

The lawsuit comes at a time of increased focus on how airlines treat passengers after an April video went viral of United Airlines passenger David Dao being dragged from his seat to make way for a crew member. According to Thursday's complaint, an unmoored, fully stocked, 300-pound beverage cart struck Charles Johnson in the head after it flew down the aisle on Flight 1941 to Charlotte, North Carolina from Hartford, Connecticut on April 28, 2016. Johnson said the impact caused his hat to be ripped off his head and resulted in a large forehead gash, severe bleeding and a loss of consciousness. But rather than land, the pilot flew on more than two hours to Charlotte, as a nurse and other passengers cared for Johnson because the cabin crew did not know how, the complaint said.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 3859 which allows faith-based groups working with the Texas child welfare system to deny services  under circumstances that conflict with the provider's sincerely held religious beliefs.  It was supported by several Christian groups. The bill's sponsor, Republican Representative James Frank, said on social media, HB 3859 bans no one  and has a mechanism for the state to offer alternative providers to anyone denied the right to be adoptive or foster parents because of the provider's religious beliefs.  He said the legislation would help troubled children find homes.  Abbott's office was not immediately available for comment. Democrats and civil rights groups said the bill could allow private, faith-based agencies to block parents who practice a different religion or who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  LGBT rights groups have said they would challenge the adoption bill in court, arguing discrimination in the name of religion had no place in the state.  This law's clear intent is to allow service providers that receive state tax dollars to misuse religion as a license to discriminate against LGBT families and children in the state’s child-welfare system,  said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a civil rights group.

The flu strain, known as H7N9, now mostly infects birds but it has infected at least 779 people in outbreaks in and around China, mainly related to poultry markets.  The World Health Organization said earlier this year that all bird flu viruses need constant monitoring, warning that their constantly changing nature makes them  a persistent and significant threat to public health . At the moment, the H7N9 virus does not have the capability to spread sustainably from person to person. But scientists are worried it could at any time mutate into a form that does.  To assess this risk, researchers led by James Paulson of the Scripps Research Institute in California looked at mutations that could potentially take place in the H7N9 virus's genome. They focused on the H7 hemagglutanin, a protein on the flu virus surface that allows it to latch onto host cells.  The team's findings, published in the journal PLoS Pathogens on Thursday, showed that in laboratory tests, mutations in three amino acids made the virus more able to bind to human cells - suggesting these changes are key to making the virus more dangerous to people. Scientists not directly involved in this study said its findings were important, but should not cause immediate alarm.  This study will help us to monitor the risk posed by bird flu in a more informed way, and increasing our knowledge of which changes in bird flu viruses could be potentially dangerous will be very useful in surveillance,  said Fiona Culley, an expert in respiratory immunology at Imperial College London. She noted that while  some of the individual mutations have been seen naturally, ... these combinations of mutations have not , and added:  The chances of all three occurring together is relatively low.   Wendy Barclay, a virologist and flu specialist also at Imperial, said the study's findings were important in showing why H7N9 bird flu should be kept under intense surveillance.   These studies keep H7N9 virus high on the list of viruses we should be concerned about,  she said.  The more people infected, the higher the chance that the lethal combination of mutations could occur.

Where they could, workers used the original bricks that had broken off the wall over the centuries. When they found none, they used new bricks made to exacting specifications.  We have to stick to the original format, the original material and the original craftsmanship, so that we can better preserve the historical and cultural values,  said Cheng Yongmao, the engineer leading Jiankou's restoration. Cheng, 61, who has repaired 17 km (11 miles) of the Great Wall since 2003, belongs to the 16th generation in a long line of traditional brick makers. A government clampdown on pollution has forced the closure of almost all brick-making factories in Beijing and nearby provinces, Cheng said. If he ran out of bricks, Cheng added, he would have to look for bricks left elsewhere or request the central government to consider reopening some brick factories. Cheng Yongmao, the engineer in charge of the reconstruction project on the Jiankou section of the Great Wall, looks as the sun rises over the wall, located in Huairou District, north of Beijing, China, June 7, 2017.Damir Sagolj      Concrete Pavement Famed for its rugged beauty, Jiankou, which is Chinese for an arrow's nock, or notch for a bowstring, was built in the twilight years of the Ming dynasty in the 1600s, but is young compared with other sections dating back two millennia. Slideshow (25 Images)Intensive repairs on the Jiankou section in the past year have been led by the district government keen to preserve the wall's natural beauty and shore up its disintegrating steps. The restoration began in 2005 and is now in its third phase, making slow progress because the uneven terrain allows use only of basic tools such as chisels, hammers, pickaxes and shovels.  Authorities' meticulous approach followed widespread outrage last year sparked by botched restoration efforts on some stretches. Authorities in the northeastern province of Liaoning, home to a 700-year-old section of the wall, paved its ramparts with sand and cement, resulting in what critics said looked more like a pedestrian pavement.  Soon after, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage said it would investigate any improperly executed wall preservation projects.  Just a tenth of the wall built during the Ming dynasty has been repaired, said Dong Yaohui, vice president of the China Great Wall Association.     In the past, we would restore the walls so that they would be visited as tourist hot spots,  he said, by contrast with today's objective of repairing and preserving them for future generations.  This is progress.

It is that lucrative line of business that President Donald Trump will target when he rolls out his new Cuba policy Friday in Miami, the heart of the country's hard-line exile community, according to U.S. officials who have seen a draft presidential memorandum. Trump will significantly restrict U.S. companies from doing business with some military-linked enterprises, the officials said.  “Any ban on using military-owned tourism facilities would make it very difficult to bring groups larger than seven people because for logistical reasons you need to work with the government,” Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, said. The number of Americans traveling to Cuba, mostly in large groups due to U.S. regulations, has nearly tripled in recent years and was expected to reach around 400,000 in 2017, according to U.S. travel agencies. Trump's expected limits on U.S. business deals will target the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy that is headed up by General Luis Alberto Rodriguez, reportedly President Raul Castro’s son-in-law. That is bad news for the pro-engagement U.S. politicians and hundreds of businesses that flocked to Cuba in the last few years in search of new opportunities.  The only hotel deal struck to date may prove the last for now, at least in the capital. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which is owned by Marriott International Inc,  signed on to manage a Gaviota hotel in Havana under the Sheraton brand which opened in 2016. Gaviota is part of GAESA and tourism development projects in Havana and other choice locations are almost exclusively in its hands. U.S. Gulf Coast ports and the Port of Virginia, which have signed letters of intent to work with the new Mariel container terminal, will most likely have to look elsewhere for shipping partners as it is controlled by Almacenes Universales, another GAESA company.  The terminal feeds a surrounding Chinese-style development zone which allows investors 100 percent ownership and which was visited by dozens of U.S. business delegations beginning in 2015, though no deals were signed. It also is controlled by Almacenes Universales. GAESA does not run Cuba’s airports, or its cruise ship terminals, meaning U.S. airlines and cruise operators might not be directly impacted, but it does control the marinas. Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, speaks to Reuters in Havana, Cuba June 14, 2017. Picture taken June 14, 2017.StringerAll the state hotels, stores and eateries in colonial Old Havana are owned by Habaguanex, which was recently taken over from the city historian's office by GAESA. GAESA began modestly enough in the 1980s as an effort to bring modern management to the civilian sector mired in the ways of Soviet-style administration.  It has grown dramatically over the last decade since Raul Castro took over for his ailing and now deceased older brother, Fidel. Today GAESA boasts dozens of companies that control anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent of the Caribbean island’s foreign exchange earnings, according to Cuban economists. Slideshow (3 Images)GAESA’s books, like those of other state-run companies, are not public. Some Cuba experts and diplomats believe the military is feathering its own nest and perhaps preparing to cash in if the government falls.  But others believe revenues flow to the cash-strapped state. A former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said the military was viewed as a guardian of the Revolution. “Their function is to ensure that private Cubans and foreign investors do not undermine the principles of 'socialism',” he said. The holding company controls virtually all of the thousands of stores, supermarkets and malls in the country that sell imported products ranging from food and beverages to clothing and appliances, and hundreds of gas stations and eateries. That means when you enter a shop in Cuba to purchase a bottle of water, soda or beer, you probably are patronizing a military establishment. If you want to rent a condominium or satellite TV service, you have to go through a GAESA company. The holding company also controls two banks and all credit card and money transfer transactions through Fincimex.

In a move that could complicate U.S. President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow, the Senate backed the measure by 98-2. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two  no  votes. The measure is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for Syria's government in the six-year-long civil war. If passed in the House of Representatives and signed into law by Trump, it would put into law sanctions previously established via former President Barack Obama's executive orders, including some on Russian energy projects. The legislation also allows new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways and targets Russians guilty of conducting cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syria's government.  The legislation sends a very, very strong signal to Russia, the nefarious activities they've been involved in,  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as lawmakers debated the measure. If the measure became law, it could complicate relations with some countries in Europe. Germany and Austria said the new punitive measures could expose European companies involved in projects in Russia to fines. Related CoverageWhite House says existing sanctions against Russia are effectiveThe legislation sets up a review process that would require Trump to get Congress' approval before taking any action to ease, suspend or lift any sanctions on Russia. Trump was especially effusive about Russian president Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, though his openness to closer ties to Moscow has tempered somewhat, with his administration on the defensive over investigations into Russian meddling in the election. Putin dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washington's policy of imposing sanctions on Moscow had always been to try to contain Russia. National flags of Russia and the U.S. fly at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia April 11, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe bill also includes new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers. Uncertain Path in House To become law, the legislation must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. House aides said they expected the chamber would begin to debate the measure in coming weeks.  Eric ThayerHowever, they could not predict if it would come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess. Senior aides told Reuters they expected some sanctions package would eventually pass, but they expected the measure would be changed in the House. The Trump administration has pushed back against the bill, and his fellow Republicans hold a commanding 238- to 193-seat majority in the chamber. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson questioned the legislation on Wednesday, urging Congress to ensure that any sanctions package  allows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation.  Previously, U.S. energy sanctions had only targeted Russia's future high-tech energy projects, such as drilling for oil in the Arctic, fracking and offshore drilling. They blocked U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil, where Tillerson was chairman, from investing in such projects. The new bill would slap sanctions on companies in other countries looking to invest in those projects in the absence of U.S. companies, a practice known as backfilling. Also included for the first time are discretionary measures the Trump administration could impose on investments by companies in Western countries on Russia energy export pipelines to Europe. The Senate also voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to add provisions to the bill allowing the U.S. space agency NASA to continue using Russian-made rocket engines and the 100 senators voted unanimously for an amendment reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.

The Republican governor said he approved the measure even though the legislature  missed an opportunity to substantially improve the K-12 funding system.  The Republican-controlled legislature faced a June 30 deadline set by the Kansas Supreme Court in March to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitution's requirement for adequacy. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed.

Besides finding more money for schools, Kansas lawmakers also had to plug budget holes largely caused by falling tax revenue.

The 8.5 billion euros of loans from the euro zone's 18 other states, including Berlin which is wary of easing terms for Greece ahead of a German election in September, lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognizes unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made.  There is now light at the end of the tunnel,  Greece's Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters after meeting fellow euro zone finance ministers and IMF chief Christine Lagarde in Luxembourg. The accords gave enough clarity to investors on how Greece can manage its crushing debt burden that it should be able to borrow on the market again  in due course  after effectively relying on bailout support from other sovereigns since 2010. A proposal by the French government under new President Emmanuel Macron to help bridge differences on debt relief will underpin further euro zone discussions, officials said. Macron wants to work with Germany to strengthen the 18-year-old common currency, which was nearly wrecked by the sovereign debt crisis. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, whose insistence on austerity reforms to public finances in Athens have long made him a hate figure for many Greeks, said lawmakers in Berlin would review the deal on Friday to see if it deviated from a 2015 bailout enough to need new German parliamentary approval. Euro zone bailout fund chief Klaus Regling said his European Stability Mechanism would disburse 7.7 billion euros in early July to cover 6.9 billion euros in maturing debt and 0.8 billion of arrears. A further 0.8 billion euros would be disbursed  after the summer . Imf Joins in The International Monetary Fund would join the current bailout, Lagarde said, offering Athens a standby arrangement of less than $2 billion, the length of which will be tailored to match the end of the euro zone bailout in mid-2018. But the Washington-based Fund, which Europeans value for its rigor but had fallen out with over its demands they forgive Athens some of its debt, will not disburse any of its money yet. It still wants the euro zone to offer sufficient extra detail on possible debt relief in 2018 to let the Fund calculate that it will  be enough for Athens to sustain its debt in the long run. The standby arrangement was a second best solution to a full debt deal, Lagarde said, but it would buy the euro zone, Greece and the IMF time to work out the details for next year. A senior IMF official said they were still not satisfied the euro zone was ready to do enough on debt relief but had joined the bailout anyway as Greece risked being in difficulty again. To accommodate the IMF's need for more specifics on debt relief, the euro zone finance ministers said in a statement that in 2018 they would be ready to consider extending the maturities and grace periods of their loans to Greece by a range from zero to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. But they did not go any further than that and the IMF said it was not enough to calculate Greek debt sustainability. Debt relief has been a hard sell in Germany, the biggest contributor to Greek bailouts over the years, though it is also unpopular in other countries, notably in poor Eastern Europe, where Greek welfare support seems generous to many. Berlin also wants to retain leverage over Greece to make sure reforms remaining under the bailout are implemented. But in a mark of relief among the European Union's top leadership that the divisive crisis among member states seemed to be under control, European Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair a summit of EU leaders next week, tweeted:  Finally good news for Greece. It was well deserved.  The euro zone has been reluctant to commit to concrete debt relief numbers now because it argues that if Greece does all that is required of it and keeps a high primary surplus - the budget before debt servicing costs - for decades, it may not need any debt relief at all. But the IMF says euro zone assumptions on Greek economic growth and the country's ability to keep a high primary surplus are unrealistic and that Athens clearly needs debt relief to win back investor confidence and return to market financing. To bridge the wide differences in assumptions on Greek growth for the next decades, France proposed to link the size of the debt relief with Greek economic growth and euro zone ministers said they would work on that idea further. They said in their statement that the exact mechanism of how to link debt relief to growth would be worked on as of 2018 by deputy finance ministers and treasury officials and be announced after the bailout ends, together with the whole debt deal.

The Republican-controlled legislature faced a June 30 deadline set by the Kansas Supreme Court in March to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitution's requirement for adequacy. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed.

Besides finding more money for schools, Kansas lawmakers also had to plug budget holes largely caused by falling tax revenue.

Johnson may deserve a pass since he arrived late for preparations at Erin Hills to be on hand for Monday's birth of his second child with partner Paulina Gretzky in California.  He pronounced himself ready and confident on the eve of the championship, but the PGA Tour leader in numerous driving stats was too often forced to slash errant tee shots out of the tall fescue outside Erin Hills' generous fairways. Johnson double-bogeyed the 14th after leaving two balls in the willowy high grass and also took bogeys at the 15th and 17th after finding the fescue. The 32-year-old American insisted his sub-standard round was due to problems on the greens, where he had trouble gauging the speed.  I just didn't putt very well. I missed a lot of really good opportunities. That was the big key for me,  said Johnson.  If I don't three-putt, I shoot even (par). If I just make one or two of the good looks I have, it's a couple under. I didn't hit it great, but I hit it good enough to shoot a good score.  Johnson will have another crack at it on Friday, but failing to take advantage of Thursday's relatively benign conditions could sabotage his chances of making the cut.  I'm a little frustrated that I shot three-over,  he said.  But I didn't play that bad. I just didn't putt very good. It wasn't that I was hitting bad putts, my speed was a little off.  Johnson said he wished conditions were more challenging.  It would be interesting if it played really firm and fast. Right now it's really soft. The greens are soft, so you can get to the green with any club,  said Johnson.  That's why you're seeing some big scores, because the greens are so receptive. I think if it got really firm it would definitely play difficult.  Editing by Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-johnson-idUSKBN19630R"},

The 8.5 billion euros of loans from the euro zone's 18 other states, including Berlin which is wary of easing terms for Greece ahead of a German election in September, lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognizes unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made.  There is now light at the end of the tunnel,  Greece's Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters after meeting fellow euro zone finance ministers and IMF chief Christine Lagarde in Luxembourg. The accords gave enough clarity to investors on how Greece can manage its crushing debt burden that it should be able to borrow on the market again  in due course  after effectively relying on bailout support from other sovereigns since 2010. A proposal by the French government under new President Emmanuel Macron to help bridge differences on debt relief will underpin further euro zone discussions, officials said. Macron wants to work with Germany to strengthen the 18-year-old common currency, which was nearly wrecked by the sovereign debt crisis. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, whose insistence on austerity reforms to public finances in Athens have long made him a hate figure for many Greeks, said lawmakers in Berlin would review the deal on Friday to see if it deviated from a 2015 bailout enough to need new German parliamentary approval. Euro zone bailout fund chief Klaus Regling said his European Stability Mechanism would disburse 7.7 billion euros in early July to cover 6.9 billion euros in maturing debt and 0.8 billion of arrears. A further 0.8 billion euros would be disbursed  after the summer . Imf Joins in The International Monetary Fund would join the current bailout, Lagarde said, offering Athens a standby arrangement of less than $2 billion, the length of which will be tailored to match the end of the euro zone bailout in mid-2018. But the Washington-based Fund, which Europeans value for its rigor but had fallen out with over its demands they forgive Athens some of its debt, will not disburse any of its money yet. It still wants the euro zone to offer sufficient extra detail on possible debt relief in 2018 to let the Fund calculate that it will  be enough for Athens to sustain its debt in the long run. The standby arrangement was a second best solution to a full debt deal, Lagarde said, but it would buy the euro zone, Greece and the IMF time to work out the details for next year. A senior IMF official said they were still not satisfied the euro zone was ready to do enough on debt relief but had joined the bailout anyway as Greece risked being in difficulty again. To accommodate the IMF's need for more specifics on debt relief, the euro zone finance ministers said in a statement that in 2018 they would be ready to consider extending the maturities and grace periods of their loans to Greece by a range from zero to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. But they did not go any further than that and the IMF said it was not enough to calculate Greek debt sustainability. Debt relief has been a hard sell in Germany, the biggest contributor to Greek bailouts over the years, though it is also unpopular in other countries, notably in poor Eastern Europe, where Greek welfare support seems generous to many. Berlin also wants to retain leverage over Greece to make sure reforms remaining under the bailout are implemented. But in a mark of relief among the European Union's top leadership that the divisive crisis among member states seemed to be under control, European Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair a summit of EU leaders next week, tweeted:  Finally good news for Greece.

I noticed he was trying to sneak from one street to another to get into the building and kill us,” she said. “Then I took a picture of his body with my phone. We are avenging the deaths of our fellow Kurds.” The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, made up predominantly of Kurdish fighters, has seized territory to the north, east and west of Raqqa. The city of about 200,000 has been the base of operations for Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on civilians across the globe.  The assault on Raqqa is likely to be a defining moment in the U.S.-led war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Along with the Iraqi army’s campaign to drive out Islamic State in Mosul, the other center of its self-proclaimed caliphate, it threatens to deal a major blow to the militants. Spirits were high among Kurds on Thursday, as they identified Islamic State targets on an iPad and fired mortar rounds toward them. Nearby, a Kurdish fighter listened to communications on a radio. Coalition aircraft had spotted militants in a car and were about to attack. The mood along a Raqqa street was a far cry from the fear  that took hold when the extremist Sunni militants group declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria and moved towards building a self-sufficient state. Kurdish YPG militia flags hang on the walls of buildings beside names of fighters and women sang patriotic songs. Shops taken over by the militants were abandoned, with just a few empty chocolate boxes left. Large billboards with the group’s original name Islamic State in Iraq and Syria felt like part of a bygone era.

Coalition air strikes are exerting heavy pressure on Islamic State. Slideshow (8 Images)Still, dangers persist.  Minutes later, Sarya received word that a drone operated by Islamic State dropped a bomb on Raqqa, wounding 12 of her comrades. Some Kurdish fighters estimate there could be as many as 3,000 militants left in Raqqa, where buildings are pockmarked from fighting. The Syrians left, but foreign fighters stayed and were busy planting landmines and booby trapping houses, Kurdish fighters said. Islamic State snipers were highly effective, they said. “Today our movements were delayed by snipers,” said Kurdish fighter Mostafa Sirikanu. Gunfire could be heard as Kurdish militiaman Orkash Saldan pointed to a wall about 500 meters away. “Daesh are just beyond that point,” he said, walking past a rocket Islamic State fired two days ago. In a nearby building, where Islamic State had left behind mattresses and clothes, he pointed to a small teapot. “You never know they could have put a bomb in that teapot or that television,” he said.

Under a policy unanimously adopted by the Oregon Transportation Commission, residents can choose to have an  X,  for non-specified, displayed on their drivers' license or identification cards rather than an  M  for male or  F  for female. The move was cheered by supporters as a civil rights victory. The state's Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division expects to start offering the option in July.  I very much plan to head to the nearest DMV and ask for that ID to be corrected on July 3rd,  said Jamie Shupe, an Army veteran who successfully petitioned for the non-binary gender option.  And then I'll no doubt stand out front of the building, or sit in the car, and cry.  Transgender rights have become a flashpoint across the United States after some states, including North Carolina, have tried to restrict transgender people's use of public bathrooms. At the end of May, a federal court ruled that a transgender boy must be allowed to use the boys' bathrooms at his high school in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The decision in Oregon comes a year after a Portland circuit court judge granted a request by Shupe to change gender from female to a third, nongender option. That 2016 ruling prompted state officials to examine how to allow a third option in the state's computer systems and how such a change would interact with the state's gender laws. During public hearings on the change, most comments were in favor, according to a summary by DMV officials. A handful of people questioned the need for the third option and expressed concern that the change would complicate police officers' efforts to identify people. A DMV spokesman added the agency has no estimate of how many people might apply for the new IDs. (Reporting by Terray Sylvester in Hood River, Oregon; Writing by Eric M.

As a fiduciary, I have no idea how anyone can invest in China.” Famed for his successful bet against the U.S. housing market during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Bass said Hayman’s short position in the yuan, or renmimbi (RMB), is a “core” position and has “always been meaningful.” Bass, who has long argued that the Chinese yuan is set to fall 30 percent against the U.S. dollar, identified fresh warning signs that China’s credit problems have spread. These include how the five-year MTN yield, trading at 5 percent, has exceeded the bank loan rate, about 4.75 percent, for the first time, and that Moody's Investors Service recently downgraded China's credit ratings for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bass also highlighted concerns about China's capital controls and the country's shadow-banking system.  Indeed, CBRC vice-chairman Cao Yu said China established 12,836 creditor committees by the end of last year, to help manage credit of 14.85 trillion yuan. Bass said this amount represents 20 percent of the loans in Chinese banks, net of mortgages. Bass said he believes non-performing loans at Chinese financial institutions are running at a 20 percent rate, not the 1.7 percent rate that has been widely reported. “In fact, 14.85 trillion is more than all of the equity in the entire banking system,” he said. “The Chinese have masterfully swept all of this under the rug.” As credit conditions have tightened in the world's second-largest economy, borrowing costs for companies have been rising. Banks are raising lending rates, including mortgage rates, and are wary of taking on more exposure to overheated sectors such as property. That trend will set the stage for a gradual slowdown in economic activity in coming months, analysts believe, though no one foresees a sharp decline as stability is the watchword ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year Bass said China's Anbang Insurance Group, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets whose chairman has been detained by the police, illustrates China business risks.     Anbang has raised money by selling high-yielding, high-risk, short-term life insurance policies with death benefits,  Bass said.  They have the ultimate problem with extremely short-term liabilities funding very long-term assets. Anbang is just the beginning of a very large problem with asset-liabilty mismatches in China's financial system.  Bass noted that he has not always been a China bear and said China has been looking to force out one-way bearish bets on the yuan with second change this year in how the currency's guidance rate is calculated. “This fixing mechanism throws a bit of unknown into the calculation,” he said.  Still, he said he was not throwing in the towel on his short position. “The PBOC wants you to do that,  Bass said.  I don’t know how they can hold this all together. The numbers are telling me that we are right. The numbers are getting so bad so quickly.” Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by David Gregorio","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/funds-hayman-idUSL1N1JC17O"},

Qatar asked the International Civil Aviation Organization to intervene after its Gulf neighbors closed their airspace to Qatar flights last week as part of economic sanctions. The ICAO, which regulates international air travel under the Chicago Convention, brought together transport ministers and aviation officials from the Gulf states and Egypt at its headquarters to help resolve the dispute. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. The UAE has also decided to blacklist Qatari individuals and entities.  Saudi Transport Minister Suleiman al-Hamdan told ICAO members  this is something that's bigger than ICAO,  according to the source, who declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. Qatar, whose delegation was led by its Ottawa-based ambassador, was not present at the meeting. Al-Hamdan could not be reached for comment, and an ICAO spokesman could not comment. Qatar was slated to meet separately with council members and ICAO's president. The two-day meetings end on Friday. Qatar is asking the ICAO council to resolve the conflict, using a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, which governs airspace usage and is overseen by the U.N agency. ICAO does not impose binding rules, but wields clout through safety and security standards that are usually followed by its 191-member countries. Article 84 says that if two states cannot resolve a dispute related to the Chicago Convention through negotiation, one can ask the council to settle it. Members involved in the dispute are not allowed to vote on the matter. A council ruling can be appealed to an ad-hoc tribunal. The Saudi delegation said on Thursday that Qatar itself is defying Article 4 of the convention, which calls on members  not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims  of the international agreement. A man cycles past the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) headquarters building in Montreal, Quebec, Canada June 15, 2017.Christinne MuschiIt was not known what the Saudis meant, nor how Council members reacted to the Saudi message.   The Montreal meeting is the first high-level gathering of countries involved in the Gulf crisis. There have been no direct talks between Qatar and its neighbors.

Slideshow (3 Images) We call upon the International Civil Aviation Organization to declare this an illegal act. We are not a political body, we are an airline, and this blockade has stripped us of the rights which are guaranteed to us,” he said in a statement. Aviation lawyer Bill Clark, who has previously represented Qatar Airways, said the country  would probably have a good claim  under Article 84.  I think it's wise that they've invoked it. I don't believe it would be a speedy process,  he said. ICAO, which was created after the United States invited more than 50 allies to agree to a common air navigation system in 1944, has no policing powers and has to rely on consensus to enforce its will. Its decision to intervene in the Gulf airspace dispute is a rare instance of the U.N. body directly attempting to settle a row between states. In 1971, India closed its airspace to Pakistan over the hijacking of a plane by Kashmir separatists. Pakistan  complained to ICAO that its rights had been infringed under both post-World War II aviation agreements – the Chicago Convention and the separate International Air Transit Services Agreement,  which guarantees transit rights. The ICAO Council, however, merely encouraged the two sides to settle their differences, according to a history of the agency by Canadian academic David Mackenzie.

Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies who cut ties last week, in the worst rift among Gulf Arab states in years. They accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and cosying up to their enemy Iran, all of which Qatar denies. The fighter jet deal came amid increased diplomacy to try to resolve the crisis. Trump has repeatedly echoed the accusations against Qatar, even as his Defense and State Departments have tried to remain neutral in the dispute among key allies. Qatar hosts a big U.S. military base housing the headquarters of U.S. air forces in the Middle East. On Wednesday U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed the previously approved Boeing plane deal with Qatari Minister of State for Defence Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah. Qatar's ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, posted a picture of the signing ceremony on Twitter.  This is of course proof that U.S. institutions are with us but we have never doubted that,  a Qatari official in Doha said.  Our militaries are like brothers. America's support for Qatar is deep-rooted and not easily influenced by political changes.  In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States continued to work with Qatar and other governments in the region and the planes deal had been years in the making.  We see it as a tangible show of support for our defense relationship and their commitment to the United States,  spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. A Qatari defense ministry source said the deal was for 36 jets. In November, under the administration of former President Barack Obama, the United States approved a possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing, the prime contractor on the sale, declined to comment.

Just like other countries, like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt ... it is natural for Qatar to buy airplanes or parts necessary for its own defense,  Cavusoglu said in Kuwait following talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency. Turkey is friendly to Qatar and has sent food supplies since the sanctions were imposed. Kuwait has led efforts to mediate the dispute which had affected food imports and raised questions over the Gulf Arab state's plans to host the 2022 World Cup. A European diplomat in the Gulf said the timing of the deal appeared coincidental. Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon Presumably the U.S. could have delayed the deal if they'd wanted to, although I don't think there's a great connect between sales and foreign policy.  Important Air Base Qatar is an important base for the U.S. military carrying out operations against Islamic State militants and other groups in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and beyond. Al Udeid Air Base is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Two U.S. warships arrived at Hamad port in Qatar as part of a planned joint military exercise involving marine forces, Qatar's state news agency said on Wednesday. Cavusoglu, who visited Qatar and Kuwait to try to push diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, said on Thursday he intends to travel to Saudi Arabia on Friday for talks with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz about the crisis. Slideshow (5 Images) Saudi Arabia is important and the Saudi King is respected by everyone. Our expectation from King Salman is that he be the leader in solving this problem,  Cavusoglu said at a joint news conference with his Tunisian counterpart. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke by telephone with his Omani counterpart, Oman state news agency reported. The foreign ministry said foreign affairs minister Youssef bin Alawi called for support of Kuwaiti mediation efforts as the best chance for resolving the crisis. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - a broad movement whose Islamist goals are anathema to Egypt's ex-military president, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and to many of the Gulf's dynastic rulers. Conservative Gulf neighbors have long viewed Qatar's foreign policy with suspicion, especially its refusal to shun Shi'ite Iran, and resented its state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera for airing critical views from across the region. Qatar on Thursday said that preparations for the 2022 World Cup were unhindered, having secured alternative supplies of construction materials to those that had been coming by land from Saudi Arabia. Qatar's main port was also bustling with ships bringing food supplies and construction materials, witnesses said. The Pentagon said the jets sale would increase security cooperation between the United States and Qatar and help them operate together. It added that Mattis and Attiyah had also discussed the current state of operations against Islamic State and the importance of de-escalating tensions in the Gulf. The fighter jet deal had been stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administration's broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf. Trump, who took office in January, has accused Qatar of being a  high-level  sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the State Department's efforts to help ease the diplomatic crisis.

Charles and Helga Johnson, a married couple from Stanfordville, New York, are seeking at least $10 million in damages from American Airlines Group Inc in a complaint filed in the federal court in White Plains, New York. American, the largest U.S. carrier, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit comes at a time of increased focus on how airlines treat passengers after an April video went viral of United Airlines passenger David Dao being dragged from his seat to make way for a crew member. According to Thursday's complaint, an unmoored, fully stocked, 300-pound beverage cart struck Charles Johnson in the head after it flew down the aisle on Flight 1941 to Charlotte, North Carolina from Hartford, Connecticut on April 28, 2016. Johnson said the impact caused his hat to be ripped off his head and resulted in a large forehead gash, severe bleeding and a loss of consciousness. But rather than land, the pilot flew on more than two hours to Charlotte, as a nurse and other passengers cared for Johnson because the cabin crew did not know how, the complaint said. Johnson now suffers from  chronic traumatic brain injury and post-concussive syndrome,  headaches, mood swings and anxiety. He has been unable to work or bend down and has seen his marriage become  strained  because of his injuries, the complaint said. The Johnsons are also seeking punitive damages, reflecting what they called Fort Worth, Texas-based American's  gross negligence  and  reckless disregard  for their well-being. A lawyer for the Johnsons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is Johnson et al v.

Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, wrote to  correct the record  in a letter sent to a congressional panel on Wednesday regarding a recent report critical of the CFPB's work in a high-profile scandal. The five-page letter took issue with multiple conclusions reached in a report released earlier this month by Republican staff on the House Financial Services Committee. Some members of the committee have pushed for Republican President Donald Trump to fire Cordray, who has headed the agency since he was appointed by Obama, a Democrat, in 2012. The report said the CFPB had been an ineffective watchdog against Wells Fargo & Co, missing extensive improper sales practices and taking action only after work on the bank's unauthorized accounts scandal had been done by others. The committee's report also depicted the CFPB as reluctant to cooperate with the panel's Well Fargo probe. Cordray insisted that his agency had done critical work in policing Wells Fargo, and said the report  devolves into various misstatements and allegations  about the CFPB's work. The CFPB, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the city and county of Los Angeles, struck a $185 million settlement against the bank in September. Cordray argued that improper sales practices were underway at Wells Fargo as far back as 2001, while his agency was only fully staffed in 2014. He maintained the CFPB had acted properly in monitoring the bank, and the CFPB's presence allowed the federal government to provide relief to wronged consumers across the country as part of the settlement. He went on to accuse Republican staff of refusing to receive a September briefing from his staff on Wells Fargo, instead demanding he personally brief them with one day's notice, which he was unable to do. He said he also offered to publicly testify at a committee hearing devoted to Wells Fargo, but did not receive an invitation. A committee spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cordray is one of a handful of remaining regulatory heads that were appointed by Obama.

The United Nations has warned a Saudi Arabia-led Arab coalition fighting Iran-aligned Houthis against any attempt to extend the war to Hodeidah, a vital Red Sea aid delivery point where some 80 percent of Yemen's food imports arrive. The coalition has accused the Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons and ammunition and has called for U.N. monitors to be posted there. The Houthi movement denies the allegations. Five cranes have been destroyed by coalition air strikes, forcing dozens of ships to line up offshore because they cannot be unloaded.  The Security Council stresses the importance of keeping all Yemen's ports functioning, including Hodeidah port, as a critical lifeline for humanitarian support and other essential supplies,  the 15-member body said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday that the United States believed the port could be placed under the control of a third unnamed authority to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid.  The Houthis would voluntarily turn that port over to a third authority, not the Saudis, not the Emiratis, and ... we would gain access,  Tillerson told a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee in Washington. Many thousands of Yemeni state workers are also facing destitution as their salaries have gone largely unpaid for several months after the internationally-recognized government shifted Yemen's central bank to Aden from the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis. U.N. Yemen envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed told the Security Council on May 30 that he had proposed a deal to avoid military clashes in Hodeidah to be negotiated in parallel with an agreement to resume civil service salary payments nationally. However, Ould Cheikh Ahmed noted the Houthis and the allied General People's Congress, the party of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, would not meet with him.  These proposals would act as a confidence-building mechanism between the parties, with a view to a durable cessation of hostilities as a step towards the resumption of peace talks under U.N. leadership,  the Security Council statement said. The United Nations has said nearly seven million people in Yemen are one step away from famine.

The company, known as Pacific Exploration & Production before a name change earlier this week, said it had come to an agreement with the natives over payment for the use of the land, and also agreed to finance a number of community projects. The oilfield, known as Lot 192, is the largest in the country and once produced 10,000 barrels of crude per day. But production is currently suspended because the ageing pipeline serving the area was shut down early last year after suffering various spills.  Last month, Frontera and Peru's state-run oil company Petroperu said they were considering a partnership to develop the field. Frontera won a two-year concession to operate the 500,000-hectare (1,931-square-mile) lot in 2015, and the rights will be transferred to Petroperu when it expires next year.  Separately, Frontera said in a Thursday statement it plans to invest $2.5 billion in oil and gas exploration and production in Peru. The company said it has had a presence in Peru since 2001.

The offer, made with Putin's trademark sardonic humor, came as the Russian president poured scorn on Comey for his role in a row in Washington over alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. At a congressional hearing this month, Comey said Trump asked him to drop an investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, while the U.S. president has accused Comey of not telling the truth. Asked about Comey at a question-and-answer session with Russian voters, Putin said it was  strange  that, while still FBI director, Comey had passed the contents of a conversation he had with Trump to the media via a friend.  What is the difference then between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden?  Putin said, referring to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013 after leaking classified information about U.S. spy operations.  In this case, he (Comey) is not the head of a special service but a human rights activist who defends a certain position,  Putin said. Former FBI Director James Comey pauses as he testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017.Jonathan Ernst By the way, if he is subject to any sort of persecution in connection with this, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia. And he should know about this.  Striking a more serious note, Putin said Comey, in his congressional testimony, had produced no proof that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election.  I am not familiar in detail with the testimony given by former FBI director Comey,  Putin said.  Again, he gave no evidence of this (Russian interference).   And what about constant U.S. propaganda, constant U.S. support of America-oriented non-governmental organizations by giving them money directly? Isn't it an impact on our minds? Isn't it an attempt to influence how we should behave during election campaigns? This continues year after year,  he said. Putin said many heads of state around the world had told him of similar U.S. meddling in their internal affairs. But they would not voice their concerns openly, fearing they would  spoil relations  with Washington, he said.  As for Russia,  we have an opinion of our own, we express it openly. But this is not any sort of underground, subversive activity , Putin said.

The fundamentals in general still look favorable for tech. What we've seen, though, are some downgrades that are based on the fact that some ran up too quickly... and it has engendered a lot of fire sales in the tech industry,  said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended down 0.3 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.8 percent. Wednesday's interest rate hike by the U.S Federal Reserve, along with its signal that another hike could follow this year, also weighed on stocks. While the hike was widely expected, some investors said the central bank's tone was more hawkish and that raised concern about the pace of U.S. economic growth.  Monetary policy got hawkish,  said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.  In a sign that the squeeze on consumers may get tighter before long, three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise rates, against five who preferred keeping rates on hold. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7-1 vote in favor of no change. The dollar rose to its highest in more than two weeks as solid readings on the U.S. economy helped strengthen the case for the Fed to continue tightening. The number of Americans filing unemployment claims fell more than expected last week, suggesting slack in the labor market was shrinking, and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions survey for June beat expectations after a strong reading in May.  The reports followed weak U.S. inflation data on Wednesday. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, was last up 0.6 percent, and rose as high as 97.557, its highest since May 30. The stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data also boosted most U.S. Treasury yields, while traders weighed the hawkish Federal Reserve and Bank of England signals. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were last at 2.160 percent, up from 2.138 percent late Wednesday.  On Wednesday, benchmark yields hit 2.103 percent, their lowest since Nov. 10. The surprisingly weak inflation and other data overshadowed the Fed's rate hike. Brent crude settled down 8 cents at $46.92 a barrel, while U.S. crude settled down 27 cents at $44.46, after touching a six-month low of $44.32 a barrel. The stronger dollar weighed on gold, which hit a three-week low. Spot gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,254.05 an ounce.

The borough of Kensington and Chelsea is famous in Britain and beyond as the home of pop stars and other celebrities, jet-setters and bankers. But it also has pockets of deprivation like the housing estate where the doomed 24-storey Grenfell Tower stands. Dozens of residents are missing and authorities say the death toll could rise further after an inferno engulfed the building with terrifying speed as residents slept in the early hours of Wednesday. The lucky ones got out alive, but have lost everything. The disaster has prompted an outpouring of generosity, with shocked Londoners donating so many clothes, shoes and bedsheets that volunteers were soon overwhelmed. But on the streets around the charred carcass of the tower on Thursday there was palpable anger as people accused the local authority of neglecting the safety and wellbeing of the poor in favor of policies favoring the interests of the rich. Alia Al-Ghabbani, a receptionist who lives on the estate, was among many angered by a recent refurbishment in which new cladding was added to the exterior of the building and which media reports have said might have played a part in the rapid spread of the fire.   It's really irritating why they prettied up the tower ... It's because that tower was such an eyesore for these people in very expensive houses just opposite,  she said. The fire service has said it was too early to know what caused the blaze, and the local authority has said the refurbishment was designed to improve quality of life for residents of the block.  A Tale of Two Cities  Community organizer Pilgrim Tucker, who had worked closely with residents of Grenfell Tower during the refurbishment period, saw the blaze as the tragic consequence of long-term neglect of an entire section of the community.  People here in the social housing know they’ve been neglected,  she said, visibly distressed as she spoke.  If government was doing its job … this wouldn’t have happened.  As Tucker and others reported that fire safety concerns raised by residents had fallen on deaf ears, the fallout from the disaster fed into the broader political picture. In a shock election result last week, the ruling Conservatives, who emphasize fiscal discipline, low tax and pro-business credentials, lost ground to the opposition Labour Party, who favor more spending on public services. To general astonishment, the Kensington parliamentary constituency, where the Grenfell Tower stands, was won by Labour for the first time in its history. Local residents hang a banner over a balcony following the fire which destroyed the Grenfell Tower block, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 15, 2017.Stefan WermuthThe new Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has been quick to try to make her mark, criticizing the council, in a newspaper interview, for perceived safety failings and saying the tragedy was preventable. Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May visited Grenfell Tower on Thursday, but was criticized for speaking only to firefighters and not to residents. In contrast, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was cheered after visiting a nearby church and meeting residents and volunteers helping out, with locals shouting  thank you for coming .  Something you can't avoid is that Kensington is a tale of two cities,  Corbyn told reporters.  The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the whole country. The ward where this fire took place is, I think, the poorest ward in the whole country.  A general view shows the tower block that was destroyed in a fire disaster, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 15, 2017.Peter Nicholls A Certain Sort of People  The area immediately around the Grenfell block, known as Notting Dale, is a socially mixed neighborhood. The gritty 1970s social housing estate is surrounded by pretty streets lined with the well-tended, privately owned homes of affluent professionals -- though not of millionaires. They live a few minutes away, in the prestigious Holland Park area. In Notting Dale, despite local anger, the blaze has united different sides of the community all the same. Many wealthier residents have opened up their homes to tenants who fled the tower, or others who were evacuated because their flats were too close to the blaze. Anabel Donald, a well-to-do grandmother, has lent her ground-floor apartment to six people from the estate who had nowhere else to go.  On the night of the fire, Donald rushed to the local church in her pyjamas and spent hours helping evacuees as best she could, making tea, providing toys to entertain the children and cleaning the toilets which were being used by dozens of people. Though from the wealthier side of the street, Donald shared the outrage of other residents about the way Kensington and Chelsea has been run by the Conservative local council.  The feeling is, among the less privileged, that they get nothing and that the more privileged get everything. I think it is absolutely true,  said Donald. She accused the council of keeping taxes unnecessarily low, when it could easily raise more money to spend on social housing and other public services. She said she would happily pay more local tax herself.  They’re just very proud of being such an economical borough and they do it because they think it will please a certain sort of people,  she said. Amid the horror of the tower blaze, she said social divisions had seemed to matter less than usual.  I have never felt more accepted in this area than I was when I was helping, because they didn’t care which side of the divide I came from. All they cared about was I was playing with their children, giving them nappies, giving them tea and coffee.

Young starter Jose Berrios handled the Seattle Mariners from there. Gimenez hit two home runs, and Berrios continued his strong sophomore season for Minnesota with a career-high eight innings pitched in Thursday's 6-2 win against Seattle. Gimenez drove in four runs, while Eduardo Escobar had three hits, including a homer, as Minnesota split the four-game series and remained two games ahead of Cleveland in the American League Central before the two teams start a four-game weekend series on Friday.  Anytime you can get one, in my situation, is a good thing,  Gimenez said of his first multi-homer game in the majors.  To be able to get two was cool. Fortunately, I've done it before in the minor leagues, just never in the big leagues. I feel like I've never got enough at-bats to kind of get on a roll and do that. But, hey, we'll take them when they come.  Berrios (6-1) won his third straight decision, giving up two runs on five hits. He walked one and struck out six. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at TwinsSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSeattle starter Ariel Miranda (6-3) yielded six runs on a career-high 10 hits in four innings. The Mariners had won 12 of their previous 17 games, including four of six against the Twins.  Today, his velocity, he didn't have it,  Miranda explained through an interpreter.  His command was not there.  In his second season, Berrios is matching the hype surrounding him as the team's top pitching prospect of the past few years. He has gone at least five innings in each of his seven starts this season and has allowed more than three runs just once.  I'm more comfortable,  Berrios said through an interpreter of his success with runners on base.  Last year, I was thinking I had runs on bases that I have to try to get this guy out somehow or someway. I used to focus on how I'm going to get out of it. Now it's more about making sure I do what I'm supposed to do and get the hitter out.  Berrios retired the first eight batters he faced. He got out of the sixth inning with just one run allowed with a double play. Kyle Seager doubled to lead off the seventh, but Berrios got a strikeout of Danny Valencia and two flyouts to strand Seager.  We knew going in that Berrios had very good stuff, electric fastball, good breaking ball,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  We had chances to kind of get close but could never mount the big rally against him. ... We didn't swing the bats very well.  Minnesota scored five runs in the first inning. Escobar hit a two-run homer and Gimenez added a three-run shot to account for the scoring.  It's a big gap between two and five,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Gimenez's homer.  Even the next one, I thought, was big as far as momentum because they come back and put another number on the board. For him to answer with another, I thought both of them were fairly critical to how the game progressed.  Gimenez hit a solo homer, his third of the season, off Miranda leading off the third. Escobar has hit .581 (18-for-31) with three homers and eight RBIs in his last eight games. NOTES: Seattle SS Jean Segura is nearing a return from a right high ankle sprain. Segura has been running and hitting the past few days in Minnesota, and he will have a full workout before Friday's game in Texas. Manager Scott Servais said he could play in rehab games if the workout goes well, with the intention of returning for the homestand beginning Monday. ... Mariners RHP Hisashi Iwakuma pitched four scoreless innings in his first rehab start on Wednesday at Class A Modesto as he makes his way back from inflammation in his right shoulder. Iwakuma is scheduled for another rehab start next week with Triple-A Tacoma and could make his return afterward. ... Minnesota announced LHP Adam Wilk will be recalled from Triple-A Rochester to start one game of Saturday's doubleheader with Cleveland. LHP Adalberto Mejia will start the other game. Wilk is 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA in three games this season, including two relief appearances for the Twins. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-twins-recap-idUSMTZED6FLVFKCK"},

The draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and other automakers and technology companies who are seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump Administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles. The industry also opposed an Obama administration proposal last year that raised the possibility of giving regulators the power to review and approve self-driving car technology before it was put into service, similar to the vetting by Federal Aviation Administration of new technology for aircraft. The 45-page draft package of 14 bills would designate the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, pre-empting state rules. States could still set insurance and registration rules but could not use them as a way to regulate self-driving technologies. California has proposed changes to its self-driving car rules, but automakers said in April it has not gone far enough. One of the bills in the proposal would allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from U.S. federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, pedals and other human controls. Another would declare crash data, other testing and validation reports from automated cars turned over to U.S. regulators to be  confidential business information.  On Tuesday, a bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars, including sorting out conflicts between state and federal rules. Energy and Commerce Committee Republican members and staff have vowed to work with Democrats and industry and safety officials to try to reach a bipartisan consensus. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, told Congress on Wednesday it should work to eliminate state or local laws that could  unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.

Following that disappointing economic data, a report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Fed to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth.  Monetary policy got hawkish,  said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.

Charles and Helga Johnson, a married couple from Stanfordville, New York, are seeking at least $10 million in damages from American Airlines Group Inc in a complaint filed in the federal court in White Plains, New York. American, the largest U.S. carrier, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit comes at a time of increased focus on how airlines treat passengers after an April video went viral of United Airlines passenger David Dao being dragged from his seat to make way for a crew member. According to Thursday's complaint, an unmoored, fully stocked, 300-pound beverage cart struck Charles Johnson in the head after it flew down the aisle on Flight 1941 to Charlotte, North Carolina from Hartford, Connecticut on April 28, 2016. Johnson said the impact caused his hat to be ripped off his head and resulted in a large forehead gash, severe bleeding and a loss of consciousness. But rather than land, the pilot flew on more than two hours to Charlotte, as a nurse and other passengers cared for Johnson because the cabin crew did not know how, the complaint said. Johnson now suffers from  chronic traumatic brain injury and post-concussive syndrome,  headaches, mood swings and anxiety. He has been unable to work or bend down and has seen his marriage become  strained  because of his injuries, the complaint said. The Johnsons are also seeking punitive damages, reflecting what they called Fort Worth, Texas-based American's  gross negligence  and  reckless disregard  for their well-being. A lawyer for the Johnsons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is Johnson et al v. American Airlines Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-04515.

Canadian Olympic bronze medalist Andre De Grasse had a far more straightforward victory as he edged home to win the 100 metres with his best time of the season. Britain's Jake Wightman pulled off a shock win in the men's 1500 metres and Olympic champion Kerron Clement came in last in the men's 400 metres hurdles, won by Norwegian Karsten Warholm. But all the drama surrounded Schippers, celebrating her 25th birthday, who made a false start in her race but was allowed to continue after signaling to officials that she could not hear.  The Dutchwoman won comfortably in 22.31 seconds before her disqualification was announced and Ivorian Murielle Ahoure, who finished in 22.74, was handed the win.  It was noisy at the start, so much noise, very hard to concentrate,  said Schippers.  Such races happen sometimes so I must accept it.  However, one hour later, the Diamond League organizers tweeted:  Confirmation: Dafne Schippers reinstated as winner in the 200m with a time of 22.31.  No further explanation was given.  De Grasse, hoping to give Usain Bolt a run for his money at the world championships in London in August, won in 10.01 seconds, one hundredth of a second ahead of Britain's Chijindu Ujah with Ben Youssef Meite of Ivory Coast third in 10.03.  It felt good, the weather was great, I ran my season best,  said De Grasse after winning at the Oslo Diamond League meeting for the second year running.  I hope it will continue in Stockholm (on Sunday) and I will be able to get my sub-10 before the Canadian trials... for sure I need to improve my start.  Warholm gave the crowd a home win to savor in the 400 hurdles, winning in 48.25 seconds, as Clement slunk home in eighth.  I had a mis-step at the seventh hurdle, that was the problem,  said Clement.  I had nothing afterwards in the last 100 metres. But I hope all will be better in coming weeks, otherwise I felt good.  Wightman upstaged a field including Kenyans Silas Kiplagat and Elijah Manangoi as he won the 1500 metres in a personal best of 3:34.17.  In utter shock. Can not believe I've just won a Diamond League,  the 22-year-old Scot said on Twitter. Olympic champion Caster Semenya snatched a win in the women's 800 metres as she passed Francine Niyonsaba on the final straight after the Burundian runner led at the bell.

Minnesota's AA-plus general obligation and other credit ratings were placed on a watch list by S&P; in the wake of Governor Mark Dayton's line-item veto of funding for the state legislature in the fiscal 2018-2019 budget. The veto left $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a legislative office facility without money to make rental and debt payments next due in November and December, according to S&P.;  If the stalemate continues and increases, in our view, the likelihood of nonpayment or the nonappropriation leads to a termination of the lease and an extraordinary mandatory redemption of the bonds, then we could lower our ratings on the state as well as associated ratings by several notches,  S&P; said in a statement. It added if the state is able to meet its contractual obligation for the debt over the next three months, the ratings would remain at their current levels. However, the ratings' outlook, which had been positive, would likely be revised to stable due to the state's departure from  very strong budget management.  There was no immediate comment from Dayton's office. Lawmakers in the Republican-controlled legislature sued the Democratic governor on Tuesday, claiming his May 30 veto of nearly $130 million for salaries, benefits and operating expenses was unconstitutional.

Carlo,Mark Flather,ADAMIS PHARMA,EPIPEN/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp said on Thursday it received U.S. approval for its emergency epinephrine syringes to treat severe allergic reactions that it intends to be a lower cost rival to Mylan NV's widely used EpiPen, sending its shares up more than 50 percent. The company said it was looking for a marketing partner and would set a price for the product before its launch sometime in the second half of this year. Adamis said its pre-filled epinephrine syringes would be sold under the brand name Symjepi. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to around $600, enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing debate over the high cost of prescription medicines in the United States. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor.  We plan to position the product as a lower cost alternative,  Mark Flather, senior director for investor relations and corporate communications for Adamis, told Reuters.  We want to be part of the solution.  Epinephrine is the life-saving recommended treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications. Mylan has for years owned more than 90 percent of the market for emergency epinephrine injectors and its own authorized generic has recently surpassed sales of the branded version.  With an anticipated lower cost and attractive design, we believe Symjepi will be a meaningful competitor to EpiPen,  Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris said in a research note. Other rival products are available. Impax Laboratories Inc's Adrenaclick device is being sold through CVS Health Corp's drugstore chain for about $110 a pair. Privately held Kaleo earlier this year began selling its Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector that it reacquired from Sanofi SA under an unusual pricing strategy but with little success so far. The company said it would make the product available at no cost to many consumers but charge insurers $4,500. Sanofi in April sued Mylan, accusing it of engaging in illegal practices to squash EpiPen competition when the French drugmaker held the Auvi-Q rights. Adamis shares soared 53.3 percent to close at $5.75 on the Nasdaq and further rose to $6.00 in extended trading.

Westinghouse and Southern Co, the utility that owns nearly half the project, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SACE based its latest estimate on a report last week by two utility consultants to the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities including Southern Co's Georgia Power. The report is based on a scenario in which the project comes online in 2022, three years behind its current schedule, and the bankruptcy layers on costs. Southern Co, which is leading a consortium of utility owners of Vogtle, has said it is evaluating whether it will continue with construction of the project. SACE's latest estimate puts increased pressure on Georgia's utility regulator to ensure Southern Co cannot pass along future cost overruns to ratepayers. A spokesman for the Georgia PSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SACE has warned since Vogtle was approved in 2009 that Southern Co was underestimating the time and cost of the project. Vogtle was originally expected to begin producing power in April 2016 and cost $14 billion. Vogtle was meant to be a showcase for Westinghouse and part of a U.S. nuclear renaissance, by has been dogged by poor quality work and disputes with subcontractors, among other problems. Toshiba has guaranteed Westinghouse's work on the project and on Saturday said it will begin making $3.68 billion in payments to the utility partners for failure to complete the contract. The expert reports also spell out the failure of Westinghouse to improve productivity, despite hiring consultants in 2016 to speed up the project. Over the past year four core activities fell an average of 325 days further behind schedule, according to the report. SACE's Barczak said she felt the Vogtle project would not be completed in wake of the latest expert reports.  But the unknown question is how long is it going to take for Southern Co to pull the plug,  she said.

The draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and other automakers and technology companies who are seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump Administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles. The industry also opposed an Obama administration proposal last year that raised the possibility of giving regulators the power to review and approve self-driving car technology before it was put into service, similar to the vetting by Federal Aviation Administration of new technology for aircraft. The 45-page draft package of 14 bills would designate the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, pre-empting state rules. States could still set insurance and registration rules but could not use them as a way to regulate self-driving technologies. California has proposed changes to its self-driving car rules, but automakers said in April it has not gone far enough. One of the bills in the proposal would allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from U.S. federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, pedals and other human controls. Another would declare crash data, other testing and validation reports from automated cars turned over to U.S. regulators to be  confidential business information.  On Tuesday, a bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars, including sorting out conflicts between state and federal rules. Energy and Commerce Committee Republican members and staff have vowed to work with Democrats and industry and safety officials to try to reach a bipartisan consensus. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, told Congress on Wednesday it should work to eliminate state or local laws that could  unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.

The Trump administration has urged Congress to increase the debt limit before it heads out for its August recess, but Mulvaney said officials had not decided what form the legislation should take.  There are various thoughts about how to get something passed, but I don't think we've settled on how to move forward yet,  Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing.  Will it be a clean debt ceiling vote? Will it be a debt ceiling vote with some type of reforms attached to it? I don't think we've settled on that.   The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion. The limit can be increased only by a vote of Congress. The White House has sent mixed signals on how the debt limit should be handled by lawmakers.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked lawmakers to pass a bill without any measures attached to it. However, Mulvaney, a conservative Republican, was known to favor using the debt limit as leverage to get spending cuts during his time in Congress, before he was tapped to be budget director.      He downplayed any disagreements within the administration, saying it was not unusual for a Treasury secretary and a budget director to have different views on the debt limit.   It is not a source of division right now in the White House, nor is it a source of division in the party,  he said. But on Capitol Hill, the House Freedom Caucus, an influential group of about three dozen conservative Republican lawmakers to which Mulvaney once belonged, has called for any increase in the debt ceiling to be linked to reforms that cut unnecessary spending and work toward balancing the U.S. budget. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows said on Thursday he favored such a conditional raising of the debt ceiling by about $1.5 trillion, which he believes may be somewhat less than what the Trump administration wants.  There’s a number of us who are talking about a $1.5 trillion range, as long as there are some structural reforms, some other things that could go along with that,  Meadows said in the House Speaker’s Lobby. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Generally, conservative Republicans have attempted to use the debt limit to push fiscal reform, while Democrats and moderate Republicans have opposed such ultimatums. Lower tax revenues this year have forced the U.S. Treasury to borrow more money to cover the federal budget deficit, which may lead to the government hitting its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts say. Mnuchin said Monday that the government would be able to pay its bills at least through early September.

The talks come as the timeshare industry seeks to improve its occupancy rates and shed its reputation of locking customers into complex contracts they do not understand, in the hope of becoming a more popular alternative for many U.S. holidaymakers.  ILG is working with investment bank Moelis & Co (MC.N) as it fields merger interest, the sources said. Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp (VAC.N) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc (HGV.N) are among the companies that have held talks with ILG, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Marriott Vacations and Moelis declined to comment, while ILG and Hilton Grand Vacations did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ILG shares rose as much as 10 percent and ended trading up 6.5 percent, giving the company a market value of $3.5 billion. A timeshare is an agreement in which several joint owners share the right to use a given property or vacation home. Based in Miami, ILG is the exclusive global licensee for the Hyatt, Westin and Sheraton vacation ownership brands.  As of the end of December, it had a total of 41 resorts within its Vistana Signature Experiences and Hyatt Vacation Ownership businesses, and managed about 250 resorts overall, while serving more than 2 million members through various membership and exchange programs. Last month hedge fund FrontFour, owner of 2 percent of ILG's stock, wrote an open letter to the company's management urging it to seek a combination with Marriott, which has a market value of $3.4 billion. FrontFour said that if ILG does not act on the recommendation, it will  review all of (its) options including but not limited to taking action at ILG's 2018 annual meeting.  Last year, ILG acquired Vistana Signature Experiences, the timeshare business of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc, for more than $1 billion in cash and stock.

I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now - short term - at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,  Bezos, one of the world's richest people with a net worth of more than $76 billion, said in a Twitter post.  If you have ideas, just reply to this tweet with the idea (and if you think this approach is wrong, would love to hear that too.)  The request signaled a shift for Bezos, who has invested in longer-term bets like space exploration and kept quieter about other givings. The e-commerce executive has said he will sell about $1 billion of Amazon stock annually to fund his company Blue Origin, which aims to cut the cost of space travel and kick off entrepreneurship in the cosmos. For philanthropy, Bezos has supported a foundation run by his parents that focuses on education. His family has also given more than $40 million to Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, not far from Amazon's headquarters. Still, Bezos has yet to make charity a cornerstone of his work, like Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Bill Gates or Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Mark Zuckerberg have. Bezos has not joined them and 167 other of the world's richest people in pledging to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropy. Asked in an interview with Charlie Rose last year if he one day would rival Gates' magnanimity, Bezos joked,  Well, yeah, if there is anything left after I finish building Blue Origin.  His Twitter post had generated nearly 4,000 replies within three hours. Recommendations ranged from food programs for children, to protecting forests and fighting homelessness.

Reid,US,HOME,CAPITAL,LENDING,Mortgage,Backed Markets,Banks (TRBC),Company News,Consumer Financial Services (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Regulation,Company Management Issues,Corporate Events,Banking Services (Legacy),Canada","sector":"Markets","content":"TORONTO (Reuters) - After its near-collapse seven weeks ago, Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO) is taking steps toward recovery by agreeing to settle a regulatory investigation and lining up new funding. The company plays an important role in Canada's mortgage market, lending to borrowers who cannot get loans from the country's biggest banks, such as self-employed workers and new immigrants.  Canada's biggest non-bank lender must still overcome hurdles, though, including finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers. On Wednesday the company reached a C$30.5 million ($22.3 million) settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), settled a class action lawsuit, and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said, after Home Capital's board was bolstered by former Ontario Teachers Pension Plan head Claude Lamoureux and Alan Hibben, a former head of strategy at Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO).  This is a signal that the new board has taken control,  said Hari Panday, chief executive of investment banking firm PanVest Capital Corp.  They've decided they want the focus to be running the business and not fighting the regulators. The OSC (probe) was a huge hangover.  Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid. The company is still searching for Reid's successor as well as a permanent chief financial officer. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the OSC, Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business.  Maria-Gabriella Khoury, vice president of global financial institutions group at DBRS, said the company had taken  the first step to restore market confidence  with the OSC settlement and now needed to prioritize new funding. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Home Capital is in talks with a syndicate of banks, including some of Canada's biggest lenders, to secure a loan of about C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), expected to be on more favorable terms than an existing loan.   The expensive bridge financing of C$2 billion provided by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, and affected the company's ability to originate new mortgages since it cannot afford to lend money at lower rates than its cost of borrowing.  Because of the high interest on that facility the company needs to secure something soon in order to a) still have a runway of liquidity and b) not have it eat away at its current revenue,  said Khoury. Home Capital had said it was continuing to originate mortgages but had tightened its lending criteria. Negotiating new financing would enable it to relax that criteria, offer more mortgages and generate more profit, analysts say.     To meet its long-term funding needs, it must repair relationships with deposit brokers who have guided clients away from putting money in its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), a key source of funding.  It will require meeting with brokers, launching a communication campaign and reaching out to people on both deposits and mortgages,  said Panday. Those relationships will be a key focus for new CEO and CFO, who analysts say should have established relationships with the banks and both deposits and mortgage brokers. David Cockfield, managing director at Northland Wealth Management,  said Home Capital had taken  a step in the right direction .  Settling with the OSC clears the horizon,  he said.  Shares in Home Capital closed up 12.7 percent on Thursday having closed up 7.4 percent on Wednesday.

Reid,US,HOME,CAPITAL,LENDING,Mortgage,Backed Markets,Banks (TRBC),Company News,Consumer Financial Services (TRBC),Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Regulation,Company Management Issues,Corporate Events,Banking Services (Legacy),Canada","sector":"Markets","content":"TORONTO (Reuters) - After its near-collapse seven weeks ago, Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc (HCG.TO) is taking steps toward recovery by agreeing to settle a regulatory investigation and lining up new funding. The company plays an important role in Canada's mortgage market, lending to borrowers who cannot get loans from the country's biggest banks, such as self-employed workers and new immigrants.  Canada's biggest non-bank lender must still overcome hurdles, though, including finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers. On Wednesday the company reached a C$30.5 million ($22.3 million) settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), settled a class action lawsuit, and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said, after Home Capital's board was bolstered by former Ontario Teachers Pension Plan head Claude Lamoureux and Alan Hibben, a former head of strategy at Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO).  This is a signal that the new board has taken control,  said Hari Panday, chief executive of investment banking firm PanVest Capital Corp.  They've decided they want the focus to be running the business and not fighting the regulators. The OSC (probe) was a huge hangover.  Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid. The company is still searching for Reid's successor as well as a permanent chief financial officer. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the OSC, Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business.  Maria-Gabriella Khoury, vice president of global financial institutions group at DBRS, said the company had taken  the first step to restore market confidence  with the OSC settlement and now needed to prioritize new funding. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Home Capital is in talks with a syndicate of banks, including some of Canada's biggest lenders, to secure a loan of about C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), expected to be on more favorable terms than an existing loan.   The expensive bridge financing of C$2 billion provided by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, and affected the company's ability to originate new mortgages since it cannot afford to lend money at lower rates than its cost of borrowing.  Because of the high interest on that facility the company needs to secure something soon in order to a) still have a runway of liquidity and b) not have it eat away at its current revenue,  said Khoury. Home Capital had said it was continuing to originate mortgages but had tightened its lending criteria. Negotiating new financing would enable it to relax that criteria, offer more mortgages and generate more profit, analysts say.     To meet its long-term funding needs, it must repair relationships with deposit brokers who have guided clients away from putting money in its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), a key source of funding.  It will require meeting with brokers, launching a communication campaign and reaching out to people on both deposits and mortgages,  said Panday. Those relationships will be a key focus for new CEO and CFO, who analysts say should have established relationships with the banks and both deposits and mortgage brokers. David Cockfield, managing director at Northland Wealth Management,  said Home Capital had taken  a step in the right direction .  Settling with the OSC clears the horizon,  he said.  Shares in Home Capital closed up 12.7 percent on Thursday having closed up 7.4 percent on Wednesday.

The virtual currency relies on  mining  computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Bitcoin fell as low as $2,120 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp on Thursday and was last down 6 percent at $2,290.

Jafari was  wary of a near-term top ahead of $3,134, adding that investors should consider re-establishing bullish exposure between $2,330 and no lower than $1,915.  Analysts also said investors were spooked by Chinese miner Bitmain's plan to undertake a  hard fork  of bitcoin if a code upgrade on the currency is activated late this summer. Under a  hard fork , Bitmain would create an entirely new version of the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in an entirely new bitcoin currency, separate from the original currency. Bitmain's move was in response to proposals that attempt to solve the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.  Traders are concerned with what a fork could do to their holdings and most likely now converting to fiat (government currencies) until some clarity about the scaling debate comes to light,  said BitMEX's Dwyer.

The May 16 skirmish, caught on video, left nine protesters injured outside the Turkish ambassador's residence and further strained ties at a time when the NATO allies are in sharp disagreement over policy in Syria.  The charges against some members of Erdogan's security detail send a clear message that the United States  does not tolerate individuals who use intimidation and violence to stifle freedom of speech and legitimate political expression,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. Turkey condemned the charges and said the Turkish citizens, who left the country with Erdogan, should not be held responsible for the incident.   This decision taken by U.S. authorities is wrong, biased and lacks legal basis,  Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  The brawl in front of the Turkish ambassador's residence was caused by the failure of local security authorities to take necessary measures.  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert would not say on Thursday whether an extradition request would be made. The security officers are no longer protected by the immunity extended to them during Erdogan's recent visit, the State Department said.  The Turkish flag flies over the the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, U.S., June 15, 2017.Joshua Roberts We will weigh additional actions,  Nauert told reporters. Washington officials announcing the charges, which were filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, described the treatment of the protesters as an attack on U.S. values. Some of the protesters were associated with the Armenian National Committee of America and accuse Erdogan of running a politically repressive government. Slideshow (4 Images)A video posted online showed men in dark suits chasing protesters and punching and kicking them as Washington police struggled to intervene.  If they attempt to enter the United States, they will be arrested,  Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham said of the security officers charged in the case. Newsham said there was no probable cause to arrest Erdogan, who watched the confrontation unfold from a nearby car. Eighteen people have now been charged in the incident, including two Canadians and four Americans, according to prosecutors. Two men were arrested on Wednesday. Sinan Narin of Virginia faces a charge of felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor assault, and Eyup Yildirim of New Jersey faces two charges of felony assault and a misdemeanor assault charge.

Support surged by 18 percentage points in both Germany and France, which just elected europhile centrist Emmanuel Macron as president, the Washington-based Pew Research Center found. Even the British hold a much more favorable opinion of the European Union. Now 54 percent of them view the EU positively, 10 points up on a year ago, while 40 percent were unfavorable. In June last year, they voted by 52 percent to 48 percent for Brexit. Negotiations on withdrawal terms start on Monday. In none of the other nine countries surveyed did more than 35 percent of people want their country to follow suit and leave the EU. Of those, the Italians and Greeks were the least enthusiastic. Despite growing friction between their nationalist governments and Brussels, Poles and Hungarians remain among the keenest EU citizens.  The European Union has rebounded dramatically from its recent slump in public approval,  Pew researchers wrote, noting an  up-and-down cycle over the past decade .  The findings, in line with other research, will hearten EU leaders who meet at a summit next week. Some had feared, after Brexit followed grave crises in the euro zone economy and with irregular immigration, that the bloc's survival was in doubt. Fully 68 percent of Germans and 56 percent of French and Italians had a favorable view of the EU this spring, though  Italians have not joined the general bounce in approval ratings.  The survey in 10 of the 28 members - the six biggest EU states and four of the next eight most populous - did not study reasons for changes in mood.  It did, however, also record more approval for the Union's handling of the economy and migration - two areas where anger has long been directed at Brussels. An EU deal with Turkey a year ago has stemmed chaotic migrant arrivals and along with income growth, opinions about the economy have improved - with the exception of debt-laden Greece and in Italy, where the proportion of people saying their economy is in good shape slumped 18 points to 15 percent. A huge 87 percent of the Dutch, whom euroskeptics failed to win over heavily in a March election, think their economy is doing well - 25 points up on a year ago. There was a 15-point upturn in Spain, even if still only 28 percent take a rosy view.

Jurors in Hartford, Connecticut found Michael Gramins, 33, of New York, guilty on one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. It found him not guilty on six additional counts, and deadlocked on two fraud counts. Another defendant, Tyler Peters, was found not guilty on all nine counts he faced. Ross Shapiro, the third defendant, was found not guilty on eight counts, and jurors could not agree on a ninth, also for conspiracy. The trial began on May 8, and jurors began deliberating on June 6. Gramins' conviction is the second in a federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices that was unveiled in January 2013, and has been overseen mainly by the office of U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut. It followed the January conviction in a retrial involving similar claims against former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak. He was later sentenced to serve two years in prison and pay a $2 million fine. Litvak is appealing. Daly said Gramins trained subordinates to lie to customers, in a scheme whose victims included asset managers, hedge funds and insurers. Gramins faces up to five years in prison. It is unclear whether he and Shapiro will be retried on the deadlocked counts. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Gramins, in an email said he intends to file motions related to his client's conviction. A lawyer for Shapiro had no immediate comment. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Peters, declined to comment. U.S. authorities have charged at least 10 people, including six from Nomura, in connection with the bond trading probe. Three of the eight traders facing criminal charges decided to plead guilty and cooperate: former Nomura trader Frank DiNucci, and former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc traders Matthew Katke and Adam Siegel. David Demos, formerly of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, was also criminally charged, and has pleaded not guilty.

State health director Nick Lyon, charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office stemming from his role in the crisis, and Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive charged with obstruction of justice and lying to police, appeared at bond hearings Thursday in District Court in Flint, the Detroit News reported. Charles Chamberlain, Lyon's attorney, and Jerold Lax, Wells' attorney, could not immediately be reached for comment. But the attorneys both told the newspaper that they would contest the charges.  I expect it will be clear that Dr. Wells is a competent, dedicated and respected health professional and that any action she took during this unfortunate situation was taken only for the purpose of protecting legitimate public health concerns,  Lax said, according the newspaper. Lyon was released on a $15,000 bond, and Wells was released on a personal recognizance bond, according to the local news website Mlive.com. They were among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials criminally charged on Wednesday. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has said Lyon and Wells would remain in their jobs. Court documents allege Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires' in December 2015, the documents said. Wells is alleged to have lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents.

The U.S. Justice Department filing was the latest legal action tied to alleged money laundering at the fund set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 to promote economic development. In the complaints, the department alleges more than $4.5 billion was taken from 1MDB by high-level fund officials and their associates.  This money financed the lavish lifestyles of the alleged co-conspirators at the expense and detriment of the Malaysian people,  Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general, said in a statement. 1MDB could not be immediately reached for comment. Najib has denied taking money from 1MDB or any other entity for personal gain, after it was reported that investigators traced nearly $700 million to bank accounts that were allegedly in his name. The assets U.S. authorities are seeking to seize include the rights to  Dumb and Dumber To,  a 2014 comedy starring Jim Carrey, they allege was financed with tens of millions of dollars stolen from 1MDB, and the 2015 film  Daddy's Home  starring Will Ferrell. Last year, U.S. authorities moved to seize rights to the 2013 film  The Wolf of Wall Street,  which starred DiCaprio. The three films were produced by Red Granite, a company founded by Najib's stepson Riza Aziz. Red Granite said in a statement it was in discussions with the Justice Department  aimed at resolving these civil cases and is fully cooperating.  U.S. authorities accuse Jho Low, a Malaysian financier, of laundering more than $400 million stolen from the fund through an account in the United States, where he and his friends used the money to pay for lavish parties, gambling and yachts. Despite the civil allegations, U.S. authorities have not charged Low with any crime. Low did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his Hong Kong-based company Jynwel Capital. Authorities said that in 2014 Low used $3.2 million diverted from a 1MDB bond sale to buy a Picasso painting for DiCaprio.  Dear Leonardo DiCaprio, Happy belated Birthday! This gift is for you,  a friend of Low's wrote in a note. Low also used $9.2 million diverted from 1MDB bond sales to buy a collage made by the New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat which was also given to DiCaprio. DiCaprio and Low signed a note in March 2014 absolving the star of  any liability whatsoever resulting directly or indirectly from these art-work,  according to the filings. A spokesman for DiCaprio said in an emailed statement on Thursday the actor last July  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case. The spokesman said DiCaprio also returned a Oscar won by actor Marlon Brando. That was given to DiCaprio by Red Granite  to thank him for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street,  the statement said. DiCaprio's spokesman said the star accepted the gifts to raise funds in an auction for his environmental foundation. Fraud allegations against 1MDB go back to 2009, the Justice Department said, and the fund is subject to money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland and Singapore. The complaints allege that officials at 1MDB, their relatives and other associates allegedly laundered the funds using complex transactions and shell companies with bank accounts located in the United States and abroad. That allowed the origin, source and ownership of the funds to be hidden and ultimately passed through U.S. financial institutions, with the money being used to buy and invest in assets in the United States and overseas, according to the complaints.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-scandal-usa-idUSL1N1JC11F"},

Trump,John Thune,Mike Lee,Mike Pence,Mitch McConnell,Orrin Hatch,ROB PORTMAN,Shelley Moore Capito,Ted Cruz,Tim Scott,USA,HEALTHCARE/TAXES,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"Washington (Reuters) - Republican senators trying to repeal Obamacare are forming  consensus to keep some of the U.S. healthcare law's taxes they long criticized, in hopes of delaying more drastic funding cuts, particularly to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled. First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obama's healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBO's assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes.  I think most of the taxes are going to go away,  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday.  Our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue.  Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed. Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans' healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the law's taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said. Some of Obamacare's taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.  There's no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now,  Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal.  Think of me with a Rubik's cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50,  McConnell said.

But Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to reassure markets the BOJ will still lag well behind the Federal Reserve in dialing back its massive stimulus program, with inflation far from reaching the BOJ's 2 percent target, say sources familiar with its thinking.  Inflation is weak now, so I don't think the BOJ is ready to move up its interest rate targets,  said Makoto Yamashita, chief rates strategist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. At a two-day rate review ending on Friday, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero under its yield curve control (YCC) policy. Many central bank policymakers also prefer to maintain a loose pledge to keep increasing its bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($729.33 billion), the sources say. The BOJ's meeting comes in the wake of the Fed's rate review on Wednesday, where it raised interest rates for the second time in three months and laid out an outline of a plan to reduce its massive balance sheet.  Stealth  Tapering? Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented a fresh communication challenge for the BOJ, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might withdraw its stimulus - without sounding as if such an action is imminent. Sources have told Reuters the BOJ will upgrade its already upbeat economic assessment either at its rate review on Friday or in July, as it sees the benefits of an export-driven recovery broadening and pushing up domestic demand. But inflation remains disappointingly low, making BOJ officials wary of releasing too much detail on how the bank may exit its ultra-loose policy in the future. Core consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in April from a year earlier, as companies remain cautious of raising prices for fear of scaring away price-sensitive households. Still, BOJ policymakers see an increasing need to enhance their communication on a future exit strategy given growing calls for more disclosure. Market players are consequently focusing on Kuroda's post-meeting briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) for any new insights into what might trigger a future hike in the BOJ's bond yield target. Kuroda is also expected to be grilled at the briefing on the consistency between the BOJ's 80-trillion-yen bond-buying pledge and a recent slowdown in actual bond purchases. While the BOJ argues it still has plenty of bonds to buy, many analysts expect its bond-buying program to reach a limit with the bank already owning more than 42 percent of the market. Indeed, recent data showed the BOJ's bond buying has slowed considerably in recent months. Analysts expect the BOJ to slow the pace further to around 60 trillion yen by year-end and to omit the 80-trillion-yen pledge from its policy statement. BOJ officials say the bond-buying commitment has become obsolete because under YCC adopted last September the bank targets rates rather than the pace of money printing. But they remain wary of removing the bond-buying commitment   too soon out of on concern that doing so could be misinterpreted as laying the grounds for an imminent withdrawal of monetary support.

The agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), also said on Thursday it is considering further postponing the rule's effective date, when companies must fully comply with its requirements, after delaying it in April for six months. The CFPB, which is charged with protecting individuals against fraud, late last year, after two years of drafting work, issued the rule for an industry projected to reach $112 billion in 2018. It requires greater disclosures and overdraft limits for cards sold by companies such as Mastercard Inc and Greendot. Recent feedback, though, led the CFPB to consider making adjustments, said its director, Richard Cordray, in a statement. In one adjustment, customers would have to register accounts in order to receive full protections against fraud and errors. Some companies said they would have trouble giving those benefits to unregistered accounts. In the other, protections would be extended to digital wallets on smartphones that can link to prepaid accounts. The rule faced criticism in Congress, where Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia proposed repealing it earlier this year. Perdue said his objections stem from his belief the CFPB has too much power. Some rule critics also say it is too detailed and costly to implement. The CFPB's suggested adjustments came up during the repeal debate, said Thaddeaus King, a director in the Pew Charitable Trusts consumer finance project.  We're hopeful that this is the extent of what the bureau does,  he said, adding consumer advocates would primarily object to changes allowing new overdraft fees and practices. Meanwhile, industry is seeking more adjustments.  We remain hopeful that the CFPB will continue to consider additional changes in the final rule,  said Brian Tate, vice president of government affairs at the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association, including limiting the definition of prepaid account, revising disclosure requirements and extending the implementation timeline. Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a liberal group supporting the rule, said the adjustments show the bureau is willing  to listen to all stakeholders - industry, consumer groups, and others - in an effort to produce the best protections possible.

Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, Monika Bickert, Facebook's director of global policy management, and Brian Fishman, counter-terrorism policy manager, explained in a blog post.  The world's largest social media network, with 1.9 billion users, Facebook has not always been so open about its operations, and its statement was met with skepticism by some who have criticized U.S. technology companies for moving slowly.   We've known that extremist groups have been weaponizing the internet for years,  said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth College computer scientist who studies ways to stem extremist material online.  So why, for years, have they been understaffing their moderation? Why, for years, have they been behind on innovation?  Farid asked. He called Facebook's statement a public relations move in response to European governments.  Britain's interior ministry welcomed Facebook's efforts but said technology companies needed to go further.  This includes the use of technical solutions so that terrorist content can be identified and removed before it is widely disseminated, and ultimately prevented from being uploaded in the first place,  a ministry spokesman said on Thursday.  Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech.  Government officials have threatened to fine Facebook and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users.  Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda.   More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves; that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,  Bickert said in a telephone interview.  Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said,  We're talking about this because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.  Facebook's blog post on Thursday was the first in a planned series of announcements to address  hard questions  facing the company, Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy and communications, said in a statement. Other questions, he said, include:  Is social media good for democracy?   On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron launched a joint campaign to go after  terrorists and criminals  on the internet and to root out radicalizing material.   Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content,  May said at a joint news conference.  Macron's office declined to comment on Facebook's statement on Thursday.

This includes the use of technical solutions so that terrorist content can be identified and removed before it is widely disseminated, and ultimately prevented from being uploaded in the first place,  a ministry spokesman said on Thursday.  Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech.  Government officials have threatened to fine Facebook and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users.  Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda.   More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves; that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,  Bickert said in a telephone interview.  Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said,  We're talking about this because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.  Facebook's blog post on Thursday was the first in a planned series of announcements to address  hard questions  facing the company, Elliot Schrage, vice president for public policy and communications, said in a statement. Other questions, he said, include:  Is social media good for democracy?   On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron launched a joint campaign to go after  terrorists and criminals  on the internet and to root out radicalizing material.   Crucially, our campaign will also include exploring creating a legal liability for tech companies if they fail to take the necessary action to remove unacceptable content,  May said at a joint news conference.  Macron's office declined to comment on Facebook's statement on Thursday.

It is that lucrative line of business that President Donald Trump will target when he rolls out his new Cuba policy Friday in Miami, the heart of the country's hard-line exile community, according to U.S. officials who have seen a draft presidential memorandum. Trump will significantly restrict U.S. companies from doing business with some military-linked enterprises, the officials said.  “Any ban on using military-owned tourism facilities would make it very difficult to bring groups larger than seven people because for logistical reasons you need to work with the government,” Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, said. The number of Americans traveling to Cuba, mostly in large groups due to U.S. regulations, has nearly tripled in recent years and was expected to reach around 400,000 in 2017, according to U.S. travel agencies. Trump's expected limits on U.S. business deals will target the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy that is headed up by General Luis Alberto Rodriguez, reportedly President Raul Castro’s son-in-law. That is bad news for the pro-engagement U.S. politicians and hundreds of businesses that flocked to Cuba in the last few years in search of new opportunities.  The only hotel deal struck to date may prove the last for now, at least in the capital. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which is owned by Marriott International Inc,  signed on to manage a Gaviota hotel in Havana under the Sheraton brand which opened in 2016. Gaviota is part of GAESA and tourism development projects in Havana and other choice locations are almost exclusively in its hands. U.S. Gulf Coast ports and the Port of Virginia, which have signed letters of intent to work with the new Mariel container terminal, will most likely have to look elsewhere for shipping partners as it is controlled by Almacenes Universales, another GAESA company.  The terminal feeds a surrounding Chinese-style development zone which allows investors 100 percent ownership and which was visited by dozens of U.S. business delegations beginning in 2015, though no deals were signed. It also is controlled by Almacenes Universales. GAESA does not run Cuba’s airports, or its cruise ship terminals, meaning U.S. airlines and cruise operators might not be directly impacted, but it does control the marinas. Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, speaks to Reuters in Havana, Cuba June 14, 2017. Picture taken June 14, 2017.StringerAll the state hotels, stores and eateries in colonial Old Havana are owned by Habaguanex, which was recently taken over from the city historian's office by GAESA. GAESA began modestly enough in the 1980s as an effort to bring modern management to the civilian sector mired in the ways of Soviet-style administration.  It has grown dramatically over the last decade since Raul Castro took over for his ailing and now deceased older brother, Fidel. Today GAESA boasts dozens of companies that control anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent of the Caribbean island’s foreign exchange earnings, according to Cuban economists. Slideshow (3 Images)GAESA’s books, like those of other state-run companies, are not public. Some Cuba experts and diplomats believe the military is feathering its own nest and perhaps preparing to cash in if the government falls.  But others believe revenues flow to the cash-strapped state. A former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said the military was viewed as a guardian of the Revolution. “Their function is to ensure that private Cubans and foreign investors do not undermine the principles of 'socialism',” he said. The holding company controls virtually all of the thousands of stores, supermarkets and malls in the country that sell imported products ranging from food and beverages to clothing and appliances, and hundreds of gas stations and eateries. That means when you enter a shop in Cuba to purchase a bottle of water, soda or beer, you probably are patronizing a military establishment. If you want to rent a condominium or satellite TV service, you have to go through a GAESA company. The holding company also controls two banks and all credit card and money transfer transactions through Fincimex.

The overnight operation last week, triggered by a run on the bank that left it critically short of liquidity, was the first test for the European Union mechanism to wind-down failing lenders.  The authorities involved in the resolution acted in a very swift manner ensuring a continuation of core functions with no resulting costs for the taxpayers and this is very good,  Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers that discussed Popular's rescue. Ministers were briefed on the operation by the European Central Bank and by Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU body to liquidate banks, the Single Resolution Board. The two bodies led the rescue of Popular. No minister criticized the operation, as no  reasonable  alternative private solution was available and no public support was in sight, an EU official said reporting discussions among ministers. Owners of Popular bonds lost some 2 billion euros but the Spanish financial market reacted calmly after the rescue, despite fears of possible disruption that had until then dissuaded authorities from using the new liquidation procedure. The mechanism was adopted after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis to reduce taxpayers costs by dictating losses on shareholders, bondholders and even uninsured depositors, if necessary.  Italy has used an exception to the new rules to rescue with public money Monte Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), the country's fourth bank, and is negotiating with EU institutions a similar operation for two smaller regional banks from the Veneto. Dijsselbloem, who has been one of the main architects of the new mechanism, said the resolution of Popular was  successful .  The mechanism has worked very well. Its goal is to create stability and protect depositors, and in that process protect taxpayers. All three of these goals were met,  he told reporters.

Canadian manufacturing sales topped forecasts and hit a record in April as sales of petroleum and coal products rebounded after two months of declines, data from Statistics Canada showed.                  At 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3279 to the greenback, or 75.31 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3226 to C$1.3308.     Oil prices touched six-month lows, under pressure from high global inventories and doubts about OPEC's ability to reduce the glut. U.S. crude        prices were down 0.72 percent to $44.41 a barrel.          Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank said the summer driving season usually means an increase in demand and tighter supply, but inventory data suggests significant excess glut.     The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies, supported by the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to boost interest rates further.                  On Wednesday, the loonie touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months at C$1.3165. It has gained 1.5 percent this week, helped by signals from the Bank of Canada that higher interest rates lie ahead.      That will be quite significant for Canadian dollar going forward,  said Osborne, adding the currency could potentially trade below C$1.30 in the coming months.      Because it won't be just one rate increase, it will be more than one, and we barely have one rate increase factored in for Canada over the next 12 months at this point.      Chances of a rate hike this year have surged to more than 90 percent from less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data on Friday.                The central bank, which had long said interest rates are too blunt a tool to tackle the country's housing market, may have finally decided to act and at least limit its role in fueling a potential bubble with low interest rates.                  Resales of Canadian homes dropped 6.2 percent in May from April, while Toronto sales plunged 25.3 percent as new housing policy changes sideswiped demand and new listings rose again, the Canadian Real Estate Association said.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            price down 7.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.918 percent and the benchmark 10-year             falling 38 Canadian cents to yield 1.533 percent.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index fell 9.71 points, or 0.06 percent, to 15,160.42, its lowest close since Dec. 6. The index has lost ground each day this week, and it closed on Thursday below its 200-day moving average for a second straight day.  It's pretty defensive ... the loss of momentum in tech has a lot of people rattled,  said Ian Scott, equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management. Wall Street also closed lower as a recent selloff in technology stocks deepened. Canada's technology group pared recent losses to end 0.2 percent higher. But it accounts for just 2.5 percent of the TSX's weight, much less than resource stocks. The energy group retreated 1.7 percent as oil prices fell to a six-month low. The commodity was pressured by high global inventories and doubts over OPEC's ability to implement production cuts as promised. U.S. crude prices settled 27 cents lower at $44.46 a barrel. Canadian Natural Resources fell 1.4 percent to C$36.84, while Cenovus Energy lost 4.4 percent to C$10.47. The materials group, which includes miners, fertilizer and lumber companies, lost 0.8 percent as metal prices, including copper and gold, fell a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Barrick Gold retreated 1.6 percent to C$20.76, while Teck Resources Ltd lost 3.75 percent to C$21.58 after it forecast a drop in its average realized price from the sale of steelmaking coal for the second quarter. But losses for the TSX were narrowly based, with seven of the index's 10 main groups ending higher. The financial group, which has lost more than 6 percent since peaking in February, rose 0.3 percent, helped by a 0.4 percent gain for Toronto-Dominion Bank to C$64.99. The banks  have sold off to a level now where I am starting to look at them a little bit more, as a Canadian investor who is less worried about a cataclysmic housing correction being right around the corner,  Scott said. Resales of Canadian homes dropped 6.2 percent in May from April, with Toronto sales plunging 25.3 percent in the month as new housing policy changes sideswiped demand and new listings rose again. Investors have also worried about how the troubles of alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc could affect the country's real estate market. Shares of Home Capital rose 12.7 percent to C$13.67 after the company reported late on Wednesday it had reached a settlement agreement with the Ontario Securities Regulator accepting responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. Industrials rose 0.2 percent as railroad stocks gained ground.

Jurors in Hartford, Connecticut found Michael Gramins, 33, of New York, guilty on one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. It found him not guilty on six additional counts, and deadlocked on two fraud counts. Another defendant, Tyler Peters, was found not guilty on all nine counts he faced. Ross Shapiro, the third defendant, was found not guilty on eight counts, and jurors could not agree on a ninth, also for conspiracy. The trial began on May 8, and jurors began deliberating on June 6. Gramins' conviction is the second in a federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices that was unveiled in January 2013, and has been overseen mainly by the office of U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut. It followed the January conviction in a retrial involving similar claims against former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak. He was later sentenced to serve two years in prison and pay a $2 million fine. Litvak is appealing. Daly said Gramins trained subordinates to lie to customers, in a scheme whose victims included asset managers, hedge funds and insurers. Gramins faces up to five years in prison. It is unclear whether he and Shapiro will be retried on the deadlocked counts. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Gramins, in an email said he intends to file motions related to his client's conviction. A lawyer for Shapiro had no immediate comment. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Peters, declined to comment. U.S. authorities have charged at least 10 people, including six from Nomura, in connection with the bond trading probe. Three of the eight traders facing criminal charges decided to plead guilty and cooperate: former Nomura trader Frank DiNucci, and former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc traders Matthew Katke and Adam Siegel. David Demos, formerly of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, was also criminally charged, and has pleaded not guilty.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought civil charges against former Nomura traders Kee Chan and James Im. Chan settled with the SEC, but Im did not. The case is U.S. v.

A spokesman for the acquisitive insurance giant, which made headlines with its 2015 purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, said banks were still distributing its products. Bloomberg earlier reported that Chinese authorities had asked lenders to suspend some business dealings with Anbang. That report cited an unnamed source and did not give details on what type of business dealings with Anbang banks were asked to suspend. China's banking regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Anbang, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets, said early on Wednesday that Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfil his duties. Last week, the company denied reports that Wu had been barred from leaving China. Wu was detained by authorities last Friday, people familiar with the matter said. None of the sources wanted to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. Two days earlier, Wu had presided over a large internal meeting that appeared to be business as usual, said a person who was there. Anbang, which said it is operating normally in Wu's absence, distributes insurance through multiple channel types. According to its annual report, 88 percent of its insurance sales last year were through banks. The insurer has spent more than $30 billion in the past two years acquiring insurers, luxury hotels and other property assets. But it has faced increasing pushback in its offshore deal-making amid a broader decline in Chinese outbound acquisitions. Beijing has strengthened curbs over capital outflows after China's leadership vowed to curb risk in its financial system. Industry Scrutiny China's big insurers have attracted regulatory attention for their aggressive acquisitions of overseas assets, while using client money derived from high-yield investment products sold to consumers. This has particularly jarred with authorities concerned about an economy over-reliant on credit. In a speech late last year, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Liu Shiyu criticised the prevalence of  abnormal  highly-leveraged acquisitions by insurers and other financial companies, and that in some instances, their use of funds of  improper origins  represented the  retrogression and decay  of human nature and business ethics. In April, President Xi Jinping ordered more to be done to rid Chinese financial firms of excessive risk. Zhuang Deshui, deputy director at Peking University's Clean Government Centre, said the anti-corruption crackdown directed at the financial industry was aimed at breaking up vested interest groups, including Communist Party officials, who had abused their power for financial gain while obstructing key reforms. 'Sold Out' Employees at several Chinese banks contacted by Reuters on Thursday said they had stopped selling some Anbang products, in some cases several months ago and also because the products had  sold out . The head of a Beijing branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) said Anbang's 3-year universal insurance products with guaranteed principal and interest were very popular last year, with interest rates at 3-4 percent. But since receiving a notice from its headquarters in the third quarter of 2016, it had stopped selling Anbang products, the bank official said, adding that reasons behind the suspension were not disclosed. A sales representative at a sub-branch of CITIC Bank in the eastern city of Hangzhou said sales of nearly all Anbang products had been suspended since late May. Only a 5-year insurance product with a relatively low yield of more than 4 percent was being sold, the agent said. ICBC and CITIC Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The head of a Beijing branch of Bank of Hangzhou said it had not received any notice on suspending sales of Anbang products, which were still for sale. The bank did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Last month, Anbang Life Insurance (IPO-ABLF.HK) was barred from issuing new products for three months for  disrupting market order  by designing a product that bypassed regulations aimed at curbing growth in risky, short-term, universal life insurance products. Anbang Life at the start of the year had begun to shift its sales away from universal life to traditional products, generating premiums in the first quarter that topped full-year 2016 totals. Anbang has 1.97 trillion yuan ($290 billion)in assets, according to its website.

Jurors in Hartford, Connecticut found Michael Gramins, 33, of New York, guilty on one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. It found him not guilty on six additional counts, and deadlocked on two fraud counts. Another defendant, Tyler Peters, was found not guilty on all nine counts he faced. Ross Shapiro, the third defendant, was found not guilty on eight counts, and jurors could not agree on a ninth, also for conspiracy. The trial began on May 8, and jurors began deliberating on June 6. Gramins' conviction is the second in a federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices that was unveiled in January 2013, and has been overseen mainly by the office of U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut. It followed the January conviction in a retrial involving similar claims against former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak. He was later sentenced to serve two years in prison and pay a $2 million fine. Litvak is appealing. Daly said Gramins trained subordinates to lie to customers, in a scheme whose victims included asset managers, hedge funds and insurers. Gramins faces up to five years in prison. It is unclear whether he and Shapiro will be retried on the deadlocked counts. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Gramins, in an email said he intends to file motions related to his client's conviction. A lawyer for Shapiro had no immediate comment. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Peters, declined to comment. U.S. authorities have charged at least 10 people, including six from Nomura, in connection with the bond trading probe. Three of the eight traders facing criminal charges decided to plead guilty and cooperate: former Nomura trader Frank DiNucci, and former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc traders Matthew Katke and Adam Siegel. David Demos, formerly of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, was also criminally charged, and has pleaded not guilty.

State health director Nick Lyon, charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office stemming from his role in the crisis, and Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive charged with obstruction of justice and lying to police, appeared at bond hearings Thursday in District Court in Flint, the Detroit News reported.  Charles Chamberlain, Lyon's attorney, and Jerold Lax, Wells' attorney, could not immediately be reached for comment. But the attorneys both told the newspaper that they would contest the charges.  I expect it will be clear that Dr. Wells is a competent, dedicated and respected health professional and that any action she took during this unfortunate situation was taken only for the purpose of protecting legitimate public health concerns,  Lax said, according the newspaper. Lyon was released on a $15,000 bond, and Wells was released on a personal recognizance bond, according to the local news website Mlive.com. They were among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials criminally charged on Wednesday. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has said Lyon and Wells would remain in their jobs. Court documents allege Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires' in December 2015, the documents said. Wells is alleged to have lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said.

The San Francisco ride-services giant had planned to disrupt freight hauling by offering a complete package of trucking technology including self-driving trucks and smartphone-based logistics services. But what has emerged so far, industry watchers say, is a modest effort to build a brokerage service connecting truckers looking for loads to shippers with cargo to haul.  Uber's self-driving truck effort is weighed down by a high-stakes lawsuit over allegedly stolen trade secrets linked to its $680-million purchase of self-driving trucking startup OttoMotto last year. Testing of the autonomous technology has slowed and several Otto engineers have been redeployed to Uber's cargo business, according to state transportation agencies and Uber officials.  Meanwhile, that unit, dubbed Uber Freight and launched publicly in May, looks a lot like the firms it is trying to displace. Rival startups and old-line transport firms alike have come out with apps to match truckers to cargo. Uber Freight also uses a conventional call center and online  load boards  where truckers have found work since the dot-com era began.   The world doesn't need another broker,  said Eric Gilmore, chief executive of Turvo, a Sunnyvale, California logistics startup that's trying to wring paperwork out of the shipping process. Turmoil among Uber's top ranks could also prove damaging as the company grapples with a series of scandals related to its hard-charging culture and business practices. Just this week, Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick announced he is taking a leave of absence; his second-in-command Emil Michael left the company; and board member David Bonderman resigned. Hitting the Gas Uber executives say the company's push into trucking is moving forward at full throttle. Bill Driegert, director of operations at Uber Freight, said the business is shipping  large brand names  and has  a solid core of drivers who have signed up and are using it regularly.   We are all in on this,  Driegert said.  We are in it for the long-term and we think we can make a difference.  Still, he acknowledged that Uber's self-driving truck initiative and its freight business are on separate tracks, with no plans to collaborate on a full complement of services anytime soon. Otto doesn't yet have a commercial product for customers to buy. Related CoverageFactbox: Uber's sprawling ambitionsThat's a different message from last fall. In a September interview, just a month after Uber acquired Otto, the startup's co-founder Lior Ron told Reuters he expected truckers would be using the firm's driverless technology to haul freight by 2017 as part of a suite of trucking services offered under the Uber banner. In April, Uber retired the  Otto  name without explanation and now lumps the business into its Advanced Technologies Group, a unit that works on a variety of self-driving technologies and mapping. Detours and course-corrections are typical with any startup. Uber's challenge is to make inroads in a fragmented, low-margin industry where many shippers and brokers have ties going back decades. Delivering cargo requires more complex logistical planning than does ferrying people home from bars. The financial stakes are higher too. Goods can spoil and shippers and fleet managers can lose money if a load doesn't arrive on time. Uber must prove  they have the same capabilities as any broker that has been doing this for years,  said Thom Albrecht, president of Sword & Sea Transport Advisors, a Virginia-based consulting firm.  Investors are counting on it. Optimism that the San Francisco ride-services giant can  Uberize  other transport businesses has propelled the firm to a $68 billion valuation, despite its lack of profits. Uber lost $708 million in the first quarter, down from $991 million in the fourth quarter last year, the company said recently. FILE PHOTO: An Autonomous trucking start-up Otto vehicle is shown during an announcing event in Concord, California, U.S. on August 4, 2016.Alexandria Sage/File PhotoPrivately held Uber is under pressure to go public. Investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Fidelity Investments, are waiting for a big payoff. But Uber has struggled to dominate other markets the way it has ride-hailing. Its food and package-delivery services, UberEats and UberRush, for instance, aren't major players in their categories.   This is ambition porn at its finest,  said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of venture capital data company CB Insights.  Uber continues to enter new verticals to feed the narrative that their total addressable market is massive.   Uber's trucking aspirations are achievable and it continues to invest in both Uber Freight and its autonomous truck division, Uber Freight's Driegert said.  They are two independent businesses and we are both charging forward at 100 miles per hour,  he said.  Autonomous Driving Duel Still, the distancing of Uber Freight from Otto, two businesses Uber once saw as complementary, removes what trucking industry executives say was Uber's distinct advantage in the crowded logistics market: self-driving technology.  Otto's future could hinge on a lawsuit filed in February by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car unit, Waymo, against Otto and Uber. The lawsuit claims Otto co-founder and former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski stole more than 14,000 documents containing Waymo trade secrets before decamping to start Otto.    When Uber purchased Otto in August, the most important asset was Levandowski, who is recognized as one of Silicon Valley's top experts in self-driving technology. He quickly was named head of the Advanced Technologies Group and reported to Kalanick. Uber fired Levandowski last month after he refused to turn over the Waymo documents, which had been requested by the federal judge overseeing the case. A trial is scheduled for October. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. Uber has never denied that Levandowski took the files, which Waymo alleges include confidential designs. But Uber contends no information contained in those documents made its way into Uber's self-driving technology. The suit is one of several controversies now dogging Uber. The company last week fired 20 employees following an internal investigation into 215 claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, bullying and other employee concerns. Its executive ranks have been decimated after a wave of departures. Uber also faces legal battles related to how it classifies and pays its drivers as well as a federal criminal probe relating to its use of technology to evade regulators. Otto's autonomous driving efforts, meanwhile, appear to have downshifted. After making a splash last year with test runs in Colorado, Ohio and Nevada - including a $500 deal to haul 52,000 cans of Budweiser in a self-driving truck for Anheuser-Busch (ABI.BR) - Otto has not done additional test runs in those states. An Uber spokeswoman declined to offer an explanation, but said the company hoped to demonstrate the technology in action again soon. Otto trucks continue to be tested in California, but not in fully autonomous mode, a separate Uber spokeswoman said. California regulators are investigating the company over whether it used self-driving technology without approval. The North American trade association for independent truck drivers says it held talks with Otto as recently as a couple months ago, but any prospect of using the technology is premature.      From our side, it's been mostly a matter of educating Otto  about the truck industry, said Todd Spencer of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association.  They realize there is a tremendously big market, if only they can find something that works.

World number one Dustin Johnson opened defense of his U.S. Open crown with a shaky three-over 75 while number two Rory McIlroy, sidelined for much of the year with rib and back injuries, opened with an eagle but could not shake the rust, fading to six-over 78 after being punished by the brutal fescue rough on several occasions.

Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY SportsAs bad as the Northern Irishman's day was it was still better than playing competitor world number three Jason Day, the Australian slumping to a seven-over 79 that included two triple bogeys.  I just played bad golf,  said Day.  I can't put it any other way other than just there was some good stuff mixed in with a lot of poor stuff.   Two triples, I don't know. It's weird.  Slideshow (5 Images) It's not like I gave up. I actually gave it 100 percent all the way through the end and I shot 79.  World number four Hideki Matsuyama (74), number five Jordan Spieth (73) and number Henrik Stenson (74) will all have work to do if they hope to see the weekend at season's second major. Few in the 156 player field, however, had a more wretched day than Englishman Danny Willett, the 2016 Masters champion who handed in a nine-over 81. The year's second major started without Phil Mickelson, the five-times major winner withdrawing to attend his daughter's high school graduation. Six times a runner-up at the U.S. Open, Mickelson skipped another chance at completing a career grand slam when it became obvious Mother Nature was not going to cooperate and delay the start of the opening round. Mickelson had kept fans and officials guessing almost down to the wire, hanging on to the long shot hope that storms might delay the start of the year's second major and allow him to attend the graduation and then fly from San Diego to Wisconsin to make his tee time. His withdrawal marked the end of a golfing era with the 117th U.S. Open becoming the first major to not include Mickelson and/or Tiger Woods since the 1994 Masters. Woods, who recently underwent his fourth back surgery, has not played a PGA Tour event since January at Torrey Pines, the site of the last of his 14 major wins in 2008. The last major he played in was the 2015 PGA Championship. Editing by Mark Heinrich and Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-idUSKBN1961ZD"},

The overnight operation last week, triggered by a run on the bank that left it critically short of liquidity, was the first test for the European Union mechanism to wind-down failing lenders.  The authorities involved in the resolution acted in a very swift manner ensuring a continuation of core functions with no resulting costs for the taxpayers and this is very good,  Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers that discussed Popular's rescue. Ministers were briefed on the operation by the European Central Bank and by Elke Koenig, who chairs the EU body to liquidate banks, the Single Resolution Board. The two bodies led the rescue of Popular. No minister criticized the operation, as no  reasonable  alternative private solution was available and no public support was in sight, an EU official said reporting discussions among ministers. Owners of Popular bonds lost some 2 billion euros but the Spanish financial market reacted calmly after the rescue, despite fears of possible disruption that had until then dissuaded authorities from using the new liquidation procedure. The mechanism was adopted after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis to reduce taxpayers costs by dictating losses on shareholders, bondholders and even uninsured depositors, if necessary.  Italy has used an exception to the new rules to rescue with public money Monte Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), the country's fourth bank, and is negotiating with EU institutions a similar operation for two smaller regional banks from the Veneto. Dijsselbloem, who has been one of the main architects of the new mechanism, said the resolution of Popular was  successful .  The mechanism has worked very well. Its goal is to create stability and protect depositors, and in that process protect taxpayers. All three of these goals were met,  he told reporters.

Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies who cut ties last week, in the worst rift among Gulf Arab states in years. They accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and cosying up to their enemy Iran, all of which Qatar denies. The fighter jet deal came amid increased diplomacy to try to resolve the crisis. Trump has repeatedly echoed the accusations against Qatar, even as his Defense and State Departments have tried to remain neutral in the dispute among key allies. Qatar hosts a big U.S. military base housing the headquarters of U.S. air forces in the Middle East. On Wednesday U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed the previously approved Boeing plane deal with Qatari Minister of State for Defence Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah. Qatar's ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, posted a picture of the signing ceremony on Twitter.  This is of course proof that U.S. institutions are with us but we have never doubted that,  a Qatari official in Doha said.  Our militaries are like brothers. America's support for Qatar is deep-rooted and not easily influenced by political changes.  In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States continued to work with Qatar and other governments in the region and the planes deal had been years in the making.  We see it as a tangible show of support for our defense relationship and their commitment to the United States,  spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. A Qatari defense ministry source said the deal was for 36 jets. In November, under the administration of former President Barack Obama, the United States approved a possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing, the prime contractor on the sale, declined to comment.

Just like other countries, like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt ... it is natural for Qatar to buy airplanes or parts necessary for its own defense,  Cavusoglu said in Kuwait following talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency. Turkey is friendly to Qatar and has sent food supplies since the sanctions were imposed. Kuwait has led efforts to mediate the dispute which had affected food imports and raised questions over the Gulf Arab state's plans to host the 2022 World Cup. A European diplomat in the Gulf said the timing of the deal appeared coincidental. Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon Presumably the U.S. could have delayed the deal if they'd wanted to, although I don't think there's a great connect between sales and foreign policy.  Important Air Base Qatar is an important base for the U.S. military carrying out operations against Islamic State militants and other groups in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and beyond. Al Udeid Air Base is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Two U.S. warships arrived at Hamad port in Qatar as part of a planned joint military exercise involving marine forces, Qatar's state news agency said on Wednesday. Cavusoglu, who visited Qatar and Kuwait to try to push diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, said on Thursday he intends to travel to Saudi Arabia on Friday for talks with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz about the crisis. Slideshow (5 Images) Saudi Arabia is important and the Saudi King is respected by everyone. Our expectation from King Salman is that he be the leader in solving this problem,  Cavusoglu said at a joint news conference with his Tunisian counterpart. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke by telephone with his Omani counterpart, Oman state news agency reported. The foreign ministry said foreign affairs minister Youssef bin Alawi called for support of Kuwaiti mediation efforts as the best chance for resolving the crisis. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - a broad movement whose Islamist goals are anathema to Egypt's ex-military president, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and to many of the Gulf's dynastic rulers. Conservative Gulf neighbors have long viewed Qatar's foreign policy with suspicion, especially its refusal to shun Shi'ite Iran, and resented its state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera for airing critical views from across the region. Qatar on Thursday said that preparations for the 2022 World Cup were unhindered, having secured alternative supplies of construction materials to those that had been coming by land from Saudi Arabia. Qatar's main port was also bustling with ships bringing food supplies and construction materials, witnesses said. The Pentagon said the jets sale would increase security cooperation between the United States and Qatar and help them operate together. It added that Mattis and Attiyah had also discussed the current state of operations against Islamic State and the importance of de-escalating tensions in the Gulf. The fighter jet deal had been stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administration's broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf. Trump, who took office in January, has accused Qatar of being a  high-level  sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the State Department's efforts to help ease the diplomatic crisis.

Law enforcement agencies and congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with members of Trump's campaign. Here is what is publicly known and not known: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putin's associates hacked information, paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said. The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow's role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia's role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying:  I will tell you this, Russia: if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.  He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf. The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration.  As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,  Trump said, although he added:  It could have been others also.  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.  The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?  he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted:  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  Did the FBI probe continue after Comey's dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey's departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey's firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it. Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on  Restoring Confidence in the FBI  that recommended Comey's dismissal. Rosenstein's memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton's use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein's view was that Comey's decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation. Was Comey's firing related to the FBI's Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBI's Russia probe.  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that,  Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agency's investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency, according Comey's testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agency's probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed.  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called  Showboat  to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation? Mueller's probe has expanded to include examining whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to curtail the FBI's probe of Russian meddling, the Washington Post reported on June 14. In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he had thanked Comey for informing him that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. The Post reported the scope of the probe expanded to include Trump shortly after Comey's dismissal, citing government officials. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-qa-idUSL1N1JC1SS"},

State health director Nick Lyon, charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office stemming from his role in the crisis, and Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive charged with obstruction of justice and lying to police, appeared at bond hearings Thursday in District Court in Flint, the Detroit News reported.  Charles Chamberlain, Lyon's attorney, and Jerold Lax, Wells' attorney, could not immediately be reached for comment. But the attorneys both told the newspaper that they would contest the charges.  I expect it will be clear that Dr. Wells is a competent, dedicated and respected health professional and that any action she took during this unfortunate situation was taken only for the purpose of protecting legitimate public health concerns,  Lax said, according the newspaper. Lyon was released on a $15,000 bond, and Wells was released on a personal recognizance bond, according to the local news website Mlive.com. They were among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials criminally charged on Wednesday. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has said Lyon and Wells would remain in their jobs. Court documents allege Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires' in December 2015, the documents said. Wells is alleged to have lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said.

The pilot, who was not identified, was being treated for serious burns and injuries, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office. No one else was on board the blimp. The incident occurred near Erin, Wisconsin, about 45 miles northwest of Milwaukee. The sheriff's office said the blimp may have experienced mechanical problems prior to the crash. The blimp crashed in an open field about a half mile (one km) from the Erin Hills golf course around 11:15 a.m CDT (1615 GMT), according to a statement from the U.S. Golf Association. Some witnesses reported on social media that the blimp was on fire and smoking before it hit the ground, and smoke was visible rising among the trees after the crash.  I was teeing off and I looked up and saw it on fire, and I felt sick to my stomach. I had the shakes. I felt terrible for the people inside,  golfer Jamie Lovemark said at a news conference. Golfer Brandt Snedeker said his caddie pointed it out on the 9th hole.  He said the blimp is not looking good,  he said to reporters. The blimp, not affiliated with the U.S. Open, was operated by Airsign, a Florida-based company, to display advertising, Airsign sales manager Catherine Walsh said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it would investigate the incident. According to the sheriff's office, the blimp had been airborne for several hours prior to the incident and was lawfully operating at the proper altitude.

Hog futures fell sharply to their session lows at 10:10 a.m. CDT (1610 GMT) in what two traders called a  flash crash,  before prices recouped a portion of their losses.      We saw the market dip $2 (per cwt) in a matter of seconds,  said Top Third Ag Marketing broker Craig VanDyke, adding that the move likely was tied to automated selling.     Chicago Mercantile Exchange July hogs        fell 0.525 cents to 82.050 cents per pound, settling above the contract's session low of 80.725 cents. August hogs        dropped 1.475 cents to 78.925 cents.     U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing a downturn in U.S. weekly pork export sales were seen as bearish but prices for cash hogs and wholesale pork have been trending higher, buoying futures.                        USDA after the close of trading said hogs in the top cash markets of Iowa and southern Minnesota were up $1.03 to $81.58 per cwt.               CME live cattle         and feeder cattle futures         each fell to the lowest levels in weeks before rebounding. Cattle breached support of several moving averages amid lower prices for cash cattle and declines in beef.       It's hard to be long when you are waking up to negative news every day,  said Kevin Bost, president of Procurement Strategies Inc.  I think you have about five or six weeks of falling beef prices and falling cattle prices.      Small numbers of cash cattle fetched $130 to $134 per cwt in the U.S. Plains this week, down as much as $7 from a week ago, feedlot sources said.     Cattle and beef often ease in the hottest months of the summer, when consumers cook fewer pricey beef cuts such as roasts, choosing cheaper options such as burgers.     However, the losses in futures may have been too great, prompting bargain buying.

The Office of Management and Budget, which Mulvaney heads, has directed agencies to come up with plans to streamline their operations. As a part of this push, the budget office reviewed 253 of its guidance and policy documents and found that 59 were no longer needed. President Donald Trump has pledged to reorganize the federal government and to do away with onerous rules and policies that slow down administration priorities and increase the cost of governing. Some of the paperwork that the budget office deemed unnecessary included old requirements for submitting plans for Y2K, the effort to get computer systems up to date for the year 2000. Another scrapped requirement was that agencies develop 10 to 15 page business plans for contracts over $50 million. Under a new process, agencies will use a three-page template. The White House has directed agencies outside of OMB to conduct reviews of their own paperwork obligations to see what can be removed. Mulvaney also said the White House would begin assessing the various government reports to Congress that are required by statutes to develop a list of those that lawmakers should consider rescinding.

The S&P; technology sector fell 0.5 percent, continuing a slide that began last Friday. The sector cut steeper losses from earlier in the session, as did the benchmark S&P; 500. Apple shares ended down 0.6 percent while Google parent Alphabet dropped 0.8 percent after separate bearish analysts reports on the two tech heavyweights. The consumer discretionary sector dropped 0.5 percent, as Amazon.com shares closed down 1.3 percent. Nike fell 3.2 percent after the company said it would cut about 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles. Tech, still the best-performing group this year, and consumer discretionary have been among the sectors that have fueled the S&P; 500's 8.6-percent rally in 2017.  You seem to be losing some momentum in the big growth names that have led the market so far this year,  said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.  At the same time, the economic data has just not been good enough to get investors excited about buying into other areas of the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.66 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,359.9, the S&P; 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,432.46 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.39 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,165.50. Financials and energy, sectors that should thrive during economic expansions, also sold off. Financials slipped 0.4 percent and energy fell 0.7 percent.

If your best-performing sectors are real estate and utilities, it's a good sign that interest rates are dominating the equity market,  said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist with TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen.

Following that disappointing economic data, a report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Fed to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth.  Monetary policy got hawkish,  said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.  Fiscal policy is getting delayed and inflation will not cooperate the way the markets and the Fed want it to.

A week ago, President Donald Trump's administration and 14 Republican U.S. senators said they wanted the spying authority to be renewed without any changes before it expires at the end of the year. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act adopted by Congress in 2008, including a controversial part known as Section 702, broadened the U.S. government's legal authority to conduct surveillance of phone calls, emails and other communications belonging to foreigners who live overseas. U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. allies consider the law vital to national security, but privacy advocates have criticized Section 702 for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to an unknown number of Americans without a search warrant.  Government surveillance activities under the FISA Amendments Act have violated Americans' constitutionally protected rights,  the group of about three dozen lawmakers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement.  We oppose any reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act that does not include substantial reforms to the government's collection and use of Americans' data.  The caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has already had success in challenging the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership on other policy issues. It opposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on grounds that it did not do enough to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare law, earning concessions on a bill that passed the House in May. The intraparty dissent among Republicans in Congress over Section 702 resembles a debate that took place two years ago, when lawmakers disagreed sharply over whether to curtail a National Security Agency program that collected U.S. call metadata in bulk - a practice exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The dispute led to the brief expiration of the USA Patriot Act before lawmakers passed a law effectively terminating the bulk collection practice. The extent of Section 702 spying was also revealed in disclosures by Snowden, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. On Wednesday, a declassified court document, made public in response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, revealed that an unidentified U.S. technology company objected in 2014 to participating in a Section 702 program, but was ordered by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to comply.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-intelligence-idUSL1N1JC1QV"},

The study, the first systematic analysis of police body-camera footage, found subtle but widespread racial disparities in officers’ language. “Our findings highlight that, on the whole, police interactions with black community members are more fraught than their interactions with white community members,” said Jennifer Eberhardt, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Stanford University in California, in a press release. “Words are power,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a statement. “And this study shows that the words police officers use are consequential.”  She pledged to work to end racial differences in Oakland policing. Transcripts of 981 stops conducted by 245 Oakland officers in April 2014 showed that police were more likely to call white drivers “sir,” or “ma’am,” or to address them by a courtesy title and their last name, while officers were more likely to address black drivers by their first name or call them “bro,” “dude” or “bud.”  The racial disparities persisted even after researchers controlled for the race of the officer, the location and the outcome of the stop and the severity of the infraction. Officers were 57 percent more likely to offer an apology, to thank or otherwise speak in what is considered a respectful way to white drivers than blacks, according to the report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. On the other hand, officers were 61 percent more likely to address black residents less respectfully; for example, they were more likely to order blacks to keep their hands on the wheel. “To be clear: There was no swearing,” Dan Jurafsky, a study co-author and Stanford professor of linguistics and of computer science, said in a statement. “These were well-behaved officers. But the many small differences in how they spoke with community members added up to pervasive racial disparities.” The Oakland police department is the nation’s first law-enforcement agency to allow a university to examine body-worn camera footage of vehicle stops. The racially diverse Bay Area city of about 420,000 was a pioneer of police body cameras in 2010.  Supporters of police body cameras, worn now in major cities throughout the U.S, say the footage can help avert or resolve cases of police misconduct.  Lead author Rob Voigt, a Stanford linguistics doctoral student, told Reuters Health in an email that the study shows the footage also offers possible insight into everyday police-community relations. “Police departments can use these tools not only to diagnose problems in police-community relations but also to develop solutions,” he said.  Although this study focuses on traffic stops, the findings speak to a known issue about policing and racial bias,” said Dr. Gary Slutkin, founder of Cure Violence at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health. “Everyone has biases, but because police have so much power over citizens, including to arrest, charge and even use a gun, these biases do cause harm,” Slutkin, who was not involved in the study, said in an email. Every routine traffic stop is “an opportunity to build or erode public trust in the police,” the study authors write.  Without knowing the race or gender of the officers or the stopped motorists, 70 undergraduate students rated officers’ transcribed utterances based on their level of respect, politeness and friendliness. Researchers then created a computational linguistic model of how speakers show respect, including apologies and commands, and designed software to identify words and phrases in the body-camera footage transcripts. Investigators employed the software to examine the remaining transcripts.  “The racial disparities in officer respect are clear and consistent, yet the causes of these disparities are less clear,” the authors write. “It is certainly possible that some of these disparities are prompted by the language and behavior of the community members themselves, particularly as historical tensions in Oakland and preexisting beliefs about the legitimacy of the police may induce fear, anger, or stereotype threat,” they write. “However, community member speech cannot be the sole cause of these disparities.” Police encounters tend to be stressful, and the study highlights the need for community interventions, like mental health and substance-abuse prevention programs, to try to reduce residents’ encounters with law enforcement, Slutkin said.

Sills, who called the prisoners  dangerous beyond description  after their Tuesday sunrise escape, told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the fugitives were likely no longer in the area.  This is a very fluid nationwide investigation.  Donnie Rowe, 43, and Ricky Dubose, 24, both serving time for armed robbery, escaped in rural Putnam County, about 70 miles (110 km) southeast of Atlanta, as they were being transported with 31 other inmates to another prison. The fugitives each have 9-millimeter guns they took off the prison officers they killed, said Sills, correcting information he gave on Tuesday about their likely weapons. “They just murdered two corrections officers in a brutal fashion. They’re not concerned with anything regarding human life,” Sills said. Ricky Myrick, assistant commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, who appeared with Sills at a press conference, said the inmates were most recently cellmates at Baldwin State Prison and had been cellmates at other Georgia prisons.

Courtesy Georgia Corrections/Handout via REUTERS They have known each other for quite a while,  said Myrick. A white 2008 Ford F-250 Super Duty two-door pickup truck with a dent in the right quarter panel and tool boxes on its sides was stolen about 9 miles from the site of a Tuesday home break-in in Madison, Georgia. The pair stole clothing from the house about 25 miles north of where they had escaped, and authorities found discarded prison clothing there on Tuesday. Myrick said it is a possibility that Rowe and Dubose had planned the escape, but that they were not informed of their transfer on Tuesday. The pickup truck was the second vehicle the pair have stolen, Sills said. Immediately after their escape, they carjacked a green Honda Civic. Local media reported on Wednesday the Honda was found in a wooded area about a mile from the burglarized house. Dubose has many distinctive tattoos, including one over each eye. The pickup truck was taken from a rock quarry business, Sills told reporters, adding that the pickup was taken sometime after the business closed at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday and when it reopened about 6 a.m. on Wednesday.

His administration said it would seek an additional $250 million in updated budget proposals in November and April in support of the plan, on top of the $1 billion the city is already spending on existing economic growth programs. The administration makes regular budgetary changes based on revised revenue estimates, management needs or policy changes. Anthony Hogrebe, spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in a telephone interview that no new taxes, fees or other revenue generators were needed to pay for the program. The money would come from existing city or EDC funds, he said. However, other than the additional $250 million, the 60-page plan lays out little new spending and no changes to existing tax incentive programs for businesses. De Blasio, a Democrat, is up for re-election in November. His approval rating soared to 60 percent in a Quinnipiac University poll last month, which also found that he would beat two declared Republican challengers by 3 to 1 margins. In his February state of the city address, De Blasio touted the 100,000 new jobs goal but did not say how it would be accomplished. Under the plan, called New York Works, the city is focusing on jobs with salaries of at least $50,000 in cybersecurity, life sciences and healthcare, manufacturing, and creative and cultural industries. Asked about the timing of the plan's release and whether it was in support of de Blasio's re-election bid, Hogrebe said it was meant to pull together different efforts into a single strategy  to ensure we were all focused on delivering a specific kind of job.  The plan is focused on creating jobs that fall between the very top and very bottom of the income spectrum, which have been left out of private sector growth, he said.  It pulls together work that we have been doing since day one of this administration, with some recently developed and previously announced initiatives, and acknowledges that this is a 10-year plan,  Hogrebe said. The 100,000 new jobs would be in addition to natural job growth, Hogrebe said. State labor department data projects that more than 209,000 jobs with median salaries of at least $50,000 are to be created in New York City between 2012 and 2022, the most current forecast available.

Atlantia made a cash-and-share offer for the Spanish firm in mid-May in an attempt to create the world's biggest toll road company and said it wanted at least 10 percent of Abertis shareholders to accept payment in shares. In a prospectus filed with Spain's stock market regulator on Thursday, Atlantia said it was still insisting on some shareholders accepting payment in shares. However, it suggested it could consider a full cash offer, although it said such a move would require asking Spanish regulator CNMV  for permission to modify the terms of the offer ... extending the cash offer to the entirety of Abertis shares.  Atlantia would not comment on whether it would go ahead with asking for a change in terms. The Italian infrastructure company, which is controlled by the Benetton family, wants to win support from Abertis shareholders representing at least 50 percent plus one share. This has shone a spotlight on Criteria Caixa, the holding company that controls Spanish lender Caixabank and which is the biggest shareholder in Abertis with a 22.3 percent stake. A source close to the matter said changing terms of the bid to make it an all-cash offer could sweeten Atlantia's proposal and lure smaller investors in Abertis.   A move to change the offer to an all-cash deal would make Criteria Caixa less relevant for the outcome of the deal,  the source told Reuters. Industry analysts have said Criteria Caixa could be interested in swapping its shares in the Spanish firm with Atlantia's, while other investors could be more interested in cash. Abertis said on Thursday it did not expect to respond to Atlantia's offer until it had been approved by the regulator, a process that usually takes two or three months.  Criteria Caixa said it would not comment until Abertis responded. Atlantia maintained its offer of 16.5 euros per Abertis share on Thursday and confirmed its approach was a friendly one. The Spanish company's stock closed at 16.42 euros. Atlantia intended to  meet strategic interests of Spain  in relation to stake held by Abertis in satellite operator Hispasat, the Italian company said.  The Spanish government can block the transaction.

A week ago, President Donald Trump's administration and 14 Republican U.S. senators said they wanted the spying authority to be renewed without any changes before it expires at the end of the year. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act adopted by Congress in 2008, including a controversial part known as Section 702, broadened the U.S. government's legal authority to conduct surveillance of phone calls, emails and other communications belonging to foreigners who live overseas. U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. allies consider the law vital to national security, but privacy advocates have criticized Section 702 for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to an unknown number of Americans without a search warrant.  Government surveillance activities under the FISA Amendments Act have violated Americans' constitutionally protected rights,  the group of about three dozen lawmakers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement.  We oppose any reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act that does not include substantial reforms to the government's collection and use of Americans' data.  The caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has already had success in challenging the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership on other policy issues. It opposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on grounds that it did not do enough to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare law, earning concessions on a bill that passed the House in May. The intraparty dissent among Republicans in Congress over Section 702 resembles a debate that took place two years ago, when lawmakers disagreed sharply over whether to curtail a National Security Agency program that collected U.S. call metadata in bulk - a practice exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The dispute led to the brief expiration of the USA Patriot Act before lawmakers passed a law effectively terminating the bulk collection practice. The extent of Section 702 spying was also revealed in disclosures by Snowden, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. On Wednesday, a declassified court document, made public in response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, revealed that an unidentified U.S. technology company objected in 2014 to participating in a Section 702 program, but was ordered by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to comply.

After 12 weeks of twice-weekly lessons, 56 percent in the riding group and 38 percent in the music group said they had experienced meaningful recovery compared to 17 percent who were not given any extra activity. The self-reported benefit persisted six months after the lessons stopped. Coauthor Dr. Michael Nilsson told Reuters Health by phone that the results counter the attitude that stroke patients can't improve if a year has passed since their brain damage occurred.  For a big, big, big group of stroke survivors, it's highly unethical to say nothing can be done after 12 months,  said Nilsson, who directs the Hunter Medical Research Institute in New South Wales, Australia. That attitude can  kill the motivation for further rehabilitation.

Most stroke recovery research seems to take place in the acute phase,  he told Reuters Health in a phone interview.  This is doing it at a later phase, which is very much needed.  On average, the 123 Swedish volunteers started the study nearly three years after suffering their stroke. The Nilsson team, writing in the journal Stroke, speculated that the physical and social aspects of riding or moving to the music were responsible for the improvements. However, it did not compare them to patients who were given other types of extra attention, such as twice-weekly group outings. In addition, the study measured how the patients thought their rehabilitation was progressing, not how well they scored on more objective tests designed to measure their improvement. Such tests of gait, balance, hand strength and memory sometimes did not show enough consistent benefit to rule out the possibility it was due to chance. Nilsson said self-reported improvement was the point of the test.  We wanted their opinion  because positive self-perception  is the key for long term improvement. It's getting the patients engaged and motivated to participate, and to do that in an intense way.  Why? We must understand that you need to be prepared to invest in training and rehabilitation over a long period of time to relearn and learn in new ways to master your disability,  Nilsson said. The interventions were done on patients who were moderately debilitated. All could walk, use transportation services for the disabled and use the toilet without assistance. Horseback riding sessions - which lasted four hours and included special exercises, grooming, equipping the therapy horse and 30 minutes of sitting on the horse as it was being led - produced an immediate jump in perceived improvement. It wasn't until three months after the end of music therapy - where people were asked to move their hands and feet in time with the music in sessions lasting 90 minutes - that patients showed a comparable improvement in how they thought their recovery was going. But when it came to more objective measures, the benefits were less clear. Horseback riding produced immediate and significant improvements in gait and balance in all three tests used by the researchers, but by the sixth month of follow-up, only one of the three tests was still showing better performance. In the rhythm-and-music group, only one of the three tests showed a benefit, either immediately or at the six-month follow-up point. Although limited, the data might help doctors tease out the best types of activities for retraining the brain, Lackland said.  Nilsson, who is also a professor at the University of Newcastle in Australia and University of Gothenburg in Sweden said a larger follow-up study is being planned to confirm the findings. The results are also being analyzed to see if the time elapsed since the stroke influenced how well individual patients did.

Jorge Arzuaga, 56, of Argentina, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in the Brooklyn borough of New York as part of an agreement with prosecutors.  I deeply regret what I did,  Arzuaga said in court.  I am ashamed.  Arzuaga is one of more than 40 people and entities charged in the U.S. probe, in which prosecutors say soccer officials took more than $200 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for marketing and broadcast rights. Arzuaga admitted that beginning in 2010, he helped arrange payments from an executive at an Argentine sports marketing firm, Torneos y Competencias, to the president of the Argentine Football Association, who was also a FIFA senior vice president. Arzuaga did not name him, but the president of the Argentine Football Association at the time was Julio Grondona, who died in 2014. The sports marketing executive, Alejandro Burzaco, pleaded guilty to U.S. bribery charges in 2015. After the official's death, Arzuaga said he helped distribute bribe money left in his account to the official's heirs. Arzuaga said he received payments for helping with the transfers. As part of his plea, he has agreed to forfeit $1,046,000 in improper payments that he received. Arzuaga said he helped transfer the bribes by setting up accounts at two banks where he worked. He was an employee of Credit Suisse until 2012, and at Julius Baer from 2012 until 2015. Arzuaga was released on bail after his plea hearing. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 4. Arzuaga has also been investigated by Swiss authorities, who are expected to announce a resolution of their own charges against him soon, U.S. prosecutors said Thursday. Credit Suisse and Julius Baer could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-largest private bank, was charged last year with helping wealthy Americans dodge taxes, resulting in a deferred prosecution agreement, which requires Julius Baer to steer clear of wrongdoing for three years to ensure that the charges are eventually dismissed. A spokesman for the bank told Reuters last week that it was cooperating in the FIFA investigation, and said there was no indication that the investigation would affect the 2016 agreement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-julius-baer-idUSL1N1JC0UY"},

But there is no sign in the Democratic-led legislature that a breakthrough in the 23-month impasse could be imminent. Rauner warned on Thursday that the inability to pass a budget could bring  devastating and long-lasting ramifications  for the nation's fifth-largest state. Those include possible  junk  credit ratings, a halt to state-funded road projects, and suspension from national lotteries. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of an unprecedented second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between Rauner and Democratic leaders. Rauner said he would sign into law a bill package unveiled by Republican legislators on Wednesday that includes a $36 billion budget, a school funding revamp, and several measures he has sought such as a local property tax freeze, term limits for top state officials and cost-saving changes to the system that compensates injured workers. The bills require three-fifths majority votes for passage instead of a simple majority.  It is a true compromise – and one I hope the majority in the General Assembly will accept,  the governor said in a Facebook video posted on Thursday. Rauner and Democrats continued to blame each other for the budget crisis. “House Democrats will continue our work on the budget from Springfield, but as Governor Rauner has met each of our attempts to date with refusal, it’s clear that the onus is on the governor to show that he is finally serious about working in good faith to end the crisis he has manufactured,  House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement. If Illinois still lacks a budget when the new fiscal year dawns, the consequences could be big. The state's credit ratings could sink to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state's debt and others to demand even fatter yields. The state will be suspended from participating in the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries due to the lack of fiscal 2018 appropriations to pay winning ticket holders, Illinois Lottery spokesman Jason Schaumburg said. The games have generated about $240 million in sales in Illinois so far in fiscal 2017. With no money to pay road contractors, Illinois' transportation department is shutting down about 700 ongoing projects that carry a price tag of $2.3 billion, according to department spokeswoman Gianna Urgo. The budget impasse has ballooned Illinois' pile of unpaid bills to $15 billion as of Wednesday, fueling litigation by unpaid vendors and others. A U.S. judge has set a June 20 deadline for Illinois to start paying more of the $2 billion it owes Medicaid providers.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-idUSL1N1JC1O1"},

Under the plan, called  Consumer Direct Offense , Nike will concentrate on 12 key cities in 10 countries, which are expected to represent over 80 percent of its projected growth through 2020. These cities include New York, Berlin, Paris and Barcelona. The company also said it would focus on newer styles, such as ZoomX, Air VaporMax and Nike React, and on categories with high growth potential, including running, basketball and soccer.

(Reuters) - A former Congressional candidate from Tennessee has been sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison for plotting to burn down a mosque, a school and a cafeteria in upstate New York, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. Robert Doggart, 65, was sentenced on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, where he was convicted in February of trying to recruit people to commit arson and violate civil rights.   Doggart was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in April 2015 after saying in wiretapped telephone calls that he planned to recruit a militia and travel to Islamberg, a rural town that is home to a small Muslim community in Hancock, New York, about 130 miles (209 km) northwest of New York City. While there, he intended to  carry out an armed attack  that included burning down a mosque or  blowing it up with a Molotov cocktail or other explosive device,  the statement said. “I don’t want to have to kill children, but there’s always collateral damage,” Doggart said on one of the recorded calls, according to the statement. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the sentence. “People of all faiths have the fundamental right to worship freely, and this administration will not tolerate attempts to violate that right,” he said in a statement. Doggart's attorney, Leslie Cory, said on Thursday in a telephone interview that an appeal was likely. Cory argued in court that her client would not have carried out the plot and liked to shock people because of a personality disorder and mental problems. Islamberg, started by a group of African-American Muslims who moved from U.S. cities in the 1970s, is a gated community with dirt roads and several dozen small homes near the town of Hancock in New York's Catskills Mountains. The 200 or so members of the community, in which children are home-schooled and residents worship at a mosque built on the 70-acre property, follow a Pakistani Sufi cleric.

Defendants in an insider trading case against employees of the healthcare hedge fund Deerfield Management seem to believe they are. Their lawyers from Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel and Allen & Overy claimed in a letter last month to U.S. District Court Judges Colleen McMahon and Denise Cote of Manhattan that instead of filing a new indictment in the Deerfield case, the government brought a superseding indictment to its already-filed case against a cooperating witness who pleaded guilty. The point of that strategy, the letter suggested, was to allow the government to keep the new case in front of Judge Cote, who will preside over the informant’s sentencing, instead of forcing prosecutors to take their chances with a new, randomly assigned judge.  “Even putting aside whatever advantage the government may see in prosecuting a case before a certain judge as opposed to having it randomly assigned through the criminal wheel, the mere fact that the government has been able to effectively choose its judge in this manner is improper under the rules, unconstitutional and fundamentally unfair to the indicted defendants,” the letter said. “At minimum, it creates a strong appearance of impropriety and unfairness.”  Last week, the Manhattan federal court’s assignment committee, headed by Chief Judge McMahon, unanimously agreed that the Deerfield case should not have been filed as a superseding indictment. The committee ordered that the case be refiled as a new criminal action to be randomly assigned to a new judge.  This isn’t the first time Manhattan federal prosecutors have been accused of gaming the judicial assignment system through the strategic use of superseding indictments. In fact, one of the lawyers for the Deerfield defendants, Barry Berke of Kramer Levin, raised the same allegations a few years back when he defended onetime SAC Capital trader Michael Steinberg. In that case, Berke asserted that the U.S. attorney’s office filed Steinberg’s case as a superseding indictment, even though the other defendants had already pleaded guilty or been convicted, in order to proceed before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. Judge Sullivan had delivered pro-government jury instructions in a prior insider trading case.  Berke’s letter on behalf the Deerfield defendants, who are accused of trading based on inside tips from a federal healthcare agency, cited an admonition the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered to federal prosecutors about the Steinberg case. During oral arguments in the infamous U.S. v. Newman appeal, which involved two insder-trading defendants tried before Judge Sullivan, 2nd Circuit Judge Barrington Parker asked whether the government charged some defendants in its broad insider trading campaign via superseding indictments and others by new indictments to “get their main case before their preferred venue.”  In follow-up questions specifically about the superseding indictment against Steinberg, Judge Parker said it seemed to him that prosecutors were using the superseding indictment to obtain “a tactical benefit.” A footnote in the 2nd Circuit’s 2014 ruling in U.S. v. Newman, which vacated insider trading convictions of two hedge fund executives because of Judge Sullivan’s jury instructions, noted the government’s procedural maneuvering in the Steinberg case. Steinberg’s conviction was subsequently reversed as well.  The Deerfield defendants’ letter said that a non-exhaustive search turned up three white-collar cases in which prosecutors charged defendants via superseding indictments to cases against cooperating witnesses and seven in which defendants were charged in new indictments, despite existing cases against informants. According to a follow-up letter from defense lawyers, there’s no obvious rationale for the inconsistency.  An amicus letter from the New York Council of Defense Lawyers explained the issue succinctly. “It appears that, in cases where it has discretion to choose among different procedural options, the United States Attorney's Office relies on superseding indictments when it prefers to have what amounts to a new case remain with a particular judge, and relies on new or original indictments when it prefers to have a case assigned to a different judge,” the letter said. “There appears to be no policy, no articulated rationale and no consistency governing such choices. A reasonable observer might well conclude that the government is simply picking and choosing among judges.”  Prosecutors in the Deerfield case said in their letter to Judges McMahon and Cote that the government has all kinds of perfectly legitimate reasons to choose to bring a superseding indictment instead of filing an entirely new case, including factual overlap, the likelihood a cooperator will be called to testify and judicial efficiency. “In this case, these factors weighed in favor of superseding this case into the recently-filed case before Judge Cote,” the letter said.  And despite the defendants’ “speculation that inconsistencies in the government’s charging practices amounts to improper conduct fueled by illicit motives,” prosecutors said, the government can’t be accused of angling to get its case before Judge Cote to take advantage of her prior rulings for the simple reason that she hasn’t issued any. “There are no contested legal issues as to which Judge Cote has already ruled in the government’s favor in the matter,” the letter said.  The June 8 order calling for the case to be refiled as a new indictment does not explain the assignment committee’s reasoning but does say the members of the committee – Judges William Pauley, Vincent Briccetti and Valerie Caproni, in addition to Chief Judge McMahon – considered both sides’ submissions.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who is handling the Deerfield case, did not respond to a phone message. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-shopping-idUSKBN1962Q9"},

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 242,000 in the latest week.     In addition, June readings of the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index both beat economists' expectations.      Yields on Treasuries maturing between 2-10 years rose, with two-year yields touching a three-month high of 1.368 percent on the heels of the Fed's second interest rate increase of the year on Wednesday. However, 30-year yields were last roughly unchanged from late Wednesday and the rise in benchmark 10-year yields only reversed about a third of the extent of Wednesday's plunge.      That drop in yields came after government data on inflation and retail sales for May fell well short of market expectations. Analysts said traders continued to doubt the Fed would be able to raise interest rates for a third time this year, as the central bank projected Wednesday, given soft inflation readings.      At some point, (Fed) policymakers are going to have to recognize that, if inflation remains low, they’re not going to be able to pursue further hikes,  said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.     Analysts also said yields were pressured higher after the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee came its closest to voting for a rate rise since 2007 this week.     Along with the rise in two-year yields, three-year yields  briefly jumped above 1.5 percent after hitting 1.417 percent Wednesday. Short-dated yields are most sensitive to Fed rate movements.     Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were last at 2.160 percent, from 2.138 percent late Wednesday. Benchmark yields hit 2.103 percent Wednesday, their lowest since Nov. 10.       There is still a lot of uncertainty  about U.S. growth, said Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.      Other data showing import prices recorded their biggest drop in 15 months in May suggested domestic inflation measures could remain soft for a while. That low inflation outlook helped keep long-dated yields anchored, Rupert said.

The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015, figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show, the first such decline since the CDC began reporting the measure in 2011. The number of high school students who smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to being surveyed fell to 8 percent from 9.3 percent in 2015, the data shows. In 2011 the number was 15.8 percent.  This represents a historic public health victory,  said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, adding that the dramatic decline was the result of public messaging campaigns directed at youth. The decline in e-cigarette use was even greater, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016 from 16 percent in 2015.  These numbers are astounding,  said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the department of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health.  It really means that we may be within reach of a smoke-free generation.  The decline in cigarette use follows a broad array of public health campaigns and coincides with the rise of vaping.  This should put to bed any remaining concerns that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes or will lead to a re-normalization of smoking,  Siegel said. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use remained unchanged, the CDC's figures show, though the balance between products changed. As e-cigarette use increased, traditional cigarette use declined. Cigarette use among high school students fell during that period to 8 percent from 15.8 percent while use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent.     President Donald Trump's proposed 2018 budget includes a nearly 20 percent drop in the CDC's disease prevention and health promotion programs, including eliminating dedicated funding for its Office on Smoking and Health. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement that while the latest figures were encouraging  it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.  He said the agency had issued more than 4,000 warning letters to retailers for selling e-cigarettes, cigars or hookah tobacco to minors since youth access restrictions went into effect last August. Gottlieb, who previously held a financial interest in the vape shop Kure, has said publicly that certain e-cigarettes may have the potential to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. The latest data showed no decline in cigarette use among middle school students, where the rate was 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. Analysts with Wells Fargo Securities expect sales of vaping products to reach $4.4 billion in 2017.

Lyle Jeffs, 57, was arrested on Wednesday night in the small South Dakota city of Yankton, about 80 miles (130 km) southwest of Sioux Falls. He had been living out of a Ford pickup truck there for at least two weeks, Eric Barnhart, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Salt Lake City office, said at a press conference. Jeffs had been on the run since he slipped out of an ankle monitor and fled house arrest on June 18, 2016, in Salt Lake City, where he was awaiting trial with other leaders of the religious sect on charges they diverted money from a federal government food assistance program for the poor.  When you flee a federal indictment, the long arm of the law will eventually catch up to you and bring you back to justice,  Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber said at the press conference. A member of the public, who has not been named, spotted Jeffs and tipped off local law enforcement on Wednesday. He was arrested without incident and booked into Minnehaha County Jail, where he is awaiting extradition to Utah. Jeffs will likely face additional felony charges for fleeing prosecution, Hubert said. The FBI and local authorities are investigating whether anyone helped Jeffs, as well as where, besides Yankton, he spent the past year. Lyle Jeffs is a brother of Warren Jeffs, who is considered the prophet of the religious sect and is serving a sentence of up to life in prison plus 20 years in Texas for illegally marrying and sexually abusing underage girls. FLDS is based in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. It is an offshoot of the mainstream Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormon church, which renounced polygamy in 1890 and is not affiliated with the FLDS. Prosecutors allege that 11 FLDS leaders, including Lyle Jeffs, conspired to defraud the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, and conspired to commit money laundering.

Adamis said the Food and Drug Administration also approved the brand name Symjepi. The company expects to begin selling the pre-filled syringes in the second half of this year. The company did not disclose the price for a pair of Symjepi syringes, but the product was expected to cost less than EpiPen. Mylan has faced severe criticism and congressional and legal investigations after it doubled the cost for a pair of EpiPens to $600, enraging consumers. It has since offered its own generic version for about $300 in response to the furor.  With an anticipated lower cost, small size and user-friendly design, we believe Symjepi could be an attractive option for a significant portion of both the retail (patient) and non-retail (professional) sectors of the epinephrine market,  Adamis Chief Executive Dennis Carlo said in a statement. Epinephrine is the life-saving treatment of choice for severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings, exposure to peanuts or medications.

I deeply regret what I did,  Arzuaga said in court.  I am ashamed.  Arzuaga is one of more than 40 people and entities charged in the U.S. probe, in which prosecutors say soccer officials took more than $200 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for marketing and broadcast rights. Arzuaga admitted that beginning in 2010, he helped arrange payments from an executive at an Argentine sports marketing firm, Torneos y Competencias, to the president of the Argentine Football Association, who was also a FIFA senior vice president. Arzuaga did not name him, but the president of the Argentine Football Association at the time was Julio Grondona, who died in 2014. The sports marketing executive, Alejandro Burzaco, pleaded guilty to U.S. bribery charges in 2015. After the official's death, Arzuaga said he helped distribute bribe money left in his account to the official's heirs. Arzuaga said he received payments for helping with the transfers. As part of his plea, he has agreed to forfeit $1,046,000 in improper payments that he received. Arzuaga said he helped transfer the bribes by setting up accounts at two banks where he worked. He was an employee of Credit Suisse until 2012, and at Julius Baer from 2012 until 2015. Arzuaga was released on bail after his plea hearing. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 4. Arzuaga has also been investigated by Swiss authorities, who are expected to announce a resolution of their own charges against him soon, U.S. prosecutors said Thursday. Credit Suisse and Julius Baer could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-largest private bank, was charged last year with helping wealthy Americans dodge taxes, resulting in a deferred prosecution agreement, which requires Julius Baer to steer clear of wrongdoing for three years to ensure that the charges are eventually dismissed. A spokesman for the bank told Reuters last week that it was cooperating in the FIFA investigation, and said there was no indication that the investigation would affect the 2016 agreement.

But there is no sign in the Democratic-led legislature that a breakthrough in the 23-month impasse could be imminent. Rauner warned on Thursday that the inability to pass a budget could bring  devastating and long-lasting ramifications  for the nation's fifth-largest state. Those include possible  junk  credit ratings, a halt to state-funded road projects, and suspension from national lotteries. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of an unprecedented second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between Rauner and Democratic leaders.  Rauner said he would sign into law a bill package unveiled by Republican legislators on Wednesday that includes a $36 billion budget, a school funding revamp, and several measures he has sought such as a local property tax freeze, term limits for top state officials and cost-saving changes to the system that compensates injured workers. The bills require three-fifths majority votes for passage instead of a simple majority.

Rauner and Democrats continued to blame each other for the budget crisis. “House Democrats will continue our work on the budget from Springfield, but as Governor Rauner has met each of our attempts to date with refusal, it’s clear that the onus is on the governor to show that he is finally serious about working in good faith to end the crisis he has manufactured,  House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement. If Illinois still lacks a budget when the new fiscal year dawns, the consequences could be big. The state's credit ratings could sink to  junk,  a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state's debt and others to demand even fatter yields. The state will be suspended from participating in the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries due to the lack of fiscal 2018 appropriations to pay winning ticket holders, Illinois Lottery spokesman Jason Schaumburg said.

The world's largest packaged foods maker said on Thursday it would  explore strategic options , including a possible sale, for the business that also includes 100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets. Analysts have been speculating that Nestle could exit the U.S. confectionary business which is not in line with its stated strategy of becoming more health and nutrition-focused. That strategy, underlined by last year's naming of a healthcare veteran as CEO, comes as the whole packaged food sector battles a slowdown from a new generation of savvy consumers that are eating fresher and healthier foods. The review is limited to the United States, where Nestle does not control its key KitKat brand, and is No. 4 behind Mars, Hershey and Mondelez International. With annual sales of 900 million Swiss francs ($923 million), the U.S. confectionery business accounts for only 1 percent of company sales. Nestle's other products range from instant coffee to mineral water and baby food.  This might seem small stuff, but in our view it could be a significant step by new-ish CEO Mark Schneider ... towards a more deliberate and efficient capital allocation strategy,  said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones in a note. Nestle said it remained  fully committed  to growing its international confectionery business, particularly KitKat, which is made in the United States by Hershey. It said it would also keep the Nestle Toll House baking products. Globally, Nestle's confectionery business generated sales of 8.8 billion Swiss francs ($9.02 billion) last year. To-Do List The global packaged food industry has seen a wave of deals as companies seek to boost profits in a weak market. Unilever is trying to sell its shrinking margarines business after rebuffing a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz, and Reckitt Benckiser Group is selling its French's mustard business to pay down debt from its purchase of Mead Johnson, which closed on Thursday. Nestle had organic sales growth of 3.2 percent last year, which Bernstein analysts said was the lowest of this century and the fifth straight year of slowing growth. With that backdrop, Nestle has pushed aggressively into areas of health and nutritional science, buying and investing in a range of biotech and medical device firms, as it presses the boundaries between food and medicine. At the same time it has divested underperforming businesses including the Nutrament drink, Jenny Craig diet business and PowerBar snacks. Last year, it formed an ice cream joint venture with Britain's R&R.; Last year, RBC's Jones said a strategic review of the confectionery business should be near the top of the new CEO's to-do list.  It's incompatible with Nestle's strategy, margins are falling and its competitive position is anaemic,  he said. The clear U.S. leader is Hershey, which last year rejected a takeover offer by its more international rival, Mondelez.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nestle-confectionery-idUSL1N1JC1L1"},

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) need to give up the last 40 percent of their arms, as agreed last year with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos. Nearly 60 percent of their arms were handed over by Tuesday..   We have taken the political decision. We respect the agreement and we will implement it, whatever it takes,  FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, told Reuters. Under the accord, rejected in a public referendum but pushed through by congress, the FARC will become a political party and most fighters will receive an amnesty after explaining their actions publicly.  Londono said the FARC were discussing internally the name of their future political party, which could be ultimately decided at a FARC congress in August.   We are working with the date of August, the middle or the end of August. It could also be the beginning of September,  he said, declining to say which options for names were on the table.   The Congress will decide all these things ...  democratically,  he said. Londono was speaking after discussing the peace process together with Colombia's Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin, in a rare joint public appearance outside Colombia by a member of the government and a FARC leader. Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin and FARC leader Rodrigo Londono Echeverri, also known as Timoleon Jimenez or Timochenko, meet Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende for a conversation about how they achieved peace after 52 years of armed conflict in Colombia, at Litteraturhuset in Oslo, Norway June 15, 2017. NTB Scanpix/Hakon Mosvold Larsen via REUTERSAsked on stage by Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende to describe some of the more personal moments of the talks, Londono recalled the time he sustained a heart attack in the middle of negotiations in Havana and was  resuscitated by Cuban doctors .  Afterwards I received a personal card from President Santos wishing me well. It meant a lot to me,  Londono, visibly moved, told the audience.  At the very beginning of the process, FARC leaders had difficulty discussing among themselves whether to participate in the process, he said.  We could not talk on the radio. We could get killed just to talk on the radio. We could not meet to discuss,  said Londono. On the main stumbling blocks were for the peace process, the Colombian foreign minister said that the key was for Colombian farmers to feel they would be better off cultivating legal crops rather than coca, the crop used to produce cocaine.   We must be able to give farmers the possibility of earning a living legally, instead of cultivating coca. We must substitute crops and remove the landmines,  said Holguin.  Colombia ranks second after Afghanistan on the list of countries with the most landmines, according to the NGO International Campaign to Ban Landmines.  We are in a very difficult phase. Applying the accord is often more complicated than doing the deal in the first place,  she said. Asked the same question, Londono said that reintegrating guerrilla fighters in society was key. Also,  we must remove violence from the exercise of politics,  he said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declined to issue an emergency order blocking the FCC's vote in April to reverse a 2016 order limiting the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy. Critics said in a court filing that failing to block the FCC rule  will usher in a wave of media consolidation.  Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a Georgetown University law professor representing a coalition of groups that had sued, said the decision was  extremely disappointing. But the case is far from over, and we feel that we have a strong case once it is fully briefed and argued.  Shares in Tribune rose 5.6 percent to $41.23 on the news, while Sinclair was up 3.3 percent to $36.00. Sinclair said in a statement it was  pleased that the court denied the motion for an emergency stay of a rule that had been in effect for decades.  As part of the $3.9 billion deal, Sinclair has said it may still have to sell certain of its stations, such as those in St. Louis and Salt Lake City, to comply with FCC regulations. Under rules adopted in 1985, stations with weaker over-the-air signals could only be partially counted against a broadcaster's ownership cap. But last year, the FCC, under Democratic President Barack Obama, said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting, which eliminated the differences in signal strength. It revoked the rules in September. In April, the FCC voted to undo the Obama change. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai also said he plans to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, called the vote in April a  huge gift for large broadcasters with ambitious dreams of more consolidation.  She said it  will have an immediate impact on the purchase and sale of television stations.  U.S. broadcasting and publishing group Meredith Corp spokesman Art Slusark said in April the vote  may open up the opportunity for more acquisition opportunities.  Its shares rose 1 percent on Thursday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-sinclair-idUSL1N1JC136"},

Barry Cadden, co-founder of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was cleared of second-degree murder charges but was found guilty in March of racketeering and fraud for his role in shipping injectible steroids tainted with fungus linked to the deadly outbreak that also sickened 753 people in 20 states. Cadden's attorneys argued that prosecutors overreached in the number and severity of criminal charges that they filed against him. The attorneys said the prosectutors misled the jury by providing them a binder filled with laboratory tests showing that vials of steroids shipped by NECC were tainted but not providing comparable reports submitted by defense attorneys showing the vials were sterile.  There is huge prejudice in the fact that the government compiled this in this way in this case,  said Michelle Peirce during Thursday's hearing in Boston federal court.  There are two different test results for much of this but the jury could have assumed that this is all there was.  Prosecutors said the binder was intended to make it easier for jurors to sift through the thousands of pieces of evidence in the case.  Every single document in that binder was an admitted exhibit,  said Assistant U.S. Attorney George Varghese.  The binder issue, your honor, is a red herring for two reasons. One, there is nothing legally wrong with it and, two, there is no evidence that the jury looked at it.  One issue looming ahead of Cadden's sentencing later this month is that the jury handled its paperwork in a quirky way: Rather than just checking  guilty  or  not guilty  for the second-degree murder counts, they filled in numbers that prosecutors say showed that a majority had thought Cadden was guilty on 21 of the 25 murder counts. [L1N1J5015] A total of 14 people tied to the now-defunct Framingham, Massachusetts-based pharmacy were criminally charged, but only two face murder charges. The other is Glenn Chin, the company's pharmacist, who is due to face trial in September. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Cadden ignored the rules and put profits before patients in 2012, when the compounding pharmacy sent out 17,600 vials of steroids contaminated with mold that were mistakenly labeled sterile. The vials went to 23 states. Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-massachusetts-meningitis-idUSKBN1962EY"},

Utah Republican Rob Bishop, who chairs the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, said the board's inaction was  troubling  in a letter to board Chairman Jose Carrion, adding that the debt restructuring at Puerto Rico's power authority, PREPA, was already green-lit by Congress. Bishop's gripe is over a deal struck earlier this year between PREPA and its creditors to restructure some $9 billion of debt. PREPA's financial woes are a microcosm of an economic crisis, marked by $70 billion in total debt, that has pushed Puerto Rico into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Negotiations between PREPA and its bondholders were rocky, lasting more than two years and running into a major roadblock when an initial version of the accord was rejected by Puerto Rico's new governor. Now, the latest deal appears to be hitting a snag too, as the U.S. territory's oversight panel, created by U.S. lawmakers to manage its finances, has yet to approve it.  It appears there is no consensus from the oversight board in favor of certifying  the deal, Bishop said. But Bishop argued the board has no right to review it. The 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA - which originated in Bishop's committee - included language to keep pre-existing compromises like PREPA's out of the board's reach. The board's insistence on reviewing the deal is  outside the scope  of its powers, Bishop said, and could  result in severe, adverse effects for the island, including a dampening of the board's ability to negotiate in good faith with creditors.  Bishop and other lawmakers have supported the quick implementation of the PREPA deal, in large part because it was a compromise struck out of court. PROMESA allows Puerto Rico and its agencies to slash debts through bankruptcy, but Republican lawmakers, wary of massive cuts to bondholders, have tried to encourage out-of-court compromises. Under the PREPA deal, creditors would take repayment cuts of only 15 cents on the dollar, smaller than the hefty haircuts likely to face creditors of other Puerto Rican debt issuers now in bankruptcy.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSL1N1JC1JL"},

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington on Wednesday ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers, in its environmental review of the Dakota Access line, did not fully consider the pipeline's impact on the hunting, fishing and environmental justice rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has been fighting the line for more than a year. Legal experts on Thursday said Boasberg has quite a bit of leeway with his decision, depending on what he deems are the environmental impacts of allowing oil to keep flowing.  Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent he should apply the traditional injunction test to determine exactly what may occur - or not - during additional environmental analysis,  said Zeke Williams, managing director of the energy and natural resources practice at Lewis Bess Williams & Weese in Denver.  The parties, including pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners Inc, are scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux want the judge to stop the pipeline flow when he considers the possibility of additional environmental review.  “Our position has always been that until they can do this correctly, the pipeline shouldn’t be operating,” said Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman, who represents the Standing Rock Sioux.       In a statement, ETP said pipeline operations will continue as the  limited  process unfolds to review the issues raised.  Dakota Access believes the record supports the fact that the Corps properly evaluated  those issues, said ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado.

The line was delayed during months of protests on federal land in North Dakota and as a legal battle played out in Washington. Two of the tribe's earlier arguments had been rejected by the same judge. The 1,170-mile (1,880 km) line had been a long-desired project for Bakken producers, but met heavy resistance from the tribes over concerns about water supply and sacred lands. Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Environmental and Natural Resources Law & Policy Program at Stanford Law School, said the normal remedy under the National Environmental Policy Act would be to stop operations during the review period.

The first shipment of Bakken crude to Asia left port in April, and more was expected as U.S. production continues to rise. Cash traders on Thursday said the legal battle at this moment is not an issue, because operations have not been affected.  “This ruling was a bit of a curve ball given the judge’s prior orders,  said U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota who supports the pipeline. He said he did not believe operations would be halted during review.  (The judge) seems to be sending a message that consultation needs to be considered and documented better in future cases like this,  he told Reuters.

The president and first lady Melania Trump were present in the marble-clad courthouse for an investiture ceremony formally welcoming Gorsuch to the top U.S. court. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice in April and authored his first ruling last week in a debt-collection case. Trump sat near the front of the ornate, burgundy-draped courtroom as Chief Justice John Roberts offered him and the first lady a  warm welcome  in opening remarks. The president sat quietly as Roberts administered the judicial oath to Gorsuch and joined the crowd in applauding Gorsuch, smiling broadly. In appointing Gorsuch, Trump restored the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Trump did not speak at the event. Other notable figures at the ceremony included several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and attorneys general during George W. Bush's presidency, including John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Also attending was Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his presidency. A special counsel examining whether Trump's presidential campaign team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election is now investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice. Trump's travel ban is now before the justices after being blocked by lower courts. In deciding whether to allow the travel ban to go into effect, the justices are set to weigh whether Trump's election campaign rhetoric can be used as evidence that the March 6 order was intended to discriminate against Muslims in violation of the Constitution. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  The court is currently considering an emergency request from Trump's administration seeking to put the travel ban into effect while litigation continues. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The injunctions blocking the ban were upheld on appeal. Trump was able to make the appointment of Gorsuch only because the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court, Merrick Garland.

The losses in gold were limited, however, with bullion underpinned by myriad global uncertainties, including a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was under investigation.                                     Just like in previous rate hikes, the next day the market starts looking at the probability of the next hike because everything was factored in beforehand,  Natixis metals analyst Bernard Dahdah said.     The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a notch as expected on Wednesday and indicated further tightening before the end of the year.                  Spot gold        fell 0.5 percent to $1,254.05 an ounce by 2:56 p.m. EDT (1856 GMT), after touching $1,251.18, the weakest since May 24.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled down 1.7 percent at $1,254.60.     U.S. data on Thursday bolstered the case for higher rates, as the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.                   If you just look at economics, there's a chance of more downside. The Fed was talking about another potential rate hike later this year, which is negative for gold. But there's still enough for people to worry about in geopolitics at different levels,  Dahdah said.     Higher interest rates are negative for gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold by foregoing the chance of earning interest on cash holdings.      We think that the price of the yellow metal will fall in the remainder of the year as the Fed hikes rates by more than the market currently anticipates and global risks fade,  said Capital Economics in a note.      We remain of the view that Fed tightening will prove too strong a headwind for the price of gold this year. Our end-2017 price forecast is $1,100 per ounce, down from about $1,255 today.      The dollar index        rallied after the jobs data and following Wednesday's Fed meeting.     Among other precious metals, silver        shed 0.8 percent to $16.74 per ounce after slipping to $16.64, the lowest since May 19.             Platinum        dropped 1.6 percent to $920.99, having hit the lowest in over a month at $913.50, while palladium        shed 0.2 percent to $861.49 per ounce after rallying by 25 percent so far this year.      We're bullish on palladium compared to last year, but we think it has overshot,  Dahdah said.

The Eurogroup also welcomes the adoption by the Greek parliament of the agreed prior actions for the second review, notably the ambitious post-programme fiscal package, which is composed of an income tax reform broadening the tax base and a pension reform. Together they deliver net savings of 2% of GDP which will underpin the fiscal targets post-2018. It also contains a contingent expansionary package to enhance the growth potential of the Greek economy and to improve the Greek social safety net that will be implemented provided that the agreed medium-term targets are met. We also welcome the adoption of a package of decisive measures to effectively address non-performing loans (NPL), such as establishing an active secondary market, an Out-of-Court Debt Workout framework, as well as all actions to make the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) fully operational. Moreover, the policy package includes a large number of structural measures aimed at enhancing the growth potential of the Greek economy. With regard to labour market reforms, the Eurogroup welcomes the adopted legislation safeguarding previous reforms on collective bargaining and bringing collective dismissals in line with best EU practices. The Eurogroup also commends the Greek authorities for adopting legislation to implement OECD recommendations to strengthen competition, to facilitate investment licensing and to further open-up regulated professions. We welcome the commitment by Greece to continue on its reform path. The Eurogroup also commends Greece and the European Commission for the exceptional mobilisation of EU Funds to boost investment in support of jobs and growth since July 2015, for a total amount of nearly EUR 11 bn. The Eurogroup calls upon the Greek authorities to work closely with the European Commission to ensure that additional EUR 970 million made available following the review of the national cohesion policy funding envelopes for the period from 2017 - 2020 are fully absorbed. Furthermore, we commit to continue to provide high-level experts to support the design and implementation of reforms through technical assistance projects. In parallel the Eurogroup invites Greece together with the institutions as well as relevant third parties by the end of this year to develop and support a holistic growth enhancing strategy including improvements of the investment climate. Further options for mobilizing additional funds from national development banks and other international financial institutions (such as the EIB and EBRD) should be explored. The Eurogroup supports the efforts of the Greek authorities to work with the European institutions on the creation of a National Development Bank that would coordinate the implementation of development and promotional activities. The Eurogroup calls upon Greece, the European Commission and IFIs to work together to strengthen the pipelines of viable investment projects. Efforts should be made to step up the technical assistance from the European Investment Advisory Hub with a view to facilitating the preparation of investable projects and the establishment of investment platforms. Today the Eurogroup discussed again the sustainability of Greek public debt with the objective that Greece regains market access at sustainable rates. The Eurogroup reconfirmed the commitments and principles contained in the statements of May 2016. We noted that the implementation of the agreed short term debt measures already contributes to a substantial lowering of the gross financing needs (GFN) of Greece over the medium and long term and significantly improves the profile of Greek public debt. The Eurogroup welcomes the commitment of Greece to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and thereafter a fiscal trajectory that is consistent with its commitments under the European fiscal framework, which would be achieved according to the analysis of the European Commission with a primary surplus of equal to or above but close to 2% of GDP in the period from 2023 to 2060. The Eurogroup concluded that debt sustainability should be attained within the framework of the debt measures envisaged by the Eurogroup in May 2016. In this regard, the Eurogroup recalled the assessment of debt sustainability with reference to the agreed benchmarks for gross financing needs: GFN should remain below 15% of GDP in the medium term and below 20% of GDP thereafter so as to ensure that debt remains on a sustained downward path. The Eurogroup recalls that it stands ready to implement a second set of debt measures to the extent needed to meet the aforementioned GFN objectives, in line with the Eurogroup statement of 25 May 2016. This includes abolishing the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme, the use of 2014 SMP profits from the ESM segregated account, the restoration of the transfer of the equivalent of ANFA and SMP profits to Greece (as of budget year 2017), liability management operations within the current ESM programme envelope taking due account of the exceptionally high burden of some Member States, and EFSF reprofiling within the maximum Programme Authorised Amount. The Eurogroup stands ready to implement, without prejudice to the final DSA, extensions of the weighted average maturities (WAM) and a further deferral of EFSF interest and amortization by between 0 and 15 years. As agreed in May 2016, these measures shall not lead to additional costs for other beneficiary Member States. In order to take into account possible differences between growth assumptions in the DSA and actual growth developments over the post-programme period, the EFSF reprofiling would be recalibrated according to an operational growth-adjustment mechanism to be agreed. This mechanism will be fully specified as part of the medium-term debt relief measures, following the successful implementation of the ESM programme to make sure the GFN benchmarks defined above are respected and to ensure that the ceiling established by the EFSF Programme Authorised Amount is respected. The Eurogroup mandates the EWG to work further on this as of 2018. At the end of the programme, conditional upon its successful implementation and to the extent necessary, this second set of measures will be implemented. The exact calibration of these measures will be confirmed at the end of the programme by the Eurogroup on the basis of an updated DSA in cooperation with the European institutions, so as to ensure debt sustainability and compliance with the European fiscal policy framework. This DSA, while based on cautious assumptions, will also take into account the impact of growth enhancing reforms and investment initiatives. For the long term, the Eurogroup recalls the May 2016 agreement that in the case of an unexpectedly more adverse scenario a contingency mechanism on debt could be activated. The activation of this mechanism would be considered subject to a decision by the Eurogroup and could entail measures such as a further EFSF re-profiling and capping and deferral of interest payments. Acknowledging the staff level agreement reached with Greece on policies, IMF management will shortly recommend to the IMF's Executive Board the approval in principle of Greece's request for a 14-month  Standby Arrangement.  The IMF welcomes the further specification of the debt measures given today by Member States, and agrees that it represents a major step towards Greek debt sustainability. The IMF arrangement will become effective with resources made available in accordance with its terms, provided that the programme stays on track, when IMF staff can assure to the IMF's Executive Board that there is an agreement on debt relief measures, that, appropriately calibrated at the end of the programme, would secure debt sustainability. In view of the full implementation of all prior actions and subject to the completion of national procedures, the ESM governing bodies are expected to approve the supplemental MoU and the disbursement of the third tranche of the ESM programme amounting to EUR 8.5 bn to cover current financing needs, arrears clearing, and possibly room to start building up a cash buffer. In view of the ending of the current programme in August 2018, the Eurogroup commits to provide support for Greece's return to the market: the Eurogroup agrees that future disbursements should cater not only for the need to clear arrears but also to further build up cash buffers to support investor's confidence and facilitate market access.

The loss-making airline, in which Air France KLM and the Kenyan government both have stakes, has struggled to return to profit after tourist traffic slumped four years ago following a spate of attacks by Islamist militants. The financial restructuring proposal also involves the conversion of a separate $243 million loan by the government into equity. Private creditors are expected to participate with the conversion of their debt into equity but details have not yet been released by Kenya Airways.

The president and first lady Melania Trump were present in the marble-clad courthouse for an investiture ceremony formally welcoming Gorsuch to the top U.S. court. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice in April and authored his first ruling last week in a debt-collection case. Trump sat near the front of the ornate, burgundy-draped courtroom as Chief Justice John Roberts offered him and the first lady a  warm welcome  in opening remarks. The president sat quietly as Roberts administered the judicial oath to Gorsuch and joined the crowd in applauding Gorsuch, smiling broadly.  In appointing Gorsuch, Trump restored the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Trump did not speak at the event. Other notable figures at the ceremony included several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and attorneys general during George W. Bush's presidency, including John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Also attending was Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his presidency.

Trump's travel ban is now before the justices after being blocked by lower courts. In deciding whether to allow the travel ban to go into effect, the justices are set to weigh whether Trump's election campaign rhetoric can be used as evidence that the March 6 order was intended to discriminate against Muslims in violation of the Constitution.

The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The injunctions blocking the ban were upheld on appeal. Trump was able to make the appointment of Gorsuch only because the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court, Merrick Garland.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington on Wednesday ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers, in its environmental review of the Dakota Access line, did not fully consider the pipeline's impact on the hunting, fishing and environmental justice rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has been fighting the line for more than a year. Legal experts on Thursday said Boasberg has quite a bit of leeway with his decision, depending on what he deems are the environmental impacts of allowing oil to keep flowing.  Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent he should apply the traditional injunction test to determine exactly what may occur - or not - during additional environmental analysis,  said Zeke Williams, managing director of the energy and natural resources practice at Lewis Bess Williams & Weese in Denver.  The parties, including pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners Inc, are scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux want the judge to stop the pipeline flow when he considers the possibility of additional environmental review.  “Our position has always been that until they can do this correctly, the pipeline shouldn’t be operating,” said Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman, who represents the Standing Rock Sioux.       In a statement, ETP said pipeline operations will continue as the  limited  process unfolds to review the issues raised.  Dakota Access believes the record supports the fact that the Corps properly evaluated  those issues, said ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado.

The line was delayed during months of protests on federal land in North Dakota and as a legal battle played out in Washington. Two of the tribe's earlier arguments had been rejected by the same judge. The 1,170-mile (1,880 km) line had been a long-desired project for Bakken producers, but met heavy resistance from the tribes over concerns about water supply and sacred lands. Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Environmental and Natural Resources Law & Policy Program at Stanford Law School, said the normal remedy under the National Environmental Policy Act would be to stop operations during the review period.

The first shipment of Bakken crude to Asia left port in April, and more was expected as U.S. production continues to rise. Cash traders on Thursday said the legal battle at this moment is not an issue, because operations have not been affected.  “This ruling was a bit of a curve ball given the judge’s prior orders,  said U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota who supports the pipeline. He said he did not believe operations would be halted during review.  (The judge) seems to be sending a message that consultation needs to be considered and documented better in future cases like this,  he told Reuters.

A landslide on Friday at a section of the Delia mine, part of Canadian-listed Mandalay Resources' Cerro Bayo gold and silver complex in Chile's southern Aysen region, sparked the flooding from a nearby lake. The two missing miners have been identified as Enrique Ojeda and Jorge Sanchez. Authorities have not made contact with them and do not know if they were killed or survived by reaching an emergency shelter, which is located some 200 meters (220 yards) underground and around 50 meters from the site of the landslide. The events recall the 2010 mining accident in Copiapo, northern Chile, when 33 miners made world headlines after they survived in an emergency shelter for nearly 10 weeks before being rescued. Snowfall in recent days has complicated the rescue effort, authorities said.  The government has deployed a large team of experts in drilling, water handling, search and security that is working 24 hours,  said Mining Minister Aurora Williams, after visiting the site and meeting with the families of the missing miners on Wednesday. Efforts are focused on diverting the water and trying to make contact with the shelter. Felipe Matthews, a government geologist who was part of the team that took part in the 2010 rescue, said the work was technically challenging and the drills attempted so far had diverged from target. Mandalay said it was  doing everything possible  to locate the two miners.  The presence of water and disturbed material makes this effort extremely complicated. We will continue to deploy our own resources as well as the resources coming from suppliers, contractors, other mining companies, and government,  the company said in a statement on Thursday.

Utah Republican Rob Bishop, who chairs the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, said the board's inaction was  troubling  in a letter to board Chairman Jose Carrion, adding that the debt restructuring at Puerto Rico's power authority, PREPA, was already green-lit by Congress.   Bishop's gripe is over a deal struck earlier this year between PREPA and its creditors to restructure some $9 billion of debt. PREPA's financial woes are a microcosm of an economic crisis, marked by $70 billion in total debt, that has pushed Puerto Rico into the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  Negotiations between PREPA and its bondholders were rocky, lasting more than two years and running into a major roadblock when an initial version of the accord was rejected by Puerto Rico's new governor. Now, the latest deal appears to be hitting a snag too, as the U.S. territory's oversight panel, created by U.S. lawmakers to manage its finances, has yet to approve it.   It appears there is no consensus from the oversight board in favor of certifying  the deal, Bishop said. But Bishop argued the board has no right to review it. The 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA - which originated in Bishop's committee - included language to keep pre-existing compromises like PREPA's out of the board's reach. The board's insistence on reviewing the deal is  outside the scope  of its powers, Bishop said, and could  result in severe, adverse effects for the island, including a dampening of the board's ability to negotiate in good faith with creditors.  Bishop and other lawmakers have supported the quick implementation of the PREPA deal, in large part because it was a compromise struck out of court. PROMESA allows Puerto Rico and its agencies to slash debts through bankruptcy, but Republican lawmakers, wary of massive cuts to bondholders, have tried to encourage out-of-court compromises. Under the PREPA deal, creditors would take repayment cuts of only 15 cents on the dollar, smaller than the hefty haircuts likely to face creditors of other Puerto Rican debt issuers now in bankruptcy.

Big U.S. tobacco companies are all developing e-cigarettes, battery-powered gadgets with a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.  Some previous research suggests vapor from e-cigarettes may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke, but the electronic alternatives still release chemicals that aren’t normally in the air and the long-term health effects of the ingredients and flavorings in e-cigarettes are unclear.  Overall, just 5.3 percent of adults who participated in a 2015 online survey thought exposure to secondhand e-cigarette vapor caused “no harm” to kids, the study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Another 40 percent of adults thought it caused “little harm” or “some harm” to children.  “The bottom line is that kids should not be exposed to the emissions from any type of tobacco product, irrespective of whether that product is smoked, smokeless or electronic,” said senior study author Brian King, a researcher with the CDC Office on Smoking and Health in Atlanta.  “Although e-cigarette aerosol generally contains less harmful ingredients than secondhand smoke, it is not harmless; safer is not the same thing as safe,” King said by email. “It’s important for users of these products, particularly parents, to know the dangers of secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol and to protect kids from this preventable health risk.” To assess how adults thought about the risk of exposing kids to e-cigarettes, CDC researchers examined data from a survey of 4,127 adults 18 or older. The survey asked people to consider the potential harms of all electronic vapor products including e-cigarettes as well as e-hookahs, hookah pens, vape pens and e-cigars.  Current e-cigarette users were almost 18 times more likely than people who never tried the devices to think the secondhand vapors caused no harm to children, and former e-cigarette users were more than seven times more likely to have this opinion, according to the results published in the CDC journal Preventing Chronic Disease.  Compared with people who never smoked traditional cigarettes, current smokers were more than four times more likely to consider secondhand e-cigarette vapor harmless for kids, and former smokers were about twice as likely to have this opinion, the study found.  Men were more than twice as likely as women to think secondhand e-cigarette fumes were harmless for kids. Adults aged 45 to 64 were less likely to be uncertain about the risk of exposing kids to second-hand e-cigarette smoke than younger adults aged 18 to 24, the study also found.  One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have detailed data to determine how often current or former e-cigarette users and cigarette smokers had used these products, the authors note. That means responses from heavy users were included in the same categories as people who only smoked or vaped occasionally.  Still, the findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the potential harms as researchers continue to investigate the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, said Dr. Alexander Prokhorov, director of the tobacco outreach education program at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  “The products simply have not been in existence long enough to investigate their long-term effects,” Prokhorov, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “It took us decades to fully understand the devastating consequences of conventional cigarettes and we are regularly discovering more and more illnesses and disorders attributable to active and passive smoking,” Prokhorov said. “I would not be surprised if ongoing studies will soon report additional facts on first- and second-hand vaping and health.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2r4cn1g Preventing Chronic Disease, online May 31, 2017.

(MetLife) and for general corporate purposes, including potential capital contributions to Brighthouse's life insurance subsidiaries. Fitch also expects that following issuance of the new notes being rated today, Brighthouse's financial leverage will remain significantly below the sensitivity established for the company's ratings on May 31, 2017. The expected rating also relies heavily on a guarantee from MetLife, under which MetLife will fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the full and prompt payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes. The MetLife guarantee will terminate and be automatically and unconditionally released upon a distribution of Brighthouse common stock to MetLife's shareholders. KEY RATING DRIVERS Brighthouse's ratings continue to reflect the company's very strong statutory capitalization, significant operating scale, and strong risk-management capabilities. The business that will be contained within Brighthouse represents approximately 25% of MetLife's current total assets, which places Brighthouse as a top-12 U.S. life insurer on a standalone basis. The ratings also consider the company's above-average exposure to market-sensitive variable annuity and universal life with secondary guarantee businesses, which could have a negative impact on risk-based capitalization and earnings in an adverse market scenario. Fitch believes that further seasoning as a stand-alone company while maintaining a strong capitalization profile would ultimately reflect positively on the company's credit profile. RATING SENSITIVITIES The expected rating Fitch has assigned to Brighthouse's senior unsecured notes relies heavily on MetLife's full and unconditional guarantee on a senior unsecured basis, the full and prompt payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes until the contribution of Brighthouse Holdings, LLC, Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, and New England Life Insurance Company (NELICO) to Brighthouse is complete. The ratings also assume a generally uneventful execution of Brighthouse's legal separation from MetLife. Significant adverse developments related to the separation could have negative implications for the ratings. In the near term, a significant decline in management's strategic target for statutory capital backing the variable annuity business at separation could lead to a downgrade. Longer-term, Fitch will apply its Prism capital model to Brighthouse when sufficient information becomes available, which is likely to be in 2017. A Prism capital score below 'Strong' could cause Fitch to reassess its view of Brighthouse's capital strength, which supports the rating. Additional downgrade sensitivities include a financial leverage ratio exceeding 28%, or a significant deterioration in profitability. The primary upgrade sensitivity would include establishment of a track record of strong operating performance, risk management and reasonable stability in capitalization following the company's separation from MetLife. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following expected rating: Brighthouse Financial, Inc. --Expected senior unsecured rating on proposed issuance: 'BBB(EXP)'.

(Reuters) - Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in critical condition on Wednesday night after he and three others were shot as they practiced for a charity baseball game. The gunman, who had posted angry messages against President Donald Trump and other Republicans on social media, opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers and colleagues at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington. He was wounded in a gunfight with Capitol Hill police at the scene and later died. Scalise was shot in the left hip, suffering broken bones, injuries to internal organs and severe bleeding.  He underwent surgery but would need further operations, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center said.  Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!  Trump said on Twitter after visiting the hospital on Wednesday night. The gunman, identified by police as 66-year-old James Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois,  fired repeatedly at the men playing on the baseball field on Wednesday morning.  Congressmen at the ballpark described hearing loud noises like the sound of firecrackers and 15 to 20 people lying on the ground and realizing they had only baseball bats to defend themselves against bullets.  When he started shooting, he was shooting to kill people. And thank God he wasn't a very good shot,  said Representative Joe Barton, the Republican team's manager. Also wounded were a congressional aide and one former aide who now works as a lobbyist, officials said. One Capitol Hill police officer suffered a gunshot wound and another officer twisted an ankle and was released from a hospital, police said.  It was not only chaotic but it was a combat situation,  Alexandria Police Chief Mike Brown told reporters. 'It's Got to Stop' While police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to determine whether it was a deliberate political attack, the shooting intensified concerns about the sharp divide and bitter rhetoric in U.S. politics. FBI special agent Tim Slater declined to comment on whether the gunman had a vendetta against Republicans. Related CoverageSuspect in baseball field shooting ranted against Trump on social mediaStaunchly conservative U.S. lawmaker Scalise among wounded in shootingGunfire turns U.S. lawmakers' baseball practice into 'killing field' We continue to actively investigate the shooter's motives, acquaintances and whereabouts that led to today's incidents,   Slater told reporters. No one else was in custody, he said. The gunman was believed to have been in the Alexandria area since March, Slater said. Investigators believe that the suspect had been living out of his vehicle. Wednesday's shooting revived debate about gun rights in America. Virginia's Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, urged gun control measures.  Scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures. Hodgkinson had raged against Trump on social media and was a member of anti-Republican groups on Facebook including,  The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,   Terminate The Republican Party,  and  Donald Trump is not my President,  a search of his Facebook profile showed. As businessman Trump rose to become the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election, his brash style and outspoken views on immigration and other policies led to mass protests, including on the weekend of his inauguration in January.  A police officer mans a shooting scene after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice near Washington in Alexandria, Virginia,  June 14, 2017.Joshua RobertsThe charity ballgame between a Republican team and a Democratic team will go ahead as scheduled on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team. Representative Tim Ryan, who early on Wednesday was practicing for the ballgame with fellow Democrats, told reporters that Washington politicians needed to cool their rhetoric.  We've got to get back to ... where things aren't so personal and we're so judgmental of each other. It's got to stop. A member of the U.S. Congress got shot because they didn't like (his) political views,  Ryan said. Calls for Unity  Trump, who announced the gunman's death, called for unity.  We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,  he said. In a show of bipartisanship, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said on the floor of the House:  An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.  The House's top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ryan's message. The shooting happened shortly after 7 a.m. There were 20 House members and two senators present, and the shooting lasted about 10 minutes, said Barton. Slideshow (26 Images)Two lawmakers who were at the scene, Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack. Duncan said that as he left the field, the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot.  He asked me who was practicing this morning, Republicans or Democrats, and I said: 'That's the Republicans practicing,'  Duncan told reporters. DeSantis gave a similar account. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said he had been told that  Hodgkinson had served as a volunteer with his campaign.  Let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,  Sanders said. Ryan, the House speaker, is reviewing rules on how rank-and-file lawmakers can increase their personal security, according to several lawmakers.  Members get threats on a regular basis and have trouble determining which are real,  House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer told reporters. 'Heroism' of Police The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, across the Potomac River from Washington.       Representative Mo Brooks told CNN that during batting practice, he heard a  bam  and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence. When Scalise was shot, he went down on the infield between first and second base, then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded, leaving a trail of blood,  Brooks said. Two Capitol police officers who were there to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols, Brooks said.  But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those aren't good odds,  Brooks said. Wednesday's attack was the first shooting of a member of Congress since January 2011, when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of constituents in Tucson, Arizona. Six people were killed. Giffords resigned from Congress and became an activist for gun restrictions.

Last week, state legislators passed the bill, which requires utilities to purchase excess power generated from rooftop solar panels at near the full retail rate. Known as net metering, the buy-back policy is critical to making residential solar affordable.  Both Tesla and Sunrun said they would resume sales in Nevada if Sandoval signed the bill. He did so on Thursday during a ceremony held at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas. Solar companies cheered the reopening of the Nevada market, which comes as growth of residential solar has slowed in many key states, including top market California. In a speech at the signing ceremony, Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel said the new legislation would  bring in thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in positive economic benefit  to Nevada  over time.  Tesla would resume selling systems immediately, he added. Nevada scrapped its previous net metering policy at the end of 2015, prompting Tesla unit SolarCity and Sunrun to abandon what was at the time a major solar market. The move, which led to a 32 percent decline in solar installation jobs in the state last year, was broadly unpopular with Nevada residents. Opponents of net metering argue that forcing utilities to pay high rates for rooftop solar in effect means that customers who do not have solar panels subsidize those who do.

The S&P; technology sector fell 0.5 percent, continuing a slide that began last Friday, although it had been down more earlier. Apple shares fell 0.8 percent while Google parent Alphabet dropped 1 percent after separate bearish analysts reports on the two tech heavyweights. The consumer discretionary sector dropped 0.5 percent, as Amazon.com shares fell 1.4 percent. Nike was off 3.3 percent after the company said it would cut about 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles. Tech and consumer discretionary have been among the sectors that have charged the benchmark S&P; 500's 8.5-percent rally this year.  You seem to be losing some momentum in the big growth names that have led the market so far this year,  said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina.  At the same time, the economic data has just not been good enough to get investors excited about buying into other areas of the market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.71 points, or 0.12 percent, to 21,347.85, the S&P; 500 lost 6.87 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,431.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.08 points, or 0.55 percent, to 6,160.82. Financials and energy, sectors that should thrive during economic expansions, also sold off, dropping 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Real estate and utilities, which are high-dividend paying groups known as  bond proxies , gained 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields tumbled to their lowest since early November on Wednesday after surprisingly weak data on inflation and retail sales overshadowed the Fed's interest rate hike.  If your best performing sectors are real estate and utilities, it's a good sign that interest rates are dominating the equity market,  said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist with TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen. Following disappointing economic data on Wednesday, a report showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Fed to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth. In other corporate news, Kroger shares tumbled 18.9 percent after the supermarket chain slashed its full-year profit forecast. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Jurors in Hartford, Connecticut found Michael Gramins guilty on a conspiracy charge, but found him not guilty on six other counts and could not reach a verdict on the remaining two. Another defendant, Tyler Peters, was found not guilty on all nine counts he faced. Ross Shapiro, the third defendant, was found not guilty on eight counts, and jurors could not agree on a ninth, also for conspiracy. The trial began on May 8, and jurors began deliberating on June 6. Gramins' conviction is the second in a federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices that was unveiled in January 2013, and has been overseen mainly by the office of U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut. It followed the January conviction in a retrial involving similar claims against former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak. He was later sentenced to serve two years in prison and pay a $2 million fine. Litvak is appealing. Thursday's verdict was confirmed by Daly's office and lawyers involved in the case. It is unclear whether prosecutors will retry Gramins and Shapiro on the deadlocked counts. A spokesman for Daly had no immediate comment. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Gramins, in an email said he intends to file motions related to his client's conspiracy conviction. A lawyer for Shapiro had no immediate comment. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Peters, declined to comment. U.S. authorities have charged at least 10 people, including six from Nomura, in connection with the bond trading probe. Three of the eight traders facing criminal charges decided to plead guilty and cooperate: former Nomura trader Frank DiNucci, and former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc traders Matthew Katke and Adam Siegel. David Demos, formerly of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, was also criminally charged, and has pleaded not guilty.

The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) confirmed that the five, and two 20-year-olds, tested positive at the African Youth and Junior Championships in Cairo last December.  The Egyptian Anti-Doping Committee and the Egyptian Weightlifting Federation said they were victims of a plot and an internal investigation by the federation suggested somebody with a grudge had doctored food eaten by the team.   There is a conspiracy against the Egyptian Federation behind doping cases,  Egypt Weightlifting Federation head Mahmoud Mahjoub said. The Egyptian organizations provided no evidence to support a plot and Reuters could not independently confirm their accusations. Under IWF rules, any country returning three or more positive tests within a year faces a range of sanctions and in serious cases can be suspended from the sport.  Asked about a potential ban under section 12 of the IWF Anti-Doping Policy, which sets out possible punishments for nations who have three or more positives in a year, the body's legal counsel Eva Nyirfa told Reuters in a statement:  In line with Article 14.3 of the WADC (World Anti-Doping Code) the IWF will not make any further comments on the cases until they are closed.  Osama Ghoneim, head of the Egyptian anti-doping committee,  told Reuters that the committee  had not been informed of any sanctions yet but the rules stipulate that the local federation must be sanctioned for three years and fined $250,000 if positive cases appear.  Nine nations are already facing a ban after returning three or more via International Olympic Committee (IOC) retesting of samples taken at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. Those nine cases were due to be dealt with by the IWF's executive board later this month. Doping has long plagued weightlifting despite efforts by the IWF to eradicate it. Russia was banned from the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro for  bringing weightlifting into disrepute  after a series of positive tests. The news of the Egyptian cases come a week after the IOC warned that the entire sport faces exclusion from the 2024 Olympics if it does not provide a  satisfactory report  on how it will address its doping problem.  List of Names According to a list of names provided by the Egyptian federation to Reuters, two girls were aged 14 while two other girls and one boy were aged 15 to 17 when the IWF tested them in Cairo last December. In January, the IWF said the two 20-year-olds, both junior gold medalists, were Ahmed Emad Gouda (men’s 77kg) and Alla Yasser Zaki (women’s 75kg). None of the lifters who failed tests responded for comment when contacted by Reuters via the Egyptian federation. The IWF's legal department told Reuters it would not disclose further details about the cases because five of the seven were minors at the time of the sample collection. It said the WADA code prohibits them from commenting on such cases. Khalid Qarni, the coach who was in charge of the national youth team and other international lifters, is now working in Saudi Arabia. He did not respond to a request for comment. Mahjoub, the president of the Egyptian federation, was elected to the IWF's executive board last month.   At those same elections Tamas Ajan, the 78-year-old Hungarian who has been general secretary or president of the IWF since 1976, was elected to his fifth term as president. He has promised a harder line on doping. Osama Ghoneim, head of the Egyptian anti-doping committee, said that Egypt's own testers had taken samples from 37 youth lifters last November and all had come up clean.  We were surprised that the IWF sent its representatives to take the samples,  he told Reuters.  The positives were a surprise to us -- how come this happened only one month after they were all negative?  Ghoneim said an internal investigation had discovered that a dessert eaten by the team in their training camp had been  doctored . He suggested this could have been done by a disenchanted weightlifter, by a coach involved in a dispute with the national federation, or by officials who wanted to change the federation's leadership.  Egypt's weightlifting federation and anti-doping committee have jointly told the IWF that the seven positives were abnormal and have asked the IWF for a chance to put their case before any sanctions are imposed,  he said. The IWF had not responded to Egyptian requests for a meeting, he said.  Reuters has not been able to see the Egyptian report on the investigation. Egypt has had three lifters sanctioned in the past four years, all women and all for taking steroids. Libya, Moldova, India, Russia and Iraq and Venezuela have also had lifters test positive since the Egyptian tests were carried out.

We will oppose any deal which undermines the Good Friday agreement,  Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, told reporters outside May's Downing Street residence, in reference to the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence.  A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power, a temporary little arrangement won't have any integrity and certainly is not as important as the integrity and the needs of the people who live in Ireland.  The DUP's main demands center around securing more funding for the province, a source close to the party told Reuters on Saturday and Adams said he would welcome such funds.  We are consistently making the case that our institutions are under resourced, have been undermined by austerity and need to be properly funded. So of course we would support any monies going to the executive,  Adams said. Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in the British parliament last week but does not take up its seats or vote in Westminster, would likely reject a deal to form a government by refusing to work with the DUP in Northern Ireland. However some analysts say a deal between May and the DUP that hands the province additional resources but does not damage Irish nationalist interests or undermine peace could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to form a new power-sharing government. The DUP represents people in Northern Ireland who wish the province to remain part of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Fein wants Northern Ireland to be administered by the Irish Republic. Others leaders who met May remained skeptical.  The prime minister will have to do a lot more to convince us that the DUP tail isn’t wagging the Tory dog,  Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said in a statement.

Conservative Party sources say May wants to show her government is up and running but her loss of authority in last week's election will make it harder to handle a hectic agenda - Brexit talks with the EU, tackling a slowing economy, a political crisis in Ireland, and a devastating fire in London. The pound rose after the Bank of England came its closest in a decade to raising interest rates to counter higher prices after Britain's vote to leave the European Union - a move that could further squeeze Britons with big mortgages. The London fire, which claimed at least 17 lives, forced the cancellation of the City of London's Mansion House dinner, where May's finance minister, Philip Hammond, had the chance to revive calls for a more business-friendly exit from the EU. After touring the wrecked and fire-blackened apartment block and ordering an inquiry, May returned to talks to try to seal a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to secure the backing of their 10 lawmakers in parliament to help her pass laws and govern as Britain starts talks to leave the EU.  The talks are ongoing, they are very positive, they are constructive. There is a steady dialogue between the two sides that has never stopped at any point. It continues and when the deal is done, it will be done,  a senior source in the Conservative Party said on Thursday.  We never put timescales on when we expect a deal to be done and I'm not going to start now.  Under Pressure Related CoverageBritain's May urges Northern Irish government deal by June 29Sinn Fein cautious on DUP, May tie-up but would welcome fundingHer failure to win a majority has put May under pressure over her Brexit plans from inside and outside her party and has prompted complaints about her choice of partner due to the DUP's stance on social issues such as gay marriage. Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP, Northern Ireland's second-largest Irish nationalist party, said his party had a  positive  meeting with the prime minister over her efforts to come up with a deal with the DUP.   But we have to be honest, it will take much more than that for us to be convinced that the DUP tail is not wagging the Tory dog,  he told reporters.  We want to see any deal between those two parties reflect the wishes of all of the people of Northern Ireland, not just one section of the community.  Northern Ireland's largest nationalist party Sinn Fein said it would oppose any deal that undermines a peace deal known as the Good Friday Agreement, with President Gerry Adams telling Britain:  We want to govern ourselves. You folks here make enough mess of your own elections, make enough mess of your own governments, make enough mess of your own affairs.  Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, leaves 10 Downing Street, in central London, Britain June 15, 2017.Toby MelvilleEarlier, Andrea Leadsom, leader of the lower house of parliament, said the government had agreed with Queen Elizabeth, who reads out the new government program, that the  state opening of parliament will take place on 21 June 2017 . The start of parliament has been delayed since last Thursday's election, a gamble May took to strengthen her hand in talks to leave the European Union but which has left her scrambling for a deal to keep her in power. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's main opposition, said his Labour Party would not support May's Queen's speech in the lower house of parliament to try to force her out of power through a vote of no-confidence.   We're Confident  Slideshow (3 Images)The Conservative source said:  We're confident of getting an agreement, we're confident that the Queen's speech will be passed.  May's program will most probably have to be watered down, dropping some of her preferred reforms to help get legislation through parliament and possibly having to give way to other ministers who have strong views over the direction of Brexit. Before the Mansion House dinner was canceled because of the fire, finance minister Hammond had been due to tackle fears among the financial elite that May's insistence that  no deal is better than a bad deal  would cost them business. May's government has said its Brexit plans remain the same, and her Brexit minister David Davis will be pressing for close economic ties but a clear break with the bloc to be able to control immigration and restore sovereignty over British laws. The Conservative source said the talks to leave the European Union would not be delayed, removing the question mark over the negotiations being derailed by May's lack of a parliamentary majority lost in an election she did not need to call. Davis plans to go to Brussels on Monday to start the negotiations, which will reshape not only Britain's role in the world, but also that of a bloc praised for ensuring peace after World War Two. But some opposition politicians say that May can no longer stick to her stance for a clean break with the EU, characterizing her election bid as a poor gamble that has left Britain a laughing stock.  Look at what the Tories (Conservatives) have managed to do to the UK in the space of just one year, firstly calling a divisive and reckless EU referendum .. then having lost that gamble pursuing a hard Brexit path,  Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said.  And if that wasn't enough, calling an unnecessary general election purely for the self interest of the Conservative Party and having mucked that campaign up they are now putting the country in hock to the DUP.  additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary, Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Keith Weir and Peter Millership","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-idUSKBN1961OO"},

The world's largest packaged foods maker said on Thursday it would  explore strategic options , including a possible sale, for the business that also includes 100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets. Analysts have been speculating that Nestle could exit the U.S. confectionary business which is not in line with its stated strategy of becoming more health and nutrition-focused. That strategy, underlined by last year's naming of a healthcare veteran as CEO, comes as the whole packaged food sector battles a slowdown from a new generation of savvy consumers that are eating fresher and healthier foods. The review is limited to the United States, where Nestle does not control its key KitKat brand, and is No. 4 behind Mars, Hershey (HSY.N) and Mondelez International (MDLZ.O). With annual sales of 900 million Swiss francs ($923 million), the U.S. confectionery business accounts for only 1 percent of company sales. Nestle's other products range from instant coffee to mineral water and baby food.  This might seem small stuff, but in our view it could be a significant step by new-ish CEO Mark Schneider ... toward a more deliberate and efficient capital allocation strategy,  said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones in a note. Nestle said it remained  fully committed  to growing its international confectionery business, particularly KitKat, which is made in the United States by Hershey. It said it would also keep the Nestle Toll House baking products. Globally, Nestle's confectionery business generated sales of 8.8 billion Swiss francs ($9.02 billion) last year. To-Do List The global packaged food industry has seen a wave of deals as companies seek to boost profits in a weak market. Unilever (ULVR.L) is trying to sell its shrinking margarines business after rebuffing a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), and Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) is selling its French's mustard business to pay down debt from its purchase of Mead Johnson MJN.N, which closed on Thursday.  Nestle had organic sales growth of 3.2 percent last year, which Bernstein analysts said was the lowest of this century and the fifth straight year of slowing growth.   With that backdrop, Nestle has pushed aggressively into areas of health and nutritional science, buying and investing in a range of biotech and medical device firms, as it presses the boundaries between food and medicine. At the same time it has divested underperforming businesses including the Nutrament drink, Jenny Craig diet business and PowerBar snacks. Last year, it formed an ice cream joint venture with Britain's R&R.; Last year, RBC's Jones said a strategic review of the confectionery business should be near the top of the new CEO's to-do list.

The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, comes two days after Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said he would take a leave of absence from his troubled company to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills. Kalanick, under fire for fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking at the company he helped found, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites several media reports which said Kalanick and others doubted the victim's account of her ordeal.   Uber executives duplicitously and publicly decried the rape, expressing sympathy for plaintiff, and shock and regret at the violent attack, while privately speculating, as outlandish as it is, that she had colluded with a rival company to harm Uber’s business,  the lawsuit said. In a statement on Thursday, Uber said:  No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks.  The rape occurred in Delhi in December 2014. The Uber driver was convicted of rape and given a life sentence in prison in 2015.  The lawsuit filed on Thursday said shortly after the rape occurred, a U.S. Uber executive  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.  The lawsuit says Uber has retained a copy of those records.

The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) confirmed that the five, and two 20-year-olds, tested positive at the African Youth and Junior Championships in Cairo last December.  The Egyptian Anti-Doping Committee and the Egyptian Weightlifting Federation said they were victims of a plot and an internal investigation by the federation suggested somebody with a grudge had doctored food eaten by the team.   There is a conspiracy against the Egyptian Federation behind doping cases,  Egypt Weightlifting Federation head Mahmoud Mahjoub said. The Egyptian organizations provided no evidence to support a plot and Reuters could not independently confirm their accusations. Under IWF rules, any country returning three or more positive tests within a year faces a range of sanctions and in serious cases can be suspended from the sport.  Asked about a potential ban under section 12 of the IWF Anti-Doping Policy, which sets out possible punishments for nations who have three or more positives in a year, the body's legal counsel Eva Nyirfa told Reuters in a statement:  In line with Article 14.3 of the WADC (World Anti-Doping Code) the IWF will not make any further comments on the cases until they are closed.  Osama Ghoneim, head of the Egyptian anti-doping committee,  told Reuters that the committee  had not been informed of any sanctions yet but the rules stipulate that the local federation must be sanctioned for three years and fined $250,000 if positive cases appear.  Nine nations are already facing a ban after returning three or more via International Olympic Committee (IOC) retesting of samples taken at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. Those nine cases were due to be dealt with by the IWF's executive board later this month. Doping has long plagued weightlifting despite efforts by the IWF to eradicate it. Russia was banned from the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro for  bringing weightlifting into disrepute  after a series of positive tests. The news of the Egyptian cases come a week after the IOC warned that the entire sport faces exclusion from the 2024 Olympics if it does not provide a  satisfactory report  on how it will address its doping problem.  List of Names According to a list of names provided by the Egyptian federation to Reuters, two girls were aged 14 while two other girls and one boy were aged 15 to 17 when the IWF tested them in Cairo last December. In January, the IWF said the two 20-year-olds, both junior gold medalists, were Ahmed Emad Gouda (men’s 77kg) and Alla Yasser Zaki (women’s 75kg). None of the lifters who failed tests responded for comment when contacted by Reuters via the Egyptian federation. The IWF's legal department told Reuters it would not disclose further details about the cases because five of the seven were minors at the time of the sample collection. It said the WADA code prohibits them from commenting on such cases. Khalid Qarni, the coach who was in charge of the national youth team and other international lifters, is now working in Saudi Arabia. He did not respond to a request for comment. Mahjoub, the president of the Egyptian federation, was elected to the IWF's executive board last month.   At those same elections Tamas Ajan, the 78-year-old Hungarian who has been general secretary or president of the IWF since 1976, was elected to his fifth term as president. He has promised a harder line on doping. Osama Ghoneim, head of the Egyptian anti-doping committee, said that Egypt's own testers had taken samples from 37 youth lifters last November and all had come up clean.  We were surprised that the IWF sent its representatives to take the samples,  he told Reuters.  The positives were a surprise to us -- how come this happened only one month after they were all negative?  Ghoneim said an internal investigation had discovered that a dessert eaten by the team in their training camp had been  doctored . He suggested this could have been done by a disenchanted weightlifter, by a coach involved in a dispute with the national federation, or by officials who wanted to change the federation's leadership.  Egypt's weightlifting federation and anti-doping committee have jointly told the IWF that the seven positives were abnormal and have asked the IWF for a chance to put their case before any sanctions are imposed,  he said. The IWF had not responded to Egyptian requests for a meeting, he said.  Reuters has not been able to see the Egyptian report on the investigation. Egypt has had three lifters sanctioned in the past four years, all women and all for taking steroids. Libya, Moldova, India, Russia and Iraq and Venezuela have also had lifters test positive since the Egyptian tests were carried out.

It scared him into action.  I'm a planner. I don't like surprises,  said Krooks, an elder law attorney in Boca Raton, Florida.  Krooks figures he will spend upwards of $1 million to put four children through college. His oldest child is now 19 and attending a culinary institute in New York. His 16- and 14-year-olds are in high school, and his youngest, now 10, is about to start sixth grade.  Krooks has 529 college savings accounts for all of them, plus pre-paid tuition plans in Florida, where they now live. That pre-paid tuition can be converted to a credit for any institution if the child does not end up at a state school.  About 14 percent of U.S. families have four or more children, while 24 percent have three children, according to the Pew Research Center. Advance planning is key for those facing a long-haul of tuition payments. Depending on the age spread between their kids, college costs can double up for years or end up spread out for more than a decade.  Having multiple kids in college at once can be a boon for families receiving financial aid because the expected family contribution for tuition determined by the federal financial aid form will not shift - although living expenses and book fees will compound. But for families paying full freight, it means costs are condensed over a shorter period of time. Jim Stehr, a financial adviser who runs Paragon East Advisors in Lafayette, California, is steering three kids through college in eight years. His oldest started school in 2014, and when he is all done in 2022, Stehr expects his total costs to be roughly $800,000.  Stehr started saving when his oldest was born, but there were no good 529 savings options at that point in his state, so he just put funds aside in taxable accounts.   The good news is that I have most of the money they need, but I'm paying the price in capital gains,  Stehr said.  Mitchell Walker, a retired businessman from Mount Pleasant, Texas, took the opposite approach out of necessity, when he was putting five kids from a blended family through college on a limited income.  When Walker got remarried, his kids were 17 and 13, and they were joined by his wife and her kids, who were 8, 6 and 5 at the time. Walker had nothing saved when his oldest started college, but eked out $300 a month from his budget.  That was enough to get started at a community college, before the son transferred to Texas A&M.; The youngest of the kids graduated six years ago, ending 11 years of tuition payments over the course of 12 years.   We took almost no loans,  said Walker, who credits living in a small town with low living expenses plus a lot of belt tightening, for pulling off the feat. Walker is so keen on budgeting that he has a book coming out on his methodology(pouchplan.com/pages/book).  Dual-credit classes taken in high school also helped tremendously, because it allowed Walker's children to take a lighter class schedule in college and work more.   Time to Recoup For Allan Ripp, who runs a public relations business in New York, the key to getting through 10 years of college tuition payments is the age spread of his children - who are now 32, almost 30 and 19. He got his oldest two through in six years, and then had a long gap before their younger son started last year.  In my late 40s and 50s, it was a more financially solid period. We didn’t plan it that way, but it was a bit better,  Ripp said.  While they did not have dedicated college savings accounts, Ripp was able to lean on his business and use cash flow to cover tuition. Ripp and his wife also kept their living expenses as low as possible, driving one car for 21 years.   When all the tuition payments are finished in three years, Ripp says he will actually be sad that his kids are done and grown.  You’re always welcome to have the money you don’t spend on tuition, but I don’t think I’ll feel that it’s releasing us to go to Europe,  he said.  We lead a pretty humdrum life.

(Reuters) - The scene outside the courthouse where 12 jurors are determining Bill Cosby's fate at his sexual assault trial devolved on Thursday into a circus-like atmosphere, complete with dramatic confrontations, marching drummers and a bubble machine. Cosby, 79, was inside the courthouse waiting for the jury verdict on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, then a college administrator, in 2004.  The jury told Judge Steven O'Neill earlier in the day it was deadlocked after more than 30 hours of deliberations but he ordered them to continue. On the steps of the courthouse, plenty of people had already made up their minds.  It went from being a joke to all of this calamity,  said a man holding a sign that read  Free Mr. Cosby  who would only give his first name, Garvey.  Everything I heard points to him being innocent.  The once-beloved comedian has been accused of sexual abuse by approximately 60 women, but only Constand's allegations have led to criminal charges. Cosby has denied all of the claims.

With television cameras capturing every moment, Lili Bernard, who has accused Cosby of raping her while she was a guest star on his 1980s hit TV series  The Cosby Show,  read a Bible passage aloud to Cosby defenders before tearfully hugging a friend.

Allison held the woman's hand as she tried to persuade her to change her mind and told the woman she would have had the same opinion if she had never been alone in a room with Cosby. Minutes later, the sound of drumming filled the air as a woman carrying a sign reading  Perseverance To All Survivors  pranced down the sidewalk firing a bubble machine. Two men wearing dark plastic masks and carrying drums marched behind her. Earlier in the week, the woman had driven a U-Haul truck around the courthouse with a drawing of a middle finger with Cosby's name on it plastered to the outside. As the rhythmic drumming continued, Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy bunny from the 1960s who says Cosby assaulted her decades ago, danced to the music on the courthouse steps.

The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers’ mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right. The actions at issue might seem to help struggling borrowers: Wells Fargo lowered some customers’ monthly mortgage payments, potentially making them manageable. But there are two huge potential problems. First, the bank did this while also extending the duration of the loans – in one case by some 30 years. That greatly increased the total interest borrowers were on the hook to pay over the life of their loans. Second, Wells Fargo made these changes, according to the lawsuits, without getting the consent of either the customers or the relevant bankruptcy courts. Wells Fargo denies this, saying it notified customers and does  not finalize a loan modification without receiving signed documents  from the required parties. The trouble is, Wells Fargo has mucked up mortgage lending and modification in the past. It was one of the five lenders that in 2012 agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the U.S. federal government and 49 states to rectify poor loan servicing and foreclosure practices. Last year it forked over $1.2 billion to settle claims of reckless lending under a Federal Housing Administration program. Home loans should have been squeaky-clean after all that. Add to that its recent $185 million fine after retail bankers chasing aggressive account-opening targets created 2 million fake bank and credit-card accounts – events that cost former Chief Executive John Stumpf his job – and there's a sense of a bank still not ensuring it has fundamental checks and balances in place. Wells Fargo isn't alone. The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 exposed the many failings of the financial-services industry. For now, though, most of its big rivals appear to have put the worst of their transgressions behind them.

The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, comes two days after Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said he would take a leave of absence from his troubled company to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills. Kalanick, under fire for fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking at the company he helped found, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites several media reports which said Kalanick and others doubted the victim's account of her ordeal.   Uber executives duplicitously and publicly decried the rape, expressing sympathy for plaintiff, and shock and regret at the violent attack, while privately speculating, as outlandish as it is, that she had colluded with a rival company to harm Uber’s business,  the lawsuit said. In a statement on Thursday, Uber said:  No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks.  The rape occurred in Delhi in December 2014. The Uber driver was convicted of rape and given a life sentence in prison in 2015.  The lawsuit filed on Thursday said shortly after the rape occurred, a U.S. Uber executive  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.  The lawsuit says Uber has retained a copy of those records. The woman, who is Indian and currently lives in the United States, sued Uber in 2015 alleging that the company had not established sufficient safety standards. That case was settled a few months later.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JC1DJ"},

The British outsourcing group hired Goldman Sachs last year to launch an auction process for one of its units, Capita Asset Services, in a bid to raise cash and return to growth after a string of profit warnings, partly due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Chicago-based private equity fund GTCR and European rival CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] are among a group of three buyout funds which are competing with Link Group (LNKG.PK), a provider of shareholder management services as well as analytics, registry and fund administration services to more than 2,500 clients, the sources said. Another source named European buyout fund BC Partners as the fourth bidder involved in the process, adding that the deadline for final bids is on June 21. Capita, GTCR, BC Partners and CVC declined to comment while Link Group could not immediately be reached outside business hours. Capita has a market value of 4.3 billion pounds and its near-total focus on Britain means that unlike some rivals it does not benefit from the translation of foreign currencies back into a weak pound. Its chief executive Andy Parker resigned earlier this year after the company reported a bigger than expected drop in profits and said it would take until 2018 before it could return to growth. As part of its turnaround efforts the London-based company is trying to simplify its structure, reduce the number of business units and their reporting lines to boost oversight and transparency. The sale of its asset services unit, which serves a wide range of financial institutions including wealth and asset managers as well as banks, could fetch between 700 and 800 million pounds, the sources said. It would help it to reduce its debt burden which stood at 1.7 billion pounds at the end of last year. Capita Asset Services provides everything from shareholder solutions, fund management and loan servicing for all types of secured and collateralized loans.

But emerging markets fund managers who bought Russian equities in January will have seen the MSCI Russia equity index tumble more than 15 percent in dollar terms since then.  It fell as much as 2 percent at one point on Thursday, hitting 15-month lows and has fared worse this year than even Qatar, which is locked in a high-profile spat with its Gulf neighbors:     Russia's setback is part of a global cooling of 'Trump trades'. These were mainly based on hopes that President Donald Trump would boost the U.S. - and global - economy through spending increases.  But he was also expected to repeal sanctions imposed in 2014 to punish Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, most foreign investors were overweight Russia until this month, holding more Russian stocks than the country's share in the benchmark indexes, according to data from Renaissance Capital.  This seemed obvious as an apparent  bromance  between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a thaw in diplomatic ties. But far from lifting sanctions, U.S. lawmakers this week voted for fresh, stickier, curbs while preventing Trump from easing existing ones.   The two theses behind the overweight have both collapsed - oil prices and Trump,  said David Hauner, head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.   People were bullish on oil, which turned out to be wrong, and there were hopes on sanctions relief, which also turned out to be wrong.   Hauner, among those bullish on Russia in January, advised clients in March to reduce exposure to the stock market and has since cut Russian bonds too, citing worries over how heavily foreigners were positioned in both markets.  Crude futures meanwhile were near six-month lows, despite repeated supply cuts and price forecasts have fallen each month in 2017. Oil revenues make up almost half the government budget revenues while six of the 10 biggest Russian stocks by market capitalization are energy firms.  The latest steep losses mean state shipping firm Sovcomflot - specializing in transporting oil and gas - will delay a planned share sale which had been planned for this week, a source told Reuters on Thursday.  Rouble Stronger  On the domestic front, things are looking up. The economy should grow 1.5 percent in 2017 after two years of contraction while company earnings have improved.  Russian earnings-per-share (EPS) have on average bounced 27 percent from troughs hit in 2016 and should expand 7-9 percent in the coming six months, noted Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.   That part of the Russia story is intact,  Bolliger said but admitted the decision to overweight Russian stocks had proved  painful .  We are having discussions on how to reposition.   Russian bond investments have fared better, earning dollar-based returns of over 10 percent this year, thanks to a conservative central bank that has cut interest rates very slowly. It is expected to ease policy on Friday by 50 basis points but has pledged to keep rates well above inflation.  But high interest rates have lured record fund inflows into Russia's domestic bonds, in turn boosting the rouble 8 percent against the dollar until this week RUB=.  That has effectively severed a long-standing correlation between the currency and oil. So while crude slid 11 percent off May peaks, the rouble lost 1.2 percent, Christopher Granville, managing director at consultancy TS Lombard said in a note this week.   The rouble's de-coupling from oil compounds the blow for Russian oil stocks,  Granville said, advising clients to re-focus on domestically oriented sectors such as retail and avoid energy stocks that face oil price weakness and rouble strength.

At a camp for the displaced in the village of Ain Issa north of the city, people who arrived on Wednesday also said the air strikes supporting an assault by U.S.-backed forces had inflicted widespread destruction as the battle intensified. United Nations war crimes investigators said the air campaign had killed at least 300 civilians in the city, captured by Islamic State in 2014 in the chaos of Syria's civil war.  The escapees said the air strikes had flattened rows of apartment blocks along a main road but many of them had already been abandoned by residents fleeing Islamic State’s reign of terror and the assault on the town, which began last week.  The coalition strikes destroyed a four-story apartment building. I saw 10 people trapped underneath,  said Abu Hamoud.  They used phosphorus.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern on Wednesday about the use of incendiary white phosphorous weapons by the U.S.-led coalition, saying it endangers civilians when used in populated areas. The coalition is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias who spent months moving to surround Raqqa in northern Syria in preparation for the assault to recapture the city. Hassan Kirfou, said an airstrike hit the mosque where he works just a few hours after he closed it for the night, and two other mosques were hit. “I saw three dead teenagers on top of each other outside the Nour mosque,” he said. “I don’t know why they shot these areas. As far as I know there were only a few Daesh (Islamic State) snipers left there.” Much of the damage from air strikes was inflicted on Seif al-Dawla street, one of the main arteries of the town. “My uncle and two cousins were killed. Their house was destroyed,” Kirfou said. A Kurdish fighter from the People's Protection Units (YPG) fires a 120 mm mortar round in Raqqa, Syria, June 15, 2017.Goran TomasevicThe pressure on Islamic State, which is on the brink of losing the other center of its self-proclaimed caliphate, the Iraqi city of Mosul, is taking a heavy toll on the group, people who arrived at Ain Issa in the last few days said. “They have started using microphones to tell people: 'Don’t go to the infidels, stay with Islam',” said Abdul Razak Crais, standing near rows of white tents as people lined up for food. “They poured gasoline on the cars of anyone who tried to escape then lit a match and burned the vehicles. I saw them haul people out of their cars and shoot them with AK-47s.  The coalition estimates that 3,000-4,000 Islamic State fighters are holed up in Raqqa, the administrative headquarters of Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on civilians across the globe. Slideshow (4 Images)Residents who fled say the militants have been laying landmines on streets, booby trapping houses and digging tunnels in preparation for battle. “They take over people’s houses and create big holes in their walls so they can move back and forth during fighting,” said Thaier Ibrahim. Others at the camp said militants were hiding weapons and riding cars with civilians to avoid air strikes. Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of a U.N. Commission of Inquiry, said civilians were now extremely vulnerable:  As the operation is gaining pace very rapidly, civilians are caught up in the city under the oppressive rule of ISIL, while facing extreme danger associated with movement due to excessive air strikes.  About 10,000 civilians have fled to the SDF-run Ain Issa camp about 60 km (40 miles) north of Raqqa with hundreds more arriving each day, Medecins Sans Frontieres has said. Conditions have deteriorated because of the grueling summer heat. But people like Mohamed Nahaf took the risk of getting shot to escape Islamic State and a battle for the city that could take months. “They cut off all roads. We had to pay a smuggler $200 to get us out,” he said.

Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree, which operates 226 stores in Canada, said in March it planned to open 1,000 stores in Canada over time. The company is the leading dollar-store operator in the United States, having bought larger rival Family Dollar in 2015. But it is facing growing competition from big-box rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and upstarts such as Aldi, which have aggressively cut prices and now sell products such as eggs and milk at near dollar-store prices. Revenue growth at Dollar Tree has stagnated in the past three quarters since incorporating Family Dollar in its results, with growth ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent. Dollar Tree has nearly 14,500 stores in the United States. In contrast, sales at Dollarama Inc (DOL.TO), which owns 1,095 stores in Canada - from Halifax in the east to Vancouver in the west - have grown at a clip of at least 10 percent in the same period. It plans to grow to 1,700 stores over the next decade. Dollarama has been in business for a quarter of a century, runs an efficient supply chain and its stores have attractive layouts and an established customer base, analysts said.

Dollar Tree, which had a 28.1 percent share of the $57.92 billion U.S. market, had a 2.2 percent market share in Canada, according to Euromonitor. Dollar Tree has said revenue from stores in Canada is not material. Dollarama is not the only hurdle Dollar Tree will face in Canada. Operating in the country, for instance, is a challenge in itself.

The U.S. retailer exited the market in 2015 after less than two years of operation and incurred a $5.4 billion charge.  It looks like an enormous opportunity, but there's a much lower ceiling for growth in Canada,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData. For dollar stores, which operate on razor-thin margins, the risks are greater than for other retailers.  The Right Price Dollar Tree, however, is confident that its plan will work because it has successfully dealt with similar challenges before.

The gap came to light in documents released by the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corp in late May when the development agency sold $2.1 billion in revenue bonds to refund a portion of its $3 billion in outstanding debt, New York City Independent Budget Office (IBO), a non-partisan fiscal watchdog, said. The corporation was created by the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2005 to put in place transportation and other improvements necessary to get Hudson Yards, a massive privately funded development, off the ground. The city already has provided $128 million from its own capital budget to cover project costs from fiscal years 2005 through 2016, while another $138 million is budgeted over the next five years, the publicly funded IBO said. These costs are in addition to nearly $360 million the city has spent to subsidize interest costs on the $3 billion in bonds the corporation issued to pay for the project, the report said. How to finance the $96 million gap is yet to be determined. The bond documents said the city could assume the extra costs through its capital program or new bonds could be issued, in which case the city could be liable for interest on the debt. Bonds could also be issued without city support, the IBO said. Fitch Ratings in May assigned an A-plus rating to the infrastructure corporation's new revenue bonds, which will be paid off using both recurring and non-recurring revenues generated in Hudson Yards.

Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree, which operates 226 stores in Canada, said in March it planned to open 1,000 stores in Canada over time. The company is the leading dollar-store operator in the United States, having bought larger rival Family Dollar in 2015. But it is facing growing competition from big-box rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and upstarts such as Aldi, which have aggressively cut prices and now sell products such as eggs and milk at near dollar-store prices. Revenue growth at Dollar Tree has stagnated in the past three quarters since incorporating Family Dollar in its results, with growth ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent. Dollar Tree has nearly 14,500 stores in the United States. In contrast, sales at Dollarama Inc (DOL.TO), which owns 1,095 stores in Canada - from Halifax in the east to Vancouver in the west - have grown at a clip of at least 10 percent in the same period. It plans to grow to 1,700 stores over the next decade.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. Qatar is among the leading investors in world sport, preparing to host the 2022 soccer World Cup and the 2019 world athletics championships among the other top events it is set to stage in the coming years.  In the world of sport we remain politically neutral and continue our relationships with all the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) in the region,  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.  We hope for this even more, because all of the NOCs in the region are very active in Olympic sports in different respects and we appreciate especially how much is being contributed to sport development in the region,  Adams told Reuters. Teams across many sports, including top European soccer clubs such as Bayern Munich, regularly use Qatar's state-of-the-art sports infrastructure for winter training camps. Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the ruling emir of Qatar, has also been an IOC member since 2002. Doha, which  bid unsuccessfully for the 2016 and 2020 summer Olympics, was also seen as a likely candidate for 2028 before the IOC decided last week to award both the 2024 Games and the 2028 edition at the same time in September.  The IOC appreciates all this work very much and hopes that this crisis does not affect this cooperation,  Adams said.  This is a political issue in the region.

The 2022 World Cup is the centrepiece of a carefully crafted strategy to project Qatar onto the global stage via sport. The dispute could impact its preparations.  In the run-up to the tournament, Qatar is scheduled to host multiple events across many different sports, aimed at improving infrastructure and expertise.  I can confirm to everybody that there is absolutely no impact on the progress of work in the Mondial facilities and that work is proceeding normally,  said Ghanim al-Kuwari, executive director at the Qatari committee overseeing preparations for the World Cup. In remarks carried by state news agency QNA, Kuwari said Qatar's local World Cup organising committee had completed around 45 percent of the work in accordance with plans. Most of the construction materials needed for building World Cup stadiums had been coming by land through Saudi Arabia, a route now blocked, but Kuwari said alternative suppliers have been organised.  We have actually organised alternative sources from other areas in order that the work on the project is not impacted.  He said that while some goods had come by land, most materials were coming by sea, adding that some materials were being locally made. Separately on Thursday, the International Olympic Committee said it hoped the diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar by its Gulf neighbours would not affect sports development in the region.

Brnabic, a manager not affiliated with any party, will succeed Aleksandar Vucic, who won the presidency in April. The 250-seat parliament will debate Brnabic's nomination next week. Vucic's allies hold an overwhelming majority, so the vote is largely a formality.   I believe Ana Brnabic has all the personal qualities and expertise. I am confident she will work hard, that she will show respect to political parties and that she will work for the benefit of Serbia with other ministers,  Vucic told reporters. However, Brnabic's nomination drew criticism from conservatives, including some of Vucic's allies.  Dragan Markovic Palma - whose small Unified Serbia party is a part of the ruling coalition led by Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) - said recently that the new prime minister  should be a family man who knows what children are.  During her ministerial stint, Brnabic sought to reform Serbia's bloated administration, a key condition for membership in the European Union and part of a 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion) loan-deal with the International Monetary Fund.  Vucic suggested Brnabic should focus more on economy and matters related with IMF and the World Bank, while Ivica Dacic, the Foreign Minister and leader of the co-ruling Socialists, would be responsible for  more political  issues. Although his post is largely ceremonial, Vucic wields huge influence on the ruling coalition through the control of his SNS party. Analysts suggested the new prime minister will be little more than a figurehead. Brnabic is also expected to improve Serbia's ties with Kosovo and to reform the judiciary, secure rights of minorities, including the LBGT population, all preconditions for the country to enter the EU.  She will also have to maintain Serbia's delicate balancing act between its old allies Russia and China and the West, including NATO and the EU, which is the main trade partner.  Serbia's economy is expected to grow around 3 percent in 2017. To comply with the terms of its deal with the IMF, which expires next year, Serbia must sell its remaining state companies, including loss-making copper producer RTB Bor and its petrochemical factories.

Attorneys general from states including Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania announced the investigation two weeks after Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued five drug manufacturers for misrepresenting the risks of opioids.  We are looking into what role, if any, marketing and related practices might have played in the increasing prescription and use of these powerful and addictive drugs,  District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, said in a statement. It was unclear exactly how many states are involved in the probe, though officials said a majority of attorneys general are part of the coalition. Among those leading the probe is Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, a Republican. Officials did not specify which companies were under investigation. Opioid drugs, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Separate lawsuits by attorneys general in Ohio and Mississippi, the two states that have pursued opioid-related cases to date, have targeted Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), Endo International Plc(ENDP.O), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and Allergan Plc(AGN.N). Teva in a statement said on Thursday it is  committed to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids.  Representatives for the other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The companies have denied wrongdoing, saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved their products as safe and effective and saying that they carried warning labels that disclosed their risks. In announcing his office's lawsuit on May 31, Ohio Attorney General DeWine said the drug companies helped unleash the crisis by spending millions of dollars marketing and promoting such drugs as Purdue's OxyContin. The lawsuit said the drug companies disseminated misleading statements about the risks and benefits of opioids as part of a marketing scheme aimed at persuading doctors and patients that drugs should be used for chronic rather than short-term pain. Similar lawsuits have been filed by local governments, including two California counties, the cities of Chicago, Illinois and Dayton, Ohio, three Tennessee district attorneys, and nine New York counties.

Crew is nearing the threshold needed to approve the credit agreement amendment it is seeking that would dissolve a lender lawsuit aimed at blocking the transfer of intellectual property to an affiliated company, after Canyon Partners sold a US$100m chunk of the loan on Wednesday, a source close to the matter said. The U.S. fashion retailer, facing a total debt load of US$2.1bn, asked creditors to agree to an out-of-court restructuring that would extend the maturity on bonds to 2021, which would give J. Crew more time to turn around its business and boost declining sales. Canyon had been part of a group of lenders led by Eaton Vance that is attempting to block the amendment.  The trade, conducted via JP Morgan, was evenly split between GSO Capital Partners and Anchorage Capital Group, supporters of the amendment given significant crossholdings in the company’s US$566.5m 7.75%/8.5% PIK toggle notes due 2019 and 28% ownership of the loan.  Accounting for the sales, the company now has consents from lenders representing an amount of the loan in the high 40%-area, the source said. The amendment requires a simple majority for approval.   Meanwhile, the company has brought in UBS to work alongside restructuring advisor Lazard to help seal the deal, which includes an exchange offer that was launched on June 12 with the amendment, the source said. The exchange calls for holders of J. Crew’s PIK notes due 2019 to swap into US$250m of new 13% secured notes due 2021 backed by the entity that owns the intellectual property, as well as preferred and common stock. The transaction is conditional upon 95% of bondholders tendering. At launch, the company said a group - including GSO and Anchorage - that holds 68% of the bonds had signed off on the deal.  Lenders to the US$1.5bn loan, which priced at 300bp over Libor with a 1% floor and is due 2021, are offered a US$150m paydown as well as a 22bp increase on the loan coupon and accelerated amortization of 2.5% in the third year after the amendment becomes effective and 1.5% thereafter. Certain covenants in the loan will also be tightened.  The paydown will be financed in part with a US$30m incremental term loan backstopped by J. Crew sponsor TPG Capital, and US$97m of additional secured notes, which have already been sold, the source said.  Amendment signatures are due by 5 p.m. Friday to agent Wilmington Trust. The exchange offer expires on July 10.  Spokespeople for J Crew, Anchorage, GSO, Eaton Vance, Lazard, UBS, TPG, Canyon and JP Morgan did not respond to inquiries by press time.

Boone Pickens, is selling portfolio company Pinnacle Midstream, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Houston-based Pinnacle, which operates natural gas and crude gathering, processing and transloading services, could sell for at least $300 million, one of the sources said.  The move comes as deal-making has heated up for companies that provide pipeline, processing and storage facilities in U.S. shale basins. In April, funds managed by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) agreed to acquire EagleClaw Midstream Ventures for about $2 billion. Earlier, Targa Resources Corp (TRGP.N) snapped up Outrigger Energy LLC's Permian Basin gathering and processing assets for $1.5 billion.  Private equity investors have targeted midstream businesses, which are often viewed as less exposed to commodity price risk, because pipeline and storage assets tend to have recurring fee-for-service revenue streams.  Greg Sargent, chief executive of Pinnacle, declined to comment on the sale. A spokesman for BP Energy also declined to comment.  Pinnacle's operations are focused in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi.  The company this week said it had started engineering and construction on a 60 million cubic foot per day cryogenic gas processing plant near Orla, Texas in the prolific Permian Basin, where lower production costs and amply oil reserves have companies aggressively drilling new wells. In March, Pinnacle opened a truck transloading facility, also near Orla, Texas, and said it was flowing crude and gas through its gathering systems.

WAM quoted a statement from the UAE armed forces as saying that the ship came under attack opposite the Yemeni port of al-Mokha. The statement warned that the UAE would pursue those behind the attack.  The attack did not cause any damage to the ship, while a crew member was hurt,  WAM said. The Saudi state news agency earlier quoted the Saudi-led military coalition, which includes the UAE, as saying the ship was hit while leaving al-Mokha port but gave no further details. WAM gave no details about the medical supplies aboard the ship but noted that the UAE had been sending medicines and medical equipment to help fight a cholera epidemic that had killed nearly 1,000 people in Yemen since April.  The Houthis had reported the attack earlier, broadcasting a grainy video of what Houthi-run media said was a missile being fired at a Saudi-led coalition vessel. The missile burst into a ball of fire as it hit its target. The attack was part of a protracted conflict between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. The coalition wants to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Houthis have forced into exile. Al-Mokha was captured by the coalition from the Houthis earlier this year after heavy fighting. It lies close to the Bab al-Mandab shipping lane through which much of the world's oil passes. Several such attacks were reported since last year against Saudi, Emirati and U.S. ships in the Red Sea.  In January, two crew members of a Saudi frigate were killed in an attack close to Hodeidah port. The U.S. Navy said an unmanned remote-controlled boat laden with explosives hit the ship. The Houthis said they had fired a missile. Last October, the Houthis fired a missile at an Emirati ship in the strategic Bab al-Mandab strait in what it described as an  act of terrorism.

The British outsourcing group hired Goldman Sachs last year to launch an auction process for one of its units, Capita Asset Services, in a bid to raise cash and return to growth after a string of profit warnings, partly due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Chicago-based private equity fund GTCR and European rival CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] are among a group of three buyout funds which are competing with Link Group (LNKG.PK), a provider of shareholder management services as well as analytics, registry and fund administration services to more than 2,500 clients, the sources said. Another source named European buyout fund BC Partners as the fourth bidder involved in the process, adding that the deadline for final bids is on June 21. Capita, GTCR, BC Partners and CVC declined to comment while Link Group could not immediately be reached outside business hours. Capita has a market value of 4.3 billion pounds and its near-total focus on Britain means that unlike some rivals it does not benefit from the translation of foreign currencies back into a weak pound. Its chief executive Andy Parker resigned earlier this year after the company reported a bigger than expected drop in profits and said it would take until 2018 before it could return to growth. As part of its turnaround efforts the London-based company is trying to simplify its structure, reduce the number of business units and their reporting lines to boost oversight and transparency. The sale of its asset services unit, which serves a wide range of financial institutions including wealth and asset managers as well as banks, could fetch between 700 and 800 million pounds, the sources said. It would help it to reduce its debt burden which stood at 1.7 billion pounds at the end of last year. Capita Asset Services provides everything from shareholder solutions, fund management and loan servicing for all types of secured and collateralized loans.

Crew is nearing the threshold needed to approve the credit agreement amendment it is seeking that would dissolve a lender lawsuit aimed at blocking the transfer of intellectual property to an affiliated company, after Canyon Partners sold a US$100m chunk of the loan on Wednesday, a source close to the matter said. The U.S. fashion retailer, facing a total debt load of US$2.1bn, asked creditors to agree to an out-of-court restructuring that would extend the maturity on bonds to 2021, which would give J. Crew more time to turn around its business and boost declining sales. Canyon had been part of a group of lenders led by Eaton Vance that is attempting to block the amendment.  The trade, conducted via JP Morgan, was evenly split between GSO Capital Partners and Anchorage Capital Group, supporters of the amendment given significant crossholdings in the company’s US$566.5m 7.75%/8.5% PIK toggle notes due 2019 and 28% ownership of the loan.  Accounting for the sales, the company now has consents from lenders representing an amount of the loan in the high 40%-area, the source said. The amendment requires a simple majority for approval.   Meanwhile, the company has brought in UBS to work alongside restructuring advisor Lazard to help seal the deal, which includes an exchange offer that was launched on June 12 with the amendment, the source said. The exchange calls for holders of J. Crew’s PIK notes due 2019 to swap into US$250m of new 13% secured notes due 2021 backed by the entity that owns the intellectual property, as well as preferred and common stock. The transaction is conditional upon 95% of bondholders tendering. At launch, the company said a group - including GSO and Anchorage - that holds 68% of the bonds had signed off on the deal.  Lenders to the US$1.5bn loan, which priced at 300bp over Libor with a 1% floor and is due 2021, are offered a US$150m paydown as well as a 22bp increase on the loan coupon and accelerated amortization of 2.5% in the third year after the amendment becomes effective and 1.5% thereafter. Certain covenants in the loan will also be tightened.  The paydown will be financed in part with a US$30m incremental term loan backstopped by J. Crew sponsor TPG Capital, and US$97m of additional secured notes, which have already been sold, the source said.  Amendment signatures are due by 5 p.m. Friday to agent Wilmington Trust. The exchange offer expires on July 10.  Spokespeople for J Crew, Anchorage, GSO, Eaton Vance, Lazard, UBS, TPG, Canyon and JP Morgan did not respond to inquiries by press time.

The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, comes two days after Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said he would take a leave of absence from his troubled company to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills. Kalanick, under fire for fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking at the company he helped found, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The lawsuit cites several media reports which said Kalanick and others doubted the victim's account of her ordeal.  Uber executives duplicitously and publicly decried the rape, expressing sympathy for plaintiff, and shock and regret at the violent attack, while privately speculating, as outlandish as it is, that she had colluded with a rival company to harm Uber’s business,  the lawsuit said. In a statement on Thursday, Uber said:  No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks.  The rape occurred in Delhi in December 2014. The Uber driver was convicted of rape and given a life sentence in prison in 2015. The lawsuit filed on Thursday said shortly after the rape occurred, a U.S. Uber executive  met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.  The lawsuit says Uber has retained a copy of those records. The woman, who is Indian and currently lives in the United States, sued Uber in 2015 alleging that the company had not established sufficient safety standards. That case was settled a few months later. (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Richard Chang and Bill Rigby)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JC13P"},

High global inventories and doubts about OPEC's ability to implement agreed production cuts pressured oil prices. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates, as widely expected, and signaled another hike could follow this year. Its statement and comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen afterward prompted some investor concerns the central bank's tone was hawkish.  When you look at the economic data, it really doesn't point to an aggressive Fed. But you listen to the comments yesterday, and they're still on the aggressive side as far as raising rates,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. In a sign that the squeeze on consumers may get tighter before long, three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise rates against five for keeping rates on hold. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7-1 vote in favor of no change. The recent selloff in tech shares resulted in part by investors trying to take profits in an area that has led market gains this year and has fueled concern about stretched valuations in the overall market. The U.S. technology index was down 0.7 percent, leading a broad decline in the S&P; 500, pulled down by heavyweights including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc after bearish research comments. The tech index is down about 4 percent since Thursday's close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.91 points, or 0.14 percent, to 21,344.65, the S&P; 500 had lost 8.79 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,429.13 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 46.62 points, or 0.75 percent, to 6,148.28. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended down 0.3 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.9 percent. The dollar rose to its highest in more than two weeks as solid readings on the U.S. economy helped strengthen the case for the Fed to continue tightening. The number of Americans filing unemployment claims fell more than expected last week, suggesting slack in the labor market was shrinking, and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions for June beat expectations after a strong reading in May. The reports followed weak inflation data on Wednesday. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, was last up 0.6 percent, and rose as high as 97.557, its highest since May 30. The stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data also boosted U.S. Treasury yields, with two-year yields touching their highest in three months. But most yields remained depressed after their biggest plunge in a month Wednesday. U.S. two-year yields hit 1.368 percent, their highest in three months. Brent crude oil was down 0.3 percent to $46.87 a barrel after hitting its weakest since May 5. U.S. light crude was down 0.6 percent at $44.46. The stronger dollar weighed on gold, which hit a three-week low. Spot gold fell 0.6 percent to $1,253.09 per ounce.

Last week, state legislators passed the bill, which requires utilities to purchase excess power generated from rooftop solar panels at near the full retail rate. Known as net metering, the buy-back policy is critical to making residential solar affordable.  Both Tesla and Sunrun said they would resume sales in Nevada if Sandoval signed the bill. He did so on Thursday during a ceremony held at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas. Solar companies cheered the reopening of the Nevada market, which comes as growth of residential solar has slowed in many key states, including top market California. In a speech at the signing ceremony, Tesla Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel said the new legislation would  bring in thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in positive economic benefit  to Nevada  over time.  Tesla would resume selling systems immediately, he added. Nevada scrapped its previous net metering policy at the end of 2015, prompting Tesla unit SolarCity and Sunrun to abandon what was at the time a major solar market. The move, which led to a 32 percent decline in solar installation jobs in the state last year, was broadly unpopular with Nevada residents. Opponents of net metering argue that forcing utilities to pay high rates for rooftop solar in effect means that customers who do not have solar panels subsidize those who do.

Technology stocks fell sharply on Thursday, extending a decline from last week, as investors continued to back away from the top-performing sector this year. The slide brought much-needed relief for short sellers, who aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. The technology sector's 17 percent gain this year has drawn significant short bets as speculators counted on a pullback. While the sector's first big stumble this year drew some added interest in bearish bets - the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund drew $150 million of new short bets in the latest week - traders have largely steered clear of boosting bets against the biggest names in the sector. Through Wednesday, the cumulative short interest for a basket of six big tech stocks - Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc,  Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix - has fallen by $1.40 billion to $30.62 billion so far in June, according to S3 Partners data.  Short interest has either stayed relatively flat or decreased for these tech stocks,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.  The drop in the tech sector was due to long shareholders selling their long positions and not shorts increasing their exposure.   The recent weakness in the shares of these tech titans has resulted in paper profits of $672 million for short sellers so far this month.  For the most part, short tech positions were profitable, recouping some of their year-to-date losses but (they) were not looking to build their positions,  Dusaniwsky said. For the year, short sellers who targeted the six companies are still down $5.13 billion, according to S3 Partners data.

Bpifrance, the country's state investment bank, has led the effort over the past five years, acting as a catalyst for the burgeoning industry and a go-between for large cash-rich corporations and young entrepreneurs in need of funds to launch their business. It has in effect become in the country's number one venture capital fund, having injected 191 million euros in 53 startup companies last year.  This taxpayer financing is 13 percent higher than the previous year and Bpifrance is adding 400 million euros to its so-called Large Venture fund, with individual investments of 10 million euros or more, bringing the total up to 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion), chief executive officer Nicolas Dufourcq told Reuters.  The tide has been turning in our favor for about year now,  Dufourcq said in an interview ahead the opening of the French capital's second technology conference, dubbed Viva Tech, on Thursday.   It is as if the French Tech's boss had been elected as the new president,  he said, referring to an initiative to promote French technology firms that Macron ran as economy minister in the previous government. The new president, who plans a raft of other startup-boosting measures such as cuts in corporate tax and wealth tax exemptions, was due for a walkabout at the vast conference center on the edge of Paris on Thursday, followed by a speech. Since 2012, notable investments by Bpifrance in venture capital have included biopharmaceutical company DBV Technologies, online and mobile medical booking platform Doctolib, the developer of a wireless low-energy network for connected objects Sigfox, and the maker of high-tech audio devices Devialet.     Foreign investors began considering France as potentially lucrative new turf for disruptive companies about a year ago, Dufourcq and industry specialists say, even before independent centrist politician Macron made his candidacy official. Generous tax incentives for companies' research and development spending, renowned engineering and mathematical schools and private initiatives, such as the upcoming mega-campus for startups, Station F in Paris, funded by billionaire Xavier Niel, are some elements that explain the trend.    Whether it be Britain, Germany or Nordic countries, there's a clear interest for France,  said Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures, which invested in two of the most successful former startups, Europe's biggest car-sharing company Blablacar and Nasdaq-listed Criteo which provides web advertising services.  All funds are starting to have one or two French or Francophile people that spend their time reviewing the French market. And that's clearly new,  he said.   U.S. social media giant Facebook also gave a vote of confidence in the French tech scene earlier this year when it picked Paris as the location for its first-ever startups incubator. People  Won't Get Fleeced  Estimates differ between research companies, but all show that France is catching up with Germany and Britain, the two leading startup havens in Europe, in number of deals and total amounts invested.  French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to start-ups development, innovation and digital technology in Paris, France, June 15, 2017.Martin Bureau/PoolVenture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu.  It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in the venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic. This remains below Germany, with investments of 937 million. Still, over the first three months of this year, Paris saw 41 venture capital deals for a total value of 235 million euros, compared with 39 deals in Berlin totaling 210 million euros, according to PitchBook, a data provider.  The gap between the two countries highlights the relatively smaller size of investment tickets in France, underscoring the need for larger venture capital funds to help promising startups going international, Dufourcq said.  For instance, London-based Vitruvian Partners invested 58 million euros in January in French luxury resale store Vestiaire Collective to support its growth.  Slideshow (20 Images)Private-equity funds such as Partech, Isai have developed their own growth equity funds with larger investment tickets. New venture capital funds were created lately in France, such as Korelya Capital, founded by former digital economy minister Fleur Pellerin, and Daphni. [L8N1JC12Q]  Over the last few years, energy companies Total and Engie as well as insurer AXA have all created their own venture vehicles. The new French government, which polls predict will win a large majority in the final round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday, is likely to push reforms that may further support spending on startups.   Macron's manifesto included pro-business measures such as  cutting corporate tax to 25 percent from 33.3 percent, shifting the wealth tax to property only, which would exempt the ownership of company stakes, and introducing a flat 30 percent tax on capital gains, from up to 50 percent currently.     The new president also said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatizations to help fund a 10 billion euro government drive to boost industry and innovation.  People need to know that if they come to France, they can make a fortune and won't get fleeced,  Dufourcq said.  But tax reforms alone may not be enough for Paris to beat London on its turf.   We shouldn't delude ourselves, London still has a considerable advantage,  Mignot said, citing its cosmopolitan culture and tax credits for investing in startups.   But this advantage was built over 15 years. There's no reason Paris can't achieve it.

Dragan Markovic Palma - whose small Unified Serbia party is a part of the ruling coalition led by Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) - said recently that the new prime minister  should be a family man who knows what children are.  During her ministerial stint, Brnabic sought to reform Serbia's bloated administration, a key condition for membership in the European Union and part of a 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion) loan-deal with the International Monetary Fund.  Vucic suggested Brnabic should focus more on economy and matters related with IMF and the World Bank, while Ivica Dacic, the Foreign Minister and leader of the co-ruling Socialists, would be responsible for  more political  issues. Although his post is largely ceremonial, Vucic wields huge influence on the ruling coalition through the control of his SNS party. Analysts suggested the new prime minister will be little more than a figurehead. Brnabic is also expected to improve Serbia's ties with Kosovo and to reform the judiciary, secure rights of minorities, including the LBGT population, all preconditions for the country to enter the EU.  She will also have to maintain Serbia's delicate balancing act between its old allies Russia and China and the West, including NATO and the EU, which is the main trade partner.  Serbia's economy is expected to grow around 3 percent in 2017. To comply with the terms of its deal with the IMF, which expires next year, Serbia must sell its remaining state companies, including loss-making copper producer RTB Bor and its petrochemical factories.

The Mining Charter was introduced in 2002 to increase black ownership of the mining industry, which accounts for around 7 percent of South Africa's economic output. However the Chamber of Mines has taken the government to court over ownership interpretations in the latest draft, which requires companies to keep black ownership at 26 percent even if black shareholders sell their stakes. The new charter also requires companies to provide housing and other amenities in mining communities, many of which are mired in poverty and neglect.

As if to disprove the point, this year a number of awkward questions made it onto the air -- albeit briefly.   Perhaps you're tired and you should quit?  read one question, which flashed up behind Putin on a screen in the state television studio where the session was being hosted. Another comment appearing for a few seconds in the corner of television screens declared:  The whole of Russia thinks you've outstayed your welcome on your throne.  The questions would be standard fare in countries with a rough-and-tumble political culture, but in Russia, where Putin is widely treated with a deference reinforced by adulatory state media coverage, they stood out for their boldness. Russia holds a presidential election next year in which Putin is widely expected to run. Bread-and-Butter Issues The Kremlin and its allies in state media are trying to show they are receptive to criticism, especially as they compete for Russians' attention with social media, where no-holds-barred criticism of the authorities is normal. During the question-and-answer session, Putin was for the most part not asked to respond to any of the more awkward questions. Those citizens who put questions to him via phone or video link were respectful and steered away from politics, asking instead about bread-and-butter issues. But towards the end of the four-hour session, the anchors of the broadcast read out a viewer's comment complaining that the questions put to Putin were stage-managed. The Russian president, rising to the challenge, picked out another viewer's comment that had flashed up on a screen, about how it was time Russia got rid of Putin.  Would you call that a stage-managed question?  Putin asked. The event included other moments that appeared designed to convey that the Kremlin was willing to accommodate alternative points of view.  The perception that freedom of expression is being restricted in Russia -- denied by officials -- is a source of anger for many among the urban middle-classes, the kind of people who too part in protests earlier this week. Alexei Uchitel, a director whose film about a love affair between a ballerina and the future Tsar Nikolai II scandalized some pro-Kremlin conservatives, was a guest in the studio.

Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for the past 17 years, is widely expected to run for what would be a fourth presidential term in March 2018, but was vague when discussing his own political plans.  I am still working,  said Putin, when asked during his annual televised question and answer session who his successor might be.   I want to say that the voter, the Russian people should decide this.  In a sign that an election is near, Putin focused mostly on domestic issues, but found time to joke that he was ready to offer former FBI head James Comey political asylum and to complain about alleged U.S. meddling in Russian politics.    Unlike previous years, some awkward questions surfaced, albeit briefly.  Perhaps you're tired and you should quit?  read one, which flashed up behind Putin on a screen. Despite those rare dissenting voices and two big anti-Kremlin protests this year, polls show Putin, 64, would comfortably win another term in office if, as expected, he decides to stand.  Tough Times Related CoverageDissent gets a cameo role at Putin phone-in sessionBut the same polls have also laid bare widespread political apathy, raising doubts about the turnout at next year's election, as well as serious concerns about everyday issues such as low wages, rising prices and shoddy housing.  Low world oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over the conflict in Ukraine have hit Russia hard since 2014, reducing the amount of money available for domestic needs, a problem further exacerbated by rampant official corruption.  After taking questions from a succession of people living in poverty and squalor, Putin emphasized his own humble roots, recalling how his late father used to scrimp on electricity.   We have many tasks. The first and the most important is to ensure wage growth. We need to get rid of poverty, get rid of hovels and dangerous housing.  Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with journalists following a live nationwide broadcast call-in in Moscow, Russia June 15, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinBut Putin also made clear that improvements would be gradual, depend on the pace of economic recovery, and could only be achieved by harnessing digital technology and by making structural changes to the way the country was run. The number of people living below the poverty line in Russia rose to 23.4 million last year, up from 15.5 million in 2013, according to the World Bank. The bank also said 13.5 percent of Russians live on less than 10,000 roubles ($173.61) per month. The average wage was higher in rouble terms -- 39,253 roubles ($681.47) in April, according to the Federal Statistics Service -- but Putin was confronted on Thursday by people who said they or people they knew earned as little as 3,600 roubles ($62.50) a month.  I'll have to check that,  said Putin, who fielded almost 70 questions in just under four hours, in an event that Kremlin watchers often liken to a tsar listening to his petitioners.

And the increase in the number of people who live below the poverty line is especially worrisome,  he said.  Putin looked somber when listening to some comments. In one exchange, a teacher in Siberia said she was making just 16,500 roubles ($286.46) a month, a sum she said she was struggling to get by on. Putin said he was surprised because the average wage for teachers in her region should be twice that. In another segment, a woman in the Ural mountains city of Izhevsk told Putin she had to live in unsanitary conditions in a ramshackle wooden house. She said she was afraid the ceiling would collapse onto her children. Putin said steps would be taken to re-house her and even said he would visit during a visit to the city he had previously planned.  I'll call in on you,  he told her via video link. Putin was less forthcoming on the subject of his own family. When asked about his grandchildren, he appealed for privacy, saying he feared being candid on the subject could deprive them of a normal childhood. Putin avoided mentioning opposition leader Alexei Navalny by name, but made clear he did not approve of an anti-Kremlin protest on Monday which was broken up by baton-wielding riot police.  I don't think this is being done to improve the situation in the country but to resolve personal questions linked to self-promotion,  Putin said of that and other protests.

Technology stocks fell sharply on Thursday, extending a decline from last week, as investors continued to back away from the top-performing sector this year. The slide brought much-needed relief for short sellers, who aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. The technology sector's 17 percent gain this year has drawn significant short bets as speculators counted on a pullback. While the sector's first big stumble this year drew some added interest in bearish bets - the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund drew $150 million of new short bets in the latest week - traders have largely steered clear of boosting bets against the biggest names in the sector. Through Wednesday, the cumulative short interest for a basket of six big tech stocks - Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc,  Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Netflix - has fallen by $1.40 billion to $30.62 billion so far in June, according to S3 Partners data.  Short interest has either stayed relatively flat or decreased for these tech stocks,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.  The drop in the tech sector was due to long shareholders selling their long positions and not shorts increasing their exposure.   The recent weakness in the shares of these tech titans has resulted in paper profits of $672 million for short sellers so far this month.  For the most part, short tech positions were profitable, recouping some of their year-to-date losses but (they) were not looking to build their positions,  Dusaniwsky said.

The flu strain, known as H7N9, now mostly infects birds but it has infected at least 779 people in outbreaks in and around China, mainly related to poultry markets.  The World Health Organization said earlier this year that all bird flu viruses need constant monitoring, warning that their constantly changing nature makes them  a persistent and significant threat to public health . At the moment, the H7N9 virus does not have the capability to spread sustainably from person to person. But scientists are worried it could at any time mutate into a form that does.  To assess this risk, researchers led by James Paulson of the Scripps Research Institute in California looked at mutations that could potentially take place in the H7N9 virus's genome. They focused on the H7 hemagglutanin, a protein on the flu virus surface that allows it to latch onto host cells.  The team's findings, published in the journal PLoS Pathogens on Thursday, showed that in laboratory tests, mutations in three amino acids made the virus more able to bind to human cells - suggesting these changes are key to making the virus more dangerous to people. Scientists not directly involved in this study said its findings were important, but should not cause immediate alarm.  This study will help us to monitor the risk posed by bird flu in a more informed way, and increasing our knowledge of which changes in bird flu viruses could be potentially dangerous will be very useful in surveillance,  said Fiona Culley, an expert in respiratory immunology at Imperial College London. She noted that while  some of the individual mutations have been seen naturally, ... these combinations of mutations have not , and added:  The chances of all three occurring together is relatively low.   Wendy Barclay, a virologist and flu specialist also at Imperial, said the study's findings were important in showing why H7N9 bird flu should be kept under intense surveillance.   These studies keep H7N9 virus high on the list of viruses we should be concerned about,  she said.  The more people infected, the higher the chance that the lethal combination of mutations could occur.

May has been holding talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), keen to get the backing of their 10 lawmakers in Westminster's parliament to return to government after failing to win a majority in last week's British election. The prime minister met leaders of Northern Ireland's other political parties on Thursday, some of whom had voiced concerns that a tie-up could destabilise local politics and undermine the British government's neutrality in overseeing separate talks to form a new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.  We will oppose any deal which undermines the Good Friday agreement,  Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, told reporters outside May's Downing Street residence, in reference to the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence.  A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power, a temporary little arrangement won't have any integrity and certainly is not as important as the integrity and the needs of the people who live in Ireland.  The DUP's main demands centre around securing more funding for the province, a source close to the party told Reuters on Saturday and Adams said he would welcome such funds.  We are consistently making the case that our institutions are under resourced, have been undermined by austerity and need to be properly funded. So of course we would support any monies going to the executive,  Adams said. Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in the British parliament last week but does not take up its seats or vote in Westminster, would likely reject a deal to form a government by refusing to work with the DUP in Northern Ireland. However some analysts say a deal between May and the DUP that hands the province additional resources but does not damage Irish nationalist interests or undermine peace could motivate Sinn Fein to agree to form a new power-sharing government. The DUP represents people in Northern Ireland who wish the province to remain part of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Fein wants Northern Ireland to be administered by the Irish Republic. Others leaders who met May remained sceptical.  The prime minister will have to do a lot more to convince us that the DUP tail isn’t wagging the Tory dog,  Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said in a statement.

The statement warned that the UAE would pursue those behind the attack.  The attack did not cause any damage to the ship, while a crew member was hurt,  WAM said. The Saudi state news agency earlier quoted the Saudi-led military coalition, which includes the UAE, as saying the ship was hit while leaving al-Mokha port but gave no further details. WAM gave no details about the medical supplies aboard the ship but noted that the UAE had been sending medicines and medical equipment to help fight a cholera epidemic that had killed nearly 1,000 people in Yemen since April.  The Houthis had reported the attack earlier, broadcasting a grainy video of what Houthi-run media said was a missile being fired at a Saudi-led coalition vessel. The missile burst into a ball of fire as it hit its target. The attack was part of a protracted conflict between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. The coalition wants to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whom the Houthis have forced into exile. Al-Mokha was captured by the coalition from the Houthis earlier this year after heavy fighting. It lies close to the Bab al-Mandab shipping lane through which much of the world's oil passes.

Barry Cadden, co-founder of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was cleared of second-degree murder charges but was found guilty in March of racketeering and fraud for his role in shipping injectible steroids tainted with fungus linked to the deadly outbreak that also sickened 753 people in 20 states. Cadden's attorneys argued that prosecutors overreached in the number and severity of criminal charges that they filed against him. The attorneys said the prosectutors misled the jury by providing them a binder filled with laboratory tests showing that vials of steroids shipped by NECC were tainted but not providing comparable reports submitted by defense attorneys showing the vials were sterile.  There is huge prejudice in the fact that the government compiled this in this way in this case,  said Michelle Peirce during Thursday's hearing in Boston federal court.  There are two different test results for much of this but the jury could have assumed that this is all there was.  Prosecutors said the binder was intended to make it easier for jurors to sift through the thousands of pieces of evidence in the case.  Every single document in that binder was an admitted exhibit,  said Assistant U.S. Attorney George Varghese.  The binder issue, your honor, is a red herring for two reasons. One, there is nothing legally wrong with it and, two, there is no evidence that the jury looked at it.  One issue looming ahead of Cadden's sentencing later this month is that the jury handled its paperwork in a quirky way: Rather than just checking  guilty  or  not guilty  for the second-degree murder counts, they filled in numbers that prosecutors say showed that a majority had thought Cadden was guilty on 21 of the 25 murder counts. A total of 14 people tied to the now-defunct Framingham, Massachusetts-based pharmacy were criminally charged, but only two face murder charges. The other is Glenn Chin, the company's pharmacist, who is due to face trial in September. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Cadden ignored the rules and put profits before patients in 2012, when the compounding pharmacy sent out 17,600 vials of steroids contaminated with mold that were mistakenly labeled sterile. The vials went to 23 states.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-meningitis-idUSL1N1JC182"},

Unicaja will issue up to 687.5 million new shares to institutional investors at between 1.1 euros and 1.4 euros per share, it said in a statement to Spain's market regulator, confirming a Reuters report earlier on Thursday. The initial public offering would value the bank at between 1.7 billion and 2.3 billion euros, it said. The rescue of Banco Popular last week, in which shareholders and junior bondholders were wiped out, had cast doubt over whether Unicaja's listing would go ahead. Like Popular, Unicaja has a bad loan ratio above the average of its rivals and banking industry sources said its business model, mostly focused on selling mortgages in the rural Spanish regions of Andalusia and Castilla and Leon, might not appeal to investors. With 56 billion euros of assets, it currently controls 2 percent of Spanish deposits. Unicaja had been due to list before March this year as a condition for indirectly receiving public aid when it bought out smaller rescued bank CEISS. It obtained a grace period from the European Commission but the new deadline has not been disclosed. Unicaja aims to use the proceeds of the sale to repay public aid worth 604 million euros, increase its stake in CEISS and for general corporate purposes. The sale will also mean the current majority shareholders, a group of former savings banks which currently owns 86.7 percent of the lender, could see their stake fall below 50 percent if the full amount of shares are sold. $1 = 0.8966 euros $1 = 0.8973 euros Additional reporting and writing by Jesús Aguado; Editing by Julien Toyer and Jane Merriman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/unicaja-ipo-spain-idUSL8N1JC43M"},

Parliament voted on Wednesday to back a treaty to hand over the two uninhabited islands of Tiran and Sanfir and Sisi is expected to ratify the decision soon. The plan to cede the islands to Saudi Arabia, which has given Egypt billions of dollars of aid, was first announced last year and has since become mired in political protest and legal action. The Social Democratic Party, along with several other parties and groups, called for protests on Friday. Thousands of people backed a Facebook page named  Giving up land is treason,  which urges people to protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square, birthplace of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising. It shows a box full of Saudi cash, which it describes as the title deeds for the islands. Opponents of the plan say Egypt's sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. Small demonstrations have taken place over the past couple of days, despite a state of emergency imposed by Sisi in April following church bombings that killed at least 45 Christians.  At least eight were detained for 24 hours on suspicion of illegally protesting and insulting the president, according to the state news agency MENA.  Those who kidnap our youth from their homes because they are defending their land, shouldn't they be called the Occupation Authority?  Zyad el-Elaimy, a liberal politician and a member of the social democratic party said on Twitter. Elaimy said at least three members of his party had been arrested following a protest after a meeting at party headquarters on Wednesday. Security forces broke up the demonstration. Sisi is losing much of the popularity he enjoyed when he overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 and was lionized as the savior of the nation. He is facing mounting criticism over the struggling economy and is seen by many Egyptians as a traitor for giving up the islands. A popular Twitter hashtag is  Sisi is a traitor.  The Free Egyptians Party, usually supportive of Sisi, issued a strong denunciation of the treaty.  Our patriotic and historic responsibility requires us to confirm that Tiran and Sanfir islands were and continue to be under Egyptian sovereignty,  the statement read. The statement had also backed a court ruling which blocked the islands deal earlier this year. As legal action rumbles on, the matter will next be taken up by the Supreme Constitutional Court.

The bill, proposed by Ireland's main opposition party Fianna Fail to force banks to cut their mortgage rates, passed the initial stage in parliament a year ago despite objections from a minority government that is not large enough to block it. The legislation is now being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee where it has also been criticised by the central bank, which would be handed the new powers. The European Central Bank and the European Commission have also opposed the bill. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's warning was contained among a set of recommendations in a government-commissioned report on how to develop a more stable market that it described as currently  quite dysfunctional.   Generally any move by the legislature to intervene and regulate interest rates generates negative perceptions among international funders and raises the possibility of further interventions, which introduces additional risk for funders and makes entry less attractive,  it said. The CCPC said that of the 20 banks, representative bodies and individuals who responded to their consultation, only three - Fianna Fail, the Fair Mortgage Rates Campaign and an individual consumer - were in favour of capping interest rates. Fianna Fail finance spokesman, Michael McGrath, told national broadcaster RTE that Ireland's finance minister is consulting with the Attorney General on some legal aspects of the bill and he was awaiting feedback before proceeding. Among its proposals, the CCPC recommended that government be more proactive in boosting the low levels of new entrants, make it far easier for existing customers to switch mortgage provider and look at ways to fund longer-term fixed rate products.  We would suggest the postponement of additional policy proposals on related issues until these options have been fully considered,  it said.

While its stock may not appear expensive in terms of expected earnings, some investors believe further gains in Apple will be less likely as an expected iPhone launch approaches.   Anticipation of a new iPhone has been out there for a while now, and maybe we're entering a period where the stock is topped out,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Apple accounts for about 4.5 percent of his firm's equity exposure. Apple has surged 48 percent over the past year to record highs, largely in anticipation that the Cupertino, California company will launch an iPhone with major improvements to mark the device's 10th anniversary.  The company typically unveils its new iPhones in September. Many analysts believe a large number of customers will upgrade to the new device from older phones. A selloff in technology stocks that began last Friday has clipped 4.1 percent off the S&P; 500 information technology index as investors worry about stretched valuations in 2017's top-performing sector.  During that time, Alphabet has lost 5.8 percent, Amazon is down 5.17 percent and Facebook is off 4.03 percent. Apple has declined more than 7 percent in the past five days. Downgrades Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz cautioned in a note on Thursday that the  mega cycle  of iPhone sales expected this year may fall short of expectations due to competition in China.  Analysts from Pacific Crest and Mizuho Securities downgraded their ratings on Apple this month, both saying the benefits from the expected new iPhone are priced into the stock.    Without this little flash crash, we were probably going to see some downward movement anyway on Apple,  said Brian Hennessey, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund.  There is some downside risk that was not there to nearly this extent at the beginning of the year. It's partly timing as you get closer to the launch.   Apple is the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund's largest holding. It recently traded at 14.7 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That's down from an earnings multiple of 16 in midday but above its five-year average of 12.2. But Moskowitz warned that the earnings multiple is near the peak level of early 2015, when strong sales of the iPhone 6 pushed Apple's stock to record highs, only to slip into a deep downturn. Apple will probably be classified completely as a growth company in an annual rebalancing of Russell indexes on June 23, according to Jefferies.  After that drop in Apple's stock extended into 2016, Russell allocated 8 percent of Apple as  value  in its investment style indexes, with 92 percent of Apple remaining  growth.   The expected rebalancing of Apple in Russell's subindexes reflects its recovery last year and recent record highs.

Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, Monika Bickert, Facebook's director of global policy management, and Brian Fishman, counterterrorism policy manager, explained in a blog post. Facebook uses artificial intelligence for image matching that allows the company to see if a photo or video being uploaded matches a known photo or video from groups it has defined as terrorist, such as Islamic State, Al Qaeda and their affiliates, the company said in the blog post. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft last year created a common database of digital fingerprints automatically assigned to videos or photos of militant content to help each other identify the same content on their platforms. Similarly, Facebook now analyses text that has already been removed for praising or supporting militant organizations to develop text-based signals for such propaganda.  More than half the accounts we remove for terrorism are accounts we find ourselves, that is something that we want to let our community know so they understand we are really committed to making Facebook a hostile environment for terrorists,  Bickert said in a telephone interview. Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook and other social media sites such as Google and Twitter to do more to remove militant content and hate speech. Government officials have threatened to fine the company and strip the broad legal protections it enjoys against liability for the content posted by its users. Asked why Facebook was opening up now about policies that it had long declined to discuss, Bickert said recent attacks were naturally starting conversations among people about what they could do to stand up to militancy. In addition, she said,  we're talking about this is because we are seeing this technology really start to become an important part of how we try to find this content.

The S&P; 500 technology sector has risen 16.7 percent this year, far outperforming other sectors and giving investors a chance to lock in gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has also surged 13.7 percent, compared with the S&P; 500's 8.2 percent gain for the year. However, fortunes turned last Friday after a drop in Apple's shares triggered a selloff and led to the tech sector's biggest two-day decline in nearly a year.  The huge tech run was impressive and has come to a point where people want to take some money off the table and preserve profits,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn capital in Benardsville, New Jersey. Google's parent Alphabet dropped 1.8 percent following a Canaccord Genuity downgrade, giving investors more reasons to sell the stock. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 45.14 points, or 0.21 percent, at 21,329.42, the S&P; 500 was down 12.12 points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,425.8 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 58.38 points, or 0.94 percent, at 6,136.51. Investors are also concerned about the U.S. economy's ability to withstand a third interest rate hike later this year and the Federal Reserve's plans to trim its balance sheet, especially after a recent set of lackluster economic data. A Washington Post report that President Donald Trump was being investigated for possible obstruction of justice added to the jitters. Bakhos said the development was  adding a little angst to the market and moved investors to choose a risk-off path.  The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street's  fear gauge , hit 11.61 points - its biggest percentage gain in nearly one month. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower. The gainers were utilities and real estate , whose slow but steady growth makes them attractive during periods of uncertainty. Industrials pared losses to trade little changed after Boeing shares were lifted to a record high by Deutsche Bank's price-target increase. Shares of Caterpillar and United Technologies were also helped by Boeing's gain. Kroger was down 17.6 percent after the supermarket chain operator slashed its full-year profit forecast. Nike was off 3.2 percent after the company said it would cut about 2 percent of global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles.

Barry Cadden, co-founder of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was cleared of second-degree murder charges but was found guilty in March of racketeering and fraud for his role in shipping injectible steroids tainted with fungus linked to the deadly outbreak that also sickened 753 people in 20 states. Cadden's attorneys argued that prosecutors overreached in the number and severity of criminal charges that they filed against him. The attorneys said the prosectutors misled the jury by providing them a binder filled with laboratory tests showing that vials of steroids shipped by NECC were tainted but not providing comparable reports submitted by defense attorneys showing the vials were sterile.  There is huge prejudice in the fact that the government compiled this in this way in this case,  said Michelle Peirce during Thursday's hearing in Boston federal court.  There are two different test results for much of this but the jury could have assumed that this is all there was.  Prosecutors said the binder was intended to make it easier for jurors to sift through the thousands of pieces of evidence in the case.  Every single document in that binder was an admitted exhibit,  said Assistant U.S. Attorney George Varghese.  The binder issue, your honor, is a red herring for two reasons. One, there is nothing legally wrong with it and, two, there is no evidence that the jury looked at it.  One issue looming ahead of Cadden's sentencing later this month is that the jury handled its paperwork in a quirky way: Rather than just checking  guilty  or  not guilty  for the second-degree murder counts, they filled in numbers that prosecutors say showed that a majority had thought Cadden was guilty on 21 of the 25 murder counts. [L1N1J5015] A total of 14 people tied to the now-defunct Framingham, Massachusetts-based pharmacy were criminally charged, but only two face murder charges. The other is Glenn Chin, the company's pharmacist, who is due to face trial in September. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Cadden ignored the rules and put profits before patients in 2012, when the compounding pharmacy sent out 17,600 vials of steroids contaminated with mold that were mistakenly labeled sterile. The vials went to 23 states. Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-meningitis-idUSL1N1JC0M9"},

The number of middle and high school students who used any tobacco product fell to 3.9 million in 2016 from 4.7 million in 2015. The number who used e-cigarettes fell to 2.2 million from 3 million, while the number who used traditional cigarettes fell to 1.4 million from 1.6 million. The figures, released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showed that 11.3 percent of high school students used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 16 percent in 2015. Roughly 8 percent of high school students used traditional cigarettes, down from 9.3 percent in 2015. Among middle school students, 4.3 percent used e-cigarettes in 2016, down from 5.3 percent in 2015. There was little change in the rate of middle school traditional cigarette smoking, which was 2.2 percent in 2016 compared to 2.3 percent in 2015. The 2016 figures represent the first time the use of all tobacco products has declined among youth since the CDC started reporting this measure in 2011. In previous years declines in cigarette and cigar use coincided with increases in the use of other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and hookahs. Between 2011 and 2016 overall tobacco use, including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, smokeless tobacco, pipes and bidis, remained roughly the same. Use of cigarettes between 2011 and 2016 fell among high school students to 8 percent in 2016 from 15.8 percent in 2011, use of cigars fell to 7.7 percent from 11.6 percent and smokeless tobacco use fell to 5.8 percent from 7.9 percent. At the same time use of e-cigarettes rose to 11.3 percent from 1.5 percent and use of hookahs rose to 4.8 percent from 4.1 percent. The latest figures show e-cigarette use is declining without a corresponding increase in traditional cigarette use. In 2016 e-cigarettes remained the most commonly used tobacco product among high school students, at 11.3 percent, and among middle school students, at 4.3 percent. The latest figures show that of those students who used any tobacco product, nearly half used two or more. The CDC did not specify which products were most frequently used together but Brian King, the CDC Office on Smoking and Health's deputy director for research translation, said previous studies have shown that the most common dual use pairing is between cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

The Phoenix financial planner brought his 5-year-old orange tabbies Frankie and Scotch in for bathing, clipping and shaving, which cost $150. But then the payment system asked whether he wanted to tack on a healthy tip: Either 20, 25 or 30 percent.  Ridiculous,  says Koury, 36, who says it was not explained to him why he needed to tip, or whom. He was so irked, in fact, that he ended up giving no tip at all. Traditionally, many consumers have rewarded tip-worthy service when the spirit moves them, and within a certain range: 10 percent is on the low side, 15 is fairly standard, and 20 is seen as generous. But with the advent of pre-calculated tipping options, and apps like Square that allow businesses to customize payment screens, consumers are prompted for tips in unfamiliar circumstances. Options in the 20-25-30 percent range pop up with increasing frequency. Welcome to the phenomenon of  tip inflation.  Recent data from Square, a popular mobile payments app led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, reveals that tip encouragement seems to be working: The average tip for taxis last year was 16.54 percent, in the food and beverage sector it was 17.05 percent, and in salons it was 18.55 percent. In a previous analysis, Square users reported that from 2013 to 2014, customers tipped 35 percent more frequently. It should be noted that Square's default settings for amounts over $10 are  No tip, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent.  So if you are seeing tip options of 20, 25 and 30 percent, that has been customized by the business owner.  Don't fall for it!  says New York financial planner David Mendels.  Twenty percent is a generous tip, and if I don't give more than that, it doesn't make me a miser. If they suggest more, it makes them greedy and unprofessional. That is reason enough to knock it down to 15 percent.  The bottom line: Business owners have every right to ask for whatever tip they deem appropriate. And you, in turn, have every right to say  No.   Would you voluntarily pay a higher amount for anything just because you were given the option to do so?  asks Edward Vargo, a financial adviser in Westlake, Ohio.  I would simply ignore anything above 20 percent, unless you feel you have received really exceptional service.  When ultra-generous tip options are waved in customers' faces, it can feel very much like  tip shaming.  Rather than appearing miserly to the service employee, people often just tap one of the available options and swallow the additional cost. So how can consumers make a snap decision that is appropriate for them? It may seem like a straightforward transaction, but there are actually many factors packed into that one decision, advises etiquette expert Diane Gottsman, author of  Modern Etiquette for a Better Life  and founder of the Protocol School of Texas. What can you afford? Was the service above-and-beyond in any way? And is the service professional largely dependent on those tips for their income?  You decide what you tip, and you should not feel pressured by the app,  says Gottsman.  So go with your feelings, but please tip fairly.

FIFA formally launched the initiative jointly with the game's law-making body IFAB on Thursday as part of a strategy  focusing on improving fairness and the image of the game,  it said in a statement. Football is often compared unfavourably to other sports because of the behavior of the players. Remonstrating with referees and surrounding match officials to protest decisions, known as  mobbing , is common, along with play-acting, time-wasting and other forms of gamesmanship.  YouTube has a number of clips of referees being attacked or chased off the pitch by irate players.  Referees, players, coaches and fans all agree that improving player behavior and respect for all participants (and especially match officials), increasing playing time and the game’s fairness and attractiveness must be football’s main priority,” IFAB technical director David Elleray said. At the same time, FIFA technical director Marco van Basten told a news conference in St Petersburg that mobbing would be one of FIFA's first targets during the Confederations Cup. Referees had also been instructed to be more accurate in adding time for major delays such as injuries and substitutions and to prevent more time-wasting, van Basten said. One of the most common time-wasting tactics used by teams holding a narrow lead is for a player to be substituted and then leave the field slowly, stopping to shake hands with opponents and match officials along the way.  The 'play fair' initiative is a plan for football,  said Van Basten.  This strategy aims to promote fairness and integrity, ensure the game is accessible to everyone and optimize the use of technology.   The Confederations Cup, featuring the champions of the six continental confederations plus the World Cup hosts and defending champions, will be held in Russia from June 17 to July 2.

The bacterium Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, which gets its nickname from the sounds patients make as they gasp for air during intense coughing fits. Pertussis is highly contagious and easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. About half of babies under age 1 year who catch pertussis require hospitalization for serious complications like pneumonia or brain disorders. About 49 percent of pregnant women in the U.S. got the Tdap booster vaccine against tetnanus, diphtheria and pertussis last year, up from just 27 percent in 2014, the study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found. The CDC first recommended this vaccine for all pregnant women in 2013.  “While we are encouraged to see Tdap vaccination is becoming a routine part of prenatal care, one out of two babies are born without protection from whooping cough,” said Carla Black, a researcher with the CDC’s Immunization Services Division who worked on the study.  “The best way to protect babies from whooping cough is to get a Tdap vaccine during the third trimester of each pregnancy,” Black said by email. “Getting Tdap vaccination while pregnant helps protect babies during the critical time between birth and 2 months old, the age when they are old enough to begin getting their own whooping cough vaccines.” Women were most likely to get the Tdap vaccine when a doctor or nurse recommended it and offered to give them the shot, the study found. About 70 percent of women got vaccinated under these circumstances, compared with just 1.4 percent of women who were not told to do this by their health care provider.  When providers told patients to get the vaccine but didn’t give it to them, about 31 percent of the women were vaccinated, the study also found.  Roughly 13 percent of women who didn’t get the vaccine said they were concerned that it was unsafe for their baby, and another 5 percent of women were worried the vaccine might be unsafe for them.  “From a safety perspective, there’s good data that tells us it’s safe for both mother and baby, with the majority of reported side effects being a sore arm after the vaccine,” said Dr. Kerrie Wiley, a public health researcher at The University of Sydney in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study.  The study confirms something doctors have long known about vaccines: that patients are much more likely to get their recommended shots when doctors tell them to do it and then have a dose ready to give them, Wiley said by email.  “Pregnancy is such a busy time, there’s so many things expectant mothers need to remember, and many women in our research spoke about information overload - having to remember appointments, which foods to avoid and all those other recommendations that come with finding out they’re pregnant,” Wiley said. “It’s about helping put recommended vaccines on their pregnancy radar. Until recently, there was still some concern that the Tdap vaccination wouldn’t provide sufficient protection for babies, noted Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.  “Recent studies have demonstrated that there is good protection against pertussis among young infants by maternal Tdap,” Maldonado, who wasn’t involved in the CDC study, said by email.  “Better education of pregnant women and their providers would be very helpful in increasing maternal Tdap vaccination,” Maldonado added.  To assess vaccination rates, researchers conducted an online survey in March and April of 2016 of women 18 to 49 years old who were pregnant at any time since August 1, 2015. The survey included about 2,100 women. Researchers followed similar methods to collect data on vaccination rates for 2014 and 2015.

Qatar had asked the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to intervene after its Gulf neighbors closed their airspace to Qatar flights. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt last week severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran. The UAE has also decided to blacklist Qatari individuals and entities. In response, ICAO - a U.N. agency that regulates international air travel under the Chicago Convention - said it would host talks of ministers and senior officials from Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt at its Montreal headquarters on Thursday to seek a  consensus-based solution  that addressed  current regional concerns.  Most of the officials attending the meeting are expected to be transport ministers, an ICAO representative said on Wednesday. ICAO has rarely intervened in disputes between states, especially involving overflights, which are governed by a separate international agreement from the Chicago pact that created the UN aviation agency. In 1971, India closed its airspace to Pakistan in a row over the hijacking of a plane by Kashmir separatists. Pakistan complained to ICAO that its rights had been infringed under both post-World War II aviation agreements – the Chicago Convention and the separate International Air Transit Services Agreement, which guarantees transit rights. The ICAO Council, however, merely encouraged the two sides to settle their differences, according to a history of the agency by Canadian academic David Mackenzie.

Safran says it is confident of resolving Zodiac's industrial problems after visiting its plants, including a British factory blamed for the latest profit downgrade in April.

U.S. senators approved new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday over alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, targeting certain Russian energy projects.  As far as the implementation of the sanctions is concerned, they don't conceal that this is aimed at ensuring American LNG to Europe,  Interfax quoted Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev as saying. The United States is eyeing new markets for its LNG exports, including Europe. Gazprom so far has dismissed the potential impact from the U.S. proposal on its business in Europe, where it accounts for a third of gas supplies, saying that high transportation costs make U.S. LNG too expensive. The U.S. Senate said it was the policy of the United States to continue to oppose Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, saying it would have a detrimental impact on the European Union's energy security, gas market development in Central and Eastern Europe and energy reforms in Ukraine. Gazprom and its European partners are pushing ahead with the plans to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream undersea gas pipeline to Europe from Russia as Moscow seeks to diversify its energy supplies and bypass Ukraine. Medvedev also said he hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump will not approve the new sanctions.   Let's hope that, first of all, the draft law has not been passed yet; without the president's signature it cannot become law,  he was quoted as saying by Interfax. Germany and Austria on Thursday also censured the U.S. Senate for approving the new sanctions on Russia, saying they expose European companies involved in Russian energy projects to fines for breaching U.S. law. Medvedev said that Gazprom has already received more than 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) from its partners for Nord Stream 2 financing. In April Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV and Engie agreed to each loan 10 percent of the cost of the venture, or up to 950 million euros each.  Gazprom will shoulder 50 percent of the cost of the 55 billion cubic meter pipeline, which is due to start operating in 2019.

Fighting and bombardment around Damascus have eased significantly since Russia, Turkey and Iran agreed a deal for  de-escalation zones  around Syria in an April meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan. Fighting since then has mostly focused on Syria's sprawling desert in the centre and east of the country, where warring sides are racing to capture territory from Islamic State. However, strikes on Thursday targeted the Eastern Ghouta oasis area of farms and towns outside Damascus after at least two shells hit the capital's Qassaa district, the Reuters witness said. The war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said rocket and the Syrian army also bombarded the Jobar district in eastern Damascus. The next round of talks in Astana is likely to be held in early July, Russian media have quoted a senior official as saying. More substantive peace talks in Geneva could resume after that. After six years of war between President Bashar al-Assad and rebels seeking to oust him, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed and more than half the country's pre-war population made homeless. Syria's army has made several advances since the Astana de-escalation zones were agreed against Islamic State, including in oil-rich desert areas in recent days. On Wednesday a Syrian military source said the army had taken control over Arak oil field and pumping station east of Palmyra, part of its offensive to relieve an enclave in Deir al-Zor that is besieged by the jihadist group. On Thursday, a military media unit run by the government's ally Hezbollah reported that the army had captured the Thawra oil field south of Tabqa in northern Syria. Syrian oil fields have been an important source of revenue for Islamic State. Their loss to Damascus has made it more difficult for the government to produce electricity.

SocGen placed a 20 percent stake in ALD in a sale which was a test of investor appetite for a company that combines cars and financial services. The deal values ALD at around 5.78 billion euros. ALD offers leases to corporate clients which make monthly lease payments to cover financing, depreciation of the vehicle and the cost of various services, such as tyre maintenance or insurance, while the vehicle is still owned by ALD. ALD, whose core clients currently include mid-sized companies, is targeting individual customers in Europe who are increasingly turning to leasing or sharing cars, rather than owning them. ALD expects to expand its business with individual clients to around 1 million cars in their fleet by 2025. It aims to grow its fleet by 8 to 10 percent annually, up from the 1.4 million cars it had as of the end of March 2017.  ALD's listing will provide extra flexibility to accelerate our expansion,  the company's chief executive Mike Masterson said in a statement. ALD said it is ranked number three globally and number one as a car leasing company in Europe by number of vehicles under management. Along with European rivals, ALD faces some uncertainties over the valuation of its fleet partly related to tighter emissions regulations.

The 100-member Senate backed the measure by a margin of 98-2. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two  no  votes. The bill includes new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers. The Senate this week also added new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for Syria's government in that country's six-year-long civil war. Lawmakers also voted overwhelmingly earlier on Thursday to add provision to the bill allowing the U.S. space agency NASA to continue using Russian-made rocket engines and reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance. To become law, the legislation still must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. House aides said they expected the chamber would begin to debate the measure in the coming weeks, although they could not predict when it might face a final vote. Trump's secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had questioned the legislation in testimony in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.  I would urge Congress to ensure any legislation allows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation,  he told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, aides in both the Senate and the House said they expected support for the bill would be strong enough to override a Trump veto if necessary.

U.S. senators approved new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday over alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, targeting certain Russian energy projects.  As far as the implementation of the sanctions is concerned, they don't conceal that this is aimed at ensuring American LNG to Europe,  Interfax quoted Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev as saying. The United States is eyeing new markets for its LNG exports, including Europe. Gazprom so far has dismissed the potential impact from the U.S. proposal on its business in Europe, where it accounts for a third of gas supplies, saying that high transportation costs make U.S. LNG too expensive. The U.S. Senate said it was the policy of the United States to continue to oppose Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, saying it would have a detrimental impact on the European Union's energy security, gas market development in Central and Eastern Europe and energy reforms in Ukraine. Gazprom and its European partners are pushing ahead with the plans to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream undersea gas pipeline to Europe from Russia as Moscow seeks to diversify its energy supplies and bypass Ukraine. Medvedev also said he hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump will not approve the new sanctions.   Let's hope that, first of all, the draft law has not been passed yet; without the president's signature it cannot become law,  he was quoted as saying by Interfax. Germany and Austria on Thursday also censured the U.S. Senate for approving the new sanctions on Russia, saying they expose European companies involved in Russian energy projects to fines for breaching U.S. law. Medvedev said that Gazprom has already received more than 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) from its partners for Nord Stream 2 financing. In April Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV and Engie agreed to each loan 10 percent of the cost of the venture, or up to 950 million euros each.  Gazprom will shoulder 50 percent of the cost of the 55 billion cubic meter pipeline, which is due to start operating in 2019.

That was well below median expectations in a Reuters poll for an interannual expansion of 0.9 percent.

If the chastened prime minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis take a gentler tone when talks finally launch in Brussels next week, they could win valuable concessions, some think. A week after May lost her majority in an election she had called in the hope of strengthening her hand in the talks, some fellow Conservatives want her to focus more on limiting the damage to business and less on cutting immigration and other ties to the EU when Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019. Other EU governments will be happy to let Britain keep trade open as it would limit the hit to their own economies, officials told Reuters, though they are not ready to ease conditions that May would struggle to sell to her party's Brexit hardliners. But speculating now on different kinds of trade pact - on   soft Brexit  or  hard  - is to put cart before horse, they say. EU leaders gave chief negotiator Michel Barnier no authority to so much as talk about trade until he clinches outline deals on Brussels' priority issues, including on what London owes them. Barnier this week acknowledged  sensitivity  in London at EU suggestions that Britain might owe it some 60 billion euros in 2019 and said sorting out the issue soon would help a trade deal:  I would like to very quickly play down this question, and find concrete, pragmatic and just solutions,  he said on Monday.   We need trust to build the future relationship.     Related CoverageBritain, EU to launch Brexit talks on Monday: Brexit departmentEU leaders, who will meet May at a summit next Thursday, have been irritated by her repeated threats to walk out with  no deal  -- even if most see that as a campaigning bluff given the chaos it would cause. They are also irked by her refusal to say Britain will definitely pay what Brussels calls a  hefty bill  -- some ministers have even said the EU may owe London money. Haggling Over Bill If Davis, who launches the formal negotiations with Barnier on Monday, can show British willing on the EU's priority  Phase One  issues, then trade talks could get under way by the turn of the year -- a step-by-step timetable Barnier says must be followed to limit the risk of a disruptive  no deal  scenario. An EU official close to the matter said the  softer Brexit  talk could be  productive  and help progress in the first months, where the British attitude to discussing the financial settlement  will be the first serious test of the negotiations . There are also differences over the other priority issue for Brussels -- securing the rights of 3 million EU citizens living in Britain -- but diplomats see those as less problematic. And as leaders welcomed the new tone in London and talk of a  softer Brexit  that may be less disruptive than May's clean break with the single market and customs union, officials from at least some governments saw compromise on the British bill.  If they refuse to pay, there will be no agreement,  a senior official handling Brexit for one EU member state government told Reuters.  However, discussing about the amount of money, here there will be flexibility,  he added. A senior Brussels official said the amount, which compares to London's annual net EU payment of around 10 billion euros, would still be  peanuts  in terms of the overall economy and also that the final bill would be determined less by technical and legal arguments than by hard-headed political horse-trading. Trade Trade-Offs Significant progress in talks on the budget and citizens' rights issue, as well as on issues around the new EU-UK land border in Ireland, would allow EU leaders to give Barnier a mandate by December to discuss a future, close relationship and, potentially, years of transition after 2019 to smooth its way. Barnier speaks of a willingness to look at various options but EU officials also stress that greater access to EU markets will mean accepting greater costs, closer to EU membership, and question whether Britain can find a political consensus on that. The other 27, including lead powers Germany and France, want to dissuade others from emulating Britain and so insist that any Brexit deal must be less advantageous than full membership.  All the options are balanced and come with obligations,  an EU official working on Brexit said, noting that May had seemed to be looking for a sweeping free trade deal like that agreed last year with Canada but that some of those calling for  soft  Brexit cited arrangements such as those with Norway and Turkey. Norway is in the single market, in return for accepting free immigration from the EU, EU courts and budget payments. Turkey has special arrangements with the customs union but must follow Brussels in trade policies with other global players. For Brussels, a concern with starting talks on such models would be that Brexit supporters might end up blocking them, raising the risk of time running out to get any deal:  Would you ... 10 months later find that there was no real majority for that?  the official said.  It all becomes very uncertain.  Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; @macdonaldrtr; editing by Mark John","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-eu-analysis-idUSKBN19620C"},

Crude prices wallowed near a six-week low as doubts grew over OPEC's ability to cut oil supplies, weighing on stocks worldwide and adding to worries over the resilience of sectors most geared to economic growth. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark fell to its lowest since April 24 before paring some losses and ended down 0.4 percent. Euro zone stocks and blue-chips fell 0.6 percent. Basic resource stocks fell 1.7 percent while energy stocks fell 0.6 percent.  Numbers showing the supply-demand imbalance are pushing commodities to the downside,  said David Stubbs, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  OPEC has been unable to control global production, and the situation in Qatar is showing it is not very united,  he added. Large brokers have been turning away from cyclicals and into defensives lately as they see strong momentum in European data fading, removing a catalyst for the sectors most sensitive to growth. Energy stocks are the worst-performing in Europe this year, and the only sector to have fallen year-to-date. Retailers were also under significant pressure. Europe's retail index fell 2.2 percent, the biggest sectoral faller in Europe, and Britain's mid-caps suffered their sharpest fall this year, as investors grew more skittish about the resilience of consumer spending in Britain, where is inflation is climbing due largely to a weak pound. Retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, adding to multiplying signs of inflation depressing consumer spending, the engine of the UK economy.  I don't think this is a surprise to anyone in terms of the narrative about how weak and stretched the consumer is and will be for the next quarters,  said Stubbs.  If retail sales are weak then the pie is contracting and someone is going to get hammered. Those that are unable to deal with that are going to see a much weaker bottom line,  he added. DFS Furniture plummeted 20 percent on Britain's small-cap index after a profit warning which it blamed on a dip in demand, with significant declines in store footfall. In Europe, H&M; shares fell 5.5 percent after May sales missed forecasts, adding to a string of softer figures from the Swedish fashion retailer, which blamed tough trading conditions. Petrofac shares were a rare bright spot on falling markets, up 3.9 percent, after a Jefferies upgrade to buy. Telecoms firm Proximus fell 3.6 percent after suffering a cut to 'sell' from Citi. Meanwhile stocks in Athens inched 0.15 percent lower as its international lenders prepared on Thursday to unblock as much as 8.5 billion euros in loans that Athens desperately needs next month to pay its bills .

Mining firms in the world's top platinum producer have complained about a lack of consultation over revisions to an industry charter that sets targets for black ownership and participation in the powerful sector. The charter is part of a wider empowerment drive across Africa's most industrialized economy designed to rectify the disparities of apartheid that persist more than two decades since the end of white minority rule in 1994. The Chamber of Mines, which represents mining firms, said it would take the government to court over the charter because it had not been consulted sufficiently and feared the new rules would create regulatory uncertainty and scare off investors. Announcing the new rules on Thursday, Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said companies had 12 months to meet the new 30 percent target. The rand fell 2 percent after Zwane announced details of the revisions. Johannesburg's Mining Index ended the day more than 3 percent lower, underscoring investor concerns about the charter and the uncertainties it raises.  The value destruction is hard to quantify and the uncertainty will persist. What is certain is that South Africa continues to be a terrible destination for mining investment and assets in South Africa will continue to trade at a discount,  said Ben Davis, an analyst at London-based Liberum Capital.  The government has said in the past that companies must stick to ownership targets even if black shareholders sell their stakes but Zwane said it had not yet decided whether mining firms must maintain the threshold permanently. The Chamber of Mines said it would also take this issue back to courts. It argues that a company should only be obliged to meet its black ownership targets once. The Mining Charter was introduced in 2002 to increase black ownership of the mining industry, which accounts for about 7 percent of South Africa's economic output. Black South Africans make up 80 percent of the 54 million population, yet most of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population.   Not Our Charter  Zwane told a news conference in the capital Pretoria that he had consulted widely with businesses.  We will engage with business going forward in a respectable manner. We will never take them to court,  he said. The new charter stipulates that mining firms must pay 1 percent of their annual turnover to the Mining Transformation and Development Agency, which helps black communities. Under the new rules, prospecting rights must be 50 percent black owned and mining rights should be 30 percent black owned. Mining firms are required to procure 70 percent of goods and 80 percent of services from black-owned companies. This could prove difficult for many companies, as much of the expensive and sophisticated equipment used on South Africa's increasingly mechanized mines is imported from foreign manufacturers.   The new rules also state that half of the members of mining company boards must be black, and a quarter of the overall board must be women. Officials at the Chamber of Mines said they hoped legal action would force the government back to the negotiating table.  We will not sign this charter because it is not our charter,  Chamber of Mines CEO Roger Baxter told a news conference in Johannesburg. The chamber, which represents companies such as Anglo American and Sibanye Gold, did not take part in the launch of the new charter because of what it said was a lack of prior consultation.

The proposal will mark the first from the administration under President Donald Trump for the controversial Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law aimed at cutting U.S. oil imports and boosting renewable fuel use. The EPA is broadly expected to hold its proposed requirements for conventional biofuel, which is mainly corn-based ethanol, unchanged at 15 billion gallons, the maximum under the RFS, said four Washington sources representing oil and biofuels interests. The persons spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. “We are expecting a modest increase in advanced and no change to the 15 billion” for conventional ethanol, said a U.S. biofuels industry source. Biofuels credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) were gyrating in active trade ahead of the announcement, with prices of the biomass-based diesel RINs jumping as much as 4 cents each, according to traders. The credits are used by fuel companies to meet the annual requirements from EPA for the volumes of ethanol and biodiesel that need to be blended in gasoline and diesel used by American drivers.  The proposal went from EPA to the White House for review last month. It includes targets for conventional and advanced biofuel for 2018 and for biomass-based diesel for 2019.

The change will be effective from July 1, said John Pullinger, Britain's national statistician. Statistics experts have long argued that  pre-release access  should end because it could give government officials an advantage over opposition lawmakers, eroding public trust in data. They have also pointed to the risk of leaks. In March, Reuters published a report showing movements in the value of British sterling against the U.S. dollar often followed an unusual pattern before monthly releases of official retail sales data. The Wall Street Journal published an analysis which showed similar movements in British government bond futures ahead of data releases. Pullinger said he had become increasingly concerned about growing access to economic statistics by government officials and that he tightened Office for National Statistics' procedures in March as a result.  It is already clear to me that the changes are not successfully dealing with the risks the review sought to mitigate,  Pullinger said in a letter to the UK Statistics Authority watchdog, published on Thursday.  I have therefore decided that pre-release access to ONS statistics will stop with effect from 1 July 2017.  An ONS spokesman said there was no evidence that official data was being leaked.  It is important, however, that public trust in the statistical system is maintained and that ministers and officials are above suspicion,  he added. The Royal Statistics Society, which had campaigned to end pre-release access for government officials, welcomed the move.  It will reduce the opportunities for figures to be 'spun' and increase public confidence in official statistics,  said RSS executive director Hetan Shah.  It will also lower the risk of market-sensitive information being leaked or abused.  Earlier on Thursday, sterling weakened against the dollar before the release of worse-than-expected retail sales numbers - a move that fitted with the trend observed in the Reuters analysis published in March. In March the chair of parliament's Treasury Committee urged Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, which tackles financial market abuse, to investigate the media reports about unusual movements in financial markets ahead of official data releases. Foreign exchange traders regularly post messages on Twitter saying they believe data is leaked ahead of publication, based on movements in the pound.

He then broke early in the deciding set and held firm.  It's never easy, especially the first match on grass,  Cilic told the ATP's website.  Janko has been at the top of the tennis game and is a quality player.  Cilic will seek a 50th career grasscourt victory on Friday when he plays Canada's Vasek Pospisil, who was leading Alexandr Dolgopolov when his opponent retired.

On Wednesday the bank cut jobs across that division, many of which came from its Charlotte, N.C., headquarters, a spokesman said. He would not specify the number of jobs lost. The cuts come as Bank of America is aiming to cut costs to boost financial targets Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has set.      Although Bank of America is also hiring, the employees that it is trying to reduce cost more than those who are joining, Moynihan said at a conference last month. The bank has also been cutting costs by shuttering data centers and moving information to less costly systems run by technology firms. For any large bank, technology and operations costs run high. Old systems are reliable but dated, while new ones are expensive to develop. Separately, at a conference on Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said the global banking and markets unit has roughly 1,300 applications that cost about $1.3 billion to maintain and run. As the bank sorts through those platforms and decides which to eliminate, some jobs will be lost, said spokesman Dan Frahm.

The source did not say when the placement of the stake with investors, part of Russia's privatisation programme, would now happen. Sovcomflot declined to comment.

We will announce specific deals as soon as they are ready.  The Russian stock index on Thursday slipped below the psychologically important 1,000-point level for the first time since late November 2016 on concerns about potential new U.S. sanctions against Moscow. Two financial market sources told Reuters late May the Sovcomflot deal was expected in early June. It was later postponed with no explanation. Polyus, Russia's top gold producer, decided to go ahead with its share offering on Thursday. But another deal planned for the near future, by En+ Group, has been pushed back, two people familiar with the matter said. En+ Group, which manages Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska's aluminium and hydro power assets, had planned to raise $2 billion from the sale of a 20-25 percent stake in London and Moscow as early as June, sources said in April. En+ is now targeting September for the initial public offering (IPO), one of the people said. Another said the target date was now September-October. En+ declined to comment. Deripaska told Rossiya 24 TV in early June the company wanted to raise $1.5 billion in an IPO and that a decision could be taken in the next 18 months subject to market conditions and as several other Russian firms are aiming for equity sales.

Nigeria is battling a currency crisis brought on by low oil prices, which has tipped its economy into recession and created chronic dollar shortages. Africa's biggest economy wants to attract foreign investors and at same time maintain a strong currency to ward off inflation. Spokesman Isaac Okorafor said the central bank would ensure it sustains intervention to support the naira and that the bank was comfortable with its dollar reserve level of $30.3 billion. Analysts estimate the bank has spent more than $5 billion defending the naira this year.  Average trading on investors' window is now $2.2 billion in the first six weeks of its introduction with our participation restricted to less than 30 percent,  Okorafor told Reuters.  This showed the level of confidence in the system.  Before the investors' window was introduced in April, the central bank was the main supplier of hard currency on the interbank forex market, after foreign investors fled naira assets in the wake of an oil price slump in 2014. The regulator has allowed investors to trade the naira at rates set freely between buyers and sellers, hoping to increase the amount of dollars available in Nigeria - but effectively introducing yet another exchange rate to the five already in operation. Nigeria has an exchange rate for Muslim pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia, a retail rate set by licensed exchange bureaus, and a rate for foreign travel and school fees, in addition to its official and black market rates. The stock market has reacted positively to the introduction of the investor window, rising 34 percent in six weeks with volumes more than doubling. The rally also partly follows MSCI's recent move to boost Nigeria's weighting on its frontier index, analysts say.  When we started intervening in the market, the question was sustainability but we will ensure the process is sustained,  Okorafor said in Lagos. The central bank last year removed a temporary peg to float the naira, but to protect its precariously low foreign reserves it introduced the convoluted exchange rate system that sees different buyers paying various rates for dollars. It has said the move is needed to eliminate frivolous demand for foreign currency. The naira was quoted at 372.70 on the investors' window on Thursday. It traded at 365 on the black market and was stuck at around 305.25 to the dollar on the official window.  Today we are gradually achieving convergence between the investor window and invisible window (FX rate for retail users),  Okorafor said.

Disabled girls often struggle to get to schools that are far from their homes, and they face a lack of accessible toilets and assistance while special devices and services are often given to boys first, Leonard Cheshire Disability said in a report.   Some families resist sending their disabled daughters to school because of fears about their safety or in a bid to protect them from sexual violence,  Ola Abu-Alghaib, head of impact at Leonard Cheshire, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.          The consequences of not getting an education can be extreme, and have a devastating effect on the ability of disabled girls to fulfill their potential, gain employment and support themselves or their families,  she said.   At least half of the world's 65 million school-age children with disabilities - most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia - are kept out of the classroom because little to no money is budgeted for their needs, disability rights groups said last October. Many charities that strive to help getting girls to school do not provide special help for disabled ones while disability programs often treat boys and girls the same, the report said. Despite obstacles to disabled girls' education, a majority of aid groups do not have projects targeting them specifically, the report said. Researchers interviewed 20 aid groups who work to promote education and found that barely one in three had specific information on girls with disabilities.  Many poor families will try to marry their daughters with disabilities as soon as possible to transfer the burden of care and be assured that someone will take care of their daughter,  Abu-Alghaib said.  This puts these girls at higher risk of ending up in abusive relationships and prevents them from accessing education,  she added.   The exclusion of children with disabilities is a major obstacle to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all by 2030, the International Disability and Development Consortium has warned.

The 2.1 million-hectare nature reserve in northern Guatemala is under threat from forest fires, drug traffickers and cattle barons, researchers said in a study. Using satellite images, researchers analyzed the severity of this year's forest fires on reserve land, comparing areas of the park where local communities have formal land rights with areas where residents lack them. Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and severity of forest fires in much of the world, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based advocacy group. Researchers say Thursday's study shows that land rights for local people in nature reserves help nations respond to the increased danger from fires.  Communities with land rights are better organized - their livelihoods are intertwined with the forests,  said Andrew Davis, a researcher with the PRISMA Foundation, the El Salvador-based think tank that produced the study. About 14,000 residents have formal rights covering 400,000 hectares of the reserve, he said. These rights allow them to use, manage and patrol reserve land, but they cannot buy or sell it. Only 1 percent of the 8,000 forest fires in the reserve tracked this year by researchers happened inside of land formally controlled by local communities, Davis said.  In the community concessions people have to follow strict guidelines to prevent fires,  Davis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that communities who formally control the land are also better able to patrol the territory to keep intruders out. Foreign observers backed the study's findings.  I have traveled through the community concessions, and I have been struck by the deep commitment of communities to conserving their forests,  Stefano Gatto, the European Union's ambassador to Guatemala, said in a statement.   By giving these communities concessions over their lands, the government has given them the reason and motivation to fight the destruction.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The IFS Rating is based on 100% ownership of Allianz Russia by Allianz SE (IFS AA/Stable), one of the world's largest insurance groups but is capped by Russia's sovereign Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-'. The rating also takes into account Allianz Russia's weak standalone capital position and operating performance. Fitch views Allianz Russia as strategically 'Important' to Allianz SE based on the agency's insurance group rating methodology. This view is supported by the track record of parent support and its strategic commitment to maintaining a direct presence in Russia. The Russian subsidiary makes a small contribution to Allianz SE's total assets and written premiums but has an important role in maintaining the franchise of the Allianz group in Russia. In 2016 Allianz Russia continued its portfolio restructuring process, completing the transfer of its voluntary health insurance portfolio to its sister company Allianz Life Insurance Company in February 2016. Allianz Russia also sold its 100% share in OJSC IC Rosno-MS to a third party and discontinued compulsory health insurance in November 2016. After the completion of this restructuring, Allianz Russia is focusing on its core business lines - commercial property and casualty, marine, aviation, transport and financial risks. According to Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model (Prism FBM), Allianz Russia scored below 'Somewhat Weak' based on 2016 results, in line with 2015's levels. Fitch does not expect a notable strengthening in capital adequacy over the next 12 months as the insurer plans to reduce capital through dividend payment. Allianz Russia focuses on regulatory solvency compliance as the key target in its capital management. The regulatory solvency margin stood at 274% at end-2016, and Allianz Russia plans to maintain regulatory solvency above 200% at end-2017 after the dividend payment that took place in June 2017. In 2016 the company's combined ratio improved to 100% from 118% in 2015 and 149% in 2014. The company managed to report an improved underwriting result of RUB3 million in 2016 after a underwriting loss of RUB1.5 billion in 2015, with the loss ratio falling to 12% from 65% in 2015 and 100% in 2014. However, the underwriting result was under pressure from an increased commission ratio of 67.8% (2015: 49.6%) which was partially offset by an increased reinsurance commission ratio of 18.5% (2015: 6.7%). In 2016 Allianz Russia reported net income of RUB2.4 billion, compared with a net loss of RUB703 million in 2015 based on IFRS accounting. The company's financial result benefited from the sale of its 100% share in OJSC IC Rosno-MS in November 2016, with the gain on disposal and the profit for the period from discontinued operations totalling RUB1.8 billion and  RUB475 million respectively. As a result, net income return on equity reached 75% in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in Russia's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR would lead to a change in Allianz Russia's IFS rating. A weakening of the parent's willingness to support the Russian subsidiary or a reduction in its strategic importance to the parent would likely result in a downgrade.

China, the world's largest steel producer, makes far more steel than it consumes, selling the excess output overseas in markets such as the United States, often undercutting domestic producers. Last week, American steel executives said a Trump administration national security review of their industry could provide relief from imports that dozens of U.S. Commerce Department anti-dumping cases have only partly offered. Steel stocks have received a boost from Donald Trump's election as president, with optimism that his administration will promote the domestic industry. The S&P; 1500 steel sector index had climbed 9.8 percent since Trump's election, while Nucor's shares had risen 15 percent.

The new computer tomography or  CT  scanner is being tested in a pilot project in single checkpoint lane at Phoenix International Airport and could be a long-term solution to avoiding additional security measures. Similar testing is expected to begin in Boston later this month, officials said. The CT scanner being tested by American Airlines Group Inc and the TSA in Phoenix is built by L3 Technologies Inc. Testing is also expected to take place with other CT scanners this year built by Analogic Corp and Integrated Defense & Security Solutions Corp. The technology is similar to what is currently used to inspect checked luggage at U.S. airports today, but traditional X-ray machines are used to inspect carry-on luggage. The CT screening equipment shoots hundreds of images with an X-ray camera that spins around the conveyor belt to provide officers with a three-dimensional picture of a carry-on bag and uses algorithms to detect explosives, firearms and other prohibited items. The devices could speed up screening by eliminating the need for repeat trips through the X-ray machine and most secondary screening, the TSA said. Flyers on domestic U.S. flights must currently remove laptops and liquids from checked luggage during screening. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials opened a two-day meeting on Thursday with European officials in Malta to discuss new security measures that could prevent the U.S. government from expanding a ban on laptops beyond flights from 10 airports primarily in the Middle East. Homeland Security chief John Kelly told a congressional panel last week he was looking at an additional 71 airports in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for a possible expansion of the ban, but said he was talking about ways it could be avoided. A European airline industry official told Reuters this week the United States had suggested possible enhancements including explosive trace detection screening, increased vetting of airports' staff and additional detection dogs. U.S. restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft.

High global inventories and doubts about OPEC's ability to implement agreed production cuts pressured oil prices. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates, as widely expected, and signaled another hike could follow this year. Its statement prompted worries for some investors that the tone was hawkish.  When you look at the economic data, it really doesn't point to an aggressive Fed. But you listen to the comments yesterday, and they’re still on the aggressive side as far as raising rates,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. In a sign that the squeeze on consumers may get tighter before long, three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise rates against five for keeping rates on hold. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7-1 vote in favor of no change. The recent selloff in tech shares, which have led sector gains so far this year, has been prompted in part by investors trying to take profits in an area that has led market gains this year and has fueled concern about stretched valuations in the overall market. The U.S. technology index was down 0.8 percent, leading a broad decline in the S&P; 500, pulled down by heavyweights including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc after bearish research comments. The tech index is down about 4 percent since Thursday's close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 43.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 21,330.99, the S&P; 500 had lost 11.44 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,426.48 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 55.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 6,139.54. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.3 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.9 percent. The dollar rose to its highest in more than two weeks as solid readings on the U.S. economy helped strengthen the case for the Fed to continue tightening. The number of Americans filing unemployment claims fell more than expected last week, suggesting slack in the labor market was shrinking, and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions for June beat expectations after a strong reading in May. The reports followed weak inflation data on Wednesday. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose to 97.557, its highest since May 30. The stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data also boosted U.S. Treasury yields, with two-year yields touching their highest in three months. But most yields remained depressed after their biggest plunge in a month Wednesday. U.S. two-year yields hit 1.368 percent, their highest in three months. Brent crude oil was down 0.3 percent to $46.87 a barrel after hitting its weakest since May 5. U.S. light crude was down 0.6 percent at $44.46.

The 2.1 million-hectare nature reserve in northern Guatemala is under threat from forest fires, drug traffickers and cattle barons, researchers said in a study. Using satellite images, researchers analyzed the severity of this year's forest fires on reserve land, comparing areas of the park where local communities have formal land rights with areas where residents lack them. Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and severity of forest fires in much of the world, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based advocacy group. Researchers say Thursday's study shows that land rights for local people in nature reserves help nations respond to the increased danger from fires.  Communities with land rights are better organized - their livelihoods are intertwined with the forests,  said Andrew Davis, a researcher with the PRISMA Foundation, the El Salvador-based think tank that produced the study. About 14,000 residents have formal rights covering 400,000 hectares of the reserve, he said. These rights allow them to use, manage and patrol reserve land, but they cannot buy or sell it. Only 1 percent of the 8,000 forest fires in the reserve tracked this year by researchers happened inside of land formally controlled by local communities, Davis said.  In the community concessions people have to follow strict guidelines to prevent fires,  Davis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that communities who formally control the land are also better able to patrol the territory to keep intruders out. Foreign observers backed the study's findings.  I have traveled through the community concessions, and I have been struck by the deep commitment of communities to conserving their forests,  Stefano Gatto, the European Union's ambassador to Guatemala, said in a statement.   By giving these communities concessions over their lands, the government has given them the reason and motivation to fight the destruction.

Struggling retailers, weak commodities stocks and ex-dividends also sent the blue-chip FTSE 100 index to its lowest level in nearly a month, down 0.74 percent. The mid-cap index fell 2.11 percent.  If one of the indices is going to find things tougher, it's likely to be the (FTSE) 250 rather than the 100,  said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. The slide in UK stocks worsened after the Bank of England said that its Monetary Policy Committee had come the closest to voting for an interest rate rise since 2007, with three of its policymakers backing an increase. The session was especially tricky for British retailers, with furniture seller DFS plummeting by more than 20 percent after a profit warning, blaming a weaker trading environment. Its shares suffered their worst day since listing. Shares in mid-cap peer Howden Joinery nursed a 5.1 percent loss, while smaller ScS tumbled 8.1 percent. The FTSE 350 general retailers index was down 3.9 percent.  DFS believes that (like-for-like) sales could recover. However, we take a more cautious view given rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty,  Jefferies analysts said in a note, downgrading DFS to  hold . A sharp fall in retail sales in May showed that British retailers are facing a tough time as a jump in inflation and low wage growth puts pressure on consumers, with a hung parliament after the UK general election adding to political uncertainty. Weakness in retail was also evidenced in the United States in the previous session, when figures showed that U.S. consumer prices fell unexpectedly in May. Aside from falls in Persimmon and other stocks trading ex-dividend, shares in clothes retailer Next slid by 6.1 percent after Credit Suisse cut its rating to  underperform , pointing to weak pricing across Europe for the wider sector.  With earnings, margins and cash conversion continuing to fall, we regard Next as a value trap,  Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Falls in mining companies also weighed, as the price of copper fell, set back by strength in the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The sector came further under pressure after South Africa raised the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies. Anglo American, which is headquartered in both London and Johannesburg, fell 6 percent.

In two decisions this week, U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in Portland, Oregon said Skechers did not willfully infringe two Adidas patents by selling its less expensive  Mega Blade  sneakers, and denied Adidas' request for a preliminary injunction to halt sales. The decisions are a blow to Adidas, which like some rivals often turns to U.S. courts to stop rivals from selling products it considers knockoffs. In its lawsuit last July, the German company said Skechers copied  leaf spring  elements of its Springblade midsole, meant to propel runners forward and improve performance. It said this enabled Skechers to get a free ride on its technology without the development costs, and harmed Adidas' reputation and market share by cutting into Springblade's pricing power,  coolness  and  cachet.  Adidas had launched Springblade in 2013, at $180 a pair. Simon, however, found no willful infringement because Skechers began selling Mega Blade sneakers one year before the Adidas patents were issued in May 2016. The judge also said an injunction was inappropriate because Adidas did not show it faced irreparable harm without one, or that it was likely to win the case.  Adidas's evidence of irreparable injury is too conclusory and speculative,  and the company  fails to make a persuasive showing that the Mega Blade shoe has had an appreciable adverse effect on the Springblade shoe,  Simon wrote. Both decisions are dated Monday, and the decision on the preliminary injunction was made public on Wednesday. The judge put the case on hold so the U.S. Patent and Trial Appeals Board could consider related issues. Adidas and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Michael Greenberg, Skechers' president, said the Manhattan Beach, California-based company was pleased with the decisions.  Skechers respects the intellectual property rights of other companies and has invested tremendous resources into building a brand identity by developing its own distinctive designs, not by copying others,  Greenberg said in a statement. Adidas has also sued Skechers for having allegedly copied the design for its classic white Stan Smith tennis sneakers. A trial is scheduled for April 2018, court records show.

Trading below $1.27 before the BoE's decision, the pound leapt by a full cent to $1.2795 after it emerged that Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders had voted with existing policy hawk Kristin Forbes for higher borrowing costs. At a time when the BoE has blamed a rise in inflation past its 2 percent target on a weak pound, traders read the split vote as warning that officials could seek to defend the currency with rhetoric or action even as the economy overall slows. It was also just the latest surprise in a week which has seen the pound slump after British Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an early election.  There is a clear emphasis on the risk of a sustained inflation overshoot and the Bank of England probably does not want to be seen as being dismissive of such concerns,  UBS Wealth Management's Head of the UK Investment Office, Geoffrey Yu, said. Short sterling contracts for December of this year moved 6 basis points, raising the likelihood attached to a rise in the bank's main interest rates before the end of 2017 to about 30 percent. <0#FSS:> Two-year gilt yields hit their highest since May 10 as prices tumbled, and the euro zone's benchmark German 10-year bond yield also hit a day's high of 0.265 percent. But the implications for growth and company profits in an economy already slowing sharply were evident in a slump for both Britain's main FTSE 100 index and more domestically focused mid-caps.  The internationally focussed FTSE 100, which has tended to rise as the pound falls in the past year, hit a session low of 1.1 percent. Mid-caps saw their sharpest one-day fall in nearly a year, down 1.9 percent. Risks Upsetting London's stock market, already facing a slowing domestic economy, Brexit talks due to start next week and months of political uncertainty around a new minority government, is one risk the BoE would be taking by raising rates.  Dominated by companies whose revenues come from abroad, the blue-chip index has benefited from the pound's fall in the past year. Reversing that might hurt.  Equally, for a country with one of the highest household debt burdens in the world, a rate rise would risk triggering falls in housing prices that might leave millions of people with negative equity on long-term mortgages.   From what they have said in the statement today, it does appear that they seem quite concerned about the weakness of the pound,  MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said.  But I'm not sure that the market buys that they are going to follow through, given the recent weakness of the activity data on the economy and the uncertainty generated by the election,  he said. A number of analysts emphasised that the vote may be chiefly a way of the BoE supporting the pound without actually changing policy conditions, noting also that Forbes is due to leave at the end of the month.  With the economic outlook still challenging, wage growth will likely remain weak which should act as a drag on longer term inflation once the currency impact passes,  Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.

The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F2'. The affirmation reflects Fitch's expectation that the recent modest increase in PSP's net debt/EBITDA will reverse as new investments and refurbishments start to generate yield. PSP's strong balance sheet, low CHF funding costs, recurring rental income from a portfolio of prime, unencumbered, commercial properties, good tenant profile and exposure to the strong Swiss economy. Fitch expects the group to maintain a strong financial profile despite prevailing weak rental demand for Swiss commercial properties. We view as credit-positive management's strategies of focusing acquisitions on renovation and modernisation in a yield-compressed environment and of abstaining from leveraging the balance sheet on valuation gains. KEY RATING DRIVERS Challenging Rental Markets: Fitch expects Swiss office rents (62% of total rents in 2016) to remain subdued in 2017. Supply continues to outstrip demand, especially in peripheral regions and Geneva. However, PSP's portfolio primarily comprises high-quality properties in prime locations that are generally more resilient and PSP has a track record of exceeding Fitch's estimates. Rents in the Swiss retail sector (17% of total rents in 2016) are also under pressure from growing online shopping and shopping tourism abroad that are exacerbated by a strong Swiss franc. Strategic Acquisition: Leverage increased slightly in 2016 after the CHF145 million acquisition of a property in Zurich West. The acquisition is in line with PSP's long-term investment strategy to grow its footprint in the area. PSP's prudent acquisition strategy, focusing on yield increase through renovation and modernisation helps support the ratings. Growing Development Activities: PSP's committed development exposure was moderate at CHF46 million (less than 1% of investment portfolio) at end-1Q17, although the potential programme amounts to CHF484 million until 2022 (less than 10% of investment portfolio). This is well below our rating guidance of 15%. Fitch expects total development capex to grow to more than CHF130 million in 2018 from CHF110 million in 2016. As a result, we expect net debt/EBITDA to peak at 9.7x in 2018, slightly above our guidance of 9.5x, and to reduce thereafter to a level commensurate with the ratings, driven by new leases after completion of these projects. Unabated Investor Demand: Strong valuations for prime commercial property in Switzerland support PSP's financial flexibility. PSP can dispose of assets at healthy multiples, or use its additional debt-raising capacity to support its investment programme. The current low interest rate environment and strengthening Swiss economy attract capital into prime commercial properties in Switzerland (AAA/Stable). We expect yields on PSP's assets to remain low. Uncertainties from ongoing immigration reform, growing unemployment and weaker retail sales in Switzerland may hamper the Swiss commercial rent market in the medium term. 'A'-category LTV: Fitch expects loan-to-value ratio (LTV; net debt/portfolio value excluding development property) to remain commensurate with PSP's ratings, as it comfortably maps to the 'A' category in our Ratings Navigator for EMEA real estate and property companies. Fitch forecasts LTV to remain stable despite the group's development programme, partially mitigated by disposals. Strong Debt Serviceability: PSP's low funding cost support the ratings. EBITDA net interest cover increased to 7.9x in 2016 from 6.7x in 2015. This is comfortably above our downgrade guideline of 2.5x. We expect debt serviceability to remain strong, as all-in costs of new bonds were only 0.3% in 2016. Senior Unsecured Uplift: PSP's senior unsecured rating benefits from a one-notch uplift to the IDR, as the majority of PSP's portfolio comprises investment properties in Switzerland, which is an established market with depth, transparency and liquidity, even in poor market conditions. Its properties are also standalone assets that are valued on a regular basis and fulfil all criteria for a senior unsecured uplift according to Fitch's Recovery Ratings and Nothing Criteria for Equity REITs. Limited Geographic Diversification: The ratings are constrained by the group's focus on Swiss properties and the size of the Swiss property market, which is small by European standards. The ratings also incorporate a fairly short-term lease structure in Switzerland, which is usually five years plus a tenant extension option for another five years compared with seven-to-eight years for offices in the UK. This is partially mitigated by the group's high-quality tenants, moderate tenant concentration and high tenant industry diversification. DERIVATION SUMMARY PSP's rating is underpinned by a strong financial profile and a high-quality office property portfolio. Its concentrated portfolio provides less diversification than higher-rated Unibail-Rodamco SE (A/Stable), and similarly rated Segro PLC (BBB+/Stable). PSP rent levels have remained nearly flat, compared with continued like-for-like rental growth for both Unibail and Segro; Rental dynamics in its markets are less favourable. PSP's good access to capital markets and low funding costs support a very strong interest cover ratio. This is partly offset by a shorter debt maturity profile and shorter lease duration than similarly rated peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 2% rent reduction on lease renewals due to oversupply in key office and retail markets. -  Moderate capex, net of disposals, to peak in 2018 and to average around CHF50 million thereafter. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Material diversification of portfolio geographically or by sector, accompanied by financial metrics being maintained, notably LTV below 40% through the cycle. This would lead to an upgrade. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - An increase in rent arrears, tenant defaults, resulting in EBITDA net interest cover falling below 2.5x. - Material committed development spending rising above 15% of the portfolio (2016: less than 1%). - LTV above 40% (2016: 34%) and net debt-to-EBITDA above 9.5x (2016: 9.4x) on a sustained basis LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity: PSP's liquidity is comfortable, comprising CHF670 million of undrawn credit facilities and CHF21 million in cash at end-2016, compared with no maturing debt in the next two years and limited committed capex. In addition, the group will have access to CHF100 million in cash deposits that will become available in 2018. PSP has had unimpaired access to both local Swiss banks and the bond market throughout the financial crisis, which Fitch expects will continue.

The Russian government has been looking for ways to cut a budget deficit that is persisting because of low prices for oil and gas, both key sources of revenue for state coffers. On Thursday, the government studied proposed changes to the tax code, which envisaged an increase in both extraction and excise taxes for oil and gas producers. It decided to raise the MET for Gazprom from the fourth quarter and a finance ministry source said that change alone would bring in an additional 30 billion roubles this year. Besides the Gazprom increase, the government discussed extending an increase in the MET for oil producers announced in the 2017 budget through to 2020 instead of 2019. It also looked at increasing excise taxes in line with inflation in 2020. It was not immediately clear whether those proposals had been approved in the meeting.  We count on the changes to bring an additional 30 billion roubles in 2017 and around 380 billion roubles in 2020 to the budgets of all levels,  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. Gazprom has been singled out as it has a monopoly on the Russian gas pipeline system and is the country's sole gas pipeline exporter. The MET for Gazprom will, however, be lowered in 2019 and 2020, according to the draft changes to the tax law. Russia initial targeted a 2017 budget deficit of 3.2 percent of gross domestic product but it lowered the planned annual shortfall to 2.1 percent in May saying it now expected higher revenues.

Trading below $1.27 before the BoE's decision, the pound leapt by a full cent to $1.2795 after it emerged that Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders had voted with existing policy hawk Kristin Forbes for higher borrowing costs. At a time when the BoE has blamed a rise in inflation past its 2 percent target on a weak pound, traders read the split vote as warning that officials could seek to defend the currency with rhetoric or action even as the economy overall slows. It was also just the latest surprise in a week which has seen the pound slump after British Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an early election.  There is a clear emphasis on the risk of a sustained inflation overshoot and the Bank of England probably does not want to be seen as being dismissive of such concerns,  UBS Wealth Management's Head of the UK Investment Office, Geoffrey Yu, said. Short sterling contracts for December of this year moved 6 basis points, raising the likelihood attached to a rise in the bank's main interest rates before the end of 2017 to about 30 percent. <0#FSS:> Two-year gilt yields hit their highest since May 10 as prices tumbled, and the euro zone's benchmark German 10-year bond yield also hit a day's high of 0.265 percent. But the implications for growth and company profits in an economy already slowing sharply were evident in a slump for both Britain's main FTSE 100 index and more domestically focused mid-caps.  The internationally focussed FTSE 100, which has tended to rise as the pound falls in the past year, hit a session low of 1.1 percent. Mid-caps saw their sharpest one-day fall in nearly a year, down 1.9 percent. Risks Upsetting London's stock market, already facing a slowing domestic economy, Brexit talks due to start next week and months of political uncertainty around a new minority government, is one risk the BoE would be taking by raising rates.  Dominated by companies whose revenues come from abroad, the blue-chip index has benefited from the pound's fall in the past year. Reversing that might hurt.  Equally, for a country with one of the highest household debt burdens in the world, a rate rise would risk triggering falls in housing prices that might leave millions of people with negative equity on long-term mortgages.   From what they have said in the statement today, it does appear that they seem quite concerned about the weakness of the pound,  MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said.  But I'm not sure that the market buys that they are going to follow through, given the recent weakness of the activity data on the economy and the uncertainty generated by the election,  he said. A number of analysts emphasised that the vote may be chiefly a way of the BoE supporting the pound without actually changing policy conditions, noting also that Forbes is due to leave at the end of the month.  With the economic outlook still challenging, wage growth will likely remain weak which should act as a drag on longer term inflation once the currency impact passes,  Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.

Inflation could remain sluggish for a while as other data on Thursday showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in 15 months in May. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second time this year amid expectations of moderate economic growth and further strengthening in the labor market.  Labor is scarce and separations are low as companies try and hang onto skilled labor,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  At present, it appears the labor market data rather than the inflation data are in the driving seat for data-dependent Fed policy.  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday, better then economists' expectations for a decline to 242,000.  Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 119 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. While monthly job growth has slowed, record high job openings suggest that is likely because companies cannot find qualified workers. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 6,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended June 3.  The so-called continuing claims have now been below 2 million for nine straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack. The upbeat labor market data helped to lift the dollar against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, led by  technology shares amid worries over stretched valuations. Mixed Factory Data In another report, the Labor Department said import prices declined 0.3 percent last month as the cost of imported petroleum products tumbled. That was the biggest drop since February 2016 and followed a 0.2 percent increase in April. In the 12 months through May, import prices rose 2.1 percent, the smallest gain since last December. Import prices rose 3.6 percent year-on-year in April. The slowdown in import prices suggests domestic inflation could remain soft for a while. Consumer inflation measures have slowed in recent months, retreating below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.  The Fed on Wednesday acknowledged the ebb in price pressures and said it expected annual inflation rates to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the target over the medium term.  In May, import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after increasing 0.3 percent in April. They increased 1.0 percent in the 12 months through May.  Not enough to stir up inflation pressures,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production fell 0.4 percent last month, weighed down by a 2.0 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly. With auto sales slowing and inventories bloated, motor vehicle production could remain a drag on factory output for a while. Manufacturing output jumped 1.1 percent in April. It rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months to May, pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. That was supported by a survey from the New York Fed showing its Empire State current business conditions index surged 21 points to 19.8 in June, the highest reading since September 2014. While another survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed a measure of business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 27.6 this month from 38.8 in May, unfilled orders and delivery times increased.  This gives us some comfort that any deterioration in the manufacturing sector is not going to be especially severe,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Mixed Factory Data In another report, the Labor Department said import prices declined 0.3 percent last month as the cost of imported petroleum products tumbled. That was the biggest drop since February 2016 and followed a 0.2 percent increase in April. In the 12 months through May, import prices rose 2.1 percent, the smallest gain since last December. Import prices rose 3.6 percent year-on-year in April. The slowdown in import prices suggests domestic inflation could remain soft for a while. Consumer inflation measures have slowed in recent months, retreating below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.  The Fed on Wednesday acknowledged the ebb in price pressures and said it expected annual inflation rates to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the target over the medium term.  In May, import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after increasing 0.3 percent in April. They increased 1.0 percent in the 12 months through May.  Not enough to stir up inflation pressures,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production fell 0.4 percent last month, weighed down by a 2.0 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly. With auto sales slowing and inventories bloated, motor vehicle production could remain a drag on factory output for a while. Manufacturing output jumped 1.1 percent in April. It rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months to May, pointing to underlying strength in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. That was supported by a survey from the New York Fed showing its Empire State current business conditions index surged 21 points to 19.8 in June, the highest reading since September 2014. While another survey from the Philadelphia Fed showed a measure of business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a reading of 27.6 this month from 38.8 in May, unfilled orders and delivery times increased.  This gives us some comfort that any deterioration in the manufacturing sector is not going to be especially severe,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

In a large sample of women treated at a rape clinic in Stockholm, about 70 percent reported an inability to move or resist during the assault. “Victims tend to blame themselves for not resisting, so the fact that 7 out of 10 have paralysis is useful to know,” said lead study author Dr. Anna Moller of Stockholm South General Hospital and the Karolinska Institute.  In animals, this reaction, known as tonic immobility is an evolutionary defensive response to a predatory attack, Moller’s team writes in the journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.  Past studies indicate that humans can similarly feel paralyzed when under attack or in other life-threatening circumstances, experiencing temporary, involuntary immobility that may also involve a dissociated, catatonic-like mental state. “In court situations, a lot of focus is given to whether the victim consented to the intercourse or not,” Moller told Reuters Health by email. “This paralysis and passiveness should not be considered consent.” Moller and colleagues surveyed 298 women who visited the Emergency Clinic for Raped Women in Stockholm within one month of a sexual assault. The clinic offers free services and sees about 600 patients per year. The researchers interviewed participants using a questionnaire called the Tonic Immobility Scale, which asks about feeling frozen or paralyzed, the inability to move although not restrained, the inability to call out or shout, numbness, feeling cold and feeling detached from one’s self.  After six months, the research team also assessed 189 of those women for PTSD and depression. They found that 70 percent of women reported significant tonic immobility and 48 percent reported extreme tonic immobility during their assaults. Having had this experience more than doubled the likelihood of PTSD at the six-month follow up and raised the likelihood of severe depression by nearly four-fold. Of the 189 women who completed the six-month assessment, more than half of those who experienced tonic immobility during their assault had developed PTSD, compared to 28 percent who didn't. Similarly, 34 percent of those who experienced tonic immobility were severely depressed, compared to 14 percent of those who didn't.  The research team also found that women with a history of sexual assault - in childhood or adulthood - were twice as likely as others to have experienced tonic immobility during the recent rape. Women whose rape was part of a “more severe assault,” involving physical violence or multiple attackers, for example, were also twice as likely to have experienced tonic immobility during the attack. One limitation of the study is that the emergency clinic only saw female patients at the time of the interviews. Moller’s team would also like to include larger, more diverse samples in several geographic locations to better understand tonic immobility generally, she said. Future studies should also include levels of victim resistance, said Jennifer Wong of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, who wasn’t involved in the research.  “A victim may have felt frozen, detached or numb during some of the assault but may have initially verbally or physically resisted her attacker,” Wong said. Tonic immobility research could provide major implications for court cases and the psycho-education of rape victims, Moller said. “Don’t blame rape victims for not resisting,” she said. “It’s a normal biological reaction when exposed to an extreme threat.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2rIM4zI Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, online June 7, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-rape-tonic-immobility-idUSKBN19626W"},

In two decisions this week, U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in Portland, Oregon said Skechers did not willfully infringe two Adidas patents by selling its less expensive  Mega Blade  sneakers, and denied Adidas' request for a preliminary injunction to halt sales. The decisions are a blow to Adidas, which like some rivals often turns to U.S. courts to stop rivals from selling products it considers knockoffs. In its lawsuit last July, the German company said Skechers copied  leaf spring  elements of its Springblade midsole, meant to propel runners forward and improve performance. It said this enabled Skechers to get a free ride on its technology without the development costs, and harmed Adidas' reputation and market share by cutting into Springblade's pricing power,  coolness  and  cachet.  Adidas had launched Springblade in 2013, at $180 a pair. Simon, however, found no willful infringement because Skechers began selling Mega Blade sneakers one year before the Adidas patents were issued in May 2016. The judge also said an injunction was inappropriate because Adidas did not show it faced irreparable harm without one, or that it was likely to win the case.  Adidas's evidence of irreparable injury is too conclusory and speculative,  and the company  fails to make a persuasive showing that the Mega Blade shoe has had an appreciable adverse effect on the Springblade shoe,  Simon wrote. Both decisions are dated Monday, and the decision on the preliminary injunction was made public on Wednesday. The judge put the case on hold so the U.S. Patent and Trial Appeals Board could consider related issues. Adidas and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Michael Greenberg, Skechers' president, said the Manhattan Beach, California-based company was pleased with the decisions.  Skechers respects the intellectual property rights of other companies and has invested tremendous resources into building a brand identity by developing its own distinctive designs, not by copying others,  Greenberg said in a statement. Adidas has also sued Skechers for having allegedly copied the design for its classic white Stan Smith tennis sneakers. A trial is scheduled for April 2018, court records show. The case is Adidas America Inc et al v Skechers USA Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, No. 16-01400.

Releasing the details of a revised mining charter, Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane gave resource companies 12 months to raise the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent. Analysts said the revised charter would further tarnish the country's credentials as an investor-friendly emerging market, while the changes also drew opposition from the industry lobby group. The Chamber of Mines said it would challenge the new rules in court, arguing that there had been insufficient consultation in drawing up the charter - which is designed to widen ownership of the South African economy. The mining index ended down 3 percent to a level last seen in April 2016.  A lot of the pressure we're seeing in the resource stocks alongside some weakness in the currency is coming on the back of this revised mining charter and what effectively it's going to mean for fixed investments going forward,  said BNP Paribas Cadiz Securities economist Jeffrey Schultz. Implementing the charter would be a significant blow to an industry that is already struggling, Schultz said. Diversified mining company Sibanye Gold dropped 3.5 percent to 16.15 rand, AngloGold Ashanti declined 6.08 percent to 138.31 rand and Anglo American Platinum fell 7.18 percent to 281.31 rand by 1244 GMT. The benchmark Top-40 index was down 1.3 percent and the broader All-share index fell by the same margin. Rising interest rates in the U.S. coupled with the release of the mining charter saw investors selling the rand, which weakened 1.96 percent to 12.86 against the dollar. The Federal Reserve raised lending rates by 25 basis points, weakening demand for emerging-market currencies that had seen large flows as a global hunt for yield persisted. South African bonds were also weaker, with the yield on the benchmark 2026 government bond up 8 basis points to 8.485 percent.

With the rate of inflation at its highest in four years and showing no sign of reversing, the Bank's eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-3 to keep rates on hold at a record low 0.25 percent. Economists had expected a 7-1 split. But the pound's boost faded, exposing the Bank's delicate balancing act: trying to shore up the currency without delivering the policy tightening that could damage an economy already slowing amid the deep uncertainty of Brexit. It's a dangerous balancing act, too, one that could put the Bank's credibility in the eyes of financial markets on the line. As the Bank itself knows only too well, once it's lost, it's extremely hard to recover. And the currency suffers. Turkey's central bank jacked up rates by more than 400 basis points, or four percentage points, in January 2014 to prevent the sliding lira from sparking massive inflation. Later that year, Russia's central bank more than doubled interest rates to 17 percent. It's not only an emerging market phenomenon, either. The Bank of England famously raised interest rates to 12 percent on 16 September, 1992 -  Black Wednesday  - and spent billions of dollars of its foreign exchange reserves in a doomed attempt to defend the pound from attack. The Bank is in a bind. Economic growth is slowing, and all the incoming data show no sign of it picking up speed any time soon. Figures released just before the Bank announced its decision on Thursday showed that retail sales in May fell sharply. On Wednesday, data showed that wage growth in February-April was much weaker than expected at 2.1 percent, while inflation in May jumped to a four-year high of 2.9 percent. This means real earnings are falling at the fastest pace in three years, throwing grit in one of the economy's most powerful growth engines: consumer spending. British growth in the first quarter was the slowest of all 28 European Union nations, according to Eurostat. And if the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is right, the 1 percent growth penciled in for next year will be the lowest of all 32 nations covered in its latest outlook. Against the hugely uncertain backdrop for investment and spending stemming from Brexit, Britain's soft economic indicators point to the Bank sticking with its ultra-loose policy and sterling remaining under pressure. All bar one: inflation. The pound's 13 percent devaluation since last year's Brexit referendum has fueled the surge in inflation, and there's little sign of it reversing much any time soon. It's decimating real wage growth, eating into consumer spending and weighing on the economy at large. The growth outlook is darkening, and as Thursday's vote showed, the Bank finds itself in an increasingly tight spot. If it threatens to raise rates, sterling could steady or even rise in value, thereby easing the upward pressure on inflation. The erosion of real earnings would stop, potentially providing a springboard for a rebound in consumer spending. This would be the ideal scenario for the Bank. But it only works as long as the $5 trillion-a-day currency market believes that, if the push comes to the shove, the Bank will raise rates. If not, sterling will likely come under immediate and sustained attack. A fall towards $1.20 would be more on the cards than a test of $1.30 again. In that scenario, with inflation already nudging 3 percent, the Bank's current dilemma will seem like a picnic in comparison.

Fitch has also affirmed the unsecured rating of Batelco International Finance No. 1 Limited at 'BB+'. This rating action follows Fitch's revision of the Outlook on the sovereign rating of Bahrain to Negative from Stable and the affirmation of its Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BB+' on 12 June 2017 (see 'Fitch Revises Bahrain's Outlook to Negative, Affirms IDR 'BB+' at www.fitchratings.com). KEY RATING DRIVERS Linkage to the Sovereign: Batelco's current rating does not benefit from any uplift for government support, as the company's 'BB+' standalone rating is at the same level as the sovereign. Batelco as a state-owned entity is highly unlikely to be rated higher than the sovereign, therefore any negative rating action for the sovereign would impact Batelco's rating negatively. Batelco could benefit from a one-notch uplift from sovereign support if the sovereign rating is higher than Batelco's standalone rating. An upgrade of the sovereign rating could result in an upgrade for Batelco, provided there is continued support from the government of Bahrain. Batelco is 78% directly and indirectly owned by the government of Bahrain, and is represented by six out of 10 directors on Batelco's board. Leverage Remains Low: Despite group revenue and EBITDA coming under pressure in 2016 and 1Q17, Fitch's views Batelco's financial profile as satisfactory, underpinned by our expectation of a conservative leverage profile (funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage around 1.5x-2.0x over the next three years), good pre-dividend cash flow generation and a sound liquidity profile over the medium term. Domestic Market Key: Batelco is facing intense competition in its domestic market (which accounted for 48% of the group's 2016 EBITDA), especially in mobile. Pursuing a convergence strategy, focused on a high-quality fixed and mobile infrastructure should allow Batelco to retain its strong market share in the mid-to-high value consumer segment as well as in the business segment. International Diversification: Batelco's largest international operations are in the Maldives, Jordan and the Channel Islands. The Maldives and the Channels Islands are performing in line with Fitch's expectations and underlying EBITDA should remain stable over the next three years. Jordan (around 20% of Batelco's consolidated revenue) is a greater challenge due to its weak macroeconomic trends and higher execution risks as Batelco invests in network expansion. Overall, Batelco has the financial flexibility to support its investment in Jordan, which is reflected in the ratings. DERIVATION SUMMARY Batelco's standalone rating is 'BB+', reflecting the company's improving domestic position, low leverage as well as risks in its international operations. We do not envisage Batelco being rated above the sovereign, especially given the government's significant shareholding in the company. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Our assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: -Revenue growth of 1%-1.5% per annum in 2017-2019; -EBITDA margin largely stable at 36%-37% in 2017-2019; -Capex (excluding spectrum) averaging around 15%-20% of revenue in 2017-2019; -Annual dividend payments rising in line with EBITDA. RATING SENSITIVITIES Batelco Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Pressure on free cash flow (FCF) driven by EBITDA margin erosion, consistently higher capex and shareholder distributions, or significant underperformance in the core domestic market and at other key subsidiaries. -Debt-funded acquisitions leading to an increase in FFO net leverage above 3.5x (1.6x at end-2016) with failure to deleverage below such threshold within the next 18 months. -A weakening in the linkage with the sovereign, which would be a negative credit factor, as would any possibility of the sovereign rating being downgraded from 'BB+'. Batelco as a state-owned entity is highly unlikely to be rated higher than the sovereign. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - An upgrade of the sovereign rating, or a change of Outlook to Positive, with continued support from the government of Bahrain, without a weakening in the linkage with the sovereign. Bahrain sovereign Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Failure to shrink the fiscal deficit and set out a clear path towards stabilising the government debt-to-GDP ratio. - Severe deterioration of the domestic security environment. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A narrowing of the budget deficit consistent with a decline of the government debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term. - A broadly accepted political solution to domestic political tensions.

Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

In two decisions this week, U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in Portland, Oregon said Skechers did not willfully infringe two Adidas patents by selling its less expensive  Mega Blade  sneakers, and denied Adidas' request for a preliminary injunction to halt sales. The decisions are a blow to Adidas, which like some rivals often turns to U.S. courts to stop rivals from selling products it considers knockoffs. In its lawsuit last July, the German company said Skechers copied  leaf spring  elements of its Springblade midsole, meant to propel runners forward and improve performance. It said this enabled Skechers to get a free ride on its technology without the development costs, and harmed Adidas' reputation and market share by cutting into Springblade's pricing power,  coolness  and  cachet.  Adidas had launched Springblade in 2013, at $180 a pair. Simon, however, found no willful infringement because Skechers began selling Mega Blade sneakers one year before the Adidas patents were issued in May 2016. The judge also said an injunction was inappropriate because Adidas did not show it faced irreparable harm without one, or that it was likely to win the case.  Adidas's evidence of irreparable injury is too conclusory and speculative,  and the company  fails to make a persuasive showing that the Mega Blade shoe has had an appreciable adverse effect on the Springblade shoe,  Simon wrote. Both decisions are dated Monday, and the decision on the preliminary injunction was made public on Wednesday. The judge put the case on hold so the U.S. Patent and Trial Appeals Board could consider related issues. Adidas and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Michael Greenberg, Skechers' president, said the Manhattan Beach, California-based company was pleased with the decisions.  Skechers respects the intellectual property rights of other companies and has invested tremendous resources into building a brand identity by developing its own distinctive designs, not by copying others,  Greenberg said in a statement. Adidas has also sued Skechers for having allegedly copied the design for its classic white Stan Smith tennis sneakers. A trial is scheduled for April 2018, court records show. The case is Adidas America Inc et al v Skechers USA Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, No. 16-01400.

Turkey has taken in some 3 million Syrian migrants since the start of civil war in 2011, making it home to the world's largest refugee population.  Now Ankara is giving Syrian refugees the right to return to Turkey within a month if they want to go home to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr holiday.     Some said they wanted to start again in their homeland, and would return within the month if it did not work out, while others said they wanted to return to Syria for good, citing the difficulty of finding employment in Turkey.  One day you can find a job, the other day you can't,  said Sevsen Um Mustafa as she walked toward the border crossing with two daughters in tow.  Sometimes they make you work but they don't pay. Even if they do, it's not enough.   Even smelling the soil of Aleppo is better than here,  said the former Aleppo resident.  I'd rather die there because of war than here because of starvation.  The majority of Syrian refugees in Turkey live outside the government-built camps and struggle to make ends meet as the cost of food, rent and clothing usually exceeds their incomes. The government, which tightened its border security after a 2016 deal with the European Union to stem illegal migration, estimates it has spent some $25 billion on housing the refugees. Border Crossing Syrians, who say they are returning to Syria ahead of the Eid al-Fitr, carry their belongings as they walk to the Turkish Cilvegozu border gate, located opposite of Syrian crossing point Bab al-Hawa in Reyhanli, in the Hatay province, Turkey, June 15, 2017.Umit BektasAuthorities did not give any figures on how many Syrians have returned so far. A Reuters witness said at least 3,000 people crossed on foot through the dusty Cilvegozu border crossing into Syria during several hours on Thursday.  Ankara introduced work permits for Syrians in 2016 but many, like 22-year-old Muhammed Ali, said opportunities are scarce.  Even if I worked for the whole month, I'd have 200-300 liras ($57-$85) left over after paying the rent,  said Ali, who was heading back to his hometown of Afrin, in northwest Syria after four years of working as a textile laborer in Istanbul. Slideshow (5 Images) I had no rights of leave, no insurance. I was miserable.  The offer to return applies to Syrian nationals with valid travel documents who cross through the Cilvegozu and Oncupinar border gates, authorities said. The Eid al-Fitr holiday begins on June 25. Those who wish to return can do so until July 14. Anyone who comes back after that will be treated as new arrival and subject to the regular immigration process, a local official at the Hatay governor's office said.  Facing criticism from Western allies that it was too slow to stop the flow jihadis from Syria, Turkey has fortified its 900 km (560 miles) border with fences, minefields, ditches and a wall. In August 2016 it launched a military campaign in Syria and drove Islamic State militants from its border. Authorities say thousands of Syrians have since returned to Syrian towns freed from Islamic State. Still, Turkey's biggest cities and border provinces still host hundreds of thousands of refugees. Images from Turkey's state-run broadcaster TRT also showed hundreds of refugees waiting near Oncupinar border crossing in the southeastern Turkish province of Kilis.

State investment bank NI Capital expects to offer shares in ENPPI before the end of this year, the bank's Chief Executive Officer Ashraf Ghazaly told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. NI Capital expects to raise between $100-150 million from the ENPPI sale, Ghazaly said.  Our target is for ENPPI to be ready for offering on Egypt's bourse before the end of this year,  he said. Privately managed NI Capital is part of the country's National Investment Bank and acts as a consulting authority for the government and manages government investment funds. The government's IPO programme, which will take place over three to five years, will include dozens of state-owned companies. Ghazaly said these would include companies from the petroleum, services, chemicals, shipping, maritime and real estate sectors. IPOs managed by NI Capital will offer no more than 24 percent of the shares of the state-owned companies, he said. Egypt expects to raise 5-7 billion Egyptian pounds ($276-$387 million) through state-owned company IPOs during the 2017-2018 fiscal year beginning in July, deputy finance minister Ahmed Kouchouk told Reuters last month. The state owns vast swathes of the economy, including at least three of the country's largest banks along with much of its oil industry and also big chunks of real estate. Egypt's economy has been struggling to recover since a popular uprising in 2011 drove foreign investors and tourists away, but the government hopes a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending programme signed at the end of last year will put it on the road to recovery.  I'm convinced that the current time is suitable for IPOs to gain investors' confidence in the Egyptian market. The Central Bank's decision to cancel caps on foreign transactions will increase that confidence and help us attract more foreign investors,  Ghazaly said. Egypt's central bank on Wednesday removed limits on international currency transfers, scrapping a $100,000 monthly limit on individual bank transactions in a long-awaited reform intended to attract badly needed foreign investment. The last time state-owned companies were listed on the exchange was in 2005 when shares were floated in Telecom Egypt and oil companies Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals and AMOC.

The Phoenix financial planner brought his 5-year-old orange tabbies Frankie and Scotch in for bathing, clipping and shaving, which cost $150. But then the payment system asked whether he wanted to tack on a healthy tip: Either 20, 25 or 30 percent.  Ridiculous,  says Koury, 36, who says it was not explained to him why he needed to tip, or whom. He was so irked, in fact, that he ended up giving no tip at all. Traditionally, many consumers have rewarded tip-worthy service when the spirit moves them, and within a certain range: 10 percent is on the low side, 15 is fairly standard, and 20 is seen as generous. But with the advent of pre-calculated tipping options, and apps like Square that allow businesses to customize payment screens, consumers are prompted for tips in unfamiliar circumstances. Options in the 20-25-30 percent range pop up with increasing frequency. Welcome to the phenomenon of  tip inflation.  Recent data from Square, a popular mobile payments app led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, reveals that tip encouragement seems to be working: The average tip for taxis last year was 16.54 percent, in the food and beverage sector it was 17.05 percent, and in salons it was 18.55 percent. In a previous analysis, Square users reported that from 2013 to 2014, customers tipped 35 percent more frequently. It should be noted that Square's default settings for amounts over $10 are  No tip, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent.  So if you are seeing tip options of 20, 25 and 30 percent, that has been customized by the business owner.  Don't fall for it!  says New York financial planner David Mendels.  Twenty percent is a generous tip, and if I don't give more than that, it doesn't make me a miser. If they suggest more, it makes them greedy and unprofessional. That is reason enough to knock it down to 15 percent.  The bottom line: Business owners have every right to ask for whatever tip they deem appropriate. And you, in turn, have every right to say  No.   Would you voluntarily pay a higher amount for anything just because you were given the option to do so?  asks Edward Vargo, a financial adviser in Westlake, Ohio.  I would simply ignore anything above 20 percent, unless you feel you have received really exceptional service.  When ultra-generous tip options are waved in customers' faces, it can feel very much like  tip shaming.  Rather than appearing miserly to the service employee, people often just tap one of the available options and swallow the additional cost. So how can consumers make a snap decision that is appropriate for them? It may seem like a straightforward transaction, but there are actually many factors packed into that one decision, advises etiquette expert Diane Gottsman, author of  Modern Etiquette for a Better Life  and founder of the Protocol School of Texas. What can you afford? Was the service above-and-beyond in any way? And is the service professional largely dependent on those tips for their income?  You decide what you tip, and you should not feel pressured by the app,  says Gottsman.  So go with your feelings, but please tip fairly.  And if you are feeling guilty about not agreeing to a lavish tip? Financial planner Vargo has some simple advice:  Get over it.

Morgan Chase & Co employee filed a federal sex discrimination complaint on Thursday accusing the bank of discriminating against fathers by giving them paid parental leave on different terms than mothers based on a stereotype that women should care for children. Derek Rotondo said in his complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that J.P. Morgan gives mothers 16 weeks of paid leave, while fathers get only two weeks unless they prove they are primary caregivers. Rotondo, who works as a fraud investigator for the bank in Columbus, Ohio, claimed this violates federal and state anti-bias law. Rotondo, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the law firm Outten & Golden, said fathers must show that either their partner has returned to work or is medically incapable of caring for the child to get the 16 weeks of leave. He said he would not qualify because his wife, who had a baby in early June, is a teacher and is not working until the fall.  We’ve just received the complaint and are reviewing it,  said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Jennifer Lavoie. The EEOC will review Rotondo's complaint and decide whether to launch a full-scale investigation and potentially bring a lawsuit on his behalf, after trying to settle the case. The EEOC could give Rotondo authorization to sue J.P. Morgan directly. The United States is alone among wealthy countries in not having legally mandated paid parental leave, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. While some employers offer paid leave to new parents, there is a “widespread failure” to treat men and women equally, ACLU attorney Galen Sherwin said. Time Warner Inc changed its paid parental leave policies in 2014 after a former CNN reporter filed a complaint with the EEOC targeting a policy that he said gave 10 weeks of leave to biological mothers and parents who adopted, but only two weeks to biological fathers. Unequal leave policies reinforce the stereotypes that women are the caregivers and men are the breadwinners, Sherwin said. Rotondo said he wanted to take the lead role caring for his infant based on his experience caring for his first child. “I have no problem staying up, missing sleep, changing diapers – those things come naturally to me,” Rotondo told Reuters.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-leave-idUSL1N1JC0VX"},

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 242,000 in the latest week.     In addition, June readings of the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index both beat economists' expectations.      U.S. two-year yields hit 1.368 percent, the highest since mid-March, in the wake of the Federal Reserve's second interest rate increase of the year on Wednesday and the U.S. economic data.      Three-year yields briefly jumped above 1.5 percent after hitting an eight-day low of 1.417 percent Wednesday. Short-dated yields are most sensitive to Fed rate movements.     While yields on Treasuries maturing between five and 30 years inched up, they were not far from their lowest levels since November touched Wednesday after government data on inflation and retail sales for May fell well short of market expectations.     Analysts said traders continued to doubt the Fed would be able to raise interest rates for a third time this year, as the central bank projected Wednesday, given soft inflation readings.      We are still pretty much making baby steps after yesterday’s rally,  said Stanley Sun, interest rate strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York.  There is definitely a little bit of the market being skeptical of how far the Fed can raise rates this year and also beyond.      Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last down 4/32 in price to yield 2.153 percent, from a yield of 2.138 percent late Wednesday. Benchmark yields hit 2.103 percent Wednesday, their lowest since Nov. 10.       There is still a lot of uncertainty  about U.S. growth, said Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.      Other data showing import prices recorded their biggest drop in 15 months in May suggested domestic inflation measures could remain soft for a while.     That low inflation outlook helped keep long-dated yields anchored, Rupert said. She said most yields were still pressured a bit higher partly in response to a rise in European debt yields after a hawkish Bank of England vote.

The technology sector has risen 16.7 percent this year, far outperforming other sectors and giving investors a chance to lock-in gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has also surged 13.7 percent, compared with the S&P; 500's 8.2 percent gain for the year. However, fortunes turned last Friday after a drop in Apple's shares triggered a selloff and led to the tech sector's biggest two-day decline in nearly a year.  The huge tech run was impressive and has come to a point where people want to take some money off the table and preserve profits,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn capital in Benardsville, New Jersey. Investors are also concerned about the U.S. economy's ability to withstand a third interest rate hike later this year and the Federal Reserve's plans to trim its balance sheet, especially after a recent set of lackluster economic data. A Washington Post report that President Donald Trump was being investigated for possible obstruction of justice added to the jitters. Bakhos said the report was  adding a little angst to the market and moved investors to choose a risk-off path.  The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street's  fear gauge , hit 11.61 points - its biggest percentage gain in nearly one month. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower. The gainers were utilities, real estate and telecom services, whose slow but steady growth makes them attractive during periods of uncertainty. At 11:03 a.m. ET (1503 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 59.58 points, or 0.28 percent, at 21,314.98, the S&P; 500 was down 13.7 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,424.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 64.29 points, or 1.04 percent, at 6,130.60. Among stocks, Kroger was down 12.5 percent after the supermarket chain operator cut its full-year profit forecast. Mattel was down 7.2 percent at $20.63 after the toymaker cut its dividend. One bright spot was a Labor Department report that showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,063 to 730. On the Nasdaq, 1,906 issues fell and 770 advanced.

Overall, the agency said in its Summer 2017 Energy Market and Reliability Assessment report that preliminary data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC), which writes the nation's power reliability standards, forecast power resources should be adequate to meet demand in most regions this summer. However, restrictions at Southern California Gas' Aliso Canyon, the biggest natural gas storage facility in the state,    could pose a risk to gas and electric reliability, especially if hotter than normal weather conditions and unplanned gas pipeline outages materialize during the summer, FERC said. California state agencies have not allowed SoCalGas, a unit of Sempra Energy, to inject gas into the facility following a leak between October 2015-February 2016. Also, new regulations on gas storage facilities imposed by California, are likely to reduce the flow of the fuel, FERC added.  Given the abundance of accumulated snow water (in the Western regions), high hydro generation is likely to continue into the early part of the summer, which could be leveraged to reduce gas constraints in Southern California,  the report said, adding that snow water equivalent in the region, particularly in California, has been near record levels seen during the 1982-1983 period.  The anticipated reserve margin in ISO New England, the regional power grid operator, is forecast at 14.9 percent, slightly below the target of 15.1 percent. The operator could be forced to import additional power from neighboring regions in case peak summer conditions materialize, as forecast, since the commissioning of about 700 megawatts of new resources could be delayed, FERC said. One megawatt can power about U.S. 1,000 homes. In Texas, FERC forecast that reserve margins in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the power grid for about 75 percent of the state, would continue to be tight when compared to other regions, even though the operator expects to have adequate generating capacity to meet peak demand.   The Lower Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, and West Texas are a few areas in ERCOT that risk experiencing localized reliability issues due to strong load growth, transmission constraints, and limited generation resources,  the report said.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. Qatar is among the leading investors in world sport, preparing to host the 2022 soccer World Cup and the 2019 world athletics championships among the other top events it is set to stage in the coming years.  In the world of sport we remain politically neutral and continue our relationships with all the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) in the region,  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.  We hope for this even more, because all of the NOCs in the region are very active in Olympic sports in different respects and we appreciate especially how much is being contributed to sport development in the region,  Adams told Reuters. Teams across many sports, including top European soccer clubs such as Bayern Munich, regularly use Qatar's state-of-the-art sports infrastructure for winter training camps. Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, the ruling emir of Qatar, has also been an IOC member since 2002. Doha, which  bid unsuccessfully for the 2016 and 2020 summer Olympics, was also seen as a likely candidate for 2028 before the IOC decided last week to award both the 2024 Games and the 2028 edition at the same time in September.  The IOC appreciates all this work very much and hopes that this crisis does not affect this cooperation,  Adams said.  This is a political issue in the region. We are encouraging a dialogue on the political level so that the problem can be solved at this level.  Qatar said on Thursday the rift with fellow Gulf Arab states, which includes economic sanctions on Doha, had not affected its preparations to host the World Cup.

With 291 galleries from 35 countries presenting 4,000 artists' works, the world's most prestigious art fair is as much a place to hobnob as it is to buy and sell an estimated 2.5 billion to 3 billion euros ($2.8-3.4 billion) of art. This year's fair — hard on the heels of a $110.5 million sale of a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting at a Sotheby's auction in New York — got off to a fast clip, dispelling a somber market mood last year. At the Levy Gorvy booth, a collector snatched up a small Joan Miro on paper while the gallery's co-founder and former Christie's chairman Brett Gorvy showed another potential buyer a nearby work. A large painting from the late German artist Sigmar Polke's flamingo and heron series, which caught the eyes of four buyers, sold for around $12 million, while a $32 million Basquiat attracted museum curators and dealers.  I always said I won't leave in a downturn or when the market is riding a rocket to the top,  said top dealmaker Gorvy on his departure from Christie's in December to join forces with dealer Dominique Levy.  It feels like there's a nice steady rise.  With mid-market prices ranging from $50,000 to $1 million, art deals represent  large and infrequent purchases  even among the world's growing population of millionaires, art economist Clare McAndrew said. In the first market report commissioned by UBS and Art Basel, she estimated art sales hit $56.6 billion last year, with the rich eager to place cash at a time of low financial returns.  I don't know whether art is already an asset class,  Juerg Zeltner, head of international wealth management at Swiss bank UBS, told journalists at the fair.   The only thing I do know is that money is worth less. Given the central bank interventions, it does look to me that a lot of private investors are looking to also invest money in art.  But that poses pitfalls for buyers whose ranks have swelled from several dozen serious collectors to millions of active buyers in recent years. Lisa Schiff, New York based art advisor looks at the artwork 'Rob Pruitt's Official Art World/Celebrity Look-Alikes from 2016/2017' by US artist Rob Pruitt at the Unlimited exhibition during the Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland June 13, 2017.Moritz HagerMark Andersen, a UBS asset allocation expert, said art's one-of-a-kind nature makes it nearly impossible to treat as a traditional investment, lacking the predictability and standardised metrics that forecasting requires.  The phenomenon of people not being well advised and thinking they're going to get into the art market and buy a hot artist to make money historically doesn't end very well,  Citi private bank's art advisory and finance head Suzanne Gyorgy said. Art for Art's Sake    In the Art Basel Unlimited section for video and museum-scale works, U.S. artist Rob Pruitt filled a room with images matching art world figures with their celebrity look-alikes. Slideshow (10 Images)Art adviser Lisa Schiff, who arranged the purchase of the work on behalf of one of her clients on the fair's opening morning, said she was seeing a changed mindset from buyers at this year's fair.  The habit of the last 15 years of buying voraciously is finito,  Schiff said.  People are getting exhausted by this complete addiction to auction estimates and auction prices... Value is when you build something and you believe in it.  But art mavens remain wary of speculative buying at a time when the world's wealthy, waylaid by political and economic uncertainty, are eager to place cash. Speculation had transformed the industry from one driven by art to one fueled by finance, Galerie Gmurzynska's Mathias Rastorfer said.  If you're selling for a lot of money, without critical acclaim, without peer recognition and without curatorial accompaniment, you're still successful because you're selling well,  Rastorfer said, adding that the phenomenon was slowly beginning to correct. For Glimcher, who spends 14 days a month on airplanes jetting between gallery spaces spread from Hong Kong and Seoul to London and Palo Alto, a busy schedule is testament to the limited scope for scaling up an art business.  It's not possible to truly corporatise this business, which is built on relationships and interpersonal interactions,  he said.  That's why we have these art fairs.

If your answer is “Social Security,” congratulations. You know that Social Security Disability Insurance is part of Social Security. That seems obvious, but the Trump administration wants you to think otherwise. “If you ask 999 people out of 1,000, (they) would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security,” Mick Mulvaney, the administration’s budget director, said in May at a press briefing on its 2018 spending plan. “It’s old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security.”  Mulvaney was explaining a proposed $72 billion spending cut in disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income, to be spread over 10 years. The likely intent was to wriggle away from President Donald Trump's campaign pledge not to cut Social Security.  Mulvaney does have a point - most people do think of retirement when they think of Social Security, due to the universality of retirement benefits. But despite his claims on popular perceptions of Social Security, Mulvaney’s attempt to separate SSDI from Social Security is dangerous and could have a very corrosive effect. Hacking away at the disability insurance program is an attack on the very idea of social insurance. The fundamental aim of Social Security is to protect against the risk of lost income from work, whether from retirement, disability or the death of a family breadwinner. Disability insurance was added to the program during the  Eisenhower era. Workers and employers alike contribute to the disability insurance fund through their payroll tax contributions. (Currently, 2.37 percent of the total 12.4 percent payroll tax goes into the disability fund, split evenly between workers and employers.)  Workers qualify for benefits by working the equivalent of at least 10 years - just as they do for Social Security and Medicare, although the number of work credits required for disability are adjusted for age to accommodate younger workers. So disability protection is an earned benefit, no different than retirement coverage. But SSDI often is attacked as though it were a government handout. Indeed, the administration's proposed cuts come alongside appalling cuts to other programs that assist the vulnerable, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Republican opponents of SSDI often argue that disability spending is out of control, and that more beneficiaries must return to the workforce. “It’s the fastest-growing program,” Mulvaney said during one television interview about the budget.  It grew tremendously under President Obama. It’s a very wasteful program, and we want to try and fix that.” Hence the Trump budget plan forecasts cutting spending by tightening program eligibility rules. Spending Levels Off SSDI spending did grow in recent decades, but that was due to changes in the nation’s demography and workforce. Aging baby boomers reached ages when disability is most likely, and more women entered the workforce, making them eligible for disability payments where needed. Another factor: the increase in Social Security’s retirement age, to 66 from 65, has kept more workers on disability who would have otherwise transitioned to retirement benefits at 65. More recently, growth has leveled off - 9.455 million people received disability benefits in April this year, down by 121,000 compared with the previous April. The benefit is very modest, averaging just $1,032 per month. Media reports on SSDI often try to make the case that fraud and abuse of the program are rampant, but the case is mostly anecdotal. Typically these stories focus on the South or Appalachia - parts of the country where SSDI beneficiaries are found in disproportionate numbers due to lower levels of education and income, and where access to healthcare is more limited.  There hasn’t been any evidence to show that people who could be working are getting on benefits,” said Lisa Ekman, director of government affairs at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives, a specialized bar association for attorneys and advocates who represent SSDI claimants. “The standards haven’t changed, and they are very strict.” Indeed, only one in three SSDI applications are approved upon initial application and less than 40 percent are granted after all levels of appeal are exhausted, she notes. If anything in SSDI needs reform, it is the horrendously clogged pipeline of cases on appeal awaiting adjudication. Wait times are at a historic high - an average of 616 days to get a hearing. But budgeting for a big cut in SSDI spending by tightening work requirements is no more than wishful thinking. The only way to really save money in the program is by shrinking the benefits of vulnerable people or by reducing benefit levels that already are very modest. But trying to cut the “SS” from SSDI is not going to cut it.   (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

Workers in hard hats monitor as giant yellow cranes lift hundreds of containers off cargo ships onto lorries waiting ashore. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and transport ties with import-dependent Qatar 10 days ago, accusing it of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups, charges Doha denies. The spat initially halted much traffic to its Hamad Port and raised fears of food and other shortages. But after launching new direct shipping routes to cope with the crisis, port officials say the worst is over and the episode may even help gas-rich Qatar seal new transport deals that do not rely on Gulf neighbours.  It's a blessing in disguise,  a port official said as cargo was unloaded on Wednesday.  We're looking at signing agreements with shipping companies that can improve direct services instead of having to come through Jebel Ali  in Dubai. The first ship on a new direct weekly service from India's Mundra Port was expected to arrive on Friday. Another route to India's Nhava Sheva Port was announced late on Wednesday, after two new services opened this week from Oman, which has remained neutral during the crisis. Earlier this week the world's biggest container line, Maersk of Denmark, said it would accept new bookings for container shipments to Qatar from Oman. Several Maersk containers could be seen parked among rows of shipments at Hamad Port. Operations manager Omar El-Khayat said another deal with Maersk was being discussed. Some Services Hit Mediation efforts to end the crisis have intensified, including by the United States, which has strong military ties with Qatar, host of the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East. Two U.S. Navy ships went through Hamad Port on Wednesday for a joint exercise with Qatar. Port officials said the cutting of transport links by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain with Qatar continues to affect some services. Ships from China's Shanghai, which normally go through Jebel Ali, have to be re-routed via Iraq, adding seven days to a normally 20-day voyage, one official said. Not all lines have resumed shipping services. China's COSCO Shipping Lines Co Ltd, Taiwan's Evergreen and Hong Kong Kong's OOCL suspended container services to and from Qatar. The closure of land borders is also likely to put pressure on Qatar to ensure continuity of supplies. Trade sources say sugar imports remain frozen given the country's main suppliers are Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Hamad Port's general cargo terminal can handle 1.7 million tonnes of goods per year, according to Qatar's transport ministry, but it is not a bulk cargo port. Officials would not say at what capacity Hamad Port was operating compared to before the crisis, or whether it could handle increased demand. The Qatar Ports Management Company, Mwani, gave no import figures for June. But it hoped new services would help make up the shortfall. Livestock and Gabbro Rock Mwani's Hamad al-Ansar said ties with Turkey and Iran, which have flown goods into Doha since the boycott, might expand, with Turkish vessels already on their way.  We'll open a relationship with anyone who can bring cargo.  For now, port employees have their work cut out. As one large ship took back empty containers later in the day, a second one arrived bringing livestock from Australia.  The first five days of the crisis there were fewer shipments. Now it's back to normal. I've seen the schedule and it looks packed,  said a Kenyan supervisor. Hamad Port's imports include large quantities of food and building materials for construction projects including stadiums for the 2022 soccer World Cup, and a metro line running alongside highways that stretch out of Doha. The boycott raised concerns that projects could be delayed if building material including from the Far East and South Asia is choked. But at the nearby Mesaeeid stockyard, vast dunes of gabbro rock, around 10 million tonnes' worth according to officials, lay stockpiled for construction.  It's business as usual,  the port official said. (Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London, editing by David Evans)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gulf-qatar-port-idUSL8N1JC2LJ"},

Overall, the agency said in its Summer 2017 Energy Market and Reliability Assessment report that preliminary data from the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC), which writes the nation's power reliability standards, forecast power resources should be adequate to meet demand in most regions this summer. However, restrictions at Southern California Gas' Aliso Canyon, the biggest natural gas storage facility in the state,    could pose a risk to gas and electric reliability, especially if hotter than normal weather conditions and unplanned gas pipeline outages materialize during the summer, FERC said. California state agencies have not allowed SoCalGas, a unit of Sempra Energy, to inject gas into the facility following a leak between October 2015-February 2016. Also, new regulations on gas storage facilities imposed by California, are likely to reduce the flow of the fuel, FERC added.  Given the abundance of accumulated snow water (in the Western regions), high hydro generation is likely to continue into the early part of the summer, which could be leveraged to reduce gas constraints in Southern California,  the report said, adding that snow water equivalent in the region, particularly in California, has been near record levels seen during the 1982-1983 period.  The anticipated reserve margin in ISO New England, the regional power grid operator, is forecast at 14.9 percent, slightly below the target of 15.1 percent. The operator could be forced to import additional power from neighboring regions in case peak summer conditions materialize, as forecast, since the commissioning of about 700 megawatts of new resources could be delayed, FERC said. One megawatt can power about U.S. 1,000 homes. In Texas, FERC forecast that reserve margins in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the power grid for about 75 percent of the state, would continue to be tight when compared to other regions, even though the operator expects to have adequate generating capacity to meet peak demand.   The Lower Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, and West Texas are a few areas in ERCOT that risk experiencing localized reliability issues due to strong load growth, transmission constraints, and limited generation resources,  the report said.

The number of Americans filing unemployment claims fell more than expected last week, suggesting that slack in the labor market was shrinking, and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index for June beat expectations after a strong reading in May. The Fed has maintained its monetary policy is data dependent, meaning economic reports in line with its outlook are necessary for it to continue raising rates. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose to 97.557, its highest since May 30. The dollar also hit its highest against the euro, Swiss franc and Swedish crown since May 30 following the data's release. The greenback rose to a six-day high against the Japanese yen of 110.64 yen.  The Fed has pretty much reaffirmed its intent, absent any pronounced deterioration, of continuing to normalize rates, to raise once more this year,  said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets Online Trading.  And I think that realization is starting to seep into the market right now.  The dollar already was trading higher ahead of the release of U.S. economic data on Thursday in response to the Fed's decision to raise U.S. overnight interest rates by 25 basis points to a target range of 1.00-1.25 percent on Wednesday. The Fed also gave its first clear outline of its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds. A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed the central bank would announce the start of its balance sheet normalization at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.  Long-term Fed expectations remain very much supported - that is the main reason why the dollar is remaining supported for now,  Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri said. Sterling was flat in North American trading after it jumped more than a cent on signs of a shift in the Bank of England's stance on keeping interest rates at record lows. Two more policymakers at the Bank of England joined Kristin Forbes in calling for a reversal to the BoE's interest rate cut last August, sending the pound as high as $1.2795 in the minutes following its decision to leave rates unchanged.

The Alpine country is preparing to dismantle bank secrecy next year when it begins sending information about its customers' accounts to foreign tax agencies. But Switzerland's multi-trillion-dollar financial industry is seeking new safeguards to protect bank data against misuse that could expose clients to crimes such as kidnapping or blackmail.   Data could be sold or used to put pressure on clients or their families,  said Yves Mirabaud, chairman of the Association of Swiss Private Banks and senior managing partner at Mirabaud, a Geneva-based private bank.   I'm referring to countries where we're not very sure that the democratic process is the same as ours, or where corruption is very high.  Wealthy clients have pulled tens of billions of dollars out of Swiss bank accounts because of a worldwide crackdown on tax evasion following the global financial crisis last decade. That culminated in the Automatic Exchange of Information programme fostered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which aims to ensure that offshore accounts are known to authorities.  The participation of Switzerland, the world's largest center for overseas wealth, in the data exchange agreement was heralded at the time as a major breakthrough in ending tax avoidance. Banks in Switzerland are  fully committed  to implementing the Automatic Exchange of Information, said a spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association, the main banking lobby.  But they are lobbying to add an  activation  clause that means information would only be handed over to a country if two criteria are met -- a level playing field with other financial centers, and an assurance the data will be used properly.   They say giving information to countries in regions such as South America or Africa, where data protection standards can be weak and corruption rife, risks it falling into the wrong hands.      In 2018 Switzerland is due to start swapping information with 38 foreign tax authorities, including all European Union countries, and with a further 41 from 2019.   The proposed clause would apply to the 2019 batch of countries, among which are several emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.  We want to be sure that when we provide information that it does not get misused or compromise a client's security,  said Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer (BAER.S), Switzerland's third-biggest private bank behind UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S). The Swiss government will send to parliament a dispatch, which contains its proposals on the exchange of information with these 41 countries, by July 5. Parliament will then be asked to decide on the implementation of these plans.

A spokeswoman for the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters, an arm of the finance ministry, signaled the government would consider halting transfers of information.  If there are concerns about how the data will be used in a specific jurisdiction, Switzerland could look at taking any of the measures provided for in the multilateral framework governing the automatic exchange of information,  she said, referring to steps that include suspending the data exchange with a country.  Campaigners against secrecy are crying foul, however, and accuse the Swiss of trying to allow the wealthy to keep cash hidden.   That information might fall into the hands of kidnappers... is the perfect excuse,  said Nicholas Shaxson of Tax Justice Network, an organization that lobbies on tax havens.   It's a justification for an ocean of fraud.   Pressure on Switzerland built after a U.S.-led crackdown starting in 2008 publicized practices used by its bankers to keep money hidden from tax authorities, from smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes to hiding documents in the pages of Sports Illustrated. This U.S. clampdown and the push by the OECD to bring in global rules on exchanging tax data between countries means that Switzerland handing over information to Europe and the United States is unavoidable.  Perfect Excuse  Data from the Swiss National Bank shows a sharp decline in U.S. money in Swiss accounts. U.S. customers accounted for 161 billion Swiss francs  ($165.3 billion) of bank deposits in 2006, but that had more than halved in 2015.  In the meantime, the size of deposits from many emerging market countries has gradually increased.  Mark Herkenrath of Alliance Sud, a group that campaigns for transparency, is skeptical about the true motivation.   For a lot of Swiss banks, a big part of their business is breaking away because money from the U.S. has dried up. The temptation now is to continue taking money from developing countries,  he said.   The suggestion that they are shielding their customers from abuse of their human rights is the perfect excuse to avoid transparency.  The Paris-based OECD, which will police whether the exchange of information is working, is optimistic that Switzerland will honor the deal. But it stands ready to act in case the Swiss banks drag their feet.  It's not going to be used as an excuse,  said Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's tax policy director, acknowledging the banks' argument for preventing the misuse of information.  But if it is, the country will be sanctioned.   Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-banks-secrecy-idUSKBN19622S"},

Panelists Madhav Chinnappa, Director of Strategic Relations for News and Publishers at Google; Maisie McCabe, Deputy Editor of Campaign; Nic Newman, Research Association at Reuters Institute; and Nathalie Malinarich, Mobile Editor, BBC News Online, joined moderator John Pullman, Reuters Global Head of Video and Pictures, to debate Reuters exclusive survey results of reader trends on news consumption, fake news, trust, social media and consumer behavior and perceptions of news brands.  Among the highlights:   Chinnappa said that Google is “trying to give the answers that the users are looking for when they search, which is a very specific thing. So for us, when you look at false news, on some levels, that’s news spam. It’s people trying to game the system. And we’ve been trying to fight that from the beginning of Google.” Malinarich noted that brand attribution or recognition on social media is really difficult. “If you spend your whole day snacking on Facebook, you know you’ve read things about Trump or whatever it is, but you don’t who wrote them or made the video at the end. …it’s just kind of a jumble in your head and you remember the actual stories and the headlines, but you don’t really remember who provided that.” The way people buy online advertising, McCabe said, was to look for the cheapest way to find people who look like they might be interested in their brand. “That means they don’t pay attention to necessarily where the ad is going to run, so then you have the situation where people are chasing numbers by any means. It’s definitely something advertisers need to be wary of.” On fake news, Newman said “whose responsibility is it—is it publishers, is it platforms, is it users? In this world, it’s all of those. Users get the benefits of greater choice, but downside of that is they have to do more work themselves to work out what is true and what isn’t. They are, and they relish that. They see that trade off when you talk to them. From a publishers point of you, they need to do more about transparency. From a platform point of view, they need to do more as well to show the value of brands.  You can follow more of the discussion on Twitter by searching #tomorrowsnews.

Kadcyla, which can prolong the lives of some women with advanced disease, has been a battle-ground for campaigners wanting better access to modern cancer drugs, with 115,000 people signing a petition demanding its availability. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Thursday it could now recommend funding for Kadcyla, following the new commercial access arrangement with Roche. Details of the discount offer were not disclosed.  Today’s announcement on Kadcyla shows that for companies who are willing to work with us, there are concrete gains for them, for the NHS and most importantly for patients able to get new and innovative drugs,  said NHS England chief Simon Stevens. At its full list price, Kadcyla costs about 90,000 pounds ($115,000) per patient, according to NICE, although Roche says this figure is exaggerated because the drug is typically given for shorter periods than NICE assumes. Until now, the drug has only been covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which finances drugs not routinely paid for on the NHS. With the medicine moving to routine use, around 1,200 women could now be eligible to receive it. Roche, the world's biggest supplier of cancer medicines, has  expressed frustration in the past at the rigid system used in Britain to determine value for money in cancer care, with CEO Severin Schwan describing the system as  stupid  in 2015. The company's UK general manager Richard Erwin welcomed the new deal as a  positive  development on Thursday.   Industry critics, however, argue that medicine prices are rising far faster than inflation, especially in cancer treatment, and returns demanded by the industry on newly launched products are unsustainable. Kadcyla is designed for women with so-called HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, cannot be surgically removed and has stopped responding to initial treatment. The medicine combines Herceptin with a tumour-killing drug that is carried directly into cancer cells, causing fewer cases of common chemotherapy side effects like hair loss.

The Alpine country is preparing to dismantle bank secrecy next year when it begins sending information about its customers' accounts to foreign tax agencies. But Switzerland's multi-trillion-dollar financial industry is seeking new safeguards to protect bank data against misuse that could expose clients to crimes such as kidnapping or blackmail.   Data could be sold or used to put pressure on clients or their families,  said Yves Mirabaud, chairman of the Association of Swiss Private Banks and senior managing partner at Mirabaud, a Geneva-based private bank.   I'm referring to countries where we're not very sure that the democratic process is the same as ours, or where corruption is very high.  Wealthy clients have pulled tens of billions of dollars out of Swiss bank accounts because of a worldwide crackdown on tax evasion following the global financial crisis last decade. That culminated in the Automatic Exchange of Information programme fostered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which aims to ensure that offshore accounts are known to authorities.  The participation of Switzerland, the world's largest center for overseas wealth, in the data exchange agreement was heralded at the time as a major breakthrough in ending tax avoidance.

Financial stocks, which account for roughly a third of the index's weight, slipped 0.5 percent. Brookfield Asset Management fell 1.2 percent to C$50.05 and was among the most influential decliners. Royal Bank of Canada was also a key index mover, despite seeing only a modest 0.6 percent fall to C$92.82. Alternative lender Home Capital Group was one of the few bright spots that offset some of the group's declines. Shares rose 12.9 percent to C$13.70 after the company reported late on Wednesday it had reached a settlement agreement with the Ontario Securities Regulator accepting responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures.

The influential energy group, which had see-sawed between gains and losses in morning trading, retreated 1.2 percent, as oil prices touched a six-week low. The commodity was pressured by high global inventories and doubts over OPEC's ability to implement production cuts as promised. U.S. crude prices were down 0.6 percent to $44.45 a barrel.

He also called for a detailed review of YPFB's purchasing procedures after seven mid-level YPFB officials were jailed pending trial on charges related to the deal. The contract with Italian drilling equipment manufacturer Drillmec was canceled in April after Energy Ministry investigators raised allegations of irregularities in the bidding process. Drillmec had won the contract in February.  We've seen that the procedures were bad, and the prosecutors will complete the corresponding process,  Morales said at an event at the presidential palace.  The contract has been annulled, so there is no economic loss due to the drill purchases.  Acha, who took over the helm at YPFB in 2015, could not be immediately reached for comment. He has repeatedly said he had no knowledge of the bidding process. The country's justice department has not ruled out including him in investigations.

With 291 galleries from 35 countries presenting 4,000 artists' works, the world's most prestigious art fair is as much a place to hobnob as it is to buy and sell an estimated 2.5 billion to 3 billion euros ($2.8-3.4 billion) of art. This year's fair — hard on the heels of a $110.5 million sale of a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting at a Sotheby's auction in New York — got off to a fast clip, dispelling a somber market mood last year. At the Levy Gorvy booth, a collector snatched up a small Joan Miro on paper while the gallery's co-founder and former Christie's chairman Brett Gorvy showed another potential buyer a nearby work. A large painting from the late German artist Sigmar Polke's flamingo and heron series, which caught the eyes of four buyers, sold for around $12 million, while a $32 million Basquiat attracted museum curators and dealers.  I always said I won't leave in a downturn or when the market is riding a rocket to the top,  said top dealmaker Gorvy on his departure from Christie's in December to join forces with dealer Dominique Levy.  It feels like there's a nice steady rise.  With mid-market prices ranging from $50,000 to $1 million, art deals represent  large and infrequent purchases  even among the world's growing population of millionaires, art economist Clare McAndrew said. In the first market report commissioned by UBS and Art Basel, she estimated art sales hit $56.6 billion last year, with the rich eager to place cash at a time of low financial returns.  I don't know whether art is already an asset class,  Juerg Zeltner, head of international wealth management at Swiss bank UBS, told journalists at the fair.   The only thing I do know is that money is worth less. Given the central bank interventions, it does look to me that a lot of private investors are looking to also invest money in art.  But that poses pitfalls for buyers whose ranks have swelled from several dozen serious collectors to millions of active buyers in recent years. Lisa Schiff, New York based art advisor looks at the artwork 'Rob Pruitt's Official Art World/Celebrity Look-Alikes from 2016/2017' by US artist Rob Pruitt at the Unlimited exhibition during the Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland June 13, 2017.Moritz HagerMark Andersen, a UBS asset allocation expert, said art's one-of-a-kind nature makes it nearly impossible to treat as a traditional investment, lacking the predictability and standardised metrics that forecasting requires.  The phenomenon of people not being well advised and thinking they're going to get into the art market and buy a hot artist to make money historically doesn't end very well,  Citi private bank's art advisory and finance head Suzanne Gyorgy said. Art for Art's Sake    In the Art Basel Unlimited section for video and museum-scale works, U.S. artist Rob Pruitt filled a room with images matching art world figures with their celebrity look-alikes. Slideshow (10 Images)Art adviser Lisa Schiff, who arranged the purchase of the work on behalf of one of her clients on the fair's opening morning, said she was seeing a changed mindset from buyers at this year's fair.  The habit of the last 15 years of buying voraciously is finito,  Schiff said.  People are getting exhausted by this complete addiction to auction estimates and auction prices... Value is when you build something and you believe in it.  But art mavens remain wary of speculative buying at a time when the world's wealthy, waylaid by political and economic uncertainty, are eager to place cash. Speculation had transformed the industry from one driven by art to one fueled by finance, Galerie Gmurzynska's Mathias Rastorfer said.  If you're selling for a lot of money, without critical acclaim, without peer recognition and without curatorial accompaniment, you're still successful because you're selling well,  Rastorfer said, adding that the phenomenon was slowly beginning to correct.

Kadcyla, which can prolong the lives of some women with advanced disease, has been a battle-ground for campaigners wanting better access to modern cancer drugs, with 115,000 people signing a petition demanding its availability. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Thursday it could now recommend funding for Kadcyla, following the new commercial access arrangement with Roche. Details of the discount offer were not disclosed.  Today’s announcement on Kadcyla shows that for companies who are willing to work with us, there are concrete gains for them, for the NHS and most importantly for patients able to get new and innovative drugs,  said NHS England chief Simon Stevens. At its full list price, Kadcyla costs about 90,000 pounds ($115,000) per patient, according to NICE, although Roche says this figure is exaggerated because the drug is typically given for shorter periods than NICE assumes. Until now, the drug has only been covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which finances drugs not routinely paid for on the NHS. With the medicine moving to routine use, around 1,200 women could now be eligible to receive it. Roche, the world's biggest supplier of cancer medicines, has  expressed frustration in the past at the rigid system used in Britain to determine value for money in cancer care, with CEO Severin Schwan describing the system as  stupid  in 2015. The company's UK general manager Richard Erwin welcomed the new deal as a  positive  development on Thursday.   Industry critics, however, argue that medicine prices are rising far faster than inflation, especially in cancer treatment, and returns demanded by the industry on newly launched products are unsustainable. Kadcyla is designed for women with so-called HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, cannot be surgically removed and has stopped responding to initial treatment. The medicine combines Herceptin with a tumour-killing drug that is carried directly into cancer cells, causing fewer cases of common chemotherapy side effects like hair loss.

A court sentenced Enis Berberoglu, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), on charges of military espionage on Wednesday. It said he gave an opposition newspaper a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. He is the first lawmaker from the secular CHP to be jailed in a government crackdown that followed last July's failed coup. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned and over 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs. Carrying banners that read  Justice , and waving Turkish flags, crowds demonstrated as CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu started a 425 kilometer (265 mile) march from the capital Ankara to the Istanbul jail where Berberoglu is being held. Wearing a white shirt and waving at his supporters on the way, 68-year-old Kilicdaroglu embarked on a journey that party officials said could take at least 20 days. Kilicdaroglu has called the arrest lawless and motivated by the presidential palace, a reference to President Tayyip Erdogan.  Our march will continue until there is justice in this country,  Kilicdaroglu told reporters before setting off. Crowds gathered at a park in the capital to see him off and to protest Berberoglu's imprisonment.  Erdogan is waving his finger at everyone who is against him,  said Nuran, a retired teacher who declined to give her surname.  The arrest was made to send a message but we are not afraid. We will resist until they jail every single one of us.  Nearby, many people held banners, waved Turkish flags and carried posters of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the secular founder of modern Turkey, and the CHP. Police imposed tight security measures at the site of the protest, setting up security barriers, sealing off nearby roads and carrying out searches with bomb disposal teams and dogs. Water cannon and armored police vehicles waited nearby.

Berberoglu's lawyer appealed against the lawmaker's detention, seeking his immediate release, but it was rejected by the Istanbul court. He has been accused of supplying the Cumhuriyet newspaper with a video it used as the basis of a May 2015 report that alleged trucks owned by Turkey's state intelligence service were found to contain weapons and ammunition headed for Syria when they were stopped and searched in southern Turkey in early 2014. The government denied accusations that weapons were sent to Syrian rebels, saying the trucks were carrying humanitarian aid. Erdogan later acknowledged the trucks belonged to the state intelligence agency and said they were carrying aid to ethnic Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.  He accused Cumhuriyet's editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul of undermining Turkey's reputation and vowed Dundar would  pay a heavy price .  Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years in jail for revealing state secrets in a related case. The prosecutor is now seeking an additional 10 years in prison for the two over the report on the trucks. Dundar is being tried in absentia after leaving the country. Gul remains in Turkey and free, but his case is in process. Some 160 journalists are imprisoned in Turkey, according to the journalists union, and authorities have shut down 130 media outlets since the failed coup.  The government says such measures are necessary, given the vast security threats it is facing. Rights groups and some of Turkey's Western allies have voiced concern at the scope of the crackdown, decrying what they say is growing authoritarianism. Berberoglu's arrest drew criticism from TUSIAD, a leading Turkish business association, saying prosecution and arrests of journalists and academics was damaging the image of the country.  Our democratic values are of key importance in terms of our national interests and competitive power globally,  the group said in a statement.

Investors are considering a US$2.2bn-equivalent financing for Hong Kong-based international schools operator Nord Anglia Education; €1bn for European industrial supplies distributor IPH Brammer; a €444m loan for Dutch chemical distributor Caldic; and a €357m loan for European engineering company Assystem Technologies. They were also offered new paper on a €335m loan for Dutch theatre group Stage Entertainment, as CVC finally opted to leverage the business, after acquiring a majority stake in 2015. Investors have been desperate for new issuance following a lack of event-driven financings since the last quarter of 2016. Yet the emergence of a handful at the same time is causing issues internally at some funds as they struggle to attend all the bank meetings and take a view on the credits within the two-week timeframe typically given for a syndication. Instead, many investors are opting to pick the deals they perceive to have the greatest chance of getting approval from internal committees, shunning the rest. “The deals have all come at the same time and all require work. We are picking the best ones and taking those forward. [And that means] only two out of the current batch,” an investor said. A second investor said: “There are less people attending the bank meetings. Some people have to decide what to go to as there is so much happening at the same time. Having spoken to other funds, they are also struggling and making decisions from the beginning which ones are convertible and more likely to be approved.” In additional to the new deals, investors are also working on existing deals in the market including a repricing for UK petrol station operator MRH and dividend recapitalisations for UK petrol station operator Motor Fuel Group and German packaging company Kloeckner Pentaplast, among others. “We don’t focus on new deals rather than repricings. If repricings come in then we’ll do those as well,” the first investor said. Frustration Some bankers are getting frustrated with investors, especially if they are prioritising existing deals over new ones. “ spend ages complaining about a lack of new deals, then get them and say they have to do repricings first as new deals require a bit of work and thought process. They then end up not doing the new deals. They should endeavour to do more. If investors are telling people there is a finite number of deals they can process then it sends out a message it is a constrained market with capacity issues,” a syndicate head said. The new deals are broadly pricing in the same area between 350bp-400bp but could diverge if certain loans become more or less popular, amid increasing investor selectively. This could prompt welcome credit differentiation that has so far been amiss this year due to the supply and demand imbalance.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.  Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world's largest air show.  The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.  Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing's (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.  The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.  Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.  Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.  CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.  It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.  Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.   I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,  said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.     'Different Dynamic'  Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.  But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year's Farnborough Airshow in Britain.   I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,  said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.  Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia's AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.  Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like  predictive maintenance  to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.   We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,  Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.  It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.  Mitsubishi's MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.  While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.   There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,  Barrett said of the would-be challengers.  In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.  With the New Yorker's departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.  The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.

Glencore has an exclusive deal with the internationally recognised National Oil Corp (NOC) based in Tripoli to export crude from the eastern port, but the rival eastern NOC has been trying to wrest control of those crude sales since late 2014. The eastern NOC called on the port's operator to halt Glencore's loadings because of the trader's links to Qatar. It said it was acting on letters from Abdullah al-Thinni's eastern government requiring companies to cut links with Glencore. Qatar Holding and CEO Ivan Glasenberg are the largest stakeholders in Glencore. Qatar has an 8.49 percent stake. Glencore and Qatar also jointly own a 19.5 percent stake in Russia's state-controlled oil firm Rosneft, which in turn has an agreement with NOC to buy crude. Glencore declined to comment. The NOC in Benghazi, which has repeatedly tried and failed to take control of oil exports from the NOC in Tripoli, published the order targeting Glencore late on Wednesday. The Benghazi NOC is aligned with a government and parliament also based in the east, both of which issued statements naming Glencore. Their military commander, Kahlifa Haftar, has received backing from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which, along with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, cut ties with Qatar last week. The countries accused Qatar of fomenting regional unrest, supporting Islamist militants and the Muslim Brotherhood, and getting too close to Iran. Qatar said the move was based on lies. Officials in eastern Libya have issued a flurry of statements singling out people and entities with alleged links to Qatar or the Muslim Brotherhood. Previous efforts by east Libyan factions to export oil have been blocked under U.N. Security Council resolutions that recognise the NOC in Tripoli as the sole legitimate seller of Libyan oil. Haftar's military has allowed exports to flow freely from the east under the Tripoli NOC. Tanker Loading A spokesman from NOC subsidiary Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), which operates exports of Messla and Sarir crude from Hariga, said it had not received the instruction from the Benghazi NOC. Omran al-Zwai said AGOCO, which produces 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), was operating as usual. The majority of the AGOCO's production is exported by Glencore. A port official at Hariga said a tanker had loaded 460,000 barrels of crude on Thursday for export to Greece. Daily volumes through the port are about 190,000 barrels, he said. The NOC in Tripoli warned al-Thinni earlier this week not to use the Qatar dispute  as a pretext for exporting oil illegally . NOC Tripoli Chairman Mustafa Sanalla wrote to Thinni that Glencore was a publicly traded company, and not controlled by Qatar.  It supported us during the (2011) revolution, and supplied fuel on open credit when we had queues of cars waiting at petrol stations,  he said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Glencore secured an extension to the exclusive deal for lifting the two crude grades. The deal began in September 2015 and currently runs until the end of this year. Over a year ago, eastern authorities blocked a Glencore tanker from leaving the Hariga terminal for three weeks.

VW said on Thursday it had extended a deal with Russia's GAZ group to assemble VW brand and Skoda cars until 2025. As part of the agreement, VW will also supply 2.0 litre diesel engines to light commercial vehicles made by GAZ. The prolonged decline of the once-booming Russian car market caused General Motors to leave in 2015 but VW has kept investing and started making engines at a new plant in Kaluga, some 170 km (105 miles) southwest of Moscow two years ago. Volkswagen is the world's biggest carmaker by sales and is the leading foreign automaker in Russia by sales and revenue. In a separate statement, VW said its truck and bus division had signed a letter of intent with GAZ to examine a long-term business cooperation in commercial vehicles. The two companies are considering a strategic partnership for supplies and joint assembly of components, and possible projects will be examined in a next phase, VW said. GAZ already uses components from VW's Scania and MAN heavy-truck divisions for its buses.  With this letter of intent, we are taking another important step in our global champion strategy and are clearly demonstrating our commitment to the Russian market,  VW trucks chief Andreas Renschler said. Car deliveries in Russia by the VW group, which includes the luxury Audi and Porsche brands, fell 4.3 percent to 166,900 last year. But there are signs of a rebound as Russian new car sales rose 6.9 percent in April and 15 percent in May.

Morgan Chase & Co employee filed a federal sex discrimination complaint on Thursday accusing the bank of discriminating against fathers by giving them paid parental leave on different terms than mothers based on a stereotype that women should care for children. Derek Rotondo said in his complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that J.P.

Rotondo, who works as a fraud investigator for the bank in Columbus, Ohio, claimed this violates federal and state anti-bias law. Rotondo, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the law firm Outten & Golden, said fathers must show that either their partner has returned to work or is medically incapable of caring for the child to get the 16 weeks of leave. He said he would not qualify because his wife, who had a baby in early June, is a teacher and is not working until the fall.   We’ve just received the complaint and are reviewing it,  said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Jennifer Lavoie.

The decision overturns a 2015 High Court ruling that allowed local Italian laws to invalidate the English law swap agreement, deeming the swaps to be null and void. The ruling will also strengthen the international recognition of the ISDA Master Agreement as a derivatives governance tool, possibly setting a precedent for similar cases that have used local laws to invalidate the governing law of swaps contracts. The original ruling said that Dexia failed to inform the municipality of its right to cancel the transactions during a seven-day cooling off period - a mandatory provision under the Rome Convention. The Court of Appeal found in favour of Dexia, ruling that Article 3(3) of the Rome Convention, which states that the choice of governing law of a contract should not prejudice the application of mandatory local laws, did not apply given the ISDA Master Agreement underpinning the trades. Dexia also said that it entered into back-to-back hedges with banks outside of Italy in connection with the swaps, using the same documentation. According to lawyers at Allen & Overy and Italian law firm BonelliErede, representing Dexia, the landmark ruling could be significant for similar litigations involving Italian local authorities and financial institutions that used  lack of capacity  arguments to void swaps obligations.  The decision is of significance to any financial institution facing allegations of lack of capacity or defences based on local mandatory laws,  Allen & Overy partner James Partridge said in a statement.  This decision further confirms the court’s approach to the scope of Article 3(3), emphasising that swaps entered into on ISDA form documentation as part of a wider chain of back-to-back transactions are to be regarded as taking place in a market which is inherently international.” The case refers to the last of six swaps that Prato entered into with Dexia between 2002 and 2006 as part of a wider debt restructuring. Prato defaulted on the final swap - an interest rate collar - in 2010. As interest rates fell to historic lows in the wake of the global financial crisis, the floor payable by Prato exceeded prevailing market rates. Following the payment default, Dexia brought a claim against the local authority, seeking to recover €6.5m that was due to be paid on the swap up to the 2013 maturity. The ruling follows the acquittal of Dexia Crediop and its executive Riccardo Sommavilla in the criminal dispute over the same matter before the Court of Prato that concluded on May 31.

Grindeanu's leftist Social Democrat Party (PSD) withdrew its support for his cabinet late on Wednesday, saying he was not implementing the coalition government's program. It plans to file a no-confidence motion against him in parliament on Monday along with its junior coalition partner ALDE. The no-confidence vote will be scheduled for Wednesday, the PSD said, and is likely to succeed as the PSD and ALDE have a majority in parliament.  This way we are defusing the situation, this premier clings to power using various tricks despite having lost our political support. This is circus,  ALDE leader Calin Tariceanu said after a coalition meeting to decide on the next steps.    Independent observers said the coalition's bid to oust Grindeanu reflected anger within the ranks over his failed attempt to decriminalize corruption offences by decree. The decree, seen as the biggest retreat on reforms since Romania joined the European Union in 2007, would have exempted abuse-of-power offences of sums below 200,000 lei ($48,000) from prosecution, shielding hundreds of politicians from justice. Proposed weeks after Grindeanu, 43, took office after December's parliamentary election, the changes to anti-graft rules caused the largest street protests in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism. Grindeanu had to annul the decree. Under Romanian law, the president must endorse a premier after consultations with political parties. The nominee must then secure a vote of confidence in parliament. President Klaus Iohannis's office said on Thursday he would only appoint a new premier if the incumbent resigns or loses a confidence vote.  President Iohannis requests the urgent resolution of the internal coalition crisis,  spokeswoman Madalina Dobrovolschi said.  It is strictly the responsibility of parties in the ruling coalition.  For the PSD's tax changes to come into effect, they need to be approved six months before the enforcement date. So unless a new government approves tax changes this month it is doubtful they will be implemented from January 2018 as planned. The changes would help rein in the fiscal gap as a 25 percent wage hike for about 1.2 million public sector workers needs to be partly offset by changes to the social security tax system that would bring more money into state coffers.  The PSD stepped in to remove support for Grindeanu at the right moment. Just two weeks before parliament's summer recess. Grindeanu's decision to effectively block their graft-related plans to try to cushion corrupt officials have weighed decisively on his fate,  said analyst Cristian Patrasconiu.

As if to disprove the point, this year a number of awkward questions made it onto the air -- albeit briefly.  Perhaps you're tired and you should quit?  read one question, which flashed up behind Putin on a screen in the state television studio where the session was being hosted. Another comment appearing for a few seconds in the corner of television screens declared:  The whole of Russia thinks you've outstayed your welcome on your throne.  The questions would be standard fare in countries with a rough-and-tumble political culture, but in Russia, where Putin is widely treated with a deference reinforced by adulatory state media coverage, they stood out for their boldness. Russia holds a presidential election next year in which Putin is widely expected to run. Bread-and-Butter Issues The Kremlin and its allies in state media are trying to show they are receptive to criticism, especially as they compete for Russians' attention with social media, where no-holds-barred criticism of the authorities is normal. During the question-and-answer session, Putin was for the most part not asked to respond to any of the more awkward questions. Those citizens who put questions to him via phone or video link were respectful and steered away from politics, asking instead about bread-and-butter issues. But towards the end of the four-hour session, the anchors of the broadcast read out a viewer's comment complaining that the questions put to Putin were stage-managed. The Russian president, rising to the challenge, picked out another viewer's comment that had flashed up on a screen, about how it was time Russia got rid of Putin.  Would you call that a stage-managed question?  Putin asked. The event included other moments that appeared designed to convey that the Kremlin was willing to accommodate alternative points of view. The perception that freedom of expression is being restricted in Russia -- denied by officials -- is a source of anger for many among the urban middle-classes, the kind of people who too part in protests earlier this week. Alexei Uchitel, a director whose film about a love affair between a ballerina and the future Tsar Nikolai II scandalised some pro-Kremlin conservatives, was a guest in the studio. Putin slapped down the film's critics, saying the director was a patriot.  We have a big, complicated country, we have lots of people with lots of points of view,  Putin said.

Spotify, which recently hired advisers to explore a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported an operating loss of 349 million euros ($389 million) in 2016, up 47 percent compared with the previous year.  This is explained by substantial investments that have been made during the year, mostly in product development, international expansion and a general increase in personnel,  Spotify's Luxembourg-based holding company wrote in its regulatory filing on Thursday.   Revenue rose by more than 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros as paid subscribers increased to 48 million in 2016 from 28 million the previous year. Overall, the service said it now has 140 million monthly active users, against 126 million at the end of last year.   The company, which depends on acquiring content licenses from a limited number of music majors, struck a new deal with Vivendi-owned (VIV.PA) Universal Music in April.  The move could make the streaming platform more attractive to its top-selling artists, such Adele, Lady Gaga, Coldplay and Kanye West, by letting them release albums exclusively to premium users.

While the interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve was widely expected on Wednesday, policymakers gave markets a reality check by signalling it would begin selling assets accumulated over years of money-printing. Euro zone government bond yields followed the overnight rise in U.S. equivalents when trading opened on Thursday, a move that accelerated after the Bank of England came closest to voting for a rate hike since 2007. Three of its policymakers backed a hike even though the economy is showing signs of a slowdown caused by the uncertainty of Britain's impending departure from the European Union. British 10-year bond yields rose as much as 10 basis points on the day, while German equivalents jumped 7 basis points to a two-week high of 0.298 percent. Other euro zone 10-year yields were up around 3-7 basis points on the day. The moves were more extreme in shorter-dated bonds which tend to be more sensitive to immediate policy changes. Two-year German yields rose to their highest level since late January at minus 0.632 percent. Five-year yields shot up 9 bps -- the biggest daily jump in almost two months.  It seems like there is a bit of a struggle going on among central banks, with two major ones trying to sound hawkish,  said Nordea chief strategist Jan von Gerich.  You could argue that both the Fed and the BoE could have sounded more dovish but were not.  For its part, the European Central Bank last week said it had not discussed scaling back its stimulus programme and lowered its inflation forecasts suggesting it was in no rush to tighten financial conditions. Large bond auctions by Spain and France put further selling pressure on government bonds as investors made room for the new supply. Any action by major central banks such as the U.S. or the UK tends to reverberate across the debt markets of developed countries, as many investors have European, U.S. and Japanese government bonds in their portfolio and switch between them when there are changes in yields. The Fed's move had been more surprising as it came directly after inflation and retail sales data in the United States that had pushed U.S. yields to a seven-month low and nudged other benchmarks down. In Europe, Germany's 10-year yield hit a seven-week low of 0.225 percent on Wednesday, before it snapped back sharply after the Fed.  The Fed has taken a cautious approach to balance sheet normalisation, but they have begun it and it's definitely a tightening of policy,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  The meeting was definitely tilted towards the hawkish side.  Greek government bond yields were a touch higher as its international lenders prepared on Thursday to unblock as much as 8.5 billion euros in loans that Athens desperately needs next month to pay its bills, and to give some idea of what debt relief they may offer over the long-term. The chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters the size of the payment to Athens would be discussed during the meeting, since lenders agreed that Greece had pushed through all the requested reforms.

The resolution of Banco Popular used new European rules to ensure that creditors, not taxpayers, picked up the bill. Investors have responded by dumping debt issued by other small peers. Popular’s speedy collapse and sale to larger rival Banco Santander left holders of its subordinated bonds with nothing. Investors in the debt of other small lenders have responded in two ways. First, they are pricing in a greater probability that healthy lenders will get into trouble. Second, they are assuming that, in that scenario, their investment will be worth very little, if anything. Spain’s Liberbank shows the scale of the fallout. The Spanish lender’s Tier 2 bonds fell as much as 20 percentage points in the two days after Popular was resolved. They now trade at an 8 percent discount to their face value. Fearful of a vicious spiral of falling confidence, Spanish regulators on Monday imposed a ban on short-selling of Liberbank shares. Investors are probably over-reacting about the possibility of Liberbank getting into trouble. True, the lender’s net dodgy assets are worth more than its equity, and the provisions it has set aside are up to 10 percentage points lower than the Spanish average. Yet the bank has a healthy-looking common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12 percent. Ratcheting up provisioning to the sector average would knock that down to a still-manageable 9 percent. Yet the Popular example still offers grounds for caution. Regulators were quick to declare the bank non-viable when it lost deposits, whereas in the past they have kept lenders alive by offering emergency funds. Investors were also shocked by the discounted fire-sale of Popular’s assets to Santander, which wiped out shareholders and junior bonds. The conclusion is that small banks may fail more quickly, and leave creditors with bigger losses, than before. The trauma could throw up some opportunities. Liberbank’s Tier 2 bonds now yield over 8.5 percent, some 2 percentage points more than riskier contingent convertible bonds issued by larger rival CaixaBank. That looks excessive. Yet when the dust settles, investors are likely to demand a bigger premium to hold capital instruments issued by small banks. That will push up funding costs, and further squeeze returns.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The wife of a Boko Haram commander, 25-year-old Aisha, was among 70 women and children who in February finished a nine-month deradicalization program, having being captured by the army in a raid on the militants' Sambisa forest base last year. Last month Aisha vanished from her family home in Borno's state capital Maiduguri, taking the baby boy fathered by her Boko Haram husband and some of her clothes, according to her younger sister Bintu Yerima.   Before she left ...  she had received a phone call from a woman who was with her (in the program),  22-year-old Yerima told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Maiduguri.  The woman said that she had returned to the Sambisa forest.  Phone calls to Aisha after she disappeared went unanswered, and her mobile has since been switched off, her sister added. Fatima Akilu, a psychologist and head of the Neem Foundation, an anti-extremism group which ran the state-backed  program, said she had heard that some of the women who were under her care, including Aisha, had gone back to Boko Haram.   Rehabilitation, reintegration is a long process ... complicated by the fact we have an active, ongoing insurgency.   Boko Haram's bloody campaign to create an Islamic state is now in its eighth year with little sign of ending, and has claimed more than 20,000 lives and uprooted 2.7 million people.   When you have fathers, husbands, sons and brothers who are still in the movement, they (the women) want to be reunited ... to go back to a place where they feel they belong,  added Akilu.  Power and Shame The allure of power may be another factor in their return. Thousands of girls and women have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2009 - most notably the more than 200 Chibok girls snatched one night from their school in April 2014 - with many of them used as cooks, sex slaves, and even suicide bombers. Yet some of these women, like Aisha, say they managed to gain respect, influence and standing within the militant group. Aisha told the Thomson Reuters Foundation earlier this year that other women kidnapped by Boko Haram were given to her as  slaves  because she was married to leading militant Mamman Nur. Seduced by the power, and disenchanted with the domestic drudgery of their everyday lives, women are far more difficult than men to deradicalize and reintegrate into their communities, said Akilu, who called for more support for the former captives.  Women often come out successful from deradicalization program, but they struggle in the community,  Akilu said.  Some face a lot of stigma. They feel like pariahs.  Many Nigerians fear women abducted by Boko Haram have been radicalized and may recruit others or commit violence once they return home, and that their children born of rape may have been tainted by the  bad blood  of the militants, according to a 2016 report by charity International Alert and the U.N. children's agency (UNICEF).  It needs a lot of work to get communities to accept women who have done the almost unthinkable,  said Akilu, who explained how the reintegration process can take several years.   Trying to reintegrate is especially difficult when Boko Haram are carrying out their atrocities almost every week.

The 40-year-old father of one was among millions of east Europeans who moved to wealthier western Europe in search of better-paid jobs after their countries joined the EU from 2004, leaving huge labor market gaps behind. With economic prospects improving across eastern Europe and wages rising due partly to a shortage of workers, official data show tens of thousands of people returning to the region, where the cost of living remains well below western levels. Those numbers will not cure chronic labor shortages overnight. Thousands of people are still planning to leave, and latest data show emigrants from both Hungary and Bulgaria still outnumber returnees. But the first waves of returnees still signal something of a turning point for a region where migration has hitherto worked largely as a one-way street. Kiss left home in 2010 to take up a job in a hotel kitchen in northern Italy after his video rental and massage businesses crashed during the global crisis, which hit Hungary hard.  I had to find something to be able to maintain the same standard of living,  said Kiss, whose son, now eight, was just 10 months old when he started working abroad. Kiss, who has recently acquired a barista certification, plans to use his savings to launch a cafe in Budapest with a fellow Hungarian with whom he worked while abroad.  Distance and this way of life take a very hard toll on your relationships,  he said.  For me, too, not coming home now would have probably meant the end of my family.  Official statistics show 17,000 Hungarians returned last year, up from below 15,000 a year earlier. More than 9,000 Bulgarians have been returning home every year since 2014, double the numbers of earlier years. Many are young people returning to start their own business, mainly in the IT sector, or to join growing outsourcing business opportunities. In Poland, the region's biggest economy, net international migration turned positive last year for the first time since World War Two, official statistics show. Meanwhile, net migration of EU citizens to Britain, a top target for east Europeans along with Germany or Italy, fell last year as new arrivals from eastern European countries sank to the lowest level since they joined the EU in 2004. Britain's looming exit from the EU is deterring some migrants.  Bosch employee Mate Muskat talks with Reuters in Budapest, Hungary, June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Laszlo BaloghImre Molnar and his fiancee returned to Hungary after two years spent in Switzerland as they could not feel settled abroad. They have opened a wine bar in Budapest that serves only local wines and food.  We realized that Switzerland is a very different country,  Molnar said.  It is very beautiful, but society is quite closed, people are not very open and in reality we did not feel at home as we do here in Budapest.   Like Hot Cakes  Judit Kovacs, a branch manager at the Hungarian unit of Dutch staffing agency Randstad, said blue-collar workers were more likely to return as they usually cannot afford to take their entire family abroad.  There is demand for returning workers, especially those who have learned a new technology,  she said, citing auto sector suppliers as an example. Slideshow (2 Images) Machine operators, for example, who have learned to run machinery that is not yet in use in Hungary but the investment is already in the pipeline,  Kovacs said.  Workers with such experience are being snapped up like hot cakes.  Technological advances, such as the advent of self-driving cars, or the entry of service sector companies like BlackRock Inc into the Hungarian market, are also creating opportunities for white-collar workers. German technology supplier Robert Bosch hired 2,000 workers in Hungary last year alone and plans to add hundreds more engineering jobs to keep up with buoyant demand. BlackRock, which announced plans in January to open a service hub in Budapest, said it had received a large number of applications from prospective returnees after a scouting event hosted by the Hungarian embassy in London.  About a third of applicants ... were Hungarians working in London who are planning to return to Hungary,  corporate communications director Marc Bubeck said. Economists are generally upbeat about prospects for the eastern European region, which is expected to outpace its richer western peers in economic growth in the years ahead despite concerns over its continued reliance on EU development funds. But money isn't everything.  In purely financial terms, it is definitely worth working abroad,  Kiss said.  But if you look at the other side of the equation, that I have yet to ride a sled with my son even though he is already eight, the two are not necessarily in balance.   For now, I am full of hopes and dreams,  he said.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.  Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world's largest air show.  The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.  Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing's (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.  The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.  Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.  Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.  CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.  It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.  Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.   I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,  said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.     'Different Dynamic'  Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.  But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year's Farnborough Airshow in Britain.   I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,  said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.  Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia's AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.  Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like  predictive maintenance  to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.   We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,  Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.  It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.  Mitsubishi's MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.  While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.   There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,  Barrett said of the would-be challengers.  In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.  With the New Yorker's departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.  The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.

Grindeanu's leftist Social Democrat Party (PSD) withdrew its support for his cabinet late on Wednesday, saying he was not implementing the coalition government's program. It plans to file a no-confidence motion against him in parliament on Monday along with its junior coalition partner ALDE. The no-confidence vote will be scheduled for Wednesday, the PSD said, and is likely to succeed as the PSD and ALDE have a majority in parliament.  This way we are defusing the situation, this premier clings to power using various tricks despite having lost our political support. This is circus,  ALDE leader Calin Tariceanu said after a coalition meeting to decide on the next steps.    Independent observers said the coalition's bid to oust Grindeanu reflected anger within the ranks over his failed attempt to decriminalize corruption offences by decree. The decree, seen as the biggest retreat on reforms since Romania joined the European Union in 2007, would have exempted abuse-of-power offences of sums below 200,000 lei ($48,000) from prosecution, shielding hundreds of politicians from justice. Proposed weeks after Grindeanu, 43, took office after December's parliamentary election, the changes to anti-graft rules caused the largest street protests in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism. Grindeanu had to annul the decree. Under Romanian law, the president must endorse a premier after consultations with political parties. The nominee must then secure a vote of confidence in parliament. President Klaus Iohannis's office said on Thursday he would only appoint a new premier if the incumbent resigns or loses a confidence vote.  President Iohannis requests the urgent resolution of the internal coalition crisis,  spokeswoman Madalina Dobrovolschi said.  It is strictly the responsibility of parties in the ruling coalition.  For the PSD's tax changes to come into effect, they need to be approved six months before the enforcement date. So unless a new government approves tax changes this month it is doubtful they will be implemented from January 2018 as planned. The changes would help rein in the fiscal gap as a 25 percent wage hike for about 1.2 million public sector workers needs to be partly offset by changes to the social security tax system that would bring more money into state coffers.  The PSD stepped in to remove support for Grindeanu at the right moment. Just two weeks before parliament's summer recess. Grindeanu's decision to effectively block their graft-related plans to try to cushion corrupt officials have weighed decisively on his fate,  said analyst Cristian Patrasconiu.

The watchdog assessed resolutions from shareholders seeking to overhaul the Petropavlovsk board at its annual meeting next week and sought to determine whether they were acting in concert. Peter Hambro, who has headed Petropavlovsk since he founded it in 1994, questioned whether the shareholders seeking change were acting together to pursue  a takeover by stealth , avoiding paying the premium a formal takeover would require. The Takeover Panel found the rebel shareholders' resolutions were not  board control-seeking , the shareholders were not acting together and therefore there was no requirement for a mandatory offer. Hambro told Reuters he accepted  the narrow remit  of the Takeover Panel, but urged shareholders attending the company's annual meeting next Thursday to oppose the rebels' proposals, which include blocking his re-appointment to the board. The changes  would be disruptive to the successful completion of the very promising projects we have under way,  he said. Hambro has stepped down as chairman but is an executive director and says the company is on track after returning to profit in 2016. Citing inadequate governance, the dissident shareholders, which include conglomerate Renova, Sothic Capital Management and M&G;, who between them hold more than 30 percent of Petropavlovsk, have proposed Ian Ashby as chairman. Ashby was named in May as a non-executive director at Anglo American. In addition the rebels have nominated Vladislav Egorov, who works for the Renova group, Garrett Soden, who has worked for the Lundin group of companies for a decade, and Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea Football Club. The Takeover Panel said all of the proposed directors were independent, with the exception of Egorov, who it said  is not considered to be independent, owing to his employment by Renova . Renova declined to comment. In the years before a restructuring in 2015, Petropavlovsk's equity value collapsed. The share price has recovered from lows around 2 pence at the end of 2014 to just over 8 pence, boosted by its return to profit last year, but the rebel shareholders say it is still underperforming its peers.

The ban will cover new and old buildings, and applies to private homes and businesses as well as publicly owned facilities, the Ministry of Climate and Environment announced.   Those using fossil oil for heating must find other options by 2020,  Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen said in a statement. Recommended alternatives to oil-based products include heat pumps, electricity from the country's hydroelectric grid and even special stoves burning wood chips, he added. The directive is set to cut Norway's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by an estimated 340,000 tonnes per year, compared to overall national emissions of 53.9 million tonnes in 2015, the ministry said. Under the Paris climate agreement, Norway plans to make sharp cuts in emissions by 2030. Norway's emissions were 3.3 percent above 1990 levels last year, despite past pledges of reductions. Additional measures could include limitations on the use of natural gas for heating, the ministry said. The fossil ban is a paradox for Norway, green groups say, as the country generates half its export revenues from crude oil and natural gas, lifting per-capita gross domestic product to around $70,000, one of the world's highest. Zero, a Norwegian foundation promoting emission cuts, applauded the decision.  This is a very important climate measure that significantly cuts emissions, sending a powerful signal that we are moving from fossil to renewable energy,  Zero said in a statement. Norway pumps about 2 million barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids per day, while its daily output of natural gas stands at around 300 million cubic meters.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 1.4 percent while The S&P; 500 information technology index was down 1.7 percent. Google's parent Alphabet fell 2.7 percent, making it the second-biggest percentage loser in the S&P; technology sector after Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to  hold,  from  buy.  The top percentage losers in the technology index were Advanced Micro Devices, down 4.6 percent, and Lam Research, down 2.97 percent. The downgrade triggered a broader tech selloff, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Also, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which  could mean a bumpy ride lower  if the prospects for a mega sales cycle diminish for its next smartphone. Apple shares fell 1.9 percent after the report. “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,  said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “I don’t think this is going to be sustained, simply because if you look at the aggregate valuations … tech is not really any more expensive than the market as a whole. Arguably, you are getting a lot more growth at a pretty reasonable price. And that is what has driven the performance so far, but the reality is that is still the case.” The selloff came a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, as expected, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could start selling bonds on its balance sheet  very soon . While the tech sector has fallen more than 4 percent since last Thursday, it is still up around 17 percent year-to-date, double the roughly 8-percent rise for the S&P; 500. That makes technology vulnerable to a pullback, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in New York, who saw no fundamental reason for the move.  Any type of concern in the market, any reason to raise cash levels, very likely these are the first stocks to go to because of the valuation ... because they've become so dominant in portfolios,  said Ghriskey who said the selloff is a short-term blip.

The Sydney-born actress, who appeared in Hollywood's Pitch Perfect films, said articles published by Bauer Media claiming she had lied about her age, real name and some childhood experiences cost her significant acting roles and income. Slideshow (3 Images)After four weeks of hearing testimony from Wilson herself, local journalists and several Hollywood celebrities, the jury of six at Victoria's Supreme Court found unanimously in her favor.

The unexpectedly tight 5-3 vote adds questions over monetary policy to uncertainty over Britain's political outlook since Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in an election last week. BoE policymakers Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders joined previous rate rise advocate Kristin Forbes in voting to reverse the BoE's decision last August to cut rates to a record-low 0.25 percent, the BoE said. Governor Mark Carney and the four other members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave rates unchanged. Financial markets were pricing in a roughly 50 percent chance of an interest rate hike by next June, compared with 20 percent earlier this week, Societe Generale fixed income strategist Jason Simpson said. But many economists said they still saw no rate hike on the horizon possibly for another two years. Sterling jumped almost a cent against the U.S. dollar after the decision but it pared gains as doubts grew about whether an outright majority of Bank officials would back higher rates in the foreseeable future  Last week's election unexpectedly gave us a hung parliament, and now it seems the MPC is also split down the middle,  HSBC economists Elizabeth Martins and Chris Hare wrote in a note to clients.  We think there could be a protracted period of split votes, as political uncertainty, waning growth momentum and weak wages weigh against the case for tightening,  they added. Britain's economy slowed sharply in early 2017 as consumers felt the pinch from higher inflation and slowing wage growth. That had led most investors to think it was unlikely that the BoE would quickly follow the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve which raised interest rates for the second time in three months late on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only Forbes, whose MPC term expires at the end of the month, to back higher rates. Attention is now turning to the future make-up of the MPC. Finance minister Philip Hammond has yet to announce replacements for Forbes and for former deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, who quit earlier this year after lawmakers criticised her failure to declare a potential conflict of interest. Hammond and Carney had been due to address an annual dinner for financiers in the City of London later on Thursday. But the event was cancelled out of respect for victims of a deadly fire in a London apartment block on Wednesday. Inflation Surge Rising inflation and a further fall in the pound have become the BoE's main concerns since its last rates meeting in May. The BoE said on Thursday that a recent jump in inflation to 2.9 percent meant it was likely to exceed 3 percent this autumn - higher than the BoE forecast just a few weeks ago and well above its 2 percent inflation target. The fall in the pound after last week's election could push prices yet higher, the central bank said. Prime Minister May is trying to get a commitment of support from Northern Ireland's main pro-United Kingdom party to allow her to pass legislation. The pound shed 2.5 percent of its value since the last BoE meeting and is now 13 percent weaker than before Britain voted to leave the EU. Britain's economy was the worst performer among the world's top seven advanced economies in the first quarter of this year as the effect of higher inflation - partly due to a weaker pound - caught up with consumers at a time of sluggish wage growth. Retail data released earlier on Thursday showed the joint slowest growth in sales volumes in four years. But the BoE said it was unclear how long the consumer weakness would last as confidence surveys have looked solid. Moreover, indicators of investment and exports looked upbeat, and unemployment was its lowest in over 40 years, the BoE said.  The continued growth of employment could suggest that spare capacity is being eroded ... and, all else equal, reducing the MPC's tolerance of above-target inflation,  the BoE said. Key considerations for future rate rises would be inflation pressures, whether consumer demand stayed weak, and if other sources of demand such as exports and business investment grew to compensate, the central bank added.

Milligan,US,TOSHIBA,ACCOUNTING,Science,United States","sector":"Technology","content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) has sought a court injunction to prevent Toshiba Corp (6502.T) from selling its chip business without the U.S. firm's consent - a move that threatens to throw the fiercely contested auction into disarray. The escalation in the spat between Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, and its business partner follows tense last-minute jockeying by suitors for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND semiconductors. According to a person familiar with the matter, the California-based firm has been left out of a new Japan government-led group being formed to bid for the unit. Toshiba's  attempts to circumvent our contractual rights have left us with no choice but to take this action,  Western Digital's Chief Executive Steve Milligan said in a statement.  Left unchecked, Toshiba would pursue a course that clearly violates these rights,  he added. Western Digital has filed its suit with the Superior Court of California, seeking an injunction until its arbitration case against Toshiba is heard. It is concerned about how Toshiba, the Japanese government and other stakeholders are handling the auction process, a second source said. The second source added it had submitted a revised bid on Wednesday that satisfies Toshiba's requests on deal certainty and price but did not receive a favourable response. Toshiba has demanded at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations concerning the auction. Toshiba said in a statement that it was proceeding with selecting a preferred bidder for its memory unit by the second half of June as planned and hoped to reach a definitive agreement on a sale by June 28. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoToshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Satoru Oyama, senior principal analyst at research firm IHS, said Western Digital's argument made sense from a common-sense point of view and that developments were moving toward a worst-case scenario for the Japanese company.  Toshiba has more to lose in the dispute because it is running out of time,  he said.  Toshiba and Western Digital eventually have to talk. They cannot afford to keep fighting when Samsung is taking advantage of the NAND market boom and investing massively.  The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind cherry blossoms at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 11, 2017.Toru HanaiA third source familiar with the matter said Western Digital expects to get a ruling on its injunction request by mid-July and that arbitration cases generally take 16-24 months to resolve. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the center of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. It has been in talks with Bain Capital and the group now includes South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), sources have said.  INCJ was, however, also part of a proposed bid tabled by Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), other sources familiar with the matter have said.  Other bidders include Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O) computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest known bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said.

AIG and IBM completed a pilot of a so-called  smart contract  multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC which the companies said is the first of its kind using blockchain's digital ledger technology.  The Standard Chartered policy uses blockchain to facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. IBM has been partnering with leading companies in various industries, including Danish transport company Maersk, to create blockchain-based products that can streamline complex international dealings across sectors. The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company IBM (IBM) is seen on a computer screen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 22, 2016.Lucy NicholsonBlockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets or transactions across all industries. Multinational insurance coverage is often cumbersome because of a maze of international regulations, paperwork, and payment terms.  There's a lot of back and forth and it's all through email chains going around the world, instead of a centralized system,  Carol Barton, President of AIG Multinational said in an interview. A master policy is typically issued in the country where a company is headquartered, while affiliates often need coverage in other countries that impose varying rules, documentation, and payment terms. The real-time system allows companies, their units, and insurers, among others, to simultaneously share all data and documents about the policies, the companies said. It also notifies all of those involved about payments. The territories selected for Standard Chartered's coverage each introduced a level of complexity for testing the technology, IBM said.

Greece's largest listed property developer said its decision to buy HSBC Property's 50 percent stake in the Mall Athens for 200 million euros ($223 mln), and take full ownership, reflected its optimism about Greece's economic outlook. Its CEO Odisseas Athanassiou separately told the company's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday that the developer would transfer the mall and two other Greek shopping centres to its Lamda Malls subsidiary and then list the unit, but did not give a timeframe. Lamda Malls is 32 percent owned by Varde Partners, which bought its stake in April.  The 100 percent acquisition of the Mall Athens, one of the biggest investments in our country ... reflects our (confidence) in the long-term prospects of the Greek economy,  he said in a separate statement. More than 11 million people visit the Athens mall every year, which employs about 2,500 workers. The mall is valued at 381 million euros, Lamda said. Lamda is also leading a consortium of foreign investors which signed a deal in 2014 to turn Athens' former airport complex, a now sprawling wasteland, into one of Europe's biggest seaside resorts. On Thursday Lamda submitted the 7.9 billion euro development plan to Greek authorities for approval, a process expected to take at least nine months, Athanasiou told shareholders.

The ban will cover new and old buildings, and applies to private homes and businesses as well as publicly owned facilities, the Ministry of Climate and Environment announced.   Those using fossil oil for heating must find other options by 2020,  Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen said in a statement. Recommended alternatives to oil-based products include heat pumps, electricity from the country's hydroelectric grid and even special stoves burning wood chips, he added. The directive is set to cut Norway's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by an estimated 340,000 tonnes per year, compared to overall national emissions of 53.9 million tonnes in 2015, the ministry said. Under the Paris climate agreement, Norway plans to make sharp cuts in emissions by 2030. Norway's emissions were 3.3 percent above 1990 levels last year, despite past pledges of reductions. Additional measures could include limitations on the use of natural gas for heating, the ministry said. The fossil ban is a paradox for Norway, green groups say, as the country generates half its export revenues from crude oil and natural gas, lifting per-capita gross domestic product to around $70,000, one of the world's highest. Zero, a Norwegian foundation promoting emission cuts, applauded the decision.  This is a very important climate measure that significantly cuts emissions, sending a powerful signal that we are moving from fossil to renewable energy,  Zero said in a statement. Norway pumps about 2 million barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids per day, while its daily output of natural gas stands at around 300 million cubic meters.

The central bank kept its closely watched late liquidity window at 12.25 percent and its benchmark repo rate on hold at 8 percent, saying it would stick to a tight policy stance until the inflation outlook significantly improved. All 16 economists polled by Reuters had predicted the bank would leave those rates unchanged, as well as the overnight lending rate, at 9.25 percent, and the overnight borrowing rate, at 7.25 percent. Those were also unchanged. The lira strengthened immediately after the central bank's announcement before giving up gains later in the day. By 1413 GMT it was 3.5241 to the dollar, nearly 1 percent weaker on the day.  The central bank seems to be taking the need to tackle inflation more seriously than it has in the past,  said William Jackson, a senior economist with Capital Economics in London, in a note to clients.  Against this backdrop of strong growth this year and high inflation, the interest rate cuts that some now seem to be expecting this year are unlikely to materialise.  Inflation remained near an 8-1/2-year high last month, hitting 11.72 percent, official data has shown. Erdogan, who narrowly won sweeping executive powers in an April 16 referendum on changing the constitution, has described himself as an  enemy  of interest rates and repeatedly called on banks to lower lending costs to spur the economy. While annual inflation has neared 12 percent, the central bank has refrained from lifting its benchmark rate and has instead used the more obscure late liquidity window to tighten. That has boosted a perception that the bank is wary of making outright rate increases due to political pressure.  Although recent improvements in cost factors and (an) expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behaviour,  the bank said in a statement.  The central bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective.

Nitsche succeeds Justin O'Shea, who left Brioni in October 2016 after a six month stint. She will have responsibility for the collections and image of Brioni, whose suits once clothed movie character James Bond and have been favoured by former U.S. President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump. Prior to Brioni, Nitsche had been at Maison Martin Margiela, which she joined in 1989, working closely with the founding designer for 23 years. After Margiela's resignation, in 2009, Nitsche took over the creative direction of the brand.

The group does not publish individual figures for its smaller fashion brands, but Brioni has suffered from a drop in tourist numbers in Europe. It has also been impacted by lower Russian demand due to the rouble's devaluation. Brioni was founded by tailor Nazareno Fonticoli and entrepreneur Gaetano Savini in Rome in 1945.

Riyadh's stock index lost 0.5 percent after Brent crude dipped below $47 a barrel; all but one of the 14 listed petrochemical producers fell, with National Industrialization Co (Tasnee) dropping 3.7 percent. Jassim al-Jubran, senior equity analyst at Riyadh-based Aljazira Capital, said the stock market's losses were relatively small because most funds had been moving into shares that would benefit from any decision by index compiler MSCI next Tuesday to place Riyadh on review for possible upgrade to emerging market status.  Funds can withstand volatility in oil markets because they build long-term positions, and the MSCI review next week is higher on their list,  said Jubran. The largest bank by assets, National Commercial Bank , added 0.8 percent after its board recommended a cash dividend of 1.1 riyal per share for the first half of the year, up from the 0.6 riyal paid out for the prior-year period. The Saudi central bank responded to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike by lifting its reverse repo rate, at which commercial banks deposit money with the central bank, by the same amount to 1.25 percent but keeping its repo rate, used to lend money to banks, unchanged at 2.00 percent. This is expected to be net positive for Saudi banks' margins, but shares of other lenders were mostly lower on Thursday because the move had largely been priced in. Alawwal Bank fell 0.9 percent. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas was the most heavily traded share, surging 7.4 percent. The stock has soared 78 percent since the start of the month in unusually heavy trade. One Abu Dhabi-based stock broker, who declined to be named, told Reuters that he believed a strategic investor was building a position in the company. The second most active stock, developer Aldar Properties , dropped 3.3 percent, dragging the index 0.8 percent lower. The United Arab Emirates hiked key interest rates by 25 bps, which is expected to hurt companies with large debts. Aldar has outstanding total debt of 6 billion dirhams ($1.63 billion), with 1.12 billion due by the end of the year, according to its balance sheet. In Dubai, Emaar Properties climbed 1.3 percent to 8.0 dirhams after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to  overweight  from  equal weight  with a price target of 10.80 dirhams, up 23 percent from the previous target price. Emaar has been strong since it said two weeks ago it would spin off its local real estate unit and offer its shares to the public, giving the proceeds to its shareholders as a dividend. The Dubai index closed 0.3 percent higher. Qatar, Egypt Qatar's index rose 0.7 percent, gaining for two days straight for the first time since June 5 when four Arab states including Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha. The index is down 6.7 percent since that date. Foreign funds, which usually account for between one-fourth and one-fifth of total market turnover, provided almost half of market turnover on Thursday. Although they were net sellers of Qatari shares, it was by a small margin as some bought shares on dips. Some shares favoured by international funds surged, such as telecommunications operator Vodafone Qatar, which jumped 6.7 percent. Qatari banks, which have been beaten down by the sanctions, were mixed. Large-cap Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan fell 0.9 percent but Doha Bank rose 2.5 percent. After the market close Doha's central bank said it was raising its overnight deposit rates by 25 bps but it kept lending and repo rates unchanged - a move which should limit upward pressure on money market rates. In Egypt, Ezz Steel rose 0.5 percent, outperforming the index, which fell 0.2 percent. Late on Wednesday the country's largest steel maker told Reuters it could raise its production of rebar to its maximum capacity of 4.6 million tonnes per year if tariffs on imported rebar continued. Cairo imposed temporary tariffs on steel rebar from China, Turkey and Ukraine last week; they are set to last for four months, in order to protect local manufacturers hurt by imports.

In a video posted on Facebook, hundreds of emaciated Somalis and Ethiopians, including several children, are seen huddled in a concrete room in an unknown location in Libya.  The migrants and refugees being filmed say they have been beaten, tortured and held in cells without food, and that their parents and relatives have received video clips via social media asking for up to $10,000 to spare them from being killed.  They broke my teeth ... they broke my hand ... this stone has been put on me for the last three days,  says one man in the video posted last week, explaining how his captors placed a concrete block on his back as a punishment after his family refused to pay up $8,000.  At least 20,000 migrants are being detained in Libya, the main gateway for those attempting to reach Europe by sea, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Many are held and extorted for money by smugglers and gangs, and rising numbers are traded - in what they call slave markets - for forced labor and sexual exploitation, the U.N. agency says.  The IOM condemns the way that criminal gangs use social media in their shocking abuse of people held against their will and to extort money from their families back home,  said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM director of operations and emergencies.  This is a global problem where a smuggler or a criminal gang can easily use digital platforms to advertise their services, entice vulnerable people on the move and then exploit them and their families,  Abdiker said in a statement.  Several Senegalese migrants who were flown home by the IOM from Libya last week told the Thomson Reuters Foundation of the 'hell' they endured in detention, ranging from being beaten and starved to watching their peers die of hunger and illness.  The voyage from Libya across the Mediterranean to Italy - often on flimsy boats run by people smugglers - has become the main route to Europe for migrants from Africa after a European Union crackdown last year on sea crossings from Turkey. Smugglers in increasingly lawless Libya are packing record numbers of migrants onto boats, with sea arrivals to Italy so far this year - more than 61,000 people - up 35 percent on 2016.

Spotify, which recently hired advisers to explore a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported an operating loss of 349 million euros ($389 million) in 2016, up 47 percent compared with the previous year.  This is explained by substantial investments that have been made during the year, mostly in product development, international expansion and a general increase in personnel,  Spotify's Luxembourg-based holding company wrote in its regulatory filing on Thursday.   Revenue rose by more than 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros as paid subscribers increased to 48 million in 2016 from 28 million the previous year. Overall, the service said it now has 140 million monthly active users, against 126 million at the end of last year.   The company, which depends on acquiring content licenses from a limited number of music majors, struck a new deal with Vivendi-owned (VIV.PA) Universal Music in April.  The move could make the streaming platform more attractive to its top-selling artists, such Adele, Lady Gaga, Coldplay and Kanye West, by letting them release albums exclusively to premium users. American singer Taylor Swift recently made her music available again on Spotify and other streaming platforms.  Earphones are seen on a tablet screen with a Spotify logo on it, in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, February 20, 2014.Dado Ruvic/File PhotoSpotify is now hoping to strike deals with Sony Music and Warner Music in the run-up to a market listing, a source close to the matter said in May.

The company is working with investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Allen & Co to advise them on the process, the sources said.

Canadian manufacturing sales rose more than expected to a record level in April as sales of petroleum and coal products rebounded after two months of declines, data from Statistics Canada showed. The 1.1 percent advance topped economists' forecast for a gain of 0.7 percent.                    Prices of oil dropped to six-week lows, under pressure from high global inventories and doubts about OPEC's ability to implement agreed production cuts.           U.S. crude        prices were down 0.56 percent at $44.48 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies, supported by the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to boost interest rates further.                  At 9:25 a.m. ET (1325 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3275 to the greenback, or 75.33 U.S. cents, down 0.3 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3226 to C$1.3293.     On Wednesday, the loonie touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months at C$1.3165. It has gained 1.5 percent this week, helped by signals from the Bank of Canada that higher interest rates lie ahead.     Chances of a rate hike this year have surged to more than 90 percent from less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data on Friday.                The central bank, which had long said interest rates are too blunt a tool to tackle the country's housing market, may have finally decided to act and at least limit its role in fueling a potential bubble with low interest rates.                  Resales of Canadian homes dropped 6.2 percent in May from April as Toronto sales plunged 25.3 percent in the month as new housing policy changes sideswiped demand and new listings rose again, the Canadian Real Estate Association said.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 9 Canadian cents to yield 0.926 percent and the 10-year             falling 20 Canadian cents to yield 1.513 percent.     The gap between the 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.1 basis points to a spread of -43.5 basis points, its smallest since Feb. 27.

The S&P; 500 technology sector dropped 1.21 percent, led by declines in index heavyweights such as Apple , Microsoft and Facebook. The latest round of selloff in tech shares follows a two-day rout earlier this week. Investors have been locking in gains in a sector that had risen 16.7 percent this year, far outperforming other sectors.  Stocks have been at all-time highs and valuations are somewhat priced to perfection so a little bit of a pullback is not too surprising,  said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York.  We may see the market take a breather in the next few sessions, but it is not necessarily doom and gloom.  A Washington Post report that President Donald Trump was being investigated for possible obstruction of justice added to the jitters. All 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower. Amazon.com weighed the most on the consumer discretionary index. Defensive plays like utilities and telecom services brought up the rear. At 9:42 a.m. ET (1342 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 58.94 points, or 0.28 percent, at 21,315.62, the S&P; 500 was down 14.79 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,423.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 64.08 points, or 1.03 percent, at 6,130.81. Apart from raising interest rates and forecasting one more hike for 2017 on Wednesday, the Fed laid out its first clear outline to start trimming its $4.2 trillion balance sheet  relatively soon . While the rate hike was widely expected, a clutch of weak economic data, including Wednesday's poor inflation numbers, raised questions whether the U.S. economy was strong enough to withstand further tightening. Policymakers, however, viewed the soft data as transitory. Big banks including Bank of America, Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley fell about 1 percent. Clouston attributed the drop in bank stocks to worries about lagging U.S. inflation. Kroger was down 12.5 percent after the supermarket chain operator cut its full-year profit forecast. Mattel was down 7.2 percent at $20.63 after the toymaker cut its dividend. One bright spot was a Labor Department report that showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,039 to 580. On the Nasdaq, 1,754 issues fell and 584 advanced.

Europe is keen to diversify its energy supplies, and Greece wants to promote itself as a hub for the transit of gas from the eastern Mediterranean to the continent.  We agreed to expedite our joint actions concerning our agreement on the construction of a large project which will offer new prospects of economic cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean,  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told a news conference in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. He was flanked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Nicos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus. The planned 2,000-km (1,250-mile) pipeline aims to link gas fields off the coasts of Israel and Cyprus with Greece and possibly Italy, at a cost of up to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion).  Netanyahu said the so-called East-Med Pipeline  would be a revolution .  We've had preliminary studies of it and it seems promising and we're going to look further into it.

Along with the European market, it is exploring options to export to Turkey, Egypt and Jordan.

Delivery options have included a pipeline linking the three countries, a pipeline to Turkey, and use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage in Egypt for shipment to Europe. The three leaders said they would also pursue the development of an electricity cable linking their countries. The EuroAsia Interconnector will carry electricity generated in Israel and sent via Cyprus, the Greek island of Crete and mainland Greece to European grids. A Greek government official said Greece had proposed adding fiber optic cables estimated to boost the cost by 10 percent. It has secured funding of 1.5 billion euros from the European Union and viability studies have been completed.

We do realise that there are hard decisions to be made ... that may require that we look at further cuts to government spending and programmes,  Gigaba told a news conference. The Treasury was committed to the fiscal target it announced when the annual budget was adopted in February, he said. Gigaba said hard economic times were affecting the Treasury's plan to expand the economy.  In this context, our 2017 growth projection of 1.3 percent may not be realised,  he said.  This continues the trend of low growth over the last several years, undermining our progress in significantly reducing inequality, unemployment and poverty.  South Africa entered recession for the first time in eight years, data showed on June 6, putting pressure on the government just as it must cope with credit downgrades and Zuma faces corruption allegations. Political instability, high unemployment and the ratings downgrades have dented business and consumer confidence in South Africa. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7 percent.  We are committed to restoring ... a favourable investment grade rating with a positive outlook as quickly as possible,  Gigaba said, adding that Zuma and several cabinet ministers had met last night to discuss ways to revamp the economy. Pressure on Zuma, including from within the ruling African National Congress, has risen since a controversial cabinet reshuffle in March that led to downgrades to  junk  status by S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch and allegations of influence peddling. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing over the allegations. Moody's on Friday lowered South Africa's rating to the bottom of the investment grade table with a negative outlook, citing the cabinet reshuffle. A member of the central bank's monetary policy committee said cutting interest rates was not the answer to dragging South Africa's economy out of recession because deep economic weakness and political turmoil need to be addressed first. Nicky Weimar, senior economist at Nedbank, said Gigaba's actions did not gone far enough and that the government lacked the political capital to introduce taxes as it had  a massive credibility issue  with South Africans.  The first problem is the lack of specifics in the plan but if they do go further in cutting spending and eliminating wastage that's a positive,  Weimar said.

While the advocate general's comments are not binding, judges follow them in most cases. The ruling could cause conflict as British Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to make the legal changes necessary to stop the European court from delivering legally binding judgments on the country which is set to leave the EU in 2019. In a case brought by the English Bridge Union, the advocate general said bridge was a sport because it required mental effort as part of a challenge, noting that European Union law had no definition of sport beyond excluding games of chance. EU law requires proof of benefits to physical or mental well being for a sport to claim VAT exemption. To insist that only physical activity was required would exclude recognized sports such as shooting and archery, the adviser said. Britain's tax collectors, HM Revenue and Customs, had refused to reimburse the English Bridge Union for VAT payments on entry fees to tournaments. So-called duplicate bridge is considered a sport by the tax authorities of Austria, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, but not by Ireland and Sweden.  Played by four individuals in two teams, in clubs, tournaments, and online, it was classified as a sport by the International Olympic Committee in 1998. Last year, the European Court of Justice faced criticism from Britons who campaigned to leave the European Union before the June 2016 referendum, with the official  Vote Leave  group saying Britain lost most of its cases to the court. However, the court has backed London on cases involving challenges to British welfare rules and has upheld sanctions on Russia also challenged by Moscow that Britain strongly supports.

Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party lost seats to the Scottish Conservatives in an election last week, has long complained about May's approach to governing, saying the prime minister ignored Scotland's demands in her Brexit plan. May is due to start crucial negotiations to leave the European Union next week. But following last week's failed election gamble, she has lost her parliamentary majority and is trying to reach an agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party.  (The Conservatives) are now putting the country in hock to the DUP,  Sturgeon said.   In the space of less than a year they have jeopardized the economic security of the UK, running the risk of making the UK a laughing stock internationally and, as if that wasn't bad enough, putting the Irish peace process at risk into the bargain,  she said, in a rowdy session at Scotland's devolved parliament. Former Prime Minister John Major warned this week that May's plan to govern with the support of the DUP risked convincing 'hard men' on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland to return to violence. A deal with the DUP would increase the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. Sturgeon also declined to say whether or not she would back down on her push to hold another Scottish independence referendum, which appeared to have eroded support for her party in last week's national election.  She has said she will reflect on the issue. Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.

Milligan,US,TOSHIBA,ACCOUNTING,Science,United States","sector":"Technology","content":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) has sought a court injunction to prevent Toshiba Corp (6502.T) from selling its chip business without the U.S. firm's consent - a move that threatens to throw the fiercely contested auction into disarray. The escalation in the spat between Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, and its business partner follows tense last-minute jockeying by suitors for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND semiconductors. According to a person familiar with the matter, the California-based firm has been left out of a new Japan government-led group being formed to bid for the unit. Toshiba's  attempts to circumvent our contractual rights have left us with no choice but to take this action,  Western Digital's Chief Executive Steve Milligan said in a statement.  Left unchecked, Toshiba would pursue a course that clearly violates these rights,  he added. Western Digital has filed its suit with the Superior Court of California, seeking an injunction until its arbitration case against Toshiba is heard. It is concerned about how Toshiba, the Japanese government and other stakeholders are handling the auction process, a second source said. The second source added it had submitted a revised bid on Wednesday that satisfies Toshiba's requests on deal certainty and price but did not receive a favourable response. Toshiba has demanded at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations concerning the auction. Toshiba said in a statement that it was proceeding with selecting a preferred bidder for its memory unit by the second half of June as planned and hoped to reach a definitive agreement on a sale by June 28. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoToshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Satoru Oyama, senior principal analyst at research firm IHS, said Western Digital's argument made sense from a common-sense point of view and that developments were moving toward a worst-case scenario for the Japanese company.  Toshiba has more to lose in the dispute because it is running out of time,  he said.  Toshiba and Western Digital eventually have to talk. They cannot afford to keep fighting when Samsung is taking advantage of the NAND market boom and investing massively.  The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind cherry blossoms at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 11, 2017.Toru HanaiA third source familiar with the matter said Western Digital expects to get a ruling on its injunction request by mid-July and that arbitration cases generally take 16-24 months to resolve. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the center of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. It has been in talks with Bain Capital and the group now includes South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), sources have said.  INCJ was, however, also part of a proposed bid tabled by Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), other sources familiar with the matter have said.  Other bidders include Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O) computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest known bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said.

The weakening is caused by selling against the dollar, because the Fed projected further rate hikes yesterday,  one Budapest-based dealer said.  This pulls them (regional currencies) down against the euro as well.      In global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and guidance for more to come helped the dollar rebound following a drop prompted by an unexpected slowing of U.S. inflation and retail sales in May.     Dollar buying often weakens currencies in emerging markets, including the European Union's eastern members.     The zloty led the fall in illiquid international trade as domestic markets were closed due to a national holiday in Poland. It shed 0.75 percent by 1309 GMT, to trade at 4-week lows at 4.225.     The forint weakened by 0.7 percent.     The zloty is still near 2-year highs and the forint close to 8-month highs. Regional currencies and stocks are mostly supported by robust growth and stability.     Budapest's main index led a fall triggered by risk aversion on Thursday. It fell 0.9 percent, retreating from Wednesday's record highs.     The Czech crown shed a quarter of percent.     Trading at 26.233, it is still near its strongest levels since late 2013, touched on Wednesday. It is buoyed by a robust economy and expectations for central bank rate hikes later this year or next.     Investors in the Czech Republic usually shrug off domestic political news, like Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka's announcement on Wednesday that he would step down as the leader of his Social Democrat party.     Romania's ruling Social Democrats, meanwhile, withdrew their support from their own government late on Wednesday, leading to political turmoil. President Klaus Iohannis urged the ruling party to resolve the crisis with a no-confidence vote in parliament if Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu is unwilling to resign.     The leu's reaction was muted, declining just 0.2 percent to 4.5895, off a four-year low touched at 4.592. It was underperforming in the region even before the latest political turmoil.     It has been under pressure over concerns that the leftist government's wage hikes and tax cuts could boost the budget deficit and stoke inflation by next year.      Further (currency) appreciation is rather unlikely in the coming months in our CEE universe, apart from the Czech Republic, where monetary tightening could add to the strength of the koruna,  Erste analysts said in a note.      The other end of the spectrum is Romania, where fiscal woes could weigh on the currency in the coming quarters,  they added.

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 1.6 percent from May 2016, while home prices were up 17.9 percent from a year earlier, according to the group's home price index. It was the first full month of housing resale data since the province of Ontario introduced a 16-point plan to rein in the hot housing market in Toronto, Canada's largest city, amid fears of a bubble. The changes included a 15-percent foreign buyers tax similar to one imposed in Vancouver in 2016.  (The results) provide clear evidence that the changes have resulted in more balanced housing markets throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe region (around Toronto),” said Gregory Klump, CREA's chief economist.  For housing markets in the region, May sales activity was down most in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) and Oakville. This suggests the changes have squelched speculative home purchases,  Klump added. The industry group said the drop in sales pushed the sales-to-new listings ratio out of sellers' territory and back into balance for the first time since late 2015. The ratio fell to 56.3 percent in May, down from 60.2 percent in April and about 10 percentage points below the first three months of the year. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is consistent with a balanced housing market. CREA also upgraded its forecast for sales and prices, saying it expects less of a slowdown in 2017 than it predicted three months ago given the strong first quarter. Home sales were forecast to fall 1.5 percent to 527,400 units this year and dip 0.8 percent in 2018. In March, CREA had forecast a 3 percent drop in sales in 2017 and a 1 percent decline in 2018. The national average price was forecast to rise 7.4 percent to C$526,000 in 2017 and climb 1.8 percent in 2018, CREA said. That's up from a March forecast for a 4.8 percent price increase in 2017, but the 2018 forecast was trimmed from a previous 5 percent expected increase. CREA said some buyers may find themselves priced out of the market entirely in Toronto and Vancouver, where single family homes are in short supply.

Trump,James Boasberg,Dave Archambault,Donald J. Trump,James Boasberg,NORTHDAKOTA,PIPELINE/DAPL (UPDATE 3,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Wednesday, opening up the possibility that the line could be shut at a later date. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington said the Army Corps did not adequately consider the effects of a possible oil spill on the fishing and hunting rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Operations of Energy Transfer Partners LP's pipeline have not been suspended but that could be considered at a later date, the order said. The $3.8 billion line began interstate crude oil delivery in May. The parties are expected to meet Boasberg next Wednesday to discuss future steps. The Standing Rock Sioux are expected to argue that pipeline operations should be halted. The judge said in a 91-page decision that, while the Army Corps substantially complied with the National Environmental Policy Act, federal permits issued for the pipeline violated the law in some respects, saying in a court order the Corps did not  adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice.   To remedy those violations, the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its environmental analysis upon remand by the Court,  the judge said. The tribe had sued the Army Corps over its approval of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, arguing the line could contaminate their water source, the Missouri River.  We applaud the courts for protecting our laws and regulations from undue political influence, and will ask the Court to shut down pipeline operations immediately,” Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement. It was unclear whether the judge would agree that the line should be shut. Independent research firm Clearview Energy Partners of Washington D.C. noted in a comment late on Wednesday that Judge Boasberg's order pointed to  omissions  in the Corps' analysis, which the Corps may be able to address quickly, rather than larger errors that might require more study.  We think that the Corps may be able to persuade the court to allow Dakota Access to continue operating while the omissions are addressed and the court reviews them for adequacy,  they wrote. ETP was not immediately available for comment. In February, the Army Corps of Engineers granted the final easement needed to finish the controversial pipeline, which had been delayed for several months after protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and climate activists. The controversial pipeline needed a final permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River. Two previous arguments by the Standing Rock tribe - that the construction had threatened sacred sites, and that the presence of oil in the pipeline would damage sacred waters, had been rejected by the court. President Donald Trump issued an executive order days after being sworn in directing the Army Corps to smooth the path to finishing the line, prompting complaints by the tribe and environmental groups that it had not done an adequate environmental review.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/northdakota-pipeline-dapl-idUSL1N1JB2N0"},

The project to construct four nuclear reactors has repeatedly run into delays, including being briefly halted after Turkey downed a Russian jet near the Syrian border in November 2015. Ties have since normalised between the two countries and work on the plant has resumed. It is now expected to be completed by 2023 and should meet 6-7 percent of Turkey's electricity demand once it is fully operational, energy watchdog EPDK said in a statement. Rosatom has sold several nuclear reactors to developing countries under a model by which Russia finances, builds and operates the nuclear plant and sells power to its customer - a model that has also raised questions about Russia using energy policy as a means to political ends. EPDK said it had given Rosatom's project company Akkuyu Nukleer AS a 49-year production license. Dependant on imports for almost all of its energy, Turkey has embarked on an ambitious nuclear programme, commissioning Rosatom in 2013 to build the four 1,200 megawatt (MW) reactors. With Turkey's energy imports costing about $50 billion annually and its energy demand among the fastest-growing in Europe, Ankara wants at least 5 percent of its electricity generation to come from nuclear energy in under a decade, cutting dependency on natural gas largely bought from Russia. Rosatom initially pledged to have the first of the four reactors in Akkuyu ready by 2019 before it suffered delays. EPDK said on Thursday that Akkuyu Nukleer had agreed to accelerate construction so that all four reactors would be built by 2023, the centenary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic, rather than 2025 as previously agreed by Russia and Turkey.

The Polisario Front alleges the 50,000 tonne shipment en route to New Zealand was illegally taken from Western Sahara territory and went to court to have the cargo seized. The case is a test of Polisario's new legal tactic in its long-running conflict with Morocco over Western Sahara, a disputed territory where the two sides fought a war until a 1991 ceasefire and where U.N. talks have failed to reach an accord. The Marshall Island-flagged NM Cherry Blossom was detained under a civil maritime court order in South Africa's Port Elizabeth last month as part of Polisario's attempt to take advantage of a European court ruling last year that Western Sahara should not be considered part of Morocco in EU and Moroccan deals. The ship was carrying 50,000 tonnes of phosphate to New Zealand from Laayoune in the Moroccan-controlled part of the disputed territory for Morocco's OCP phosphate export company.  It will take some months before any trial can be heard,  said Andre Bowley, lawyer for the Polisario Front in South Africa.  For the foreseeable future the ship remains exactly where it is until our court case is determined or someone puts up security,  he told Reuters of the cargo valued at around $5 million. While the case must still go to trial, Polisario called the initial court decision a victory.  This is a historic moment for the Saharawi people and we hope the final judgment will contribute to the protection of our natural resources,  said Kamal Fadel, a Polisario representative. OCP, the world's leading phosphate exporter, said the South African court decision contradicted international law. Polisario's complaint was  a political matter disguised as a legal claim,  it said in a statement. A Panama court this month dismissed another case by the Polisario to block a phosphate cargo in Panama, saying there was no evidence it belonged to the group and that a domestic court was not the venue to judge political matters. The Port Elizabeth High Court said the core of the case was whether the Polisario movement had made a prima facie case that it owned the phosphate cargo and for an interim order granted in May to stand. It ordered that the five respondents, including the owner of the ship, the buyer of the cargo and OCP, were restrained from removing the cargo.

Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party lost seats to the Scottish Conservatives in an election last week, has long complained about May's approach to governing, saying the prime minister ignored Scotland's demands in her Brexit plan. May is due to start crucial negotiations to leave the European Union next week. But following last week's failed election gamble, she has lost her parliamentary majority and is trying to reach an agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party.  (The Conservatives) are now putting the country in hock to the DUP,  Sturgeon said.   In the space of less than a year they have jeopardized the economic security of the UK, running the risk of making the UK a laughing stock internationally and, as if that wasn't bad enough, putting the Irish peace process at risk into the bargain,  she said, in a rowdy session at Scotland's devolved parliament. Former Prime Minister John Major warned this week that May's plan to govern with the support of the DUP risked convincing 'hard men' on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland to return to violence. A deal with the DUP would increase the influence of pro-British unionists who have struggled for years with Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland. Sturgeon also declined to say whether or not she would back down on her push to hold another Scottish independence referendum, which appeared to have eroded support for her party in last week's national election.  She has said she will reflect on the issue. Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.

The new unit will be led by co-heads Alexander von zur Muhlen and Mark Fedorcik, based in Frankfurt and New York, respectively. Fedorcik will in addition continue as head of corporate finance Americas and co-head of CIB Americas. Both will report to Garth Ritchie and Marcus Schenck, co-heads of CIB, who were appointed to head up the new division in March. ECM veteran Mark Hantho has been made chairman of GCM, focusing on client coverage and large transactions. “From one unit, GCM will offer clients access to the bank’s expertise in financing and risk management solutions,” said Ritchie and Schenck in a memo sent to CIB staff and seen by IFR. The memo said Hantho would “help us to form a key client coverage group for corporates in the coming weeks”. GCM will be run as a joint venture with the bank’s existing corporate finance, equities and fixed income and currencies businesses. It will also work closely with the institutional client group. The latter will be co-headed globally by Kenan Altunis and Stefan Hoops. They will report to Ritchie and Schenck. Hoops will keep his current role as head of equities and fixed income and currencies in Germany. Within corporate finance, Deutsche said it wanted to create “global industry groups principally co-led from our hubs in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific, which will work in partnership with the country coverage teams that maintain strong local relationships”. The unit will be run globally by existing regional heads Fedorcik in the Americas, James McMurdo in Asia Pacific and Alasdair Warren across Europe, Middle East and Africa. Each region will also have a head of corporate banking coverage: Niels Ackerman for EMEA; Stefan James in the Americas, and a yet-to-be-appointed person in Asia Pacific. Chris Whitman, a former treasurer of the bank as well as senior capital markets banker, will be head of financial resource management. This unit would “be responsible for allocating the bank’s balance sheet to CIB businesses according to client selection decisions and market opportunities,” the memo said. Schenck and Ritchie said it would “ensure that we allocate capital efficiently, across both the banking and trading books”.

Alexandre Bompard will take the reins on July 18. I am convinced he will do very well. I want to welcome him,  Plassat told the company's annual shareholders meeting, to applause. Referring to Bompard, who attended the meeting but did not address shareholders, Plassat told Reuters:  Carrefour is in goods hands.  Last week, Carrefour confirmed it had chosen Bompard as its new chairman and chief executive to succeed Plassat, who has been at the helm since 2012. Europe's largest retailer had been searching since October for a successor to Plassat, 68, whose mandate as chairman and chief executive was due to expire in May 2018. Investors want Carrefour's new boss, who currently heads French retailer Fnac Darty, to boost the performance of the French hypermarkets, a task where others have struggled or failed, and to do more in terms of its digital businesses.  Not Stellar but Good  Since taking the reins, Plassat's tenure saw signs of a recovery at Carrefour as he focused on price cuts, expanding into convenience shops and renovating stores. Plassat, credited with saving Carrefour from a possible break-up, leaves a group which has progressed in most of Europe and in Brazil, its second-largest market, but has had a more sluggish performance in its biggest market which is France. In March, Carrefour reported its first fall in operating profit since 2012, with the company's performance hampered by its struggling French hypermarkets division.  Carrefour has returned to growth. The figures are not stellar but they are good. The group can look to the future with much confidence,  Plassat told shareholders, to loud applause. Shareholders also approved a second board seat for Peninsula, the family holding company of Brazilian billionaire Abilio Diniz, who is Carrefour's third-largest shareholder. Carrefour shares, which fell 14 percent last year, are up around 2 percent so far in 2017 - underperforming a 7 percent rise on France's benchmark CAC-40 index.

The remote region in Nangarhar province was most famously used by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in late 2001, in a bid to hold out against the U.S. troops and Afghan allies who toppled the Taliban regime. Now Afghan officials say Islamic State militants have seized cave complexes in Tora Bora, after days of fighting against Taliban who had been based there.  Those areas around Tora Bora were a Taliban stronghold, but now Daesh militants captured them during fighting,  the police commander in the area, Shah Wali, told Reuters, using an Arabic term for Islamic State. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid acknowledged that Islamic State forces had managed to capture several villages, but he denied that they had seized Tora Bora. General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has vowed to defeat Islamic State there this year, and in April used one of the largest conventional bombs ever dropped in combat to target a cave complex used by Islamic State in the nearby district of Achin.  After Achin, Daesh was looking for a second stronghold and now they have it,  Wali said. Abu Omar Khorasani, an Islamic State commander in Afghanistan, told Reuters that his fighters had seized Tora Bora and were also battling government troops, who are backed by U.S. ground troops and aircraft.  We are in Tora Bora but this is not the end,  Khorasani said.  The plan is to take more territory from the government and the Taliban.   The fighting has sent hundreds of families fleeing, said Malek Tor, a tribal elder who put the number of Islamic State fighters in the area in the hundreds. An official with the U.S. military command in Kabul said Islamic State forces are  on the run  and  are attempting to take refuge  in the Tora Bora region.  No matter where they are, there is no safe haven for them in Afghanistan,  the official said in a statement.  We will continue toward our goal of defeating ISIS-K in Afghanistan this year and ending their barbaric campaign of death, torture and violence against the Afghan people.   Government forces have launched new operations targeting Islamic State, but more fighters are being recruited or crossing the border from Pakistan, said Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the Nangarhar governor's office.  You kill one Daesh fighter and 10 more come from the border or are recruited here,  he said.

Some 200 Democrats in Congress on Wednesday filed the third lawsuit claiming Donald Trump violated a constitutional ban on accepting presents. All the accusers face long odds, though, of proving they were hurt directly or that the suits even belong in court. Impeachment is still probably the only way for Trump's opponents to get him to fold. The cases are theoretically compelling. They’re based on two provisions of the Constitution that prohibit officeholders from accepting “emoluments” – gifts, princely titles and such – from foreign governments or, in the case of the domestic emoluments clause, states. Both clauses target any temptation for the president or others to skew policies in favor of governments that, in effect, grease their palms. Think of it as the nation’s first conflicts-of-interest prohibition. Trump’s sprawling empire of real estate, hotels and golf courses creates all kinds of conflicts. Its condominium and shopping-mall projects abroad, for example, may tempt foreign officials to offer cheap financing, reduced taxes or occupancy guarantees in exchange for aid or policy concessions. Trump properties in the United States raise similar opportunities for state officials or for foreign leaders who may want to curry favor with the president by, say, staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., rather than the Marriott down the street. There’s no evidence these conflicts have influenced the president, but he implicitly acknowledged the problem by putting his adult sons in control of The Trump Organization and hiring two ethics monitors. Neither step is a solution. As Apple or any other company that accepted monitoring in settling a lawsuit could attest, monitors lack power beyond making recommendations, and in this case, no monitor could tell whether Panama, for example, had tried to help Trump by cutting the taxes his hotel pays. Enter the lawsuits. In their attempts to keep Trump from violating the emoluments clauses, they face the same obstacle: standing. This refers to the legal concept that allows people to sue only if they can show that they were actually hurt by an unlawful act, and that a court can help fix the damage. It’s designed essentially to keep courts from wasting their time on speculative cases. In January, the public watchdog CREW – Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington – sued, claiming it had standing because it was forced to spend time and money on the lawsuit. Suspecting this sounded circular, in April it added restaurants and others as plaintiffs, who argued that they were hurt by having to compete with Trump businesses that could lure customers with the unspoken possibility of pleasing the president. On Monday, Maryland and D.C. jumped in, filing a lawsuit that claimed companies they or their residents owned or financed suffered from Trump enterprises’ unfair advantage, and that local officials felt undue pressure to compete with other states for Trump business. The lawmakers’ suit filed on Wednesday takes yet another tack. It argues that the president is violating congressional approval rights over emoluments by accepting foreign gifts without their consent. It’s probably true that competing with Trump businesses is a lot harder since the president took office, and foreign dignitaries probably see the upside of patronizing his hotels and such. The plaintiffs in the first two cases have probably been hurt. But standing requires more: that officials felt compelled to stay at the Trump International specifically because they wanted to give the president a payment – an emolument – not because they just wanted to curry favor with him in some general way. In other words, the harm must result from the unlawful payment rather than unfair competition. That could be tough to prove. What’s more, standing requires that a court be able to fix the damage. If, as the first two lawsuits ask, a judge blocked Trump from receiving payments from foreign officials at his hotels, it’s far from clear that the officials would stop booking rooms there and shift their business to the companies that sued him. There may be an even bigger problem. Courts won’t hear cases that raise issues best resolved through the political process – voting, legislation and the like. A good example can be a dispute that affects the entire nation rather than specific individuals. Violations of the emoluments clauses seem to fit the bill, because they undermine the right of all Americans to a president untainted by conflicts of interest. The third lawsuit looks especially odd. It argues that Congress can’t exercise its constitutional right to approve foreign gifts to the president unless it knows what those gifts are – a clever play for Trump’s tax returns. Again, though, the emoluments clauses target potential bribery and corruption, and, especially for Congress, there’s a pretty clear way to address a president’s “bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” It is, of course, impeachment. The obstacles to impeachment, assuming it were even justified, are obvious in a Congress where both houses are controlled by the president's own party. That, however, doesn’t improve the odds of success for any of these three lawsuits. If Trump's opponents want to call him to account, it will take a lot more than clever lawyering.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

A spokesman for the acquisitive insurance giant, which made headlines with its 2015 purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, said banks were still distributing its products. Bloomberg earlier reported that Chinese authorities had asked lenders to suspend some business dealings with Anbang. That report cited an unnamed source and did not give details on what type of business dealings with Anbang banks were asked to suspend. China's banking regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Anbang, one of China's most aggressive buyers of overseas assets, said early on Wednesday that Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties. Last week, the company denied reports that Wu had been barred from leaving China. Wu was detained by authorities last Friday, people familiar with the matter said. None of the sources wanted to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. Two days earlier, Wu had presided over a large internal meeting that appeared to be business as usual, said a person who was there. Anbang, which said it is operating normally in Wu's absence, distributes insurance through multiple channel types. According to its annual report, 88 percent of its insurance sales last year were through banks. The insurer has spent more than $30 billion in the past two years acquiring insurers, luxury hotels and other property assets. But it has faced increasing pushback in its offshore deal-making amid a broader decline in Chinese outbound acquisitions. Beijing has strengthened curbs over capital outflows after China's leadership vowed to curb risk in its financial system.  Industry Scrutiny China's big insurers have attracted regulatory attention for their aggressive acquisitions of overseas assets, while using client money derived from high-yield investment products sold to consumers. This has particularly jarred with authorities concerned about an economy over-reliant on credit. In a speech late last year, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Liu Shiyu criticized the prevalence of  abnormal  highly-leveraged acquisitions by insurers and other financial companies, and that in some instances, their use of funds of  improper origins  represented the  retrogression and decay  of human nature and business ethics. In April, President Xi Jinping ordered more to be done to rid Chinese financial firms of excessive risk.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters building of Anbang Insurance Group are pictured in Beijing, China, August 25, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoZhuang Deshui, deputy director at Peking University's Clean Government Center, said the anti-corruption crackdown directed at the financial industry was aimed at breaking up vested interest groups, including Communist Party officials, who had abused their power for financial gain while obstructing key reforms. 'Sold Out' Employees at several Chinese banks contacted by Reuters on Thursday said they had stopped selling some Anbang products, in some cases several months ago and also because the products had  sold out . The head of a Beijing branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (601398.SS) said Anbang's 3-year universal insurance products with guaranteed principal and interest were very popular last year, with interest rates at 3-4 percent.  FILE PHOTO: The headquarters building of Anbang Insurance Group are pictured in Beijing, China, August 25, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoBut since receiving a notice from its headquarters in the third quarter of 2016, it had stopped selling Anbang products, the bank official said, adding that reasons behind the suspension were not disclosed.  A sales representative at a sub-branch of CITIC Bank (601998.SS) in the eastern city of Hangzhou said sales of nearly all Anbang products had been suspended since late May. Only a 5-year insurance product with a relatively low yield of more than 4 percent was being sold, the agent said. ICBC and CITIC Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The head of a Beijing branch of Bank of Hangzhou (600926.SS) said it had not received any notice on suspending sales of Anbang products, which were still for sale. The bank did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Last month, Anbang Life Insurance (IPO-ABLF.HK) was barred from issuing new products for three months for  disrupting market order  by designing a product that bypassed regulations aimed at curbing growth in risky, short-term, universal life insurance products. Anbang Life at the start of the year had begun to shift its sales away from universal life to traditional products, generating premiums in the first quarter that topped full-year 2016 totals.   Anbang has 1.97 trillion yuan ($290 billion)in assets, according to its website.

Eugenio Ambrosi, EU director at the IOM, the United Nations' migration body, was speaking before a summit of EU leaders next week that is due to discuss efforts to stop African migrants from traveling to Europe from Libya and to seek a way out of their stalemate over the hosting of asylum seekers.  There is an effort, and that should be increased, to ensure and improve the level of protection of the migrants that are currently in Libya,  Ambrosi told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday. The Libya-Italy route is now the one most heavily used by people trying to reach Europe. The United Nations says more than 1,850 have perished in the Mediterranean this year trying to make the crossing. Ambrosi put the total number of migrants currently in Libya at 800,000. He said the IOM had flown 4,600 migrants home from Libya so far this year and aims to increase that to 12,000. The migrants being returned, mostly to sub-Saharan Africa, have often been staying in camps run by the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. EU officials compare conditions in them to war-time camps. Ambrosi, who is in charge of channeling EU money to help migrants in Libya - a strategy the bloc hopes would discourage them from trying to cross the sea - said he expected arrivals in Italy this year slightly above the 181,000 who came in 2016.  Italy still has the possibility of receiving the number of migrants they are receiving, but unless this responsibility-sharing kicks in efficiently, they will soon reach a saturation point,  he said.  Lack of Eu Solidarity Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have arrived in the EU across the Mediterranean since 2014. That figure pales in comparison with the EU's population of half a billion people but the influx caught the bloc by surprise and triggered internal battles among member states.  For me the crisis is not the numbers that arrive. The crisis is the inability to properly respect and implement that (solidarity) principle,  Ambrosi said, adding his voice to calls for a fairer burden sharing among EU member states. The EU's executive has opened legal cases against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in people to help frontline peers Italy and Greece. The easterners cite security concerns.  At a certain point the majority of EU countries will have to take a bold decision on the issue of solidarity because that's the key to why we Europeans got together, no? Otherwise, why are we here?  said Ambrosi, an Italian national. His comments are likely to annoy some former communist states in eastern Europe. Nationalist-minded governments, especially in Poland and Hungary, have vowed not to yield to Brussels and western EU states that espouse more liberal views. The spat over migration precipitated a broader clash over basic values in the EU. Some say the easterners should see their generous EU handouts cut in retribution. Others warn that would only deepen divides and fuel euroscepticism, which already triggered Brexit. In Libya, the weakness of the Tripoli government means militias and other groups control much of the country, greatly complicating efforts to help the migrants, but the EU has nevertheless engaged with Tripoli, training its coast guard and offering other support. The EU has been criticized by rights groups for trying to keep people in places where their lives are at peril. EU officials privately also fret at dealing with institutions in Libya they see as often closely intertwined with armed groups, criminal gangs and people smugglers.  (But) I would ask what would be the alternative,  Ambrosi said.  Unless somebody convinces me that there is a viable alternative that can achieve the same or more, I don't see what else can be done.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington said the Army Corps did not adequately consider the effects of a possible oil spill on the fishing and hunting rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.  Operations of Energy Transfer Partners LP's (ETP.N) pipeline have not been suspended but that could be considered at a later date, the order said. The $3.8 billion line began interstate crude oil delivery in May. The parties are expected to meet Boasberg next Wednesday to discuss future steps. The Standing Rock Sioux are expected to argue that pipeline operations should be halted. The judge said in a 91-page decision that, while the Army Corps substantially complied with the National Environmental Policy Act, federal permits issued for the pipeline violated the law in some respects, saying in a court order the Corps did not  adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice.    To remedy those violations, the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its environmental analysis upon remand by the Court,  the judge said.  The tribe had sued the Army Corps over its approval of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, arguing the line could contaminate their water source, the Missouri River.  We applaud the courts for protecting our laws and regulations from undue political influence, and will ask the Court to shut down pipeline operations immediately,” Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement. It was unclear whether the judge would agree that the line should be shut. Independent research firm Clearview Energy Partners of Washington D.C. noted in a comment late on Wednesday that Judge Boasberg's order pointed to  omissions  in the Corps' analysis, which the Corps may be able to address quickly, rather than larger errors that might require more study.  We think that the Corps may be able to persuade the court to allow Dakota Access to continue operating while the omissions are addressed and the court reviews them for adequacy,  they wrote.      ETP was not immediately available for comment. In February, the Army Corps of Engineers granted the final easement needed to finish the controversial pipeline, which had been delayed for several months after protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and climate activists. The controversial pipeline needed a final permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River.  Two previous arguments by the Standing Rock tribe - that the construction had threatened sacred sites, and that the presence of oil in the pipeline would damage sacred waters, had been rejected by the court. President Donald Trump issued an executive order days after being sworn in directing the Army Corps to smooth the path to finishing the line, prompting complaints by the tribe and environmental groups that it had not done an adequate environmental review.

On Opposition, Street Protests  I'm ready for a dialogue with everyone who really aims for the people's life improvement, aims for the country's problems resolution but not exploit the current problems - there are enough problems always and everywhere - for his own political PR... for abusing these difficulties.   They (opposition) only exploit the problems. One has to offer a solution, not to exploit it. Those who offer solutions, those are the people who deserve the closest attention and they have the rights for a dialogue with the government.   The street protests always emerge as part of democratic procedures. This is a good way of letting authorities know your point of view. One thing is to organise the protests, another is to use it as a provocation tool. This is not being done to improve the situation in the country.  On Successor  First of all, I'm still working. Secondly, I want to say that the voter, the Russian people, should choose it. Of course, I myself will make a decision at some point... The bottom line is that, we should not forget about it, that the voter, the Russian citizen, only he is able to decide who will take over the region, the district, the city... or the country.  On Soccer World Cup, Domestic League  The international level and class experts say our team will not play (proper) football: there are too many foreign players and too little attention to the youth's football development.  On Moscow Housing Renovation Plans  We are talking about the housing fund which will turn into dilapidated and dangerous housing in 10 to 15 years and the Muscovites will suffer as much as other regions. I hope that it will be performed in line with the (recently) adopted legislation while taking into account of the peoples' interests.  On Syria, Crimea Bridge  We aim to establish a political settlement process (in Syria) between all the sides involved. Our task for the near future is to increase the capability of the Syrian Republic army itself, by providing the possibility for it to act on its own effectively.   The Crimea bridge is being built on schedule and even slightly ahead of it. There is no doubt that all the plans will be implemented according to the schedule and with the due quality.   It's not enough just to build the bridge. Countries which are interested in it - and there are such countries - should be invited to finance it.  On Ex-Fbi Director Comey  (The) ex-FBI director said that he believed Russia meddled into the voting process. He didn't provide any evidence once again, but says there was an influence on our minds, on how we should act. While this constant American propaganda... direct allocation of money for this, isn't it an influence on our minds, on how we should act on voting campaigns?   He suddenly said that he taped his talk with the president, and then passed this conversation to media via his friend. This sounds strange, when the head of special services records his talks with the commander-in-chief and passes this talk to the media. Then what is the difference between the FBI director and Mr Snowden? He is not the director of the special services then, but a rights defender, which defends a certain position. By the way if, in relation to this, a prosecution would be launched against him (Comey), we are ready to provide him with political asylum in Russia. He has to know this.  On Relations With the United States  I know the mood of our people, we don't see America as our enemy. Moreover, twice in history, when especially hard times fell on us, we joined our efforts and we were allies in two world wars.   You know better than me, in which spheres we could cooperate with the United States. First of all, this is non-proliferation control, to be precise control over weapons of mass destruction proliferation. We are the biggest nuclear powers, our cooperation in this sphere goes without saying. Second of all, this is the fight against poverty, the fight against the negative impact on the ecology, and so on. We know though the current administration's stance on the Paris accord. However, the president does not refuse to discuss this.   As far as the flashpoints are concerned... there are positive examples of our cooperation. Syrian problem, Mid-Eastern problem on the whole... There are other flashpoints and we are very hopeful for the United States' constructive role in the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis... We are ready for a constructive dialogue.  On the Arctic  The so called non-regional powers are showing their interest to this region. And this is great, we are ready for cooperation with them, but we have to safeguard our priorities.   We have to ensure... business on these territories, ensure sovereignty over these territories.   Let's not forget about the military aspect. The region is extremely important from the country's defence point of view. I don't want to stir it up, however, the experts know that the U.S.' submarines stand on duty to Norway's north, the time of delivery for missiles is 15 minutes to Moscow, and we have to understand what is happening there, see what is happening there, we have to defend this shore accordingly.   We have now returned there, and I hope that's forever.  On Central Bank Key Rate  I hope the central bank will keep acting carefully when it comes to the key rate, but acting towards key rate decrease.   Why the central bank is acting carefully? Our economy depends on the hydrocarbons sale. The oil (price) has recently grew above $50, while today it is already at $48... Most important for us is not the key rate per se, but that the rate doesn't change sharply.  On Demography, His Grandchildren  We have to think about incentive measures for young mothers who give birth to their first child.   A complex of measures is needed (to boost demography).   My children, my daughters, live here, in Russia, in Moscow, despite all the rumours. And I have grandchildren. They also live a normal life, daughters are engaged in science, education. They don't try to get into politics, they live a normal, common life. As far as the grandchildren are concerned. Some are going to kindergarten... You know what the matter is? I don't want them to grow as some princes by blood, I want them to grow into normal people. For this, they need a normal interaction among children. Once I reveal their age and name, they will be quickly identified and they won't be left alone... I had a second grandson born recently.  On Western Sanctions  Now a draft law to toughen up the sanctions has emerged in the U.S. Senate. Why? Nothing extraordinary has happened (in Russia). Why they started to talk about these sanctions out of the blue? This is, of course, evidence of ongoing political infighting in the United States.   If it wasn't for Crimea, other problems, they would have invented something else to deter Russia.   As far as the endless extension of some restrictions are concerned: if our partners lift sanctions on our economy, we should do the same, otherwise we will face problems within the World Trade Organization.  On the Economy and Inflation  What does the objective data show? It shows that recession in the Russian economy is over. We have moved to the period of growth.   We have witnessed growth for three consecutive quarters.   We have seen a decline in real incomes of citizens for the past few years. And the increase in the number of people who live below the poverty line is especially worrisome.   We have the lowest inflation in (recent years). Today, it's 4.1 percent, we have never seen it. This shows that we have all grounds to believe that we will reach 4 percent inflation target this year.

Executives from HSBC's global banking and markets (GBM) business told analysts on Thursday they expect to increase revenues faster than rivals to push GBM's return on risk-weighted assets to 2.5% or more. That reiterated targets set by HSBC in 2015. Last year GBM's RoRWA fell short, coming in at 1.8%. The improvement will be achieved by the revenue rise, a further US$20bn reduction in risk-weighted assets, and by keeping cost growth below revenue growth, according to Samir Assaf, chief executive of GBM. Part of the plan includes doing more in the US, which Assaf said contributes more to the overall business than revenue figures show. Only 15% of GBM's revenues are booked in North America, far less than for any other global investment bank.  Our US presence is becoming increasingly important for our Asian and Middle Eastern clients as they expand their business or investment in the United States,  Assaf said. A lot of business also goes the other way from major US corporate clients. Some 55% of GBM's revenue is from cross-border activity, and 30% of its outbound activity comes from North America, making it a major net exporter of revenues. Assaf said as a result the bank was providing capital to US multinational firms for business that was quite often booked in Asia or Europe. Asia accounts for 40% of GBM's revenues, Europe makes 37% and 6% is made in the Middle East. Much of the US business is going to China.  US clients are responsible for almost one-third of the revenues we book in China. So you can see the level of significance this (US) client base is,  said Robin Phillips, co-head of global banking. Brexit Benefit? HSBC said at the investor day the 5% annual rise in GBM's revenues it expects in the coming years should outpace expected industry growth of about 3% annually. GBM's revenues grew by 6% a year between 2011 and 2014 and by 5% a year from 2014 to 2016, which Assaf said outperformed all major rivals.  We are confident we can continue this trend in the foreseeable future,  he said. Growth in the global economy and investment bank revenue pool and rising interest rates will help. So too will a strategy of targeting resources on big, profitable clients.  Through our very targeted capital allocation, we can deepen and grow our client relationships, to provide more products in more regions through transaction banking, advisory and financing. This will lead to market share gains,  Assaf said. He said HSBC's share of the investment bank market was 7.5% last year, up from 6.3% in 2014, based on data from analysis firm Coalition. It made gains in fixed income in Europe, liquidity and cash management operations, and in financing and advisory. The bank will target further growth in areas including sponsor activity, high yield, securitisations, structured finance and emerging markets, he said. Britain's exit from the European Union should also provide an opportunity, and not just a cost, executives said. HSBC has said it could move up to 1,000 investment bankers to Paris in the event of a  hard Brexit , where the bank has a licence and significant operations. Assaf said last week's UK election suggested a  softer Brexit  could emerge, but it was still uncertain. He said there will be a cost from moving staff and upgrading systems, but that would be a limited one-off cost. He said with an EU licence and systems already in place, HSBC should benefit from more clients turning to it, in particular for clearing and payments.

After downward revisions to data for prior months, factory output was lower in May than it was in February. Analysts had expected factory output to rise a modest 0.1 percent. But output fell across manufacturing industries, with motor vehicles and parts production dropping 2 percent and output for fabricated metal products down 0.7 percent. If not for a 1.1 percent surge in chemicals output, manufacturing would have fallen more. Overall industrial production was flat last month, with a 1.6 percent increase in mining and a 0.4 percent gain in utilities countering the factory weakness. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, had been regaining ground as the prolonged drag from lower oil prices, a strong dollar and an inventory overhang faded.

The report, the first assessment of the functioning of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), was commissioned last year by the chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem.  The EFSF/ESM fulfilled their mandate of safeguarding financial stability in the euro area and its members, with support from other crisis measures,  said the report. Evaluating the bailouts granted by the euro zone to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus since the sovereign debt crisis in 2010, the report said governments asked for help too late. That made the rescue more costly and led to one country's problems spilling over to another.  Programmes could have been requested earlier,  the report said.  The ESM should pre-empt delays in programme requests when problems cannot be effectively solved at national level.  The report did not say how the ESM was to accelerate a rescue request in practice. The report, discussed by euro zone finance ministers at the annual meeting of the ESM, also said bailout programmes should better differentiate between short- and long-term goals. The focus ought to be on restoring market access, rather than prescribing a more comprehensive set of reforms for the economy.  Programmes included measures that were not always crucial for addressing the causes of lost market access,  it said, noting some reforms could not be completed within a three-year bailout plan. Once the bailout ended, often so did the will to continue with reforms.  Short- and long-term objectives were not always commonly understood and communicated, sometimes leading to optimistic expectations and subsequently to weakening ownership,  it said.  The Board should consider strategies to help maintain reform implementation in the post-programme period,  it said. The evaluation, lead by former European Central Bank board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, said that when dealing with the financial sector, bailouts should address problems upfront, but disburse money in a phased way, depending on the sectors' progress with restructuring and tackling non-performing loans.

The climb is a result of growth in several industries, including communication, tourism and manufacturing, Saeed added at a press conference. Egypt's economy has been struggling since a 2011 uprising drove foreign investors and tourists away, but the government hopes a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending programme signed last year will put it on the road to recovery. The balance of payments achieved an overall surplus of $11 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2016-17, which ends this month, as non-oil exports increased and non-oil imports declined. Appetite for Egyptian exports has increased since the northern African country floated its currency last November, as part of economic reforms agreed with the IMF. Since the flotation, Egypt has seen the value of its currency decline by half and inflation reach record highs, but exports have become more competitive. Tourism revenues jumped in the third quarter by 128.3 percent to $1.3 billion from $550 million a year earlier as the number of tourist nights surged to 14.2 million in the third quarter from 6.9 million a year earlier, a central bank report showed on Wednesday. Egypt's budget deficit for the first nine months of the 2016-17 fiscal year dipped to 8.4 percent from 9.4 percent during the same period last year, Saeed said.

Two more policymakers at the Bank of England (BoE) joined Kristin Forbes in calling for a reversal to the BoE's interest rate cut last August, sending the pound as high as $1.2795 in the minutes following its decision to leave rates unchanged. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only Forbes - whose term on the BoE rate setting committee expires at the end of the month - to back higher rates, especially given a slowdown in growth in the first three months of 2017. The risks to that view - and to sterling - were underlined by another lower-than-expected batch of retail sales data. By 1225 GMT, the pound had eased back to $1.2741, down 0.1 percent on the day.  I still think there is a case for weaker (UK) growth so I don't really agree with their arguments in the minutes this time,  SEB currency strategist Richard Falkenhall said, adding that he saw no change to BoE policy this year or next.  What will be important (for sterling going forward) is really the tone we will have in the first negotiations which will begin next week between the UK and the EU.  The pound has hovered near the $1.27 mark after a nearly 3 percent fall in the wake of Britain's election last week, which produced no clear majority for any party. Prime Minister Theresa May and her Conservative party are still in talks with another party from Northern Ireland to form a government, with just days remaining before the planned start date of talks on Britain's exit from the European Union. The dollar inched higher against a basket of peers, after the Federal Reserve's policy meeting kept up expectations of another interest rate hike this year. As widely expected, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.0-1.25 percent on Wednesday but it also gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. That undid all of the damage done to the greenback in Asian trading and pushed it higher in morning European trade. The dollar was up 0.6 percent against the euro at $1.1160 and 0.8 percent higher at 110.340 yen. The index that measures its broader strength was up half a percent at 97.399. A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalisation at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.  Long term Fed expectations remain very much supported - that is the main reason why the dollar is remaining supported for now,  Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri said.

We expect to run this in the autumn of this year, and we hope to have a view on agreeing a binding deal by the end of the year or perhaps shortly after that,  CFO Graeme Pitkethly said at a conference hosted by Deutsche Bank on Thursday.  If we are unable to achieve sufficient value in an outright sale, we do plan to demerge this business, and that might take a little bit longer.  Unilever is working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on the sale, sources have told Reuters, estimating that the asset could fetch about 6 billion pounds ($7.6 billion). Pitkethly added that the review of Unilever's structure, also announced in April, would be completed by the end of the year. He said the review was undertaken with a view to unifying the structure of the company, which has headquarters in both Britain and the Netherlands. Such a move would provide greater strategic flexibility for potential demergers, such as the spreads business, or for a more transformative acquisition should that become desirable, Pitkethly said.

Nasdaq futures took a big hit as a selloff in technology stocks threatened to resume on worries of stretched valuations. Heavyweights such as Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, which were hit hard by the rout earlier in the week, were in the red in premarket trading on Thursday.  Stocks have been at all-time highs and valuations are somewhat priced to perfection so a little bit of a pullback is not too surprising,  said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York.  We may see the market take a breather in the next few sessions, but it is not necessarily doom and gloom.  Apart from raising interest rates and forecasting one more hike for 2017 on Wednesday, the Fed laid out its first clear outline to start trimming its $4.2 trillion balance sheet  relatively soon . While the rate hike was widely expected, a clutch of weak economic data, including Wednesday's poor inflation numbers, raised questions whether the U.S. economy was strong enough to withstand further tightening. Policymakers, however, viewed the soft data as transitory. Big banks including Bank of America, Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley fell about 1 percent. Clouston attributed the drop in bank stocks to worries about lagging U.S. inflation. At 8:33 a.m. ET (1233 GMT) Dow e-minis were down 76 points, or 0.36 percent, with 15,402 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were down 15 points, or 0.62 percent, with 103,479 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 60.75 points, or 1.06 percent, on volume of 10,928 contracts. A Washington Post report that President Donald Trump was being investigated for possible obstruction of justice added to the jitters. One bright spot was a Labor Department report that showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week. Brent crude hit six-week lows as OPEC failed to curb oversupply. Chip stocks, including Nvidia, Micron Tech and AMD, were down more than 2.5 percent each. Kroger fell 9.5 percent to $27.4 after the supermarket chain operator cut its full-year profit forecast.

Le Pen is facing legal action in France following criticism of the center-right mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who filed suit against her for accusing him of being in league with Islamist militants.   Le Pen, runner-up to Emmanuel Macron in last month's French presidential election, already lost immunity in March in a case over tweets of graphic images of executions by Islamic State and risks losing it in a case involving alleged misuse of EU funds. In their own state’s territory, MEPs enjoy immunity as accorded to members of their own parliament. The French constitution provides immunity in cases related to opinions expressed or votes cast by lawmakers during official duties. Earlier this week, the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs recommended that Le Pen’s parliamentary immunity should be waived as her alleged statements on Estrosi were not made in the course of her duties as an MEP. It also found that there were no grounds that the request to remove her immunity had been made to cause her political damage.   Fellow National Front EU lawmaker Gilles Lebreton accused the legislature of accelerating the vote to suspend Le Pen's immunity to damage the party ahead of Sunday's second round of voting in a French parliamentary election. Le Pen's party received 14 percent of the vote in the first round. Le Pen, Lebreton said, welcomed the opportunity that the defamation case would give her to continue her criticism of Estrosi. Le Pen, who has denounced legal proceedings against her as politically-motivated, chose not to accept either of two invitations to appear before the Committee on Legal Affairs.

U.S. stock futures   signalled a rocky start on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as widely expected, and signalled another hike could follow this year. In emerging markets, Russian shares fell 4 percent as risks grew of expanded sanctions and the price of oil fell. European shares, already led down by mining stocks as the stronger dollar pushed metals prices lower, extended losses after data showed British consumers, who have been the drivers of the UK economy are feeling the impact of rising inflation.  I don't think this is a surprise to anyone in terms of the narrative about how weak and stretched the consumer is and will be for the next quarters,  JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist David Stubbs said.  If retail sales are weak then the pie is contracting and someone is going to get hammered. Those that are unable to deal with that are going to see a much weaker bottom line.  U.S. numbers on Wednesday showed a similar picture on the other side of the Atlantic - retail sales fell more than expected in May. In a sign that the squeeze on consumers may get tighter before long, three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise rates against five for keeping rates on hold. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7-1 vote in favour of no change. The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.7 percent, led lower by the retail sector, down 1.8 percent and heading for its worst day in eight months, and the basic resources sector, which fell 1.4 percent. Britain's DFS Furniture fell 21 percent after the company said a dip in demand and customer uncertainty about the economic outlook meant it would not meet profit expectations. The prime cause of rising UK inflation has been weakness in the pound, which has fallen 15 percent against the dollar since topping $1.50 in the early hours of last June 24, when it initially appeared Britons had voted to remain in the EU. Sterling edged up after the BoE decision but reversed course after finance minister Philip Hammond pulled out of a high-profile speaking engagement because of a deadly fire at a London tower block. He had been expected to speak about the need for a Brexit deal with the EU that suited the needs of British business. The dollar was up 0.4 percent against a basket of major peers.  Long-term Fed expectations remain very much supported. That is the main reason why the dollar is remaining supported for now,  Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri said. The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.1164, its weakest for more than two weeks, while the yen was down a similar amount at 110.07 per dollar. The Fed raised interest rates for the second time this year, by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00-1.25 percent. It also gave a first clear outline of plans to shed its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio built up in three rounds of quantitative easing stimulus. A Washington Post report that U.S. President Donald Trump was under investigation for possible obstruction of justice added to investor worries and undermined risk appetite. Heavy Metal The stronger dollar pushed copper down 0.6 percent to $5,663 a tonne, having hit a one-week low of $5,642. The prospect of tighter monetary policy and the fact the Fed talked about shrinking its balance sheet pushed euro zone government bond yields higher. German 10-year yields, the benchmark for borrowing costs in the bloc, rose 5 basis points to 0.28 percent, a one-week high. Later in the day, the bond market focus is likely to shift to Greece as euro zone finance ministers meet to discuss a deal with the International Monetary Fund that could pave the way for new loans for Athens.

The 12,000-tonne, 113-metre-long SS Nujoma was built at a cost of $157 million and is named after Sam Nujoma, Namibia's founding president.  I am very, very confident this (vessel) will allow us to continue to extract 1.2 million carats a year,  De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver told Reuters by telephone. He said he was  cautiously optimistic  about diamond sales in 2017 and in terms of value there have been  some small positive movements  but it was too early to declare a trend. Anglo American and De Beers rely heavily on diamonds. Anglo American says they are central to its portfolio of assets as they tend to hold value when bulk commodities fall in price. Diamonds are also important to Namibia as they generate 20 percent of its foreign export earnings. Namibia receives 80 cents of every Namibian dollar generated by Debmarine Namibia, its 50:50 joint venture with De Beers.  Marine diamonds are particularly prized. They are generally more valuable than land-based stones because lower quality gems are washed away by waves. Debmarine Namibia produced 1.2 million carats of diamonds in 2016, a level De Beers says it can maintain until 2035 when its license expires on a 6,000 square km area. The SS Nujoma is the sixth diamond exploration vessel to join Debmarine Namibia's fleet. It can hunt for diamonds at more than double the speed of its predecessor, De Beers said. De Beers has a budget for land-based exploration of about $35 million to explore in Canada, Botswana and South Africa.

Put on a military plane hours later on May 3, the 40-year-old regional lawmaker - one of the best-known opposition figures in the rural home state of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez - has not been seen since.   He's disappeared. They kidnapped him. There is complete silence,  said his mother, Carmen Cordero, who has been traveling between Barinas state and the capital, Caracas, to seek information on him at the headquarters of national intelligence service Sebin. There has been no official word on Azuaje's case, and requests to authorities for information went unanswered.  Azuaje is one of more than 3,000 activists, mainly young protesters, rounded up since massive demonstrations began against President Nicolas Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party at the start of April, according to rights groups. Nearly half of those remain behind bars. Opponents of Maduro say the 54-year-old successor to Chavez has become a dictator and unleashed repression to intimidate a population fed up with economic hardship and demanding general elections. Maduro casts the arrests as a legitimate reaction to  armed insurrection  by violent coup-plotters following a U.S. agenda to take control of Venezuela's oil wealth. Government officials view Azuaje as a ringleader in a particularly sensitive region.  A career politician always courting controversy, he backed Chavez in the early years of his 1999-2013 rule. But Azuaje later split with Chavez, who died in office, and accused the president's increasingly wealthy relatives of corruption in Barinas, a poor agricultural state in the Venezuelan  llanos  or plains where Chavez was born in a mud hut.  In 2010, Azuaje was briefly put under house arrest for assaulting a policewoman in a spat over a vehicle.  An avid swimmer and prominent member of the opposition party Justice First, he aspires to run for the Barinas governorship, currently held by a brother of Chavez.  Kelly Garcia (C), wife of the opposition lawmaker Wilmer Azuaje, sits next to her daughters during an interview with Reuters in Barinas, Venezuela June 12, 2017.Carlos Eduardo Ramirez He's long been a thorn in the side of the government,  added Cordero, wearing a white T-shirt bearing the face of her son, before driving to Caracas on another quest to find him. 'Terrorist of Barinas'  Friends and supporters say Azuaje, who also helps run the family restaurant and tourism business, gave energetic encouragement to anti-Maduro demonstrators throughout April.  Slideshow (3 Images)He was often the only mainstream politician at the scene of protests, broadcasting live via social media, they say.  Officials and government supporters accused Azuaje of fomenting and financing violence, and urged an investigation. On social media, some dubbed him  the Terrorist of Barinas  and  Captain Criminal,  showing photos of him beside alleged gang members, some in masks.  He's no angel that man, he's behind all of this, so he has to pay,  said Maduro supporter Leonardo Gonzalez, 33, wearing a red T-shirt with Chavez's image, in the scruffy state capital, also called Barinas.  The city, in the middle of rural plains, has seen the single worst bout of unrest in 2-1/2 months of often violent protests across Venezuela. Seven people were killed in the city and hundreds of stores looted in one 36-hour spate of clashes on May 22 and 23. Nearly 70 people have died nationwide.  Azuaje was last seen being bundled onto a National Guard plane in the middle of the night after being arrested and taken to local Sebin headquarters with his assistant the day before. Friends and relatives yelled his name from the perimeter fence.  Seeing the person you love treated like that is terrible,  said his wife, Kelly Garcia, cuddling their two baby girls at her home.  Wilmer's only crime is to dream and work for a better Venezuela.

Nigeria The Nigeria naira could strengthen against the dollar in the coming days as more offshore investors buy up local stocks after MSCI increased the country's weighting in its frontier market index.  We are beginning to see some international investors returning to the (stock) market,  Olabisi Ayodeji, a research analyst, told Reuters. Traders said the re-emergence of offshore interest in the stock market has boosted dollar inflows to the economy, leading to a gradual exchange rate convergence. The local currency was quoted at 365 to the dollar on the black market on Thursday, against 368 per dollar last week. It is trading at around 305.70 to the dollar on the official interbank window. Kenya The Kenyan shilling is expected to trade in a tight range in the coming week due to demand from multinational companies buying shillings to meet their tax obligations, as well as low oil prices reducing the import bill, traders said. At 1101 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.45/65 per dollar, compared with 103.24/45 at last Thursday's close.  We've seen oil prices go down to 45 dollars per barrel so we don't expect any un-warranted demand,  said a trader from a commercial bank. Uganda The Ugandan shilling is seen trading in a stable range as the central bank curbs liquidity in the market, making it slightly more expensive to buy dollars. At 0953 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,583/3,593, little changed from last Thursday's close of 3,585/3,585.  We'll probably see the shilling play stable ... in range of 3,575-3,600,  said a trader at a leading commercial bank, adding the excess liquidity removal will keep dollar demand subdued. Tanzania The Tanzanian shilling is expected to trade in a tight range in the coming days, mainly due to a general slowdown in business activity. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,234/2,244 to the dollar on Thursday, barely moved from 2,235/2,245 a week ago.  We expect stable prices next week due to subdued demand for dollars and a slowdown in inflows of hard currency in the market,  said a trader at CRDB Bank. Ghana Ghana's cedi is expected to be stable in the week ahead as firms due to a healthy supply of dollars from firms and the central bank, traders said. The unit was trading at 4.4085 per dollar by mid-morning on Thursday, compared with 4.4200 a week ago. Joseph Biggles Amponsah, an analyst at Accra-based Dortis Research, said the cedi could also be supported by falling inflation and short-term lending rates. Zambia The Zambian kwacha is expected to remain firm against the dollar next week as firms sell dollars to pay their workers and suppliers at the end of the month. At 1007 GMT, commercial banks quoted the currency of Africa's second biggest copper producer at 9.1800 per dollar from a close of 9.2500 a week ago.  The short-to-medium term outlook for the local unit seems to indicate that the kwacha is likely to remain firm,  Cavmont Bank said in a market note.

The foreign banks' support is critical for Qatari banks, whose reliance on international funding has grown sharply over the years to about $50 billion as of April, or around a quarter of their domestic loans, Standard & Poor's estimated. That is up from 13.2 percent at the end of 2015. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt last week severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran. The UAE has also decided to blacklist Qatari individuals and entities. The UAE central bank asked banks under its jurisdiction to apply  enhanced customer due diligence  when dealing with six Qatari lenders, including the biggest, Qatar National Bank . This was tantamount to telling banks to trade with Qatari institutions  at their own peril , a Middle Eastern banker in Dubai said. Bankers said UAE, Bahraini and Saudi banks have in general halted all new business with Qatar. But some international banks are not pulling back because they are reluctant to cut lucrative business ties with Qatar built up over the years. They also see attractive opportunities related to Qatar's multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects before it hosts the soccer World Cup in 2022.  International banks will be less knee-jerk than the local banks as they don't want to cut off their nose to spite their face,  a compliance executive at a foreign bank said. Commerzbank, UniCredit and Mizuho Financial have been the top three lenders to Qatari banks in the past three years, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. First Abu Dhabi Bank is the largest Gulf lender to Qatar's banks, according to the data. Some European, Asian and U.S. banks, as well as banks from Kuwait and Oman, are still lending new money to Qatar, according to sources familiar with the matter. Kuwait and Oman belong to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but are not participating in the Saudi-led embargo. Some Qatari banks are having to pay more to obtain funding, but they are not running out of money.  We're unscathed so far,  one Qatari banker said.  The panic has eased as we've been able to continue receiving funding, though there's certainly no complacency about the risks that remain.  He said his bank had borrowed over $100 million in unsecured three-year financing from a European bank and obtained six-month deposits from Asian and European banks in the two weeks since the crisis erupted. U.S. banks were still trading through bilateral and repo lines, he said. Qatar central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani referred to such ties in a statement this week, saying Qatari banks' presence in markets including Asia and Europe were helping them to continue operating. Qatari banks' reliance on GCC funding varies widely. Qatar Islamic Bank, the largest sharia-compliant lender, is the most dependent, obtaining 24 percent of its funding and 24 percent of deposits from the rest of the GCC, according to research published by Goldman Sachs. Big international banks including HSBC, Citigroup , Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan declined to comment. In a statement, Standard Chartered said its operations in Qatar were unchanged; it did not elaborate. Logistics Another difficulty facing those doing business with Qatar now is logistical, an international banker said. He said flying physical documentation for trade finance deals to Qatar has become slower and more burdensome as direct flights from Dubai have been cancelled because of the diplomatic rift. International banks' ability to keep doing business with Qatar could face hurdles if the Saudi and UAE central banks were to announced harsher sanctions, such as curbs on the ownership of Qatari assets. So far, there appears to be no sign of that happening.  If the sanctions had been proposed by the United Nations, we would have frozen everything, but because this is from one country to another, we don’t see any reason to freeze anything,  a source at an Asian bank said. Another potential risk is that Saudi Arabia could try to push international banks to choose between doing business with Qatar and obtaining access to its own, much larger market. But this would be difficult to enforce. In the meantime, the premiums which Qatari banks are paying to fund themselves do not look crippling. The three-month Qatar interbank offered rate has risen to a multi-year high of 2.31 percent from 1.92 percent before sanctions were imposed. Some Qatari banks are paying as much as 50 to 100 basis points more than they used to in the interbank market, an Omani banker said. But the Qatari banker said the six-month deposits his bank secured in the past few days only involved a premium of 1 bp.

Kadcyla, which can prolong the lives of some women with advanced disease, has been a battle-ground for campaigners wanting better access to modern cancer drugs, with 115,000 people signing a petition demanding its availability. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said it could now recommend funding for Kadcyla, following the new commercial access arrangement with Roche. Details of the discount offer were not disclosed. At its full list price, Kadcyla costs about 90,000 pounds ($115,000) per patient, according to NICE, although Roche says this figure is exaggerated because the drug is typically given for shorter periods than NICE assumes. Until now, the drug has only been covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which finances drugs not routinely paid for on the NHS. With the medicine moving to routine use, NICE estimates around 1,200 women could now be eligible to receive it. Roche, the world's biggest supplier of cancer medicines, has expressed frustration in the past at the rigid system used in Britain to determine value for money in cancer care, with CEO Severin Schwan describing the system as  stupid  in 2015.

For months, demonstrators have taken to the streets in Rif region around the northern city of Al-Hoceima to vent their frustrations over the economic, social and political problems of a kingdom that presents itself as a beacon of stability in a turbulent region. Authorities have responded by arresting as many as 100 leaders and members of the movement, called Hirak al Chaabi in Arabic, since the end of May. Undaunted, tens of thousands marched through Rabat on Sunday, the greatest number to join a demonstration since a wave of rallies in 2011 forced King Mohamed VI to allow some democratic reforms. In a country where political protests are rare and the royal  palace remains the ultimate power, the demonstrators have directed their anger at the government and the king's entourage rather than the monarch himself. Some, however, believe he must act rapidly.   I have nothing to say to the government. I address my grievances to the highest authority,  said Ahmed Zefzafi, whose son Nasser led the Hirak movement until his recent arrest.  With one phone call, all of this can be resolved,  Zefzafi told Reuters at his family home, just days after a police raid broke down their front door. So far, the palace has remained silent despite activists' calls for a royal intervention.  The government spokesman declined comment on the issue, saying only:  All the steps and initiatives taken by the government with regards to Al-Hoceima were under direct instruction from King Mohammed VI.  Following a meeting with the king on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Rabat that Mohammed VI is eager to  calm the situation in the Rif region by responding to the demands of this movement . Deprivation of Dignity The Hirak movement was born after the gruesome death in October of fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in Al-Hoceima, which lies on the Mediterranean coast. Local police confiscated fish they said he had bought illegally and dumped it in a garbage truck. Desperate to recover his stock, Fikri jumped inside and was killed by the vehicle's rubbish crusher.  We've never seen anyone die that way,  Silya Ziani, one of the Hirak leaders, told Reuters shortly before she was arrested herself.  Even Hollywood doesn't think to depict death in that manner.  Ziani, too, believes the king is the only authority able to ease the tension, with economic development vital for creating jobs and easing poverty.  We hear about the king investing in major projects abroad. What about us?  she asked. Ahmed Zefzafi, father of activist and leader of the protest movement Nasser Zefzafi, is pictured in his house in the town of Al-Hoceima, Morocco June 3, 2017.Youssef BoudlalFikri's death has become a symbol of  hogra  - a colloquial Arabic term for the deprivation of a person's dignity due to the abuse of power, corruption and injustice. The protests - including Sunday's march in the capital which was largely led by the banned Islamist Adl Wal Ihsan (Justice and Spirituality) Movement - echo Morocco's  Feb. 20th  movement of 2011. Inspired by revolts in Tunisia and Egypt that year, it staged protests over unemployment, judicial reforms and other freedoms, with thousands joining demonstrations nationwide led by activists, leftists and Islamists. King Mohamed eventually ceded some powers to parliament, and managed the protests with a combination of limited constitutional reforms, heavy policing and hefty public spending. As in 2011, no-one now openly calls for overthrowing the king, who heads the Muslim world's longest-serving dynasty. Many Moroccans are wary of the kind of instability rocking Libya and other parts of the region. The almost daily protests have been mostly peaceful, with only occasional clashes. Morocco's King Mohammed VI (R) welcomes French President Emmanuel Macron (L) and his wife Brigitte Macron before attending an Iftar meal, the evening meal when Muslims end their daily Ramadan fast at sunset, at the King Palace in Rabat, Morocco, June 14, 2017. Picture taken June 14, 2017.Abdeljalil Bounhar/PoolThe demonstrators are demanding the release of the dozens detained on charges including  threatening national security  and  receiving foreign funding . However,  hogra  is the main motivation, with Fikri's death still angering many.   Royal Intervention Moroccan authorities have arrested 11 people over Fikri's death and promised development projects for Al-Hoceima and the wider Rif region, long a hotbed of anti-government dissent and unrest among the indigenous Berber community. But while protests persist, government officials trade blame over responsibility for the unrest and for delayed projects. The Islamist Party of Justice and Development leads the government, but the pro-palace Party of Authenticity and Modernity holds most seats for Morocco's northern region. The unrest comes at a sensitive time as the country prepares more economic reforms, including floating its currency. Many Moroccans depend on money sent by relatives abroad, and the kingdom is also trying to attract investors by presenting itself as a safe haven in a region rocked by strife.  We have an economic model of development that relies significantly on tourism, remittances and foreign direct investment,  said economist Najib Akesbi.  If there isn't a detente through the release of prisoners and real, credible initiatives that address grievances, then the situation is likely to deteriorate.  Rights groups including Amnesty International have criticized the arrests in the Rif region, citing claims of torture, beatings and lack of immediate access to legal counsel. Officials say those arrested are charged in due process. Even the current holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims are fasting, has not slowed the protests in Rif, which once briefly declared itself a republic to contest former Spanish colonial rule in the 1920s. Zefzafi, who himself was involved in politics in his youth, evoked an Arabic proverb to express his feelings of helplessness over his son's arrest.

Children as young as 10 were among hundreds of men detained on charges of consorting with Rohingya insurgents, Reuters revealed in March, citing a previously unreleased police document. Thirteen juveniles were among more than 400 arrested since Oct. 9, when insurgents attacked police posts in northwestern Rakhine state, near the border with Bangladesh, according to the police document, dated March 7. The insurgent attacks led to the biggest crisis of leader Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in power, prompting some 75,000 Rohingya to flee the subsequent army crackdown to Bangladesh. Speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Yanghee Lee, the organization's special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said children should not be  arbitrarily deprived of their liberty  and the government should guarantee their right to timely proceedings.  I remind the government that children should be detained strictly as a last resort, for the shortest appropriate period of time, and must be treated with humanity and respect in a manner which takes into account their age,  said Lee. She also urged the government to investigate the death of a child who, according to the government, died because of ill health in February. The government did not report the death until last week, she said. In April, a deputy executive director of the U.N. children's fund (UNICEF), Justin Forsyth, sought the release of the children while on a visit to Myanmar. The United Nations, in report based on interviews with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, said Myanmar's security forces had committed mass killings and gang rapes against Rohingya during their campaign, which could amount to crimes against humanity. The military has denied the accusations, saying it was engaged in a legitimate counterinsurgency operation. Myanmar's ambassador in Geneva, Htin Lynn, did not directly address the  issue of the detained children, limiting his remarks to say that the Convention of the Rights of the Child applied  equally to all children in Myanmar . Lee also called on Myanmar to  fully cooperate  with a recently established U.N. fact-finding mission to investigate the alleged human rights violations by the military. Suu Kyi has opposed the mission, saying this week it would create  greater hostility between the different communities . On Thursday, ambassador Htin Lynn echoed her comments:  It will not help solve the problems Myanmar is facing in Rakhine State ... We are ready to work with the international community on any advice or arrangements should they constitute part of the solution, not part of the problem.

The proceeds will be used to refinance the existing term loans, fund the planned expansions at the Tampa and Hollywood properties, and for general corporate purposes. Ftich has affirmed STOF's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB' and all existing issue-specific ratings. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of the rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS CREDIT PROFILE REMAINS STRONG Pro forma for the refinancing, Fitch expects STOF's gross leverage, including tribal debt, to remain within its sensitivities for 'BBB' through the development phase of its Tampa and Hollywood expansions. The overall leverage trajectory will be eased by a $500 million portion of the term loan A being delayed draw. Fitch forecasts leverage including tribal debt to peak at 1.9x during FY 2018 (fiscal year ends Sept. 30) and to improve thereafter through EBITDA growth and term loan amortization (10% per year). Pro forma total leverage including tribal debt and excluded the delayed draw is 1.5x, compared to 1.1x as of March 31, 2017. Fitch has a 2.0x negative sensitivity at the 'BBB' level; however, there is some capacity in the ratings for leverage to increase slightly above 2.0x in conjunction with expansion-related financing if Fitch expects STOF to deleverage back to below 2.0x within 12-24 months. Fitch views STOF's planned expansion favorably given the strength in the underlying operating environment and benefits it will provide to STOF's competitive positioning. STOF's gaming division continues to experience steady, positive operating trends compared to more flat growth seen in other U.S. gaming markets. STOF's gaming division revenues and EBITDA for the last 12 months ending March 31, 2017 were flat and grew by 1% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Revenues have been temporarily impacted by construction disruption at Tampa since the fall of 2016 but have grown in the mid-single digit range consistently since 2011. STOF has sizable gaming operations in two distinct, populous Florida markets and benefits from having no competition in Tampa and limited competition in southeast Florida. DECEMBER 2016 UPGRADE Fitch upgraded STOF's IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' in December 2016, reflecting the diminishing uncertainty over the tribe's ability to continue offering table games and established track record of adherence to prudent financial policies. The upgrade also reflected Fitch's increased confidence that the tribe will maintain leverage below 2.0x (including tribal debt) through its planned development pipeline. The tribe has been party to a number of favorable court rulings in the past year. STOF's authority to offer table games under its existing compact expired in July 2015, but table operations continued as the tribe and the state negotiated a new compact and filed suits against each other. In November 2016, a U.S. district court found that the exception to STOF's five-year limitation to offer table games was triggered due to the state allowing another entity to offer banked table games. Therefore the tribe has the right to offer banked table games for the compact's entire 20-year term ending 2030 at its seven locations. The state is appealing the decision. Fitch believes the risk of additional significant competition in STOF's primary markets, another historical overhang, is benign. In May 2017, the Florida Supreme Court's ruled against the ability of individual counties' conducting voter referendums to determine slot expansions. Political momentum for passing legislature permitting large-scale casinos has cooled, since the initiative failed to gain traction after Spectrum Group's 2013 study. Additionally, Fitch believes that the recent court rulings gives STOF a greater seat at the table if the state picks back up expansion talks, since the ruling frees the tribe from making compact payments. GOVERNANCE TRACK RECORD STOF has a track record of instituting sound financial policies, including operating tribal government with a surplus. The tribe's reserves as of Mar. 31, 2017 provide for about six months of governmental operations including per capita payments, an improvement from less than a month of operations prior to a largely new council being elected in May 2011. A new chairman was elected in December 2016, Marcellus Osceola, Jr., who continues to support the tribe's prudent fiscal policies. The tribe may use part of its cash reserves to repay its special obligation bonds and to fund certain tribal capital improvements. Tribal reserves could decline to about two months of operations but the tribe remains committed to rebuilding cash reserves to cover nearly a full year of operations over the medium term. Fitch views further reduction in tribal debt favorably as well as the commitment to building liquidity at the tribal level, further supporting STOF's credit profile. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch's rating reflects STOF's steady, positive operating trends as well as its strong, competitive position in the Florida gaming market. STOF's 'BBB' IDR considers Fitch's expectation for STOF to maintain a credit profile consistent with a 'BBB' rating through its planned development pipeline at its existing properties. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --STOF maintains table game operations and continues to pay compact fee percentages as defined under the current compact; --Low single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with more notable upticks in years when Tampa and Hollywood projects open; --Recurring tribal distributions and casino maintenance capex levels consistent with the past few years; --Free cash flow is negative from 2017 - 2019 due to development capex, but returns to more normalized, positive levels in 2020 after the Tampa and Hollywood projects are complete. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not anticipate additional upward rating momentum in the near term. However, further upward rating momentum is possible and would be consistent with STOF adopting and broadly articulating more conservative leverage targets to its creditors. Fitch believes that 1.5x total debt/EBITDA is consistent with a 'BBB+' IDR given STOF's operating profile. When considering an upgrade, Fitch would also consider the tribe's governmental financial policies and established reserves as well as the regulatory environment vis-a-vis the compact and the potential for new competition. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Negative Outlook or a downgrade in the IDR to 'BBB-': --Leverage increasing above 2.0x for extended period of time (longer than 24 months) due to operating pressure or incremental borrowing. There is capacity in the ratings for leverage to increase slightly above 2.0x in conjunction with expansion-related financing if Fitch expects STOF to deleverage back to below 2.0x within 12-24 months; --A decline in the tribe's reserves related to operating pressure on the gaming division and/or the tribe running deficits. LIQUIDITY STOF's liquidity is strong pro forma for the recent transactions. STOF could also look to refinance the 2005B gaming division bonds, which become callable at the end of 2017. Fitch expects negative free cash flow throughout the forecast period as capex rises due the Hollywood and Tampa expansion projects. STOF's maturity schedule is more manageable with no debt maturing until 2020 and the new $500 million revolver provides additional liquidity. STOF did not previously maintain a revolver. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Seminole Tribe of Florida --$500 million senior secured revolver 'BBB'; --$700 million senior secured term loan A 'BBB'; --$1.2 billion senior secured term loan B 'BBB'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --IDR at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable; --Gaming division bonds, series 2005, at 'BBB'; --Term loan B due 2020 at 'BBB'; --Incremental term loan B due 2017 at 'BBB'; --Special obligation bonds, series 2007A&B;, at 'BBB-'; --Special obligation bonds, series 2008A ,at 'BBB-'.

No changes to following story.) By David Milliken and Andy Bruce LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee came its closest to voting for a rate rise since 2007 this week, after the central bank unexpectedly said three of its policymakers backed increasing interest rates. External MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders joined existing rate rise advocate Kristin Forbes in calling for a reversal of the BoE's decision last August to cut rates to 0.25 percent. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and four other policymakers voted to leave rates unchanged. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only Forbes - whose term on the MPC expires at the end of the month - to back higher rates, especially given a slowdown in growth in the first three months of 2017. The central bank said a jump in inflation last month to 2.9 percent meant it was likely to exceed 3 percent this autumn - higher than the BoE forecast just a few weeks ago and well above its 2 percent inflation target. Moreover, a fall in the pound after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a majority in last week's election could push prices yet higher, the central bank said. Britain's economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year as the effect of higher inflation caught up with consumers at a time of sluggish wage growth. But the central bank said it was unclear how persistent this weakness would be, as consumer confidence remained solid. Moreover, indicators of investment and exports looked upbeat, the BoE said  The continued growth of employment could suggest that spare capacity is being eroded, lessening the trade-off that the MPC is required to balance and, all else equal, reducing the MPC's tolerance of above-target inflation,  the BoE said.  Looking ahead, key considerations in judging the appropriate stance in monetary policy are the evolution of inflationary pressures, the persistence of weaker consumption and the degree to which it is offset by other components of demand.  The last time three MPC members voted for a rate rise was in 2011 - when there were nine members serving on the MPC - and the last time a single vote could have swung the decision on rates was in June 2007 when the committee split 5-4. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised American interest rates late on Wednesday and - notwithstanding some softening domestic data - signalled it is like to raise rates once more this year. Later on Thursday BoE Governor Mark Carney is due to give a speech to London bankers alongside finance minister Philip Hammond, who is expected to focus on Britain's future EU ties. Due to election campaigning, Hammond has not yet announced a replacement for U.S. academic Forbes - whose three-year term at the BoE expires at the end of the month - or for Charlotte Hogg, who has left the central bank after lawmakers criticised her failure to declare potential conflicts of interest. Most economists polled by Reuters do not expect a rate rise until 2019. The outlook is clouded by uncertainty about whether May will be able to lead a stable government as she tries to negotiate an exit deal with the EU and navigate complex legislation through parliament. She unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority in an election last week - heavily damaging her standing with party colleagues - and is trying to get a commitment of support for Northern Ireland's main pro-British party.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-economy-boe-idUSL8N1JC39X"},

First built as a cargo line to carry wood from Nepal to India in 1937, it was once the lifeblood of the community in Janakpur, running 29 km (18 miles) from Jainagar in India's neighboring eastern state of Bihar. The train service, which eventually became a cheap way for travelers to cross the international border, closed in January 2014 for a $100-million project to upgrade the colonial-era narrow rail track into a broad-gauge line. Now the only sign of life is laughing children, who chase each other through the disintegrating carriages, climbing on rusting benches and tumbling over one another. But the closure hit Janakpur hard, with close to 130 railway employees losing their jobs, said Tula Bahadur Dangi, acting general manager of Nepal Railway Corporation, who has worked for the company for 18 years. Travelers have been forced to use buses instead, paying three times the price of a train ticket for a journey four times as long, which is complicated further during the monsoon rains that make the roads muddy. Other trades dependent on the railway have also suffered.  Indian labourers work to build a new railway station in front of the old station in Janakpur, Nepal, June 4, 2017.Navesh Chitrakar There is no business now, compared to when there was a train,  lamented Rajendra Kushwaha, who ran a bookstall at Janakpur railway station for 45 years.  The revamp of the railway, set to be completed next March, presents clear signs of renewal and the improvements to come. Slideshow (24 Images)Construction is nearly 80 percent complete, with bridges and a total of 14 stations built along the route, where land has been leveled for the laying of track to extend the line northwards a distance of 69 km (43 miles). The expansion will create 350 jobs, Dangi said, complete with plans for a museum to showcase the old German-made abandoned carriages and engines.  The expanded route would also make it easier for tourists to visit the Ram Janaki temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that devout Hindus believe to be the birthplace of the goddess Sita.  Completion can't come quickly enough for Rafid Kabadi, who drove trains on the old line for 25 years, the third generation of his family in the job.  I am sad the train stopped, but happy the new one is coming,  he said, standing before a rusted carriage with his grandson.

A spokesperson for the bank confirmed that it will pay a quarterly coupon of £5.67m on a 11% Tier 2 due in December 2023 on June 20 and an annual coupon of £21.25m on a 8.5% July 2025 Tier 2 at the beginning of next month. The UK lender put itself up for sale in February after failing to meet regulatory capital requirements. But it has had little success in finding a purchaser despite reported interest from various parties. The outcome for Co-op's subordinated debt holders stands in sharp contrast to the fate of investors in Banco Popular, where the Additional Tier 1 instruments were wiped out, the Tier 2 debt converted to new equity and the bank sold for €1.  Should they be allowed to pay? No,  said one syndicate banker.  But it's Tier 2, if you don't pay, you're in default. So you keep going until someone says no, you can't pay.  The UK regulator has taken harsh action against subordinated debt holders in the past. When Bradford & Bingley was nationalised during the financial crisis, the transfer order allowed for coupons on its debt to be skipped, avoiding the event being declared a default. Market participants are now speculating as to what could push Co-op over the edge given that the regulator has been patient.  There is no direct read-across [from Popular] for Co-op. It doesn’t have a liquidity issue, it has a cost issue, which is eroding capital at a fairly rapid rate,  another banker said.  It’s a completely different set of circumstances, though you can't discount it might have the same end. They absolutely do have to address it, but I don't see the same liquidity and confidence pressure.  Unlike bonds in Popular, however, Co-op's Tier 2s are pricing in a much greater risk of being wiped out. Popular Tier 2s were quoted in the high 70s the evening before the bank was resolved. Co-op's 11% deal was in the mid 30s on Thursday and the 8.5% issue in the low 30s, according to Tradeweb prices.  I think the PRA is actually very much ready and comfortable with going in and resolving the Co-op Bank,  a bond investor said.  I could be wrong, but that's my initial take. I personally would not be surprised at all to see the resolution authority coming in and resolving the bank, if the current stakeholders are not able to bring fresh capital.  The Bank of England declined to comment. (Reporting by Helene Durand, Editing by Julian Baker and Sudip Roy)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/co-operativ-bank-bonds-idUSL8N1JC2GX"},

In a separate incident later in the day, at least two soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb, planted by the Islamist militant group al Shabaab, struck a car carrying government troops in Central Shabelle outside of the capital, the military said.  In the Wednesday evening attack, a car driven by a suicide bomber rammed into the Posh Hotel in south Mogadishu before gunmen rushed into Pizza House, an adjacent restaurant, and took 20 people hostage. Posh Hotel is the only venue with a discotheque in the capital. District police chief Abdi Bashir told Reuters Somali security forces took back control of the restaurant at midnight after the gunmen had held hostages inside for several hours. Five of the gunmen were killed, Bashir said.  We are in control of the hotel but it was mostly destroyed by the suicide bomber,  he told Reuters by phone. Witnesses said there were bodies lying at the scene on Thursday morning as ambulances came to take them away. Ahmed Mohamud Adow, the spokesman for the country's interior ministry, said the dead included a Syrian national who worked at the restaurant. He did not identify the dead Syrian who local residents said worked as a chef at the Pizza House.  People stands outside the scene of an attack on a hotel and an adjacent restaurant in Mogadishu, Somalia June 15, 2017.StringerAnother 27 civilians were taken to hospital with various injuries, ambulance services said. Witnesses said the attack was launched after the Iftar dinner for customers who are fasting for Ramadan. Most of them were still inside relaxing.       The wreckage of three-wheeled scooters caught up in the blast at the hotel, which also housed a massage parlor, lay overturned around the scene.  Slideshow (4 Images)Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. The group claimed on Thursday morning it killed more than 20 people including soldiers and government workers. Al Shabaab usually provides a higher death toll from its attacks than the government's figures.  The group has carried out a campaign of suicide bombings in its bid to topple the Somali government and impose its strict interpretation of Islam. The Horn of Africa country has been racked by armed conflict since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who was elected into office earlier this year, promised to defeat al Shabaab.

The Colombian, winner of the 2014 Giro d'Italia and last year's Vuelta, has been frustrated in his efforts to win the Tour de France, finishing second and third in the last two editions both won by Chris Froome. Quintana will again be a major rival of Froome when this year's race starts in Dusseldorf on July 1, but LeMond is not convinced by the 27-year-old's ability to mount the attacks needed to ruffle Froome's feathers.  I would love to see Quintana win but he lacks the ability to attack and his time trial needs to be improved,  the American LeMond, who will be broadcaster Eurosport's chief analyst during the three-week slog, said in an interview.  He is too steady and needs some explosiveness to be able to drop people.  Quintana will lead a powerful Movistar team that also includes veteran Spaniard Alejandro Valverde. He had targeted a Giro d'Italia/Tour de France double this year but lost the Giro to flying Dutchman Tom Dumoulin on the final day's time trial despite holding a 53-second lead. LeMond believes Quintana will be physically ready for the Tour de France, but says the psychological effects of losing such a tight battle could have an impact.  Recovering from the Giro is pyschological. That's the main thing,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990.  Physically your body recovers but if you've had a battle like Quintana had in the Giro, that can tough. But racing is better than training and if you do a three-week Tour and do the right recovery you should be in even better shape at the Tour.  LeMond also believes Spain's former winner Alberto Contador (Trek-Segafredo) will be dangerous after skipping the Giro.  I would not be surprised if Contador was on top of his game. I think he tried to pull off too much last year with the Giro so wouldn't be surprised if he was right there,  he said.  He didn't have much help last year and had some bad luck and that's all it takes to throw you off.

Overall, $10.2 trillion will be invested in new global power generation between 2017 and 2040, with renewable power sources such as wind and solar accounting for almost three quarters of that, a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) said. By 2040, global emissions are expected to be 4 percent below 2016's levels, but an additional $5.3 trillion investment in renewable power would be needed by 2040 to keep rising global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Under the 2015 Paris deal, more than 190 countries pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions to keep planet-warming well below 2 degrees to stave off the worst effects of climate change. The report said the costs of renewable power were expected to continue to fall, with the cost of solar tipped to fall by 66 percent by 2040. The cost of offshore wind power is forecast to fall by 71 percent by 2040, helped in part by increased competition and economies of scale from larger projects and bigger turbines. U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw his country from the Paris Agreement, [nL1N1IY0MV] but the report said the move is unlikely to revive the U.S. coal industry. Coal-fired power generation in the United States is expected to fall by 51 percent by 2040, with a 169 percent increase in renewable power helping to fill the void.  The greening of the world's electricity system is unstoppable, thanks to rapidly falling costs for solar and wind power, and a growing role for batteries, including those in electric vehicles,  said BNEF analyst Seb Henbest, the report's lead author.  Homes and businesses with their own renewable generation sources, such as solar panels, are expected to be able to use and even sell the power they generate by storing it in batteries in their cars. Electric vehicles and their batteries are forecast to account for 12-13 percent of electricity generation by 2040 in Europe and the United States, the report said.

The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2svJfUd * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2s4kBZ8 * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2s4ut5m By John Kemp LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Some U.S. shale producers claim they can produce oil profitably with prices well below $50 per barrel or even $45 per barrel; the oil market is likely to put those claims to the test. Shale firms have hired an extra 425 rigs to drill for oil since the end of May 2016, more than doubling the active rig count, oilfield services company Baker Hughes says. Producers have continued adding rigs even though benchmark oil prices have fallen almost $10 per barrel since the middle of February and are now almost $4 below year ago levels. Rigs have been added at rates comparable to the height of the shale boom between 2012 and 2014 ensuring output will continue growing significantly through the rest of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts onshore production from the Lower 48 states will grow by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and another 500,000 bpd in 2018. As a result, U.S. shale producers together with other non-OPEC suppliers are expected to capture all of the increase in global oil demand in 2018 and raise their share of the market significantly at the expense of OPEC. Shale producers and OPEC are now on a collision course, with OPEC curbing production to try to raise prices and shale drillers adding rigs to boost output. The contradiction will likely be resolved through a drop in oil prices to rein in shale growth. Oil prices have already declined significantly to curb the drilling boom and put output on a more sustainable trajectory. Past experience shows changes in the U.S. oil rig count typically lag 15-20 weeks behind changes in WTI oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2svJfUd). The decline in WTI prices since February should cause the rig count to level out or even start to fall sometime between the middle of June and the end of July (tmsnrt.rs/2s4kBZ8). If the rig count starts to level off or fall in the next few weeks, it could offer some support to beleaguered oil prices. However, if the rig count continues rising relentlessly, fears about overproduction will grow, and prices are likely to come under even more pressure. Many shale producers hedged a large proportion of their planned production in 2017 at prices above $50 per barrel which has given them some protection from the recent downturn. Shale firms have benefited from the plentiful availability of fresh capital from private equity investors taking an optimistic long-term view of the prospects for both prices and output. But only a small proportion of output has been hedged for 2018, which will leave shale producers progressively more exposed to low prices as existing hedges mature. The calendar strip of monthly WTI futures prices for 2018 is trading just below $47 per barrel ensuring any new hedges for 2018 executed now will be well below $50. The calendar strip for 2018 has fallen by more than $9 from its recent high over $57 per barrel at the start of the year and has fallen to its lowest level for more than a year (tmsnrt.rs/2s4ut5m). The low level of forward prices is likely to discourage hedging -- unless shale producers really are profitable at much lower prices, or fear prices will slide even further. Eventually the reduction of both spot and forward prices should curb the drilling boom, which will in turn provide a floor for oil prices. But until the boom shows real signs of moderating, oil prices are likely to remain under pressure. Edited by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-shale-kemp-idUSL8N1JC316"},

The annual U.N. survey of 128 countries showed China rose three spots to 22nd place on the list, far ahead of other developing countries. Switzerland has topped the list every year since 2011, followed this year by Sweden, the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom, while the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Kuwait were some of the biggest risers.  Switzerland is the gold medalist once again, and that's seven years running, so that's quite an outstanding performance,  Francis Gurry, head of the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), told a news conference.  The Global Innovation Index is produced jointly by WIPO and two business schools - INSEAD and the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University, and seeks to shed light on countries' competitiveness based on 81 indicators.  What's important for us is to see the gaps in the scores,  said Soumitra Dutta, dean of Cornell Business School.  One country, India, was taking that lesson seriously, creating its own state-level index to try to create competition for investment and spur innovation nationally, he added. India rose six places to 60th in this year's rankings, the 10th edition, outperforming relative to its economic strength for the seventh year running. But it remained badly let down by its bureaucracy and infrastructure.  China's weak spots included tertiary education, the regulatory environment, creative media and protection of minority investors. But in many areas, such as high-tech exports, industrial design and business sophistication, it punched far above its weight. The index takes in factors including political environment, education, infrastructure and business sophistication. This year's report also reviews the state of innovation in agriculture and food systems across sectors and geographies. Gurry said it was premature to gauge what impact President Donald Trump's policies and Britain's decision to leave the European Union might have on their rankings, but international openness was key to fostering innovation.  Will the tendencies that are out there for protectionism have an impact on that? Regrettably perhaps for today's purposes it's too early to say but it's something that we should be very concerned about,  he said.

Two more policymakers at the Bank of England (BoE) joined existing rate rise advocate Kristin Forbes in calling for a reversal to the Bank's cut to interest rates last August, sending the pound as high as $1.2795 in the minutes following the Bank's decision, which left rates unchanged. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only Forbes - whose term on the Bank's rate setting committee expires at the end of the month - to back higher rates, especially given a slowdown in growth in the first three months of 2017. The risks to that view - and to sterling - were underlined by another lower than expected batch of retail sales data earlier.  I still think there is a case for weaker (UK) growth so I don't really agree with their arguments in the minutes this time,  said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist with SEB in Stockholm, adding that he saw no change to the Bank's policy this year or in the next.  What will be important (for sterling going forward) is really the tone we will have in the first negotiations which will begin next week between the UK and the EU.  The pound has hovered near the $1.27 mark after a near 3 percent fall in the wake of Britain's election last week, which produced a  hung  parliament - no clear majority for any party. Prime Minister Theresa May and her Conservative party are still in talks with another party from Northern Ireland to form a government, with just days remaining before the planned start date of talks on Britain's exit from the European Union. The dollar inched higher against a basket of peers, after the Federal Reserve's policy meeting kept up expectations of another interest rate hike this year. As widely expected, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.0-1.25 percent on Wednesday but it also gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. That undid all of the damage done to the greenback in Asian trading and pushed it higher in morning European trade. The dollar was up half a percent against both the euro and the Japanese currency, at $1.1161 per euro and 110.080 yen. The index that measures its broader strength was up 0.4 percent at 97.296. A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalisation at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.  Long term Fed expectations remain very much supported - that is the main reason why the dollar is remaining supported for now,  said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with Credit Agricole in London.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of annual global coal output vs China: tmsnrt.rs/2rynxKa By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 15 (Reuters) - It may be tempting for those opposed to burning coal to break out the champagne and toast the second consecutive annual decline in the use of the polluting fuel, but it's also likely a little early. World coal consumption dropped by 1.7 percent in 2016, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which was published on June 13. Consumption fell by 53 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe), which equates to about 79.5 million tonnes of hard coal on an energy basis, the review said. Global production of coal plunged 6.2 percent to 3,656 mtoe, or about 5.5 billion tonnes of hard coal, the review said, the largest annual drop on record. That's the good news for efforts to curb the use of the most-polluting major global energy source. The bad news is that 2017 may well see coal output and consumption increase from last year, and as usual with most things coal, it's all about China, which accounts for about half of global consumption. China is also the world's largest producer and importer of the fuel and while the authorities in Beijing have had success in reducing coal's share of the country's energy mix, so far this year is on track to see an increase in demand. This is largely because 2016 was somewhat exceptional in China from a coal perspective, with two factors combining to lower output and demand. The first was a policy driven move to restrict production by limiting the working days of domestic mines, which was aimed at boosting prices to ensure the viability of the industry as well as curbing air pollution. If anything the policy was too successful, resulting in a 9 percent drop in output in 2016 to 3.64 billion tonnes, the third consecutive annual decline. But rapid price gains and worries over a shortage of domestic coal prompted Beijing to reverse course, allowing mines to boost output in order to ensure adequate stocks and reduce reliance on imports, which surged 25.2 percent last year. China's coal production rose 12 percent in May to 297.8 million tonnes from the same month last year, according to official data released on Wednesday. For the first five months of the year, coal output is up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes, and a hot start to summer and low levels of inventories suggest that both domestic production and imports may rise in coming months. Weather to Boost Coal Use The weather was the other factor behind the decline in China's coal demand in 2016, with both a mild summer and winter curbing the need for electricity. If this summer does prove to be warmer than usual, it's likely that this alone will be enough to boost coal demand for the year. Imports are also still rising in China, with 111.7 million tonnes imported in the first five months of the year, up 29.6 percent from the same period in 2016. Rising imports will support coal production in China's main suppliers, Australia, Indonesia, Mongolia and Russia. If China's domestic coal output maintains the growth rate for the first five months of 2017 for the entire year, it implies production will rise by about 160 million tonnes from 2016. This is slightly less than half of what global coal output fell by in 2016, according to the BP review. It's also likely that coal output will gain in other countries, with India's state-owned producer targeting production of 660 million tonnes in the fiscal year from April 2017 to March 2018. If achieved, this would be an increase of 106 million tonnes from the 2016-17 fiscal year, but it's extremely unlikely Coal India will get anywhere near its target, if history is a guide. In 2016-17 the company fell 44 million tonnes short of its target, but still managed to produce some 25 million tonnes more than it did the prior year. Nonetheless, it's likely that India will increase output in the current year, and even an increase of the magnitude achieved in 2016-17 will add significantly to global production. Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal, is expected to boost output by nearly 5 percent in 2017, or about 20 million tonnes, to 460 million tonnes, according to the country's coal mining association. And if U.S. President Donald Trump has his way, coal output in the world's second-largest producer will rebound, although most analysts dismiss this as unrealistic. What is more likely is that coal output in the United States may stabilise, with higher production of coking coal used to make steel offsetting any declines in coal for power generation. Colombia, the world's fifth-largest coal exporter, plans to boost output by 4 million tonnes this year to around 95 million tonnes, a government official said on March 22. Another factor to consider with coal is price, and it's likely that part of the decline in consumption in 2016 was related to the strong rally over the year. The Asian benchmark weekly thermal coal price at Australia's Newcastle port more than doubled from the start of 2016 to the peak of $109.69 a tonne in November. It has since slipped back to $80.79 a tonne for the week ended June 9, with this decline improving the competitiveness of coal against other generating fuels, such as natural gas. Overall, with major coal producers planning to boost output this year, it's possible that 2017 will see an increase in production and consumption, or at least a sharp slowdown in the rate of decline.

The annual U.N. survey of 128 countries showed China rose three spots to 22nd place on the list, far ahead of other developing countries. Switzerland has topped the list every year since 2011, followed this year by Sweden, the Netherlands, the United States and the United Kingdom, while the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Kuwait were some of the biggest risers.  Switzerland is the gold medalist once again, and that's seven years running, so that's quite an outstanding performance,  Francis Gurry, head of the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), told a news conference.  The Global Innovation Index is produced jointly by WIPO and two business schools - INSEAD and the SC Johnson College of Business at Cornell University, and seeks to shed light on countries' competitiveness based on 81 indicators.  What's important for us is to see the gaps in the scores,  said Soumitra Dutta, dean of Cornell Business School.  One country, India, was taking that lesson seriously, creating its own state-level index to try to create competition for investment and spur innovation nationally, he added. India rose six places to 60th in this year's rankings, the 10th edition, outperforming relative to its economic strength for the seventh year running. But it remained badly let down by its bureaucracy and infrastructure.  China's weak spots included tertiary education, the regulatory environment, creative media and protection of minority investors. But in many areas, such as high-tech exports, industrial design and business sophistication, it punched far above its weight. The index takes in factors including political environment, education, infrastructure and business sophistication. This year's report also reviews the state of innovation in agriculture and food systems across sectors and geographies. Gurry said it was premature to gauge what impact President Donald Trump's policies and Britain's decision to leave the European Union might have on their rankings, but international openness was key to fostering innovation.  Will the tendencies that are out there for protectionism have an impact on that? Regrettably perhaps for today's purposes it's too early to say but it's something that we should be very concerned about,  he said.

On that day, the North released American student Otto Warmbier who had been held for 17 months and was said by his parents to be in a coma. Rodman visited the North in 2013 and 2014. The U.S. government has issued travel warnings to Americans against travel to the North. Rodman met North Korean Olympic athletes, including judo gold medalist An Kum Ae, reported the AP, which has a bureau in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.  All of you guys should be proud of yourselves, because, you know, a lot of people don’t give you guys credit, because this is such a small country, and not many people from North Korea can compete around the world,” Rodman was quoted as telling the athletes.  But for you guys to come back here in your country, with a medal, that says a lot about North Korea, because people don’t really take North Korea so seriously about sports or anything like that.  The former basketball star has said his visit is not linked to the White House. Before Trump became president, Rodman appeared twice on his  Celebrity Apprentice  show and praised the billionaire real estate developer on Twitter during last year's election campaign. Tension has escalated on the Korean peninsula over North Korea's nuclear and missile tests since last year. North Korea has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Putin, who is divorced, has two daughters, Katerina and Maria, and is famously reluctant to discuss them or any aspect of his own personal life.  As for my grandchildren, one already attends nursery school,  said Putin, when asked about his family in a televised  question and answer session with voters ahead of a presidential election next year.   The thing is I don't want them to grow up like princes. I want them to be normal people. And for that they need ordinary, normal communication with other children.  For that reason, he said he preferred not to disclose their names and ages.   They would be immediately identified and not left in peace. It would damage the children's development. I ask you to understand me and to treat this position with understanding,  he said. Putin also touched on the subject of his daughters saying that, despite what he called rumors, they both lived in Moscow.        My daughters are involved in science and in education. They don't interfere in anything, including politics. They live normally.  Reuters has reported that Putin's daughter Katerina works in a senior post at Moscow State University and that she has described herself as the spouse of Kirill Shamalov, a shareholder in petrochemicals company Sibur. Kirill is the son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime friend of the president. Shamalov senior is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which U.S. officials have described as the personal bank of the Russian elite. Reuters has also reported that a number of firms and individuals close to the Kremlin were providing support to a project Katerina oversees at the university, and to the All-Russian Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll Federation, in which she is involved.

The comments by Werner Bahlsen, head of the economic council of Merkel's CDU conservatives, came after Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Tuesday urged the ECB to change its policy  in a timely manner , warning that very low interest rates had caused problems in some parts of the world. Germany is heading towards a federal election in September. The ECB's 2.3 trillion-euro ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying scheme is set to run until the year's end, so it will have to decide around that time whether to keep on buying to prop up a still- weak inflation rate or start winding down the programme. Germany, the bloc's largest economy, and other northern countries say the bond purchases are eroding the assets of savers and discouraging other euro zone countries from pursuing reforms to make their economies more efficient. With growth in the euro zone picking up, German politicians argue the time has come for the ECB to step back - although Schaeuble is also benefitting from record-low borrowing costs.  The ongoing purchase of government bonds has already cost the European project a great deal of credibility and has damaged it,  Bahlsen said.  The ECB can only regain trust with the return to a sound monetary policy.  A survey by the CDU's economic council showed that less than a quarter of its roughly 12,000 members had confidence in the ECB's course. Seventy-six 76 percent said they backed Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann's monetary policy stance. Weidmann said on Wednesday that the ECB, now a top creditor to euro zone governments, is at risk of coming under political pressure because any hint of policy tightening poses the risk of pushing yields higher and blowing a hole in national budgets.

Law enforcement agencies and congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with members of Trump's campaign. Here is what is publicly known and not known:   How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putin's  associates hacked information, paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow's role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump's campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia's role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clinton's use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying:  I will tell you this, Russia: if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.  He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration.  As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,  Trump said, although he added:  It could have been others also.  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed.  The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?  he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted:  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  Did the FBI probe continue after Comey's dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey's departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey's firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on  Restoring Confidence in the FBI  that recommended Comey's dismissal. Rosenstein's memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton's use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein's view was that Comey's decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's recommendation. Was Comey's firing related to the FBI's Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBI's Russia probe.  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that,  Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agency's investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency, according Comey's testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agency's probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed.  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called  Showboat  to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  Mueller's probe has expanded to include examining whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to curtail the FBI's probe of Russian meddling, the Washington Post reported on June 14. In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he had thanked Comey for informing him that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. The Post reported the scope of the probe expanded to include Trump shortly after Comey's dismissal, citing government officials. Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty.

Struggling retailers, weak commodities stocks and ex-dividends also sent the blue-chip FTSE 100 index to its lowest level in a month, down 1.2 percent at 7,386.78 points by 1123 GMT. The mid-cap index fell 2 percent.  If one of the indices is going to find things tougher, it's likely to be the (FTSE) 250 rather than the 100,  said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. The slide in UK stocks worsened after the Bank of England said that its Monetary Policy Committee had come the closest to voting for an interest rate rise since 2007, with three of its policymakers backing an increase. The session was proving especially tricky for British retailers, with furniture seller DFS plummeting by more than 21 percent after a profit warning, blaming a weaker trading environment. Its shares were set for their worst day since listing. Shares in mid-cap peer Howden Joinery nursed a 6.8 percent loss, while smaller ScS tumbled 8.3 percent. The FTSE 350 general retailers index was down 3.4 percent.  DFS believes that (like-for-like) sales could recover. However, we take a more cautious view given rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty,  Jefferies analysts said in a note, downgrading DFS to  hold . A sharp fall in retail sales in May showed that British retailers are facing a tough time as a jump in inflation and low wage growth puts pressure on consumers, with a hung parliament after the UK general election adding to political uncertainty. Weakness in retail was also evidenced in the United States in the previous session, when figures showed that U.S. consumer prices fell unexpectedly in May. Aside from falls in Persimmon and other stocks trading ex-dividend, shares in clothes retailer Next slid by 5 percent after Credit Suisse cut its rating to  underperform , pointing to weak pricing across Europe for the wider sector.  With earnings, margins and cash conversion continuing to fall, we regard Next as a value trap,  Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Falls in mining companies also weighed, with Anglo American , BHP Billiton and Glencore all weaker as the price of copper fell, set back by strength in the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Likewise, oil and gas stocks BP and Royal Dutch Shell retreated as crude oil prices hit a six-week low. Only three stocks were in positive territory among the blue chips, with emerging markets-exposed lender HSBC, RBS and LSE Group holding on to marginal gains.

The refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - 59 men, eight women and four children - were crammed into the back of a small lorry by people smugglers and suffocated on the journey from Hungary. The case highlighted the perils of the journey that more than a million migrants undertook as they fled conflict and economic hardship in the Middle East and Africa, causing a humanitarian crisis and political strife in Europe. German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung reported on Wednesday that Hungarian police had intercepted and recorded mobile phone conversations among the traffickers who drove the lorry, but acted too late to stop it.  It is incorrect to assume Hungarian authorities could have prevented the deadly crime considering its extremely rapid course,  prosecution spokesman Gabor Schmidt wrote in a response to questions from Reuters. He said Hungarian police were working to disrupt human trafficking networks that ferried migrants, often in poorly ventilated refrigerator trucks, across international borders. Schmidt said before the deadly incident police had no indication the migrants would be in mortal danger inside the trucks and focussed on mapping the networks. He said investigators had tapped the phones of the leaders of the trafficking ring that caused the deaths of the 71 migrants from Aug. 13, 2015 - two weeks before the deadly journey - trying to map traffickers in an earlier case. Suddeutsche Zeitung detailed some of the conversations based on police records it obtained. In one instance, the Afghan ring leader explicitly forbids the driver to open the lorry's door despite loud banging and cries for help from the inside.  You should in no way open the door,  he says.  If people die in there unload them in a forest in Germany.  As this conversation took place in the early hours of Aug. 27, 2015, no one was listening in on the Hungarian side.  Because there had been no data about transports threatening human life... we could not shorten the period of the wiretap (and move in on the traffickers sooner),  Schmidt wrote. There was  no reason or capacity  to listen to the conversations live. He said the languages spoken - Pashto, and Bulgarian and Serbian dialects - posed additional difficulties.  All of that meant the Hungarian authorities could only translate and analyse the wiretaps after the transport that led to the deaths of the 71 migrants,  he said, adding authorities had observed all relevant Hungarian laws. Eleven men have been charged in connection with the deaths. Their trial is due to start next week.

Keeping wild cats as pets is not uncommon in Pakistan, where wealthy businessmen have been known to operate private zoos and sometimes parade the animals for the public.  The brief clip shows a docile lion lounging in the back of a pick-up truck, restrained by a leash and collar, as curious onlookers walk past in the city of about 20 million people. Businessman Saqlain Javed was arrested on Wednesday but later freed on bail.  The man was driving around with his lion near a local market and it was a matter of endangering public life and property,  senior police superintendent Muqadas Haider told Reuters. Javed has a license to run a personal zoo and raise lion cubs, Haider added, but is not allowed to transport the animal on city streets.  The lion has been returned to its home as police consult the wildlife department on further action.  Javed was not immediately available for comment. Police said he claimed to be taking the animal home after a visit to a vet.   We have a security detail monitoring the property to make sure the lion is not removed,  Haided added.  In 2015, a pet lioness gave birth to five cubs in the central city of Multan, media said at the time.

The visit by the USS Sterett guided-missile destroyer to Zhanjiang in Guangdong province, the first U.S. warship to visit China since President Donald Trump took office, comes amid tension in the disputed South China Sea, where Washington has criticised Beijing for building artificial islands. U.S.  ship days  spent in the waters were on course to reach 900 this year, up from about an average of 700 days annually, Swift told reporters, crediting an increase in the number of carrier strike groups temporarily operating in the Pacific. But Swift played down the significance of the figure, saying it might not be sustained.  That's what resulted, that we had that increase in the number of strike group availability in the Pacific, which is what has led to that increase in ship days this year. It could be, you know, lower next year,  Swift said. Swift and other U.S. officials have said there has been no change to U.S. Navy freedom-of-navigation operations under Trump. In May, a U.S. warship carried out a  manoeuvring drill  when it sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island, Mischief Reef, built up by China in the South China Sea, to show China it was not entitled to the sea around it. It was the first U.S. freedom-of-navigation operation since October. Trump took office in January. The United States has condemned China's construction of islands and its build-up of military facilities there, concerned they could be used to restrict free movement and extend China's strategic reach. But U.S. allies in the region had grown anxious as Trump's administration had held off on carrying out South China Sea operations during its first few months in office. Some in the region attributed that to a U.S. unwillingness to anger China when its efforts were needed to try to rein in a defiant North Korea. The May U.S. Navy drill included a  man overboard  exercise to show that the ship's movement was not merely  innocent passage , according to U.S. officials, referring to when a warship effectively recognises a territorial sea by crossing it speedily, without stopping. The Sterett took part in drills in the South China Sea last week. Though they were not considered a freedom-of-navigation operation, they prompted China to say it was maintaining vigilance over U.S. military actions in the waters. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, a stance contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

European Union state aid rules are designed to support a shift towards a lower carbon economy, though they allow some support for fossil fuel if it is needed to prevent blackouts or if it cuts emissions by improving efficiency. ClientEarth lawyer Sam Bright said the activist lawyers had spent more than a year investigating Bulgaria's practice of requiring public power provider NEK and distribution companies to buy all the electricity produced by plants classified as  high-efficiency co-generation  that produce heat as well as power.  These operators are paid a surcharge, which comes from a levy on consumer bills. ClientEarth, whose campaigning successes include exposing Britain's breach of EU air quality legislation, said its research found the aid flouted EU rules and the plants did not qualify for such help.   Bulgaria is giving these plants an unfair and unlawful subsidy, which is helping to prop up coal power plants, amongst others, and hindering the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy,  Bright told Reuters. He said the lawyers had made a conservative estimate of the amount of aid paid between 2007 and 2016 and it could be higher. Bulgaria's energy minister told Reuters she did not believe the Commission would find any problem.  Until now we have not seen any obstruction, including from the European Commission,  Temenuzhka Petkova said.   Since 2015, Bulgarian legislators have passed a number of legal changes to limit the access to preferential prices and strengthen controls over high-efficiency electricity production.

The 12-year-old company bought one of Sweden's most vaunted publishing houses, Norstedts, last year in what has been a string of deals for a business that has become a symbol of the rapid transformation of the sector. The acquisition of Norstedts, founded in 1823 and the publisher of several Nobel Prize winners and Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy and sequels, was described by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper as one of the biggest changes ever for the Swedish book market.  There was a great deal of fuss about it. But I still think people appreciated that someone who was into books and stories became the owner (of Norstedts),  CEO and founder Jonas Tellander, a former executive at Swiss drugmaker Roche, told Reuters. Yet the deal might never have happened had Tellander not secured cash on TV show Dragons' Den, on which entrepreneurs seek financing from venture capitalists, effectively saving his budding business from bankruptcy. While Amazon's Audible dominates markets such as the United States, Germany and Britain, Storytel is investing heavily to become the leader in countries and languages off the beaten track of its bigger competitor. Having almost doubled sales annually since 2009, Storytel now has a market capitalisation of 3.5 billion Swedish crowns ($401 million) and its share price has jumped by 130 percent in the past year to 72.50 crowns. Expectations are high, with Morningstar data showing the company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 481. Investors are betting that Storytel, which has spent about 400 million crowns on acquisitions, can replicate the success achieved in its current markets, where paying subscribers rose 40 percent to 380,000 in the first quarter. Finding Cash, Finding People Storytel has more than 6,000 audio book titles, compared with Audible's 180,000-plus, delivering its content to the mobile devices of customers in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Poland. Much like with music service Spotify, Storytel subscribers pay a monthly fee for unlimited access to streamed audio books, which can also be saved in offline mode on Apple or android devices. Expansion into Spain, India and the United Arab Emirates will follow Russia this year, but without the financial of a heavyweight parent such as Amazon, Storytel faces the challenge of refilling cash coffers to fund its growth. It raised 122 million crowns in financing last year.  We are looking in all countries. We just need to find the right set-up and the right people,  Tellander said. The company also faces the challenge of taking on new languages and the need to find the right local entrepreneurs, said Erik Sprinchorn, fund manager at Swedbank Robur, which has close to a 5 percent stake in Storytel. Tellander said that Storytel is seeking access to the rights of 4,000 existing titles in Russia but is also starting its own production of audio books for the Indian market as well as in Arabic and Spanish, with new stories from local authors. Mirroring the strategy of movie streaming giant Netflix , both Storytel and Audible are betting that original content written exclusively for their platforms will attract more subscribers. The company made an operating profit of 25.5 million crowns last year, though heavy expansion and high marketing costs pushed it into the red again in the first quarter. Swedbank's Sprinchorn said it was nearly impossible to forecast market growth, but the global audiobook industry is currently valued at $3.5 billion, according to news website GoodEreader, referring to the Association of American Publishers. A few years ago many people were unwilling to pay for something they couldn't hold in their hands, Tellander said. Spotify and Netflix have changed that.  Once they succeed in a market, the likelihood that people will want to pay for Storytel increases. We are following their footsteps and eyeing their markets,  he said.

The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry. Last month Modi's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather. Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labor in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks. Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry. Social Tensions Much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure. But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides. Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100. The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India's poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019. Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government's move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry's image. Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad. Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales. When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.  They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,  says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders. Muqeem's monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.      Impossible Target Like meat, India's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes. Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry. Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment. India is one of the world's top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo. Modi's government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion - more than double today's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push. Shoe-makers work in an underground workshop in Agra, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Cathal McNaughtonBut in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales. India's environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy. But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.  Companies say the government's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.  There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,  Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.  There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.  India's commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March. Slideshow (5 Images)About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs. Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra's leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.  The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart. Modi's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus. When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders:  Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.  In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.  Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximize profits,  he said in Lucknow, the state capital. Wider Industry Hit In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up. Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur's Small Tanners' Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers' organization, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.  More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,  said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy once called  untouchables  are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them. Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month's inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff. Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage laborers stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem's cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather. He now earns 3,000 rupees  - or $47 - a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father's income supports three sisters and his mother.  I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,  he said.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.       However, the Fed's decision and confidence in continued U.S. economic growth was overshadowed by surprisingly weak data released earlier in the day.     U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April.      Markets are reacting to the situation and have priced in the rate hike,  said Liu Jinshu, director of research, NRA Capital.      The tone and projection suggest that one more rate hike is yet to come, and on top of that, we still have the shrinking treasury balance sheet to think about. I think the market is trying to digest this additional information,  he added.     Investor sentiment was also dented by oil prices, which fell to six-week lows under pressure from high global inventories and doubts about OPEC's ability to implement production cuts.     Singapore shares posted their lowest close in one week, dragged down by the financial sector.      While Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp ended at a one-week closing low, index heavyweights United Overseas Bank Ltd closed 2.2 percent lower and DBS Group Holdings  shed 0.9 percent.     Indonesia shares retreated from their record closing high hit in the previous session to end 0.3 percent lower, with Astra International Tbk PT pulling down the index.      Indonesia's central bank on Thursday left its benchmark interest rate where it has been since October, saying the level is consistent with efforts to maintain stability while pushing for economic growth recovery.     Malaysia ended in negative territory after hitting a two-year high earlier in the session.     Vietnam shares ended flat.

The dovish tone signalled the Swiss central bank was nowhere close to tightening policy as it tries to keep a lid on the strong Swiss franc that is weighing on the export-led economy. Asked if the SNB was considering trimming a balance sheet bloated by currency interventions, Chairman Thomas Jordan told a media conference:  That is not an issue. Our monetary policy remains expansionary for the reasons we’ve given, namely low inflation, underutilisation of production capacities and a significantly overvalued franc.  The U.S. Federal Reserve in contrast plans to shrink its $4.5-trillion portfolio. It mapped out on Wednesday a very gradual approach to shedding assets. The SNB's leeway has been limited by the European Central Bank's massive bond-buying programme, which has weakened the value of the euro. UBS economist Alessandro Bee said he expected the ECB to announce in the second half of the year that it will start scaling back asset purchases in 2018.  The bit more hawkish monetary stance by the ECB should give the SNB some monetary leeway in coming quarters. We first expect the SNB to keep monetary policy unchanged and to let the franc weaken. Only in June 2018 the SNB may use this monetary leeway to rise interest rate once,  Bee said. The SNB kept its target for three-month LIBOR at -1.25 percent to -0.25 percent and the rate on sight deposits at -0.75 percent as expected in a Reuters poll. It kept its 2017 inflation forecast of 0.3 percent but trimmed its 2018 outlook to 0.3 percent from 0.4 and its 2019 forecast to 1.0 percent from 1.1. It has kept rates frozen since it abandoned its cap on the franc versus the euro two and a half years ago, which sent the franc soaring against the single currency. Jordan did not rule out cutting interest rates further if needed and said the SNB could also use currency interventions to weaken the franc. The SNB has bought more than 47 billion Swiss francs ($48.4 billion) of foreign currency this year, although the amounts have been scaled back in recent weeks. Jordan said the global economy was strengthening and labour markets were picking up while inflation remained surprisingly modest in most advanced economies.  In our baseline scenario, we expect monetary policy to normalise further in the United States, obviously depending on the economic development there, and to remain expansionary in Europe. Europe is more important for us, of course,  he said. Jordan said political risks had diminished somewhat after pro-Europe centrist Emmanuel Macron's election victory in France, but had not gone away completely and could still lead to upward pressure on the franc. The SNB cited  considerable downside risks  to its baseline scenario. It saw 1.5 percent Swiss economic growth this year. $1 = 0.9717 Swiss francs Additonal reporting by Joshua Franklin and John Revill in Zurich; Editing by Michael Shields and Toby Chopra","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-snb-rates-idUSL8N1JC177"},

On Wednesday, Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling declared that they had lost confidence in their older brother and feared  the use of the organs of the state against us.  Lee Hsien Yang also announced that he, and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, were planning to leave the island state  for the foreseeable future  because they felt threatened. They have not disclosed the date of their departure or the destination.  Lots of things can happen to me,  he told Reuters in a phone interview on Thursday.  They have stopped people from leaving the country. I suppose if they do, they would have to explain at least. I don’t think there are any grounds to.  The Prime Minister's Office didn't immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Lee Hsien Yang's latest claims. The three children of Lee Kuan Yew, who was the founding father of modern Singapore and who ruled the country for three decades, are feuding over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. The siblings have, among other things, accused the prime minister and his wife, Ho Ching, of harbouring political ambitions for their son, Li Hongyi. The prime minister on Wednesday denied the allegations and said he was disappointed that his siblings have chosen to publicize private family matters. On Thursday, Li denied he wanted a political role, saying on Facebook:  For what it is worth, I really have no interest in politics.   Big Brother  Lee Hsien Yang has made it clear he is concerned about his phone calls and messages being monitored. He tries to make it more difficult to track his communications, using an internatioonal phone number and the WhatsApp messaging service.  I've used the term big brother, what do you think big brother means? Why do you think I use WhatsApp?  he said. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook Inc, promises privacy through encrypted messaging. Lee, the former chief executive of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, who is currently the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, said that he is still in Singapore as he needs  time to sort out my affairs.   I hope wherever I move to might be safe. It will be safer, I would say,  he said. The attacks on the prime minister by his two siblings, which initially came in a joint news release and statement while their brother was on holiday has led to a rare public display of discord at the top of a country that usually keeps such matters firmly behind closed doors. Lee Hsien Yang and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, said they feel hugely unwelcome and closely monitored in Singapore.  I'm constrained about what I should and can say. You realise of course that they are very quick to threaten defamation... Many people and many tools get used to make people feel uncomfortable,  he told Reuters on Thursday. He provided no specific evidence of action by the Singapore government against him. Reuters was unable to independently verify the accusations. Lee Wei Ling said on Wednesday if the dispute were merely a family affair, she would not have publicized it. Her concern was also about the way ordinary citizens could face an abuse of power, she said on Facebook. Before he died in 2015, Lee Kuan Yew made it public that he wanted the house, a humbly furnished home with retro furniture near the bustling Orchard shopping district, demolished. But the prime minister's siblings claim that he and his wife, Ho Ching, had opposed the wish. Officials have said that the prime minister has recused himself from any government decisions about the house.

First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obama's healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBO's assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes.  I think most of the taxes are going to go away,  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday.  Our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue.  Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans' healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the law's taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacare's taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.   There's no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now,  Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal.  Think of me with a Rubik's cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50,  McConnell said.

If your answer is “Social Security,” congratulations. You know that Social Security Disability Insurance is part of Social Security. That seems obvious, but the Trump administration wants you to think otherwise. “If you ask 999 people out of 1,000, (they) would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security,” Mick Mulvaney, the administration’s budget director, said in May at a press briefing on its 2018 spending plan. “It’s old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security.”  Mulvaney was explaining a proposed $72 billion spending cut in disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income, to be spread over 10 years. The likely intent was to wriggle away from President Donald Trump's campaign pledge not to cut Social Security.  Mulvaney does have a point - most people do think of retirement when they think of Social Security, due to the universality of retirement benefits. But despite his claims on popular perceptions of Social Security, Mulvaney’s attempt to separate SSDI from Social Security is dangerous and could have a very corrosive effect. Hacking away at the disability insurance program is an attack on the very idea of social insurance. The fundamental aim of Social Security is to protect against the risk of lost income from work, whether from retirement, disability or the death of a family breadwinner. Disability insurance was added to the program during the  Eisenhower era. Workers and employers alike contribute to the disability insurance fund through their payroll tax contributions. (Currently, 2.37 percent of the total 12.4 percent payroll tax goes into the disability fund, split evenly between workers and employers.)  Workers qualify for benefits by working the equivalent of at least 10 years - just as they do for Social Security and Medicare, although the number of work credits required for disability are adjusted for age to accommodate younger workers. So disability protection is an earned benefit, no different than retirement coverage. But SSDI often is attacked as though it were a government handout. Indeed, the administration's proposed cuts come alongside appalling cuts to other programs that assist the vulnerable, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Republican opponents of SSDI often argue that disability spending is out of control, and that more beneficiaries must return to the workforce. “It’s the fastest-growing program,” Mulvaney said during one television interview about the budget.  It grew tremendously under President Obama. It’s a very wasteful program, and we want to try and fix that.” Hence the Trump budget plan forecasts cutting spending by tightening program eligibility rules. Spending Levels Off SSDI spending did grow in recent decades, but that was due to changes in the nation’s demography and workforce. Aging baby boomers reached ages when disability is most likely, and more women entered the workforce, making them eligible for disability payments where needed. Another factor: the increase in Social Security’s retirement age, to 66 from 65, has kept more workers on disability who would have otherwise transitioned to retirement benefits at 65. More recently, growth has leveled off - 9.455 million people received disability benefits in April this year, down by 121,000 compared with the previous April. The benefit is very modest, averaging just $1,032 per month. Media reports on SSDI often try to make the case that fraud and abuse of the program are rampant, but the case is mostly anecdotal. Typically these stories focus on the South or Appalachia - parts of the country where SSDI beneficiaries are found in disproportionate numbers due to lower levels of education and income, and where access to healthcare is more limited.  There hasn’t been any evidence to show that people who could be working are getting on benefits,” said Lisa Ekman, director of government affairs at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives, a specialized bar association for attorneys and advocates who represent SSDI claimants. “The standards haven’t changed, and they are very strict.” Indeed, only one in three SSDI applications are approved upon initial application and less than 40 percent are granted after all levels of appeal are exhausted, she notes. If anything in SSDI needs reform, it is the horrendously clogged pipeline of cases on appeal awaiting adjudication. Wait times are at a historic high - an average of 616 days to get a hearing. But budgeting for a big cut in SSDI spending by tightening work requirements is no more than wishful thinking. The only way to really save money in the program is by shrinking the benefits of vulnerable people or by reducing benefit levels that already are very modest. But trying to cut the “SS” from SSDI is not going to cut it.   (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

After the financial crisis in which UBS suffered billions of dollars in losses and took a government bailout, Switzerland introduced new regulations designed to protect the economy from a possible banking collapse. The Swiss National Bank (SNB), which helps to oversee the stability of the country's financial system, said on Thursday that the two biggest banks are on track to meet the new capital requirements but more work is needed.  As a means of resolving the 'too big to fail' issue in Switzerland, it is essential that further progress be made in drawing up robust resolution plans,  the SNB wrote in its annual financial stability report. UBS and Credit Suisse, the combined balance sheets of which are more than two-and-a-half times the size of the Switzerland's economy, have already set up Swiss subsidiaries that house functions crucial to the country. However, they still need to demonstrate how they would be able to maintain these systemically important services when faced with impending insolvency, the SNB said. They will also need to bolster capital set aside in case a bank must be wound down following insolvency. Both banks are on track to meet updated too-big-to-fail (TBTF) capital requirements by the end of 2019, the SNB said, though it cautioned that they still need to improve their total loss-absorbing capacity for leverage ratios. The TBTF rules include a headline requirement for UBS and Credit Suisse to hold core capital representing 5 percent of total assets, known as the leverage ratio. At least 3.5 percent of the leverage ratio is to be made up of high-quality common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital. They will also need to meet a CET1 ratio of 10 percent. The CET1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets is a closely watched measure of balance sheet strength. After raising about 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.1 billion) this year, Credit Suisse said it would have a CET1 ratio of 13.4 percent and a leverage ratio of 5.1 percent, based on first-quarter reported numbers. UBS had a CET1 ratio of 14.1 percent at the end of the first quarter and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.55 percent. Spokesmen for UBS and Credit Suisse said they welcomed the SNB's recognition of their efforts to bolster their capital positions.

The shareholder vote shows how investors, even in an uncontested board election, are increasingly voicing their frustration with board members on matters related to executive and director pay. Chairman David D'Alessandro received more  withhold  votes than  for  votes at the annual meeting on Wednesday, a proxy voting result that means shareholders effectively voted him off the board, according to people familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named because the vote tally is not yet final. The result means that D'Alessandro is required to offer his resignation, according to company bylaws. The board must then disclose within 90 days what its intentions are in relation to the offer.   The board will continue to proceed in the best interest of shareholders following this year’s annual meeting,  Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld said in a statement to Reuters.  SeaWorld announced in March that China's Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co Ltd agreed to buy Blackstone Group's 21 percent stake in the theme park operator for $23 per share, or $429 million. The following month, SeaWorld disclosed in a securities filing that in connection with the sale, it would be paying out special bonuses to certain employees that dated to SeaWorld's 2013 IPO. The original agreement granted D'Alessandro, ex-CEO Jim Atchison and about 60 key employees a chunk of restricted shares to be paid out if SeaWorld achieved certain goals, including an investment return multiple of 2.75 times Blackstone's invested capital.  Based on the price Zhonghong paid, the achieved multiple fell just shy of that threshold, the company said. What sparked the ire of investors was that despite missing the target, SeaWorld still agreed to make the restricted share payouts, with D'Alessandro and eight of the company's senior executives forfeited 40 percent of the sum. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against D'Alessandro and another director at the annual meeting, citing the stock payouts. Proxy adviser ISS recommended shareholders vote against SeaWorld's compensation plans at the meeting, calling the restricted share payout  concerning  given the company's poor financial performance. SeaWorld's shares have fallen by half since its IPO. Shares of the $1.5 billion company rose 6.7 percent on Wednesday to $17.07 per share.  We have spoken to investors who share those concerns so a negative vote and some degree of board shakeup seem possible to us,  FBR analyst Barton Crockett said in a June 9 note. The company said in a letter to shareholders prior to the annual meeting that after considering certain factors, including achieving 97 percent of the investment multiple threshold, that it was appropriate for morale and employee retention to make the payouts. None of the company's new leadership team were eligible for the restricted shares, SeaWorld said.  Most of the covered individuals had been working for several years to stabilize the company,  SeaWorld said in its letter to shareholders. SeaWorld, which operates 12 theme parks in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio, faced criticism after the release of the 2013 documentary  Blackfish,  which depicted the captivity and public exhibition of killer whales as inherently cruel. The company said last year it would stop breeding killer whales in captivity.

The task of upgrading Malaysia's ageing fleet of fighter jets is being complicated by defence budget cuts, as Prime Minister Najib Razak grapples with growing public discontent over the rising cost of living. French arms maker Dassault Aviation SA, which builds the Rafale fighter jet, is seen as a frontrunner to supply up to 18 new aircraft to Malaysia's air force in a deal that could be worth more than $2 billion. The bodies of the two jet pilots - Major Hasri Zahari and Major Yazmi Mohamed Yusof - were found with their parachutes unfurled in a swamp in the state of Terengganu, said Affendi Buang, the chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF).  We saw the bodies and their parachutes, which means they had ejected from the plane,  Affendi told a news conference broadcast on Facebook by Malaysian publication BH Online.  We have yet to find the plane,  he said at the event in Kuantan, about 400 km (249 miles) from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. Authorities lost contact with the British-made Hawk 108 fighter jet half an hour into the exercise, Affendi said, adding that a panel has been set up to investigate the incident, and the air force will temporarily ground all its Hawk 108 aircraft. Najib offered condolences to the pilots' families in a message on social network Twitter, and vowed an indepth investigation. The last mishap involving a Malaysian-owned Hawk fighter jet was a 2003 jet crash off the coast of Kuantan during a training flight, killing both occupants. Thursday's crash comes six months after an air force twin turboprop Beechcraft B200T crashed at a base in northern Penang state during a training exercise, killing the pilot and injuring three. In May last year, two air force officers suffered minor injuries when their Aermacchi MB-339CM training jet crashed because of a faulty engine on a training flight, media said.

The 40-year-old father of one was among millions of east Europeans who moved to wealthier western Europe in search of better-paid jobs after their countries joined the EU from 2004, leaving huge labor market gaps behind. With economic prospects improving across eastern Europe and wages rising due partly to a shortage of workers, official data show tens of thousands of people returning to the region, where the cost of living remains well below western levels. Those numbers will not cure chronic labor shortages overnight. Thousands of people are still planning to leave, and latest data show emigrants from both Hungary and Bulgaria still outnumber returnees. But the first waves of returnees still signal something of a turning point for a region where migration has hitherto worked largely as a one-way street. Kiss left home in 2010 to take up a job in a hotel kitchen in northern Italy after his video rental and massage businesses crashed during the global crisis, which hit Hungary hard.  I had to find something to be able to maintain the same standard of living,  said Kiss, whose son, now eight, was just 10 months old when he started working abroad. Kiss, who has recently acquired a barista certification, plans to use his savings to launch a cafe in Budapest with a fellow Hungarian with whom he worked while abroad.  Distance and this way of life take a very hard toll on your relationships,  he said.  For me, too, not coming home now would have probably meant the end of my family.  Official statistics show 17,000 Hungarians returned last year, up from below 15,000 a year earlier. More than 9,000 Bulgarians have been returning home every year since 2014, double the numbers of earlier years. Many are young people returning to start their own business, mainly in the IT sector, or to join growing outsourcing business opportunities. In Poland, the region's biggest economy, net international migration turned positive last year for the first time since World War Two, official statistics show. Meanwhile, net migration of EU citizens to Britain, a top target for east Europeans along with Germany or Italy, fell last year as new arrivals from eastern European countries sank to the lowest level since they joined the EU in 2004. Britain's looming exit from the EU is deterring some migrants.  Bosch employee Mate Muskat talks with Reuters in Budapest, Hungary, June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Laszlo BaloghImre Molnar and his fiancee returned to Hungary after two years spent in Switzerland as they could not feel settled abroad. They have opened a wine bar in Budapest that serves only local wines and food.  We realized that Switzerland is a very different country,  Molnar said.  It is very beautiful, but society is quite closed, people are not very open and in reality we did not feel at home as we do here in Budapest.   Like Hot Cakes  Judit Kovacs, a branch manager at the Hungarian unit of Dutch staffing agency Randstad, said blue-collar workers were more likely to return as they usually cannot afford to take their entire family abroad.  There is demand for returning workers, especially those who have learned a new technology,  she said, citing auto sector suppliers as an example. Slideshow (2 Images) Machine operators, for example, who have learned to run machinery that is not yet in use in Hungary but the investment is already in the pipeline,  Kovacs said.  Workers with such experience are being snapped up like hot cakes.  Technological advances, such as the advent of self-driving cars, or the entry of service sector companies like BlackRock Inc into the Hungarian market, are also creating opportunities for white-collar workers. German technology supplier Robert Bosch hired 2,000 workers in Hungary last year alone and plans to add hundreds more engineering jobs to keep up with buoyant demand. BlackRock, which announced plans in January to open a service hub in Budapest, said it had received a large number of applications from prospective returnees after a scouting event hosted by the Hungarian embassy in London.  About a third of applicants ... were Hungarians working in London who are planning to return to Hungary,  corporate communications director Marc Bubeck said. Economists are generally upbeat about prospects for the eastern European region, which is expected to outpace its richer western peers in economic growth in the years ahead despite concerns over its continued reliance on EU development funds. But money isn't everything.  In purely financial terms, it is definitely worth working abroad,  Kiss said.  But if you look at the other side of the equation, that I have yet to ride a sled with my son even though he is already eight, the two are not necessarily in balance.   For now, I am full of hopes and dreams,  he said.

First built as a cargo line to carry wood from Nepal to India in 1937, it was once the lifeblood of the community in Janakpur, running 29 km (18 miles) from Jainagar in India's neighboring eastern state of Bihar. The train service, which eventually became a cheap way for travelers to cross the international border, closed in January 2014 for a $100-million project to upgrade the colonial-era narrow rail track into a broad-gauge line. Now the only sign of life is laughing children, who chase each other through the disintegrating carriages, climbing on rusting benches and tumbling over one another. But the closure hit Janakpur hard, with close to 130 railway employees losing their jobs, said Tula Bahadur Dangi, acting general manager of Nepal Railway Corporation, who has worked for the company for 18 years. Travelers have been forced to use buses instead, paying three times the price of a train ticket for a journey four times as long, which is complicated further during the monsoon rains that make the roads muddy.

First proposed by moderate Republicans, the idea is gaining traction among party members, according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions. While no final decisions have been made, a sense of urgency has increased as Republicans draft a replacement bill to former President Barack Obama's healthcare law before Congress goes on recess on June 30. But keeping some of the taxes in the Senate bill risks alienating conservatives. On Tuesday, 45 conservative groups and activists sent a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, urging the Senate to repeal all Obamacare taxes. One cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax, which imposes a 3.8 percent surtax on capital gains, dividends and interest, the sources said. The taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry, including a tax on health insurance premiums, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance and the medical device tax. Another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but to scale them back. A group of 13 Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not completed a full draft of the bill, but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of various provisions. The CBO's assessment will help determine which taxes the Senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill. It is not clear whether McConnell, or more conservative party members such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, are receptive to keeping some of the taxes.  I think most of the taxes are going to go away,  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 3-ranking Republican, said on Tuesday.  Our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue.  Spokesmen for McConnell and Cruz declined to comment. A spokesman for Lee said he wants Republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a 2015 Obamacare repeal bill that Obama vetoed.  Since Obamacare became law in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. They have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans' healthcare. President Donald Trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office, but Republicans, who control the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, have struggled to coalesce around a single plan. Under Senate rules, their bill must replicate the $133 billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the U.S. House of Representatives last month. That bill would end Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid in 2020, slash its federal funding by more than $800 billion over 10 years and eliminate most of the law's taxes. Moderate Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid, including Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada, have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven-year period, from 2020 to 2027, to give state governors more time to cut program costs. That timeframe also prevents senators, who serve six-year terms, from having to run for re-election when Medicaid cuts have been implemented, two former Republican Senate aides said.  Some of Obamacare's taxes could also be repealed later when Congress tackles new legislation overhauling the U.S. tax code, two current Senate aides said.   There's no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in Obamacare right now,  Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said last week. Under a process called reconciliation, the bill needs at least 50 votes to pass, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote if needed. In an interview with Reuters last month, McConnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an Obamacare repeal.  Think of me with a Rubik's cube, sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to 50,  McConnell said.

The profit warning knocked as much as a quarter off the value of the upholstered furniture retailer's shares. As sofas are seen as a discretionary  big ticket  item the profit alert adds to evidence that Britons are beginning to react to an increasingly tight squeeze on their spending power. They have been hurt by a rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since last year's vote to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wages growth. British retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, official data showed on Thursday, while data earlier this week showed British workers' earnings after inflation shrinking at the fastest pace since 2014. DFS said its trading environment had weakened more than it had anticipated in the last three months, with significant declines in customer store visits leading to a  material reduction  in orders.  We believe these demand effects are market-wide, in line with industry indicators, and are linked to customer uncertainty regarding the general election and the uncertain macroeconomic environment,  it said. Last week's election left Britain without a majority government and facing prolonged political uncertainty. The descent into political crisis just days before Brexit talks begin has sapped confidence among business leaders and infuriated bosses who were already grappling with the fallout from the vote to leave the EU. DFS said it now expected to make core earnings of 82 million-87 million pounds ($106 million-$111 million) for its year to end-July. Analysts were previously forecasting 96.1 million pounds, according to Reuters data, up from the 94.2 million pounds made in 2015-16. DFS said it has maintained its investment in the business and was confident of outperforming the market over the longer term.  We believe our expectations for the next financial year (2017-18) are realistic based on consumer confidence remaining broadly in line with current levels, given its consequent impact on upholstery demand,  it said. However, analysts at Jefferies, who cut their recommendation to  hold  from  buy , said that by next year Britain's Brexit negotiations with the EU could be weighing even more on consumer sentiment. At 1017 GMT shares in DFS were down 53 pence at 199 pence, valuing the business at 421 million pounds. Prior to the update the shares had risen 15 percent in 2017.

A still image taken from a video posted to a social media website shows militants inside a building in Marawi City, Philippines.    Social Media Website via Reuters TVMarawi is about 100 km (60 miles) south of Cagayan de Oro, but it was not clear whether Mohammad was coming from the embattled city. Most of the seven Maute brothers, including Omarkhayam and Abdullah, are believed to be in Marawi. Their parents were taken into custody last week in separate cities.  Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay, spokesman for the military's Eastern Mindanao Command, said Mohammad Noaim Maute was a suspected bomb-maker for the group.  He said Maute was holding a fake student card of the Mindanao State University, based in Marawi, when stopped at the checkpoint. He was not armed. Police said Maute, an Arabic-language teacher, readily admitted his identity when questioned.

Burundi, a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, has failed to reply to their letters to the foreign minister and they therefore have no access to the central African country where abuses are  rarely prosecuted , they said. Burundi's U.N. ambassador Rénovat Tabu said the allegations were  partial and tendentious  and that investigators were ignoring the government's efforts to restore peace and security.  Burundi was plunged into chaos in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he planned to run for a third term, which the opposition said was unconstitutional and violated the peace deal that ended its civil war in 2005. Nkurunziza was re-elected, but some of his opponents took up arms against him. More than 700 people have been killed since then, while an estimated 400,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, the state-run National Commission for Human Rights says. The U.N. commission of inquiry, set up by the Council last September, has collected 470 testimonies on violations committed since 2015 that reflect  deep and widespread fear  among exiles, its chairman Fatsah Ouguergouz said.  We were struck by the particularly cruel and brutal nature of the violations described to us,  he told the Geneva forum.  Several victims, usually young members of opposition parties ... or people accused of supporting or belonging to armed groups or having firearms, described to us the systematic torture and particularly cruel and inhuman treatment by members of the National Intelligence Service and the police, sometimes assisted by Imbonerakure,  he said, referring to the government-allied youth militia. Burundians had testified  alleging the use, during torture sessions, of clubs, rifle butts, bayonets, iron bars, metal chains and electric cables with the result that some victims' bones were broken and other victims lost consciousness; long needles stuck into victims' bodies or unidentified products injected into them; nails ripped out with pliers; burns; and many abuses inflicted on male detainees' genital organs.  Abuses have been committed  in a more clandestine but equally brutal manner  since late 2016, Ouguergouz said. Following disappearances, bodies are found in rivers,  the victims have their arms tied behind their backs and sometimes their bodies are weighed down with stones to make them sink . John Fisher of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said that Burundi  stands in contempt  of the Council.  The national justice system is heavily influenced by the ruling party and has been unable to deliver credible justice for these crimes,  he told the forum.   This impunity sends a clear message to the Imbonerakure. They know they can kill, rape and intimidate citizens and get away with it.

Social norms of what a woman's role should be, as well as practical obstacles such as a lack of childcare and transport to get to work are holding women back, the International Labor Organization (ILO) said. Nearly half of the world's working age women have a job or are looking for one, compared to 76 percent of men, a gap that has hardly narrowed in the past decade and is not expected to change between now and 2021, the U.N. agency said in an annual report on women's employment trends late on Wednesday.  Women have trouble accessing the labor market in the first instance but when they do enter it they have more difficulty in finding a job,  Steven Tobin, a lead author of the report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  When they do find a job they are concentrated in certain occupations and don't have the same opportunities for quality employment as men,  he added. The Middle East, North Africa and South Asia had the lowest rates of women in paid work and they were mostly confined to jobs in education, social work and agriculture, the report said. Worldwide, 70 percent of women and 66 percent of men would prefer that women work at paid jobs, the ILO said in March. [here The report also said reducing gender inequality in the labor market could create jobs for an additional 189 million people globally, and boost the world's economy by nearly six trillion dollars by 2025.  Some of the obstacles women are facing are viewed as a cost, but helping women into the labor market can bring significant revenue,  Tobin said.  It's an investment rather than a cost,  he added. The gender wage gap globally was estimated at 23 percent, meaning on average women earn 77 percent of what men earn, according to ILO data.

We are pleased that the issue regarding the governance of SUP ... is now before CAS,  International Surfing Association (ISA) president Fernando Aguerre said in a statement on Thursday. He said CAS had agreed to mediate new discussions over the governance at the request of both federations.  As a committed member of the Olympic Family, we believe CAS is the appropriate forum to have this case heard fairly.  The ISA has been organizing competitions for years in SUP, a sport where athletes stand on a board and move forward using a long paddle. But the International Canoe Federation (ICF), which has also had SUP events on its competition calendar for years, says the use of the paddle automatically makes it part of its organization. Surfing is one of five new sports to be included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The ISA had unsuccessfully tried to include SUP in those Games as a surfing discipline.

After the fundraising, Careem, an Uber rival operating in 12 mainly Middle East countries, wants to move into new markets in North Africa, such as Tunisia and Algeria, while strengthening its position in Kuwait and Turkey, CEO Mudassir Sheikha told Reuters by telephone.  That continues to be a focus, getting into more cities, more markets.  The latest fundraising, announced on Thursday, increases investment in the company to $500 million from $350 million last December when it was valued at $1 billion. Participants also included venture capital firm DCM Ventures and hedge fund Coatue Management. Sheikha said Careem could speed up existing plans to expand its number of registered drivers to one million next year from 250,000 today after the latest funding round.  We just need to bring a lot more scale and get a lot more people on platform; both the customer and the captains side,  he said. The company has around 10 million registered users growing at a rate of 20 percent a month, according to Sheikha. Kingdom Holding, owned by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, spent $62 million acquiring 7.11 percent stake in Careem which was partly purchased from emerging markets-focused private equity firm Abraaj Group. Kingdom Holding, which is also an investor in Uber's U.S. rival Lyft, will receive a seat on Careem's board. Sheikha said there had been no material impact on Careem's operations in Qatar which earlier this month had diplomatic, economic and transport ties cut off by four Arab countries. He also said the firm had  no plans  to enter Iran, one of the region's largest economies, whilst an initial public offering would eventually happen, it is not an immediate focus. Careem has previously said it is targeting profitability in the second half of 2018.

The much-heralded boxing match pitting Mayweather, a 49-0 machine and one of the greatest boxers of all time, against McGregor, the UFC's first simultaneous two-weight world champion, was finally officially announced on Wednesday. Bookmakers immediately installed Mayweather as the hot favorite for the 12-round, super-welterweight bout. But Lobov says the 28-year-old McGregor is ready to write combat sports history by pulling off a shock win.   Just look at all the stats - Floyd hasn't faced anyone significant for a few years now,  Lobov told Reuters in an exclusive telephone interview.    When he fought Manny Pacquaio it was five years after Manny's prime, he was on the way out basically. Conor is bigger, stronger, younger, and has a longer reach.  Lobov said that McGregor's broader fighting skill set would give him a big advantage over the 42-year-old Mayweather, who is renowned as a brilliant defensive boxer.   If you look at Mayweather's fights he often likes to get into the clinch, but what is a boxer in a clinch against a wrestler, an MMA fighter? Boxers are absolute novices in the clinch,  Lobov said.  Get a boxer and get him wrestling for a minute or two - the arms get so heavy, filled with blood, they can't even hold them up any more, they can't box.   Known as  The Russian Hammer , the 30-year-old Lobov has trained and sparred with McGregor ever since the Dubliner started to ascend the mixed martial arts ladder.  Famed for his granite chin and ability to keep coming forward, he has sparred countless rounds with the brash McGregor, who went on to become UFC champion at both featherweight and lightweight and is as well known for his trash talk as for his fighting skills.   He has incredible power, a power that nobody else has. I've never seen anyone hit that hard,  Lobov said.  You won't see many other training partners around - only a Russian Irishman can take those bombs. That's why I'm there, from the start until the end.  McGregor's stamina has previously been questioned, but a five-round war of attrition last August in a welterweight rematch against Nate Diaz - the only UFC fighter to defeat him - showed that he can go the distance.   There's a reason why MMA is only three five-minute rounds, or five fives when it's a title fight,  Lobov explained.   MMA is so much more demanding on the body - the wrestling, the changing levels, all that takes a lot out of you. Boxing is a breeze for us after MMA.   Lobov says he understands why Mayweather, who held world championships in multiple weight classes before retiring in September 2015, wants to take on what could be a risky fight.   You have to give Floyd respect - he loves to compete, he sees this young lion coming up, everyone is talking about Conor and saying he's potentially a man that could beat Floyd, also wants to prove the world wrong.   That is what makes this fight so interesting - Floyd is undefeated, Conor is young, he's the best MMA fighter ever. That's what makes it a great fight.  Having witnessed McGregor's power first hand, Lobov is in no doubt that Mayweather's proud undefeated record is about to come to an abrupt end at the MGM Garden on Aug. 26.   When Conor connects, people fall and they don't wake up. That's why I believe Conor will stop him within six rounds.

Bank Indonesia (BI) kept the 7-day reverse repurchase rate at 4.75 percent, as expected by all 18 analysts in a Reuters poll. The decision came shortly after the Fed raised United States interest rates for the second time in three months, and said it would begin cutting its bond holdings this year. In the past, Fed tightening moves have sometimes triggered outflows from emerging markets such as Indonesia. On Thursday, the rupiah barely moved and the Indonesian stock market edged down slightly. Indonesia took the Fed rate hike  in its stride , Capital Economics said. BI has said it is now in a better position to weather any external shocks. At the end of May, foreign exchange reserves were at a record high of $125 billion. On Thursday, BI still listed changes in Fed policy as among the biggest global risks it is monitoring, along with the aftermath of the United Kingdom elections and developments with oil prices. Dody Budi Waluyo, executive director of economic and monetary policy, said BI's policy stance remains neutral.  We won't change our interest rate stance as long as there's no sign that... inflation expectations are pointing to pressures to core inflation,  he said. Stable Currency The rupiah has been stable in recent weeks. Annual core inflation eased in May, although the headline reading was at a 14-year high of 4.33 percent. In the Reuters poll this week, some analysts said BI will hold the key rate throughout 2017, while others expect a hike by year-end. The World Bank earlier on Thursday said that by keeping its benchmark unchanged,  overall monetary conditions have temporarily become even more accommodative relative to second half of 2016 as the real interest has inched down due to moderately higher inflation.  Last year, BI trimmed its benchmark six times by a total of 150 basis points to try to boost lending and economic growth. It has also relaxed some lending rules to encourage banks to expand loans. Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 5 percent in 2016, the first increase in six years, despite a soft rate in the fourth quarter. In the first three months of this year, annual growth picked up only a touch, to 5.01 percent, but the government has been increasingly optimistic, with the finance minister forecasting 5.3 percent this year. BI's outlook for growth this year remained the midpoint of its 5.0-5.4 percent range, the central bank said. Its 2018 projection is 5.1-5.5 percent.

Arrium's committee of creditors decided on the Korean group over Great Britain's Liberty House, the industrials and commodities group that has been snapping up troubled steel plants around the world, according to the administrator, KordaMentha. Arrium collapsed in April 2016 with A$2.8 billion ($2.13 billion) in debt after creditors rejected a $927 million bailout proposal by private equity group GSO Capital Partners that would have paid no more than 55 cents on the dollar on their claims. KordaMetha has been overseeing the sales process on behalf of Arrium's lenders. The auction was run by Morgan Stanley. KordaMentha and Morgan Stanley would now work with the consortium to finalise the sale contract as soon as possible, KordaMentha partner Mark Mentha said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The creditors' committee includes Australian lenders Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac and ANZ Bank, which are owed a combined A$1 billion. A source familiar with the sales process said Newlake will use the Finex steelmaking technology under license from South Korean steelmaker POSCO to revamp the Arrium's main Wyhalla steelworks, which are 76 years old and located in South Australia state. That decision played a key role in the selection process, said the source. The Finex steelmaking technology helps cut costs and emissions. Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of Liberty House, which operates together with energy and commodities business SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, said:  The GFG Alliance will continue to seek out opportunities in Australia that generate sustained value creation and employment.  Newlake and JB's bid proposes spending more than A$1 billion on the Whyalla upgrade and on Arrium's mini-mills, steel distribution and iron ore mining divisions. They also plan to build a gas-fired power station to feed the steelworks, which would help combat South Australia's energy shortage. The South Australian state government has pledged A$50 million ($37.95 million) to the new owner of Whyalla to help upgrade the steelworks. The steelworks is the main employer in the town of Whyalla and the political fallout from cutbacks or shutdowns at the plant would be severe. The final sale is subject to approval by the committee of creditors and the Foreign Investment Review Board.

Abe has repeatedly denied abusing his authority to benefit his friend and his grip on power is not in danger. But the affair has chipped away at Abe's support, according to opinion polls, and it looks unlikely to fade away.  I am taking this result seriously,  Education Minister Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference, referring to the unearthing of the documents during a second investigation, after an initial one found nothing. The Asahi newspaper reported last month that it had obtained documents showing that the Cabinet Office had told the education ministry that Abe wanted a new veterinary school run by a friend to be approved.  The report led to opposition questions about the process by which the government decided to allow a veterinary department to be set up in a state special economic zone, since the government has not approved such departments in decades because of concern about a glut of veterinarians.  Opposition politicians and the media have identified Abe's friend as Kotaro Kake, the director of the Kake Educational Institution, which wants to open the veterinary department. An official at the institution declined to make immediate comment on Thursday, and Kake was not available for comment. The Kake Educational Institution issued a statement last month saying it was following the procedure necessary to set up a veterinary department and it abided by the law. Abe told parliament that being a friend of the school operator did not mean he had helped the institution get permission to open a new school.  The affair is Japan's second political controversy linked to a school in recent months. In the other case, an educational group with ties to Abe's wife got what critics said was a favorable land deal to build a school. Abe's wife, Akie, and Abe denied any wrongdoing in connection with that case. A voter survey by public broadcaster NHK showed on Monday that 48 percent of those polled said they supported the Abe government, down three percentage points from a month ago, while the disapproval rating for the government rose six percentage points to 36 percent.

The move by Hong Kong's de facto central bank followed the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, signaling confidence in a growing U.S. economy and a strengthening job market. However, HSBC  and Standard Chartered later said they would leave the city's best lending rate unchanged. HKMA chief executive Norman Chan warned residents to tread cautiously in the property market, where prices have scaled record highs, as mortgage repayments were likely to increase.  This time round, we may see a downward property cycle coinciding with an upward cycle of mortgage interest rate. We would like to remind everybody that they should remain vigilant and manage the risk prudently,  Chan said.  We expect that when the Hong Kong interest rate is tightening and rising, banks will gradually revise up their mortgage rates.  Hong Kong tracks U.S. rate moves as its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Last month, Hong Kong imposed tougher curbs on bank lending to developers, warning of a need to review credit risks posed by property companies in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets. Chan also said if the interest rate differential widened further, there would be more arbitrage activities involving fund flows from the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar, which would spur capital outflows. The Hong Kong dollar had weakened to 7.8009 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision, the second time it broke through the 7.8 level since February 2016, on concern over capital outflow on a widening interest spread. The Hong Kong dollar was at 7.8002 on Thursday afternoon. The monetary authority sets its base rate through a formula that is 50 basis points above the prevailing Fed funds target or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs (Hong Kong Inter-bank Offered Rate). Hong Kong stocks fell 1.2 percent on Thursday with the property sub-index sliding 1.2 percent to its lowest close in two weeks. Shares of New World Development slid 2.3 percent and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.7 percent.

The price range was set at $33.25-$35.30 per global depositary share in London, corresponding to a price of $66.50-$70.60 per ordinary share in Moscow, Polyus said in a statement. The latter will be paid in roubles. The company said the price range would result in a market capitalisation of between $8.5 billion and $9 billion on a pre-money, fully diluted basis, including treasury shares. Final pricing of the offer is expected on June 30. Analysts said the price range looked attractive even though the timing of the offer, which is likely to test appetite for Russian assets and is the first major offering on the Moscow market in 2017, comes as Russian shares are hit by concerns about new U.S. sanctions and weaker oil prices.  It is not the best moment for the placement, of course. It could significantly complicate the placement,  said Kirill Chuyko at BCS Investment Bank. Moscow's rouble-traded MICEX index hit its lowest level since March 2016 on Thursday after the U.S. Senate voted for new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Shares in Polyus, which is listed on the Moscow Exchange with a free float of 6.76 percent, were down 2 percent at 4,367 roubles ($75.9). However, Polyus is a pure producer of gold, considered a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty, and its production costs are relatively low. Prices for the precious metal are near a three-weak low this week but up 10 percent this year. Polyus delisted from the London Stock Exchange in late 2015 after Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis began to bite for Russian companies. It returns to London buoyed by a recent $887 million deal to sell a 10 percent stake to a Chinese consortium led by Fosun International. The Chinese deal had valued Polyus at $70.6 per share, which is equal to the upper end of the price range for its share offer.  Polyus looks attractive in this price range, the upper end of which coincides with the price of the previously announced deal with Fosun,  Vadim Kotikov, analyst at Uralsib, said. Polyus plans to raise $400 million from the sale of new shares and plans to use the proceeds to repay some of its debt and finance projects. Further proceeds from the sale of existing shares will go to its controlling shareholder, the family of Russian tycoon Suleiman Kerimov. $1 = 57.5273 roubles Reporting by Polina Devitt and Diana Asonova; Editing by Katya Golubkova and Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-polyus-spo-idUSL8N1JC112"},

The mid-point of the price range for DP Eurasia, which is Domino's fifth largest master franchise, amounts to an expected offer size of 203 million pounds and an expected free float of more than 65 percent, including the exercise of the over-allotment option. DP Eurasia, which was acquired in 2010 by local private equity firm Turkven and Aslan Saranga, who is now chief executive, currently operates 571 stores, the bulk of which are in Turkey with some in Russia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The company plans to open around 70 new stores this year - around 30 in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia and 40 in Russia - and about 70 to 90 more stores every year in the medium term. A successful listing would boost confidence in the ability of private equity firms to take advantage of Turkey's comparatively strong economic growth and young population, despite concerns over a political crackdown which has pressured the lira currency TRYTOM=D3.  DP Eurasia's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased to 75 million lira  ($21.43 million) in 2016 from 25 million lira in 2014, during a period in which the lira fell sharply against the dollar. Shares in DP Eurasia's British-based  counterpart, Domino's Pizza Group (DOM.L), trade on a 14.87 multiple of enterprise value to forecast EBITDA, according to Reuters data.

The May 22 attack at the Phramongkutklao Hospital, in central Bangkok, came on the third anniversary of the army's seizure of power, and the army initially blamed the bombing on groups opposed to military rule. Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters a male suspect was being interrogated over the attack, but gave no indication of any motive or affiliation. There was no claim of responsibility for the blast at the hospital, which is popular with soldiers and their families and retired military officers. The bombing followed a small blast that wounded two people on May 15 at the National Theater in the Thai capital, and the junta promised to increase security to reassure foreigners in one of the world's most visited tourist destinations. Thailand has been ruled by a junta since a coup in May 2014  and after the hospital attack, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha raised the possibility that violence could lead to a further delay to elections now scheduled for next year. Bombings are frequent in the country's far south, home to a long-running Muslim separatist insurgency, but attacks by the rebels have largely been confined to their southern heartland. Deputy national police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul told reporters the investigation of the Bangkok hospital bombing had made satisfactory progress, but he did not confirm the arrest.

Regulators are reviewing licencing procedures and could resume awarding licences under a new process with tougher technical requirements as early as the start of 2018, according to the people, who are founders and executives of startup electric car firms.  The government wants to give approval to only truly capable and serious players,  one of the startup founders said.  Some of the companies which have already received the licence have shown a pattern of behaviour that has raised a red flag. The main concern is their technical capability.  Two of the people said companies that had already received licences may also be subject to further review and could lose their approvals if deemed incapable of launching successful products. China's central government vigorously promotes electric vehicles to fight urban air pollution and as a means for its domestic auto industry to compete with foreign rivals with decades more experience making internal combustion engines. That has included opening the industry to newcomers in recent years, a move that has attracted billions of dollars of investment. But it also led to some companies selling cars of dubious quality to cash in on subsidies, with dozens of firms found to be cheating a green car subsidy scheme outright last year and prompting the government to raise technical standards. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has already issued more than a dozen approvals for electric vehicle projects since last year under a licencing system that is meant to enforce technical requirements. But the move to temporarily halt new licences indicates quality problems persist.  The mess in Chinese electric cars isn't a problem of giving out too many licences, the problems are with cars (made by companies) with licences,  said Li Junfeng, director of an NDRC-affiliated think tank. Some producers without licences do not have quality issues, he said, with companies such as Nio - backed by internet firm Tencent Holdings Ltd - partnering with traditional automakers to build cars rather than obtaining a licence. Li said that no decisions had been made about the licencing process but the matter is under discussion. The NDRC did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Sales of electric cars have boomed in China since 2015 due to government incentives, including billions of dollars in subsidy payouts for green cars, although they only accounted for 1.8 percent of auto sales in 2016.

Three shareholders who attended Evergrande's annual general meeting in Hong Kong said Chief Financial Officer Pan Darong told them the company plans to submit a restructuring proposal to China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) for a backdoor listing in two months. The regulator would take three or four months to review the proposal, he added. Evergrande declined to comment. The company, which has the second-largest debt pile among Chinese corporates, said last week it wants to redeem all of its perpetual debt by this month-end, ahead of plan. However, a few analysts said it was not clear how the redemption would be funded, and that additional debt to replace these bonds - classed as equity - could actually raise Evergrande's gearing. The company has raised 70 billion yuan ($10.30 billion) from strategic investors for most of its property assets, which are slated for a backdoor listing in Shenzhen, on conditions of repurchase obligation or compensation. The company is seeking a backdoor listing valued at 198 billion yuan ($29 billion) in Shenzhen, aiming to take advantage of higher valuations commanded on the mainland due to a large pool of retail investors. The plan will make it easier for heavily indebted Evergrande to raise funds.

But now, two years later, the 61-year-old is showing no sign of easing into retirement. In fact he plans to oversee an ambitious expansion plan and stay at the helm of the British oil major until at least the end of the decade, according to sources familiar with the matter. The American CEO has told his leadership team that it is in his family's tradition to not retire until 65 - which would take him to 2020 - and that he could perhaps work even longer than that, the sources said. In another signal that there is unlikely to be a change at the top anytime soon, there has been no imminent succession planning at the firm, according to the sources, one of who said succession was  not a live project . When Dudley finally decides to go, there will no shortage of candidates to take his place, however.  BP's chief financial officer, British national Brian Gilvary, 55 and the head of upstream, Irishman Bernard Looney, 46, have been cited as possible successors. There has been persistent industry speculation about when Dudley will call time on his BP career since he struck the 2015 settlement deal under which the company agreed to pay out a total of about $60 billion over the disaster that left 11 dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.  He had been made CEO in 2010 - the first American to lead BP in its 108-year-old history - to steer the company through the swathe of U.S. litigation, and the deal represented a milestone.  But rather than stepping back from the fray, he has since embarked on the biggest expansion plan in a generation for BP, even in the face of a collapse in oil prices.  'Safe Hands' The company has become the fastest-growing oil major in the world. It will launch seven oil and gas fields this year - more than any other year in its history - and will launch nine more before the end of the decade, adding 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and gas to its production. By 2020 the company, including its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, will be producing as much as 4 million bpd - the same as before the Deepwater Horizon spill and up from the 3 million bpd it was producing after offloading assets to cover the litigation costs.  We are firing on all cylinders,  Dudley told a shareholders meeting in May as he aims to catch up with production volumes of its biggest rivals Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Whether this strategy will prove effective in the long-term is by no means certain; BP's large liabilities linked to Deepwater Horizon mean it requires a significantly higher oil price - than the present price and compared with rivals - to pay for its operations and dividends. A sluggish recovery in oil prices could also lead to its already high debt rising further.  Rating agency Moody's upgraded BP's credit rating last week for the first time in 19 years while, in another sign of confidence, 97 percent of BP shareholders voted to approve Dudley's new pay package last month.  Bob hasn't done anything that we wouldn't agree with so far. When times are hard and bad, I would want someone who is pretty sensible and conservative,  said Rohan Murphy from Allianz, which holds BP shares.  Dudley is a safe pair of hands. He won't do anything too maverick,  Murphy added.  The recent rating upgrade shows the story hangs together.   Oligarch Battle The calm and softly spoken Dudley was stress-tested more than once before getting the top job. His career included three punishing years fighting a corporate war with Russian oligarchs at the firm's giant Russian venture TNK-BP that forced him to flee the country and go into hiding. He became BP chief executive when his predecessor Tony Hayward's tenure ended abruptly following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Dudley was given a task of steadying the ship as BP struggled with a firestorm from the U.S. government, victims of the spill, environmental groups and shareholders. Over the next five years, the company shed more than $55 billion worth of oil fields, refineries and infrastructure to pay for the spill clean-up. BP was abandoning low-margin projects and mature markets like Venezuela or Vietnam, often getting top dollar for its sales as oil prices hovered above $100 per barrel.     In retrospect, BP had unknowingly stolen a march on most of its rivals who had to embark on similar asset sales much later when crude prices began to collapse in 2014.     Debt Pile Just as BP was slowly emerging from the spill fallout, the collapse in oil prices drove it to its biggest loss ever in 2016. Like its peers, BP responded by slashing thousands of jobs and tightening budgets. The efforts bore fruit. In the first quarter of 2017, its profits tripled and its production rose to a five-year high thanks to higher production. Dudley's team argues that this will only improve over time as the company's strategic change of tack means it is producing more profitable oil and gas from a smaller number of fields. Another metric investors are also closely watching is BP's debt, standing at $38.6 billion, or 28 percent of its total equity including debt - the highest figure among oil majors. That ratio is set to improve as Deepwater Horizon cash payments decline over the coming years. They amounted to about $7 billion in 2016 and $4.5 billion in 2017 but will fall to $1-$2 billion from 2018. BP can currently balance its books only at $60 per barrel, compared to $50 for most of its rivals, but that figure should also fall as Deepwater Horizon payments decline.  Bob Dudley is building something that could be very interesting in the future ... he just gets on with business and that's what investors want,  said James Laing, equities fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds BP shares.  The dividend is still sustainable, debt levels are high but will come down, the cash breakeven has been lowered, the resource base is still increasing,  he added.  It doesn't feel like there is a lot of criticism to be made.  Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bp-ceo-idUSL8N1J93RL"},

Crude prices wallowed near a six-week low as doubts grew over OPEC's ability to cut oil supplies, weighing on stocks worldwide and adding to worries over the resilience of sectors most geared to economic growth. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark fell 0.7 percent to its lowest since April 24, while Euro zone stocks and blue-chips fell 0.8 percent. Basic resource stocks were the worst performing, down 1.7 percent while energy stocks fell 1 percent.  Numbers showing the supply-demand imbalance are pushing commodities to the downside,  said David Stubbs, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  OPEC has been unable to control global production, and the situation in Qatar is showing it is not very united,  he added. Large brokers have been turning away from cyclicals and into defensives lately as they see strong momentum in European data fading, removing a catalyst for the sectors most sensitive to growth. Energy stocks are the worst-performing in Europe this year, and the only sector to have fallen year-to-date. Retailers were also under significant pressure. Europe's retail index was set for its worst day in eight months and Britain's mid-caps were poised for their sharpest fall this year, as investors grew more skittish about the resilience of consumer spending in Britain, where is inflation is climbing due largely to a weak pound. Retail sales fell more sharply than expected in May, adding to multiplying signs of inflation depressing consumer spending, the engine of the UK economy.  I don't think this is a surprise to anyone in terms of the narrative about how weak and stretched the consumer is and will be for the next quarters,  said Stubbs.  If retail sales are weak then the pie is contracting and someone is going to get hammered. Those that are unable to deal with that are going to see a much weaker bottom line,  he added. DFS Furniture plummeted 21 percent on Britain's small-cap index after a profit warning which it blamed on a dip in demand, with significant declines in store footfall. In Europe, H&M; shares fell 2.7 percent after May sales missed forecasts, adding to a string of softer figures from the Swedish fashion retailer, which blamed tough trading conditions. The retail data added to investor focus on the Bank of England which was expected to keep rates on hold later, after the Swiss National Bank kept ultra-loose monetary policy in place. Petrofac shares were a rare bright spot on falling markets, rising to the top of the European index after a Jefferies upgrade to buy. Telecoms firm Proximus fell 3.3 percent after suffering a cut to 'sell' from Citi. Meanwhile stocks in Athens were down 0.6 percent ahead of a Eurogroup meeting which could yield a short-term debt agreement.

Judge Aydin Sedaf Akay has been held in Turkey since September, one of tens of thousands of Turkish officials arrested in a crackdown on people and organizations after a foiled coup in which hundreds died. The U.N. court said in a statement that Turkey's actions constituted a  further breach of Judge Akay’s protected status , as U.N. judges have diplomatic immunity under international law.  Akay is a judge at the MICT, the Hague court set up to handle final appeals and other remaining cases from the Yugoslav and Rwanda war crimes tribunals, which are being wound down. At the time of his arrest, Akay was part of a panel assembled to determine if new evidence showed Rwandan Augustin Ngirabatware had been wrongfully convicted of genocide and jailed for 35 years. That proceeding has been delayed by Akay's absence.   According to a statement by the MICT, Akay was convicted on Tuesday on a single charge of membership in  FETO  - which Turkey says is a terrorist organization that supports U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen whom Ankara accuses of backing the coup. MICT President Theodor Meron said that Akay's arrest,  detention, and legal proceedings against him are inconsistent with the assertion of his diplomatic immunity by the United Nations, as well as the binding judicial order (to release him that the MICT) ... issued in January 2017.

The share prices of lithium producers are volatile because of uncertainty surrounding supply, demand and pricing as analysts disagree over the potential size of the market for electric vehicles, many of which use lithium batteries. Neometals stands out from the crowd, Reed said, because it uses a combination of chemicals to accelerate the process of creating lithium, cutting costs. He predicted the U.S. market, with its large contingent of institutional investors, would value his firm's technical expertise.  Mining is well understood in Australia. Our plan to process our mineral concentrates into lithium battery materials and development of new processing technologies is not,  Reed told Reuters. He said Neometals was eyeing a listing under the Nasdaq International Designation - an upgrade of its over-the-counter offering - within the next two years. Most operators in the lithium triangle of high-altitude lakes and salt flats that straddles Chile, Argentina and Bolivia rely on salt pools. These take many months to produce lithium, although some operators say that once the process has begun, its duration becomes irrelevant because it creates a steady stream of lithium production. Rechargeable batteries containing lithium are used in mobile phones and electric cars, whose sales are forecast to rise fourfold from 2015 levels to 2.5 percent of the global car market by 2020, Wood Mackenzie consultant James Whiteside said. Consulting group CRU expects lithium demand to grow by around 20,000 tonnes per year over the next few years, from just over 200,000 tonnes in 2016. Many companies have been seeking to get into lithium, although not all projects are delivering. Lithium bulls say it would take only a slightly bigger takeup in electric vehicles than many predict to result in a shortfall. Lithium-based equities rallied over the previous two years, but have fallen this year because of a combination of profit-taking and fears of a supply bubble. Neometals shares are down nearly 20 percent since the start of the year, in line with the wider trend. Apart from a lithium and a titanium mine, Neometals has two processing plants and recycles batteries to recover cobalt in Canada.

In an email to employees on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said it wanted to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the organization, which would in turn lead to substantial cost savings this year. Marcus Schenck and Garth Ritchie, named this year to lead the reorganized corporate and investment bank, outlined in the email how they would split their duties. Germany's largest lender has been trying to regain its footing after a series of scandals, lawsuits and bets that went wrong pushed it to the brink of collapse last year. The memo said Schenck would concentrate on clients, overseeing corporate finance, global capital markets, and the bank's institutional client group. Ritchie will focus on products and processes, supervising equities, fixed income and currencies, global transaction banking, electronic trading, listed derivatives and clearing, research and the division's technology and operations. The new global capital markets division announced in the memo will be jointly headed by Alexander von zur Muehlen in Frankfurt and Mark Fedorcik in New York.  Schenck and Ritchie said the changes would take effect on July 1, when Schenck moves to the corporate and investment bank full time after serving as Deutsche's chief financial officer. Bloomberg News first reported the details of the memo. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank said it would combine its divisions for markets, corporate finance and global transaction banking into a single corporate and investment bank (CIB) as part of a broader restructuring of Germany's biggest lender. In the memo, Schenck and Ritchie said the executive committee of the corporate and investment bank (CIB) had asked a special team  to reduce bureaucracy and complexity, which will achieve substantial cost savings in 2017.   Their success will directly affect CIB's 2017 profitability and compensation program,  the email said.  We ask you to support them as they implement changes.  Deutsche Bank transformed itself into a major player on Wall Street over the past two decades, but bets that backfired and a series of scandals resulted in a litigation bill of 15 billion euros ($16.8 billion) since 2009. While rivals spent the years since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers cleaning up and finding new business models, Deutsche Bank did not restructure as quickly as others and was hit by a series of lawsuits over its conduct. The bank has settled its most painful litigation cases, including the alleged manipulation of interest rates and sham equities trading in Russia, which surfaced as late as 2015. At the end of last year it finally settled with the U.S. Department of Justice for misselling toxic mortgages, agreeing to pay $7.2 billion.

We are slowly dying from hunger, boiling mouldy wheat as  soup  to  break the fast at sunset, the 47 year-old father of three said by phone from the district besieged by Iraqi forces, asking to withhold his name fearing the militants' retribution. The only wish he makes in his prayers is for his family to survive the final days of the self-proclaimed caliphate declared three years ago by IS's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from a nearby mosque. The eight-month old U.S.-backed campaign to capture Mosul, IS's de-facto capital in Iraq, reached its deadliest phase just as the holy Muslim month started at the end of May, when militants became squeezed in and around the densely populated Old City. Up to 200,000 people are trapped behind their lines, half of them children, according to the United Nations.  Hundreds have been killed while trying to escape to government-held lines, caught in the cross-fire or gunned down by Islamic State snipers. The militants want civilians to remain  in areas under their control to use them as human shields.   Many bodies of the dead remain in the street near the frontlines. Four of them are relatives of Khalil, a former civil servant who quit his job after IS took over Mosul.  Daesh warned us not to bury them to make them an example for others who try to flee,  he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Those who decide not to run the risk of fleeing are living in fear of getting killed or wounded in their homes, with little food and water and limited access to healthcare.    Displaced Iraqi family from Mosul bake bread for their Iftar, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at a refugee camp al-Khazir in the outskirts of Erbil, Iraq June 10, 2017. Picture taken June 10, 2017.Erik De Castro Seeing my kids hungry is real torture,  said Salam, who closed his home appliances shop shortly after the start of the offensive as sales came to a complete stop. I wish the security forces would eliminate all Daesh fighters in a flash; I want my family to have normal life again.  Where food can be found, the price has risen more than 20-fold. A kilo of rice is selling for more than $40. A kilo of flour or lentils is $20 or more. The sellers are mainly households who stockpiled enough food and medicine to dare sell some, but only to trusted neighbors or relatives, or in return for items they need. If militants find food they take it. Slideshow (3 Images)Residents fill water from a few wells dug in the soil. The wait is long and dangerous as shelling is frequent.      “The well-water has a bitter taste and we can smell sewage sometimes, but we have to drink to stay alive,” said Umm Saad, a widow and mother of four, complaining that the militants are often seen with bottled water and canned food. “We have been under compulsory fasting even before the start of Ramadan,  she said.  No real food to eat, just hardened old bread and mouldy grains.    About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war city's population, have already fled, seeking refuge either with friends and relatives or in camps. But in areas still held by the militants escape has become harder than ever.  Fleeing is like committing suicide,  said Khalil, the ex-civil servant, who lives near the medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque, the offensive's symbolic focus, where Baghdadi proclaimed himself caliph. IS's black flag has been flying over its landmark leaning minaret since June 2014, when the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants, giving them their biggest prize, a city at least four times bigger than any other they came to control in both Iraq and neighboring Syria.

In global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and guidance for more to come helped the dollar rebound following a drop prompted by an unexpected slowing of U.S. inflation and retail sales in May.     Dollar buying often weakens currencies in emerging markets, including the European Union's eastern members.      This is the classical correlation now... but it is not a big weakening (in Central European exchange rates),  one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.     The zloty and the Czech crown are still near multi-year highs and the forint near the 8-month highs that they reached in recent weeks, supported by robust growth and stability in the region's main economies.     On Thursday the forint and the zloty,  weakened by 0.3 percent against the euro by 0847 GMT, with the Polish currency retreating behind the 4.2 line. Polish domestic markets are closed due to a national holiday.     The region's main stock indices eased by 0.4-0.5 percent, tracking Western European peers as the U.S. data triggered some concerns over global economic growth.     Long-term Hungarian government bond yields were lower by a few basis points from Wednesday's fixing, with 10-year paper trading at around 2.92 percent.      The 10-year U.S. yield is also near (7-month) lows, despite the hawkish Fed... and while they stay low, our yields will be kept down too,  said Gergely Urmossy, analyst of Erste in Budapest.          The crown and the leu shed 0.1 percent against the euro.     The crown, trading at 26.18, is still near its strongest levels since 2013, buoyed by a robust economy and expectations for central bank rate hikes later this year or next.     Investors in the Czech Republic usually shrug off domestic political news, like Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka's announcement on Wednesday that he would step down as the leader of his Social Democrat party.     Romania's ruling Social Democrats, meanwhile, withdrew their support from their own government late on Wednesday, leading to political turmoil.     President Klaus Iohannis urged the ruling party to resolve the crisis with a no-confidence vote in parliament if Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu is unwilling to resign.     The leu's reaction was muted, declining just 0.2 percent to 4.589, though this represented a new four-year low for a currency that was underperforming the region even before the latest political turmoil.     The currency has been under pressure over concerns that the leftist government's wage hikes and tax cuts could boost the budget deficit and stoke inflation by next year.

AdSmart enables Sky to provide different ads for different households watching the same programme, allowing advertisers to  target viewers according to factors such as age, lifestyle and location using Sky's customer data. TV broadcasters are fighting to preserve their share of the ad market as companies spend more on social networks such as Facebook and online platforms including Google's YouTube.

Struggling retailers, weak commodities stocks and ex-dividends also sent the blue chip FTSE 100 index to its lowest level in one month, down 0.7 percent at 7,423.52 points by 0917 GMT, while the mid caps fell 1.4 percent.  If one of the indices is going to find things tougher, it's likely to be the (FTSE) 250 than the 100,  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said. The session was proving especially tricky for British retailers after furniture seller DFS plummeted more than 22 percent following a profit warning, blaming a weaker trading environment. Its shares were set for their worst day since listing. Shares in mid cap peer Howden Joinery also nursed a 5.5 percent loss, while smaller firm ScS tumbled 9 percent. The FTSE 350 general retailers index dropped 2.5 percent.  DFS believes that (like-for-like) sales could recover, however, we take a more cautious view given rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty,  analysts at Jefferies said in a note, downgrading DFS to  hold . A sharp fall in retail sales in May showed that British retailers are facing a tough time as a jump in inflation and low wage growth puts pressure on consumers, with a hung parliament following the UK general election also adding to political uncertainty. Weakness in retail was also evidenced in the U.S. in the previous session, when figures showed that U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May. The latest macroeconomic data also put the spotlight on a Bank of England interest rate decision later in the day. Aside from falls in Persimmon and other stocks trading ex-dividend, clothes retailer Next saw its shares drop 4.7 percent after Credit Suisse cut its rating to  underperform , pointing to weak pricing across Europe for the wider sector.  With earnings, margins and cash conversion continuing to fall we regard Next as a value trap,  Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. Falls in mining firms also weighed, with Anglo American , BHP Billiton and Glencore all weaker as the price of copper fell, set back by strength in the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Likewise oil & gas stocks BP and Royal Dutch Shell retreated as the price of oil hit a six-week low.

In an email to employees on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said it wanted to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the organization, which would in turn lead to substantial cost savings this year. Marcus Schenck and Garth Ritchie, named this year to lead the reorganized corporate and investment bank, outlined in the email how they would split their duties. Germany's largest lender has been trying to regain its footing after a series of scandals, lawsuits and bets that went wrong pushed it to the brink of collapse last year. The memo said Schenck would concentrate on clients, overseeing corporate finance, global capital markets, and the bank's institutional client group. Ritchie will focus on products and processes, supervising equities, fixed income and currencies, global transaction banking, electronic trading, listed derivatives and clearing, research and the division's technology and operations. The new global capital markets division announced in the memo will be jointly headed by Alexander von zur Muehlen in Frankfurt and Mark Fedorcik in New York.  Schenck and Ritchie said the changes would take effect on July 1, when Schenck moves to the corporate and investment bank full time after serving as Deutsche's chief financial officer. Bloomberg News first reported the details of the memo. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank said it would combine its divisions for markets, corporate finance and global transaction banking into a single corporate and investment bank (CIB) as part of a broader restructuring of Germany's biggest lender. In the memo, Schenck and Ritchie said the executive committee of the corporate and investment bank (CIB) had asked a special team  to reduce bureaucracy and complexity, which will achieve substantial cost savings in 2017.   Their success will directly affect CIB's 2017 profitability and compensation program,  the email said.  We ask you to support them as they implement changes.  Deutsche Bank transformed itself into a major player on Wall Street over the past two decades, but bets that backfired and a series of scandals resulted in a litigation bill of 15 billion euros ($16.8 billion) since 2009. While rivals spent the years since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers cleaning up and finding new business models, Deutsche Bank did not restructure as quickly as others and was hit by a series of lawsuits over its conduct. The bank has settled its most painful litigation cases, including the alleged manipulation of interest rates and sham equities trading in Russia, which surfaced as late as 2015. At the end of last year it finally settled with the U.S. Department of Justice for misselling toxic mortgages, agreeing to pay $7.2 billion.

Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies who cut ties last week, accusing it of funding terrorist groups, a charge Doha denies. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly echoed the accusations against Qatar, even as his Defense and State Departments have tried to remain neutral in the dispute among key allies. Qatar is home to the headquarters for U.S. air forces in the Middle East. On Wednesday U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed the previously-approved warplane deal with Qatari Minister of State for Defence Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah. Qatar's ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad al-Thani, posted a picture of the signing ceremony on Twitter.  This is of course proof that U.S. institutions are with us but we have never doubted that,  a Qatari official in Doha said.  Our militaries are like brothers. America's support for Qatar is deep-rooted and not easily influenced by political changes.  A Qatari defence ministry source said the deal was for 36 jets. In November, under the administration of Barack Obama, the United States approved a possible sale of up to 72 F-15QA aircraft to Qatar for $21.1 billion. Boeing, the prime contractor on the sale, declined to comment. A European diplomat in the Gulf said the timing of the deal appeared coincidental.  Presumably the U.S. could have delayed the deal if they'd wanted to, although I don't think there's a great connect between sales and foreign policy.  Qatar is an important base for the U.S. military carrying out operations against Islamic State militants and other groups in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and beyond. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is home to more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Qatar's state news agency said on Wednesday that two U.S. warships arrived at Hamad port in Qatar as part of a planned joint military exercise involving marine forces. The Pentagon said the jets sale will increase security cooperation between the U.S. and Qatar and help them operate together. It added Mattis and Attiyah had also discussed the current state of operations against Islamic State and the importance of de-escalating tensions in the Gulf. The fighter jet deal had been stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administration's broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf. Trump, who took office in January, has accused Qatar of being a  high-level  sponsor of terrorism, potentially hindering the State Department's efforts to help ease the worst diplomatic crisis between Gulf Arab states for years. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is expected in Kuwait on Thursday after completing a visit to Qatar, foreign ministry sources said, in his quest to help broker an end to the dispute. Kuwait has emerged as the main mediator in the crisis. Turkey has backed Qatar in the crisis and President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said on Wednesday the rift was damaging the Islamic world and Ankara would do all it could by diplomatic channels to prevent any escalation.

We are slowly dying from hunger, boiling mouldy wheat as  soup  to  break the fast at sunset, the 47 year-old father of three said by phone from the district besieged by Iraqi forces, asking to withhold his name fearing the militants' retribution. The only wish he makes in his prayers is for his family to survive the final days of the self-proclaimed caliphate declared three years ago by IS's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from a nearby mosque. The eight-month old U.S.-backed campaign to capture Mosul, IS's de-facto capital in Iraq, reached its deadliest phase just as the holy Muslim month started at the end of May, when militants became squeezed in and around the densely populated Old City. Up to 200,000 people are trapped behind their lines, half of them children, according to the United Nations.  Hundreds have been killed while trying to escape to government-held lines, caught in the cross-fire or gunned down by Islamic State snipers. The militants want civilians to remain  in areas under their control to use them as human shields.   Many bodies of the dead remain in the street near the frontlines. Four of them are relatives of Khalil, a former civil servant who quit his job after IS took over Mosul.  Daesh warned us not to bury them to make them an example for others who try to flee,  he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Those who decide not to run the risk of fleeing are living in fear of getting killed or wounded in their homes, with little food and water and limited access to healthcare.    Displaced Iraqi family from Mosul bake bread for their Iftar, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at a refugee camp al-Khazir in the outskirts of Erbil, Iraq June 10, 2017. Picture taken June 10, 2017.Erik De Castro Seeing my kids hungry is real torture,  said Salam, who closed his home appliances shop shortly after the start of the offensive as sales came to a complete stop. I wish the security forces would eliminate all Daesh fighters in a flash; I want my family to have normal life again.  Where food can be found, the price has risen more than 20-fold. A kilo of rice is selling for more than $40. A kilo of flour or lentils is $20 or more. The sellers are mainly households who stockpiled enough food and medicine to dare sell some, but only to trusted neighbors or relatives, or in return for items they need. If militants find food they take it. Slideshow (3 Images)Residents fill water from a few wells dug in the soil. The wait is long and dangerous as shelling is frequent.      “The well-water has a bitter taste and we can smell sewage sometimes, but we have to drink to stay alive,” said Umm Saad, a widow and mother of four, complaining that the militants are often seen with bottled water and canned food. “We have been under compulsory fasting even before the start of Ramadan,  she said.  No real food to eat, just hardened old bread and mouldy grains.    About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war city's population, have already fled, seeking refuge either with friends and relatives or in camps. But in areas still held by the militants escape has become harder than ever.  Fleeing is like committing suicide,  said Khalil, the ex-civil servant, who lives near the medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque, the offensive's symbolic focus, where Baghdadi proclaimed himself caliph. IS's black flag has been flying over its landmark leaning minaret since June 2014, when the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants, giving them their biggest prize, a city at least four times bigger than any other they came to control in both Iraq and neighboring Syria.

Euro zone finance ministers will meet in Luxembourg together with International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde. She suggested last week that the IMF could join the Greek bailout now, but not disburse any money until the euro zone clarifies what debt relief it can offer Greece. The IMF has so far refused to join in this bailout, Greece's third since 2010, because it believes that without relief Greece cannot get out from under its massive debt mountain. Euro zone powerhouse Germany does not want to discuss details of debt relief before German parliamentary elections in September. At the same time, its parliament insists on IMF participation if it is to agree new disbursements. Greek Economics Minister Dimitri Papadimitriou accused German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble of being  dishonest  by blocking debt relief for Greece despite his acknowledgement that Athens has implemented significant reforms. IMF participation, even without immediate disbursements, should be enough for the German parliament to back new euro zone loans to Athens, thus ensuring Greece would get enough cash in July to repay maturing debt and avoid default. Euro zone officials have said that the compromise, if agreed on Thursday, could result in Greece receiving between 7.4 and 8 billion euros ($8.3-9.0 billion) from the euro zone bailout fund ESM to cover July repayments. Differences The IMF and the euro zone have widely different forecasts for Greek growth in the decades to come and on Athens' ability to achieve high primary surpluses - the budget leftover not including debt servicing costs - to solve its financial crisis. Some euro zone scenarios show that with sufficiently high economic growth and budgetary discipline - a primary surplus above 3 percent of GDP for 20 years - Greece would not even need any debt relief. But the IMF, with much more conservative estimates and stressing previous Greek underperformance on targets, says it is unrealistic to demand high primary surpluses for so long. Pressure is also mounting at home on Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras from a public weary of austerity. Greece says it has done its part after legislating further pension cuts and tax hikes demanded by lenders to convince the IMF to participate.  Greece has fulfilled its commitments and adopted the required reforms. Now it is time for the Europeans to comply with their commitments on debt relief,  Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt. In Athens, some 1,500 pensioners gathered to protest more than a dozen rounds of pension cuts since bailout-induced austerity was enforced seven years ago.  We have been robbed blind,  said Stavros Vassiliou, 65,  I worked 41 years in construction … I was taking 2,400 euros in 2011, now I take (a pension) of 1,000. I have a mortgage and four kids to support.  Governments of some of the euro zone creditors have said the reduced pensions do not appear to be at hardship levels. Athens says it wants a debt relief agreement  that gives clarity to the markets, but of even greater importance, renewed hope to the people of Greece , a government official told Reuters before the meeting.

MSCI's emerging equity index fell 0.8 percent snapping a two-day winning streak as oil prices touched seven-month lows and a strong inventory build-up cast doubt on the strength of the global economy. These fears were underscored by weak U.S. retail and inflation data, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the second time in three months and start unwinding its bond purchases. The emerging market losses were led by Russia where stocks tumbled almost 2 percent, after U.S. lawmakers voted in favour of new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in 2016 U.S. elections and making it harder to ease existing curbs.  Russian stocks are responding to the bill passed by the U.S. Senate last night which would tighten the sanctions regime if signed into law,  William Jackson at Capital Economics said, noting also the relatively strong rouble which was weighing on exporters' shares.  Early signs are that (the bill) won't have a very big macroeconomic impact, but ... as far as there were any hopes that sanctions might be eased or lifted gradually under the Trump administration, that is not going to happen.  The rouble hovered near one-month highs while Russian sovereign dollar bond yield premiums to U.S. Treasuries were flat at two-month highs. Most other emerging assets retreated, with Hong Kong shares at a three-week low after local authorities followed the Fed in raising rates. Mainland Chinese shares also weakened . Gulf central banks also hiked rates following the Fed move, pushing down most local bourses, though sanctions-hit Qatar is yet to do so. Qatari stocks were up slightly but on track for a fifth week of losses. The Turkish lira pulled off six-month highs before a central bank meeting that should make no changes to the late liquidity lending rate used by the bank. The lira has been gaining steadily against a weak dollar, therefore  defence of the currency is no longer a driving force,  Commerzbank analysts wrote. They noted that while inflation remained close to 12 percent,  this argument is not sufficient to trigger a rate hike today . In central Europe the Romanian leu tumbled to new 4-1/2-year lows to the euro after the ruling Social Democrats withdrew support for the government led by prime minister Sorin Grindeanu.

That represented a doubling from the 2015 tally but electric cars still only accounted for 0.2 percent of the global count. [nL8N1J41SU] How many will there be in five years' time? Or in 10 years' time?  The answer to that question will determine the fortunes of multiple metals over the coming years.  Battery materials such as lithium and cobalt are already bubbling as supply chains which have historically evolved to meet niche applications adapt to the much bigger demands of the green technology revolution.  The likes of aluminum and copper can be expected to continue benefiting from greater usage across a transport sector increasingly defined by lightweighting and enhanced electrical circuitry.  Platinum and palladium, by contrast, could be losers as electrification reduces the need for catalytic converters.  But both supply and price are going to depend on what happens to demand. And that is the electric elephant in the room.  Tearing Down the Bolt Analysts at Swiss bank UBS attempted to answer the question by tearing apart piece by piece a Chevy Bolt, which must top the list of fun things to do if you're a bank researcher.  They chose the Bolt because it is the first mass-market electric vehicle with a range of over 200 miles. It also  has a price tag and range similar to the upcoming Tesla Model 3, which is Tesla's long-awaited entry into the mass market.  ( UBS Evidence Lab Electric Car Teardown - Disruption Ahead? , May 18, 2017).  Their surprise finding is that the Bolt's powertrain was $4,600 cheaper to produce than they expected  with more cost reduction potential left.  Their key takeaway is that the Bolt could reach consumer cost of ownership parity with a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle such as the Volkswagen Golf much sooner than expected, as early as next year in Europe.  That would represent a tipping point for demand and UBS has lifted its electric vehicle (EV) sales projections by around 50 percent accordingly.   We now forecast 3.1m EVs sold in 2021 (battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids) and 14.2m sold in 2025, instead of 2.5m and 9.7m previously.  Electric vehicles' share of new sales is forecast to rise from that marginal 0.2 percent last year to three percent in 2021 and 14 percent in 2025.  Double Revolution And if those numbers look a bit on the aggressive side, UBS' forecasts look decidedly pedestrian relative to those of RethinkX, a thinktank founded by Stanford University's Tony Seba.   Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030 , also released last month, generated a flurry of headlines about the imminent demise of the combustion engine.   We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history,  the report warns. One which  will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value.  Phew! RethinkX' core argument is that there is not one but two technical revolutions under way in the automotive sector.  Electrification of the global car fleet will coincide with the roll-out of autonomous vehicle technology with both trends feeding off each other.   By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call 'transport-as-a-service' . Consumer Choice or Government Mandate? It's an extreme vision but one that serves to underline the diversity of views as to what to expect over the coming decade.  In truth, there is no consensus whatsoever as to how fast electrification, or indeed automation, of the global vehicle fleet will happen.  There are simply too many moving parts to the equation, far more than the 24 the UBS team found in the Bolt's powertrain.  UBS' research aims to tackle the problem from a consumer choice model. When does the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle outweigh the advantages still enjoyed by existing internal combustion engine vehicles?  But in many parts of the world, consumer choice will be directly affected by government edict.  California led the way with its 2012 mandate that automakers selling more than 600,000 vehicles a year in the state must sell a stipulated amount of zero-emission-vehicles or risk losing the right to sell any at all.  China, which has its own problems with smog, is now picking up the compliance baton. Its proposed system, currently at the draft legislation stage, is much tougher. Nor has Beijing shown any signs of giving in to automaker pressure to push the start back from 2018. [nL3N1JA3H7] There are multiple similar national and city initiatives.  London, for example, has stipulated that all new black cabs will have to be partly electric-powered by January next year.  Electrification of the 24,000-strong taxi fleet will go hand in hand with higher charges on diesel cars entering the city later this year.  So fast are these changes happening that the city's local and transport authorities are now racing against the clock to install the charging infrastructure necessary to support an all-electric cab fleet.  It's the interaction of consumer choice and government coercion that makes projecting EV growth rates so difficult.  Volatility Ahead Metals such as cobalt and lithium find themselves on the front-line of this green transport revolution because of their core role in batteries.  Explosive price hikes last year in lithium and earlier this year in cobalt were prime examples of what happens when supply chains are too slow to react to new demand drivers.  The initial lithium price shock seems to be fading as existing producers ramp up capacity and new operators enter the marketplace.  Cobalt, as traded on the London Metal Exchange, rocketed from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to $56,250 in early April and has since also shown signs of flattening out at a current $56,500. In both cases the initial price shock has passed.  But there is the potential for more price volatility going forward because producers, traders and analysts alike are struggling to construct consensus demand models.  That's the problem with revolutions. Once they start they evolve in wholly unpredictable ways.  The great technological jump of vehicle electrification is going to lead to some equally big moves in price.  Up? Down?  Probably both.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in May shipments were set to drop from June, particularly to the United States, as the top OPEC producer aims to limit supply to help balance the market. Exports in May, when the kingdom's total production was 9.880 million bpd, averaged below 7 million bpd, three industry and shipping sources told Reuters. Early indications suggest that remains the case this month, one of the sources said.  I'm only looking at the first week of June, and on the face of it there's not much change,  said Roy Mason of Oil Movements, a UK-based firm that estimates supply by tracking tanker shipments. Indicating lower Saudi exports, he said tanker movements suggested shipments to the United States were  less than would be seasonally normal.  Lower exports could help reduce bloated inventories in the United States, the world's largest and most transparent oil market. High stockpiles have weighed on crude prices. U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia were above 1 million bpd from May-August last year, according to U.S. government data.   So far in June, Saudi exports to the United States were below 1 million bpd, according to shipping data and industry sources. Overall, Saudi exports are set to be lower than last year, when the kingdom shipped about 7.4 million bpd on average from May to August. This is partly because Saudi Arabia usually burns more crude in power stations at home in the summer months to meet extra demand for power as people rely on air conditioners to deal with temperatures that can reach 50 degrees Celsius. This year, Saudi Arabia is also leading OPEC and other producers in a pact to cut output, a deal initially due to run during the first half of 2017 and now extended until March 2018. Under the deal, the kingdom should not produce more than 10.058 million bpd until March. In the first five months of 2017, its output has been below that target. Industry sources with knowledge of Saudi crude exports data said state oil company Saudi Aramco aimed to cut its exports to the United Sates to below 1 million bpd in June and July.  Aramco has raised its official selling oil prices (OSPs) for its crude to the United States for July, a move seen as discouraging a further buildup in U.S. oil inventories.  The high-price numbers prompted U.S. refiners to lower nominations,  one industry source said.  The company has cut allocations in July to the United States by 35 percent and to Europe by 11 percent in July. Allocations to Asia were cut by some 300,000 bpd. Reuters shipping data also points to Saudi exports below 7 million bpd in the first two weeks of June, averaging 6.98 million bpd. Last year, Saudi Arabia burned 700,000 bpd of crude to generate power in the peak summer months. That figure was expected to fall by about 100,000-120,000 bpd this year, as the kingdom uses more natural gas, one industry source said. Two sources said Saudi Arabia could draw from inventories to meet local and export requirements if needed. Saudi inventories rose to 267.854 million barrels in March from 264.704 million in February, according to official data. But the kingdom would still keep crude production and supply within its OPEC target, another source said.

In its order last week in favor of a priest whose relatives cut him out of his share of ancestral property, the court in Kerala state said a priest can give up his property if he wishes to, but there can be no  automatic deprivation  because he is in a religious order and has  renounced worldly pleasures . The ruling applies to all religions in the state, and to women in a religious order as well. The high court, which overturned a lower court's ruling against the priest, placed the Indian Succession Act - which guarantees all citizens equal inheritance rights - above canon law, which requires the surrender of any inheritance to the church, said Sabu George, a lawyer for the priest. The verdict can help retired priests and nuns, as well as those who quit the clergy,  lead a decent life , said K.P. Shibu Kalamparambil, secretary of an association of Catholic priests and nuns.  Hundreds of former priests and retired priests are living in penury in India, as most families refuse to take them back when they are old and have no work,  said Kalamparambil, who quit the priesthood after 27 years. The Catholic priests' association has long demanded a state pension and compensation from the church for retired priests and those who leave the clergy. They are often forced to live on a small stipend or depend on the largesse of the parish. A spokesman for the Catholic church in the state said they were disappointed with the ruling, and may appeal.  It is unfortunate that the law of the church has not been appreciated,  said Paul Thelakkat, a senior Catholic priest.  Detachment from property and worldly life is our tradition. This has not been positively valued and upheld.  Kerala contributes more than half of India's clergy, with Catholic families long observing a tradition of pledging one son or daughter to the church. The church - like other religious institutions in India - is considered wealthy, with extensive land holdings and properties including educational institutions and hospitals, many received as gifts. The church may still force the clergy to give up their property, and the ruling also does not benefit those who have already given their properties to the church, said Reji Njallani, national president of the priests' association.  We will ask the church to return them in light of the order,  he said. Writing by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Alisa Tang.

The Moderate, Center, Liberal and Christian Democrat parties have agreed to demand the government drop plans for an airline tax, changes to tax rules for small companies and a measure to increase the number of people paying state income tax, a source with knowledge of the situation said.  The Alliance is going to say in committee that we are ready to act to prevent damaging tax hikes, for example in the form of a vote of no-confidence,  the source said. The Social Democrat-Green government, supported by the Left Party in parliament has said it plans the tax hikes to take effect in 2018. If the government does not withdraw the proposal, the Alliance - which governed as a bloc between 2006 and 2014 - would probably table a vote of no-confidence in Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson later this year.      For the strategy to succeed, the Alliance will need backing from the Sweden Democrats, support the anti-immigrant party has said it would offer. The center-left's first budget after winning the election in 2014 was voted down by the Alliance and Sweden Democrats.  But faced with political deadlock and wary of being seen as in league with the far-right Sweden Democrats, the Alliance agreed not to use the tactic again leaving it facing accusations of having abandoned its role as an opposition. With polls showing the Sweden Democrats with around 20 percent of the vote, the Alliance needs to show it is a viable opposition to the current government or risk voters dismissing it as irrelevant.

Bpifrance, the country's state investment bank, has led the effort over the past five years, acting as a catalyst for the burgeoning industry and a go-between for large cash-rich corporations and young entrepreneurs in need of funds to launch their business. It has in effect become in the country's number one venture capital fund, having injected 191 million euros in 53 startup companies last year.  This taxpayer financing is 13 percent higher than the previous year and Bpifrance is adding 400 million euros to its so-called Large Venture fund, with individual investments of 10 million euros or more, bringing the total up to 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion), chief executive officer Nicolas Dufourcq told Reuters.  The tide has been turning in our favor for about year now,  Dufourcq said in an interview ahead the opening of the French capital's second technology conference, dubbed Viva Tech, on Thursday.   It is as if the French Tech's boss had been elected as the new president,  he said, referring to an initiative to promote French technology firms that Macron ran as economy minister in the previous government. The new president, who plans a raft of other startup-boosting measures such as cuts in corporate tax and wealth tax exemptions, was due for a walkabout at the vast conference center on the edge of Paris on Thursday, followed by a speech. Since 2012, notable investments by Bpifrance in venture capital have included biopharmaceutical company DBV Technologies, online and mobile medical booking platform Doctolib, the developer of a wireless low-energy network for connected objects Sigfox, and the maker of high-tech audio devices Devialet.     Foreign investors began considering France as potentially lucrative new turf for disruptive companies about a year ago, Dufourcq and industry specialists say, even before independent centrist politician Macron made his candidacy official. Generous tax incentives for companies' research and development spending, renowned engineering and mathematical schools and private initiatives, such as the upcoming mega-campus for startups, Station F in Paris, funded by billionaire Xavier Niel, are some elements that explain the trend.    Whether it be Britain, Germany or Nordic countries, there's a clear interest for France,  said Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures, which invested in two of the most successful former startups, Europe's biggest car-sharing company Blablacar and Nasdaq-listed Criteo which provides web advertising services.  All funds are starting to have one or two French or Francophile people that spend their time reviewing the French market. And that's clearly new,  he said.   U.S. social media giant Facebook also gave a vote of confidence in the French tech scene earlier this year when it picked Paris as the location for its first-ever startups incubator. People  Won't Get Fleeced  Estimates differ between research companies, but all show that France is catching up with Germany and Britain, the two leading startup havens in Europe, in number of deals and total amounts invested.  French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to start-ups development, innovation and digital technology in Paris, France, June 15, 2017.Martin Bureau/PoolVenture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu.  It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in the venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic. This remains below Germany, with investments of 937 million. Still, over the first three months of this year, Paris saw 41 venture capital deals for a total value of 235 million euros, compared with 39 deals in Berlin totaling 210 million euros, according to PitchBook, a data provider.  The gap between the two countries highlights the relatively smaller size of investment tickets in France, underscoring the need for larger venture capital funds to help promising startups going international, Dufourcq said.  For instance, London-based Vitruvian Partners invested 58 million euros in January in French luxury resale store Vestiaire Collective to support its growth.  Slideshow (20 Images)Private-equity funds such as Partech, Isai have developed their own growth equity funds with larger investment tickets. New venture capital funds were created lately in France, such as Korelya Capital, founded by former digital economy minister Fleur Pellerin, and Daphni. [L8N1JC12Q]  Over the last few years, energy companies Total and Engie as well as insurer AXA have all created their own venture vehicles. The new French government, which polls predict will win a large majority in the final round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday, is likely to push reforms that may further support spending on startups.   Macron's manifesto included pro-business measures such as  cutting corporate tax to 25 percent from 33.3 percent, shifting the wealth tax to property only, which would exempt the ownership of company stakes, and introducing a flat 30 percent tax on capital gains, from up to 50 percent currently.     The new president also said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatizations to help fund a 10 billion euro government drive to boost industry and innovation.  People need to know that if they come to France, they can make a fortune and won't get fleeced,  Dufourcq said.  But tax reforms alone may not be enough for Paris to beat London on its turf.   We shouldn't delude ourselves, London still has a considerable advantage,  Mignot said, citing its cosmopolitan culture and tax credits for investing in startups.   But this advantage was built over 15 years. There's no reason Paris can't achieve it.

India, Iran's top oil client after China, shipped in 487,600 barrels per day (bpd) in May, about 9 percent less compared with April and nearly 40 percent less than a peak registered in October, according to ship tracking data obtained from sources and data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts. Most Western-led sanctions against Tehran's nuclear programme were lifted in January last year, and India's Iranian crude imports began climbing two months later in March. In the fiscal year to March 2018, though, India has said it plans to order about a quarter less Iranian crude due to a snub over development of Iran's Farzad B gas field.  We stood by them in difficult times. We still buy substantial amounts of oil from them, and we expect reciprocity from Iran,  Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters on Wednesday when asked if India was still hopeful of getting the development rights for the Farzad B field. Following years of seeming rapprochement over the field, Iran has likely reached an agreement on the concession with Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom, Russian and Indian media have reported. Iran last month said India had not offered an acceptable proposal on the Farzad B development. Sri Paravaikkarasu of energy consultancy FGE said India's lower Iran imports were a  reaction of Iran's decision to award the gas field to Russia and the availability of cheaper grades like those from Russia.  India was one of four countries - China, Japan and South Korea being the other three - that continued to import large amounts of Iranian oil after sanctions were toughened in 2012. Some of the drop in imports from Iran may be due to lower demand. Overall, India imported about 4.2 percent less oil in May, compared with April, due to a shutdown of the 180,000-bpd Bathinda refinery for upgrades. In the first five months of 2017, India's oil imports from Iran still jumped about 64 percent, the data showed. While Iran's oil exports to India are stalling, supplies to Europe and Turkey hit their highest level since the lifting of sanctions in 2016. Iraq continued to be India's biggest oil supplier for the second month in a row in May, followed by Saudi Arabia. Middle Eastern oil in May accounted for 65 percent of India's overall imports, compared to 71 percent a year ago, while the import share of Africa and Latin America have risen, the data showed. The shift is likely a result of an effort led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production to prop up oil prices.

The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry. Last month Modi's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather. Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks. Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry. Social Tensions Much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure. But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides. Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100. The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India's poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019. Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government's move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry's image. Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad. Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales. When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.  They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,  says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders. Muqeem's monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials. Impossible Target Like meat, India's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes. Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry. Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara did not respond to requests for comment. India is one of the world's top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo. Modi's government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion - more than double today's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push. But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales. India's environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy. But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover. Companies say the government's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.  There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,  Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.  There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.  India's commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March. About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs. Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra's leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months. The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart. Modi's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus. When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders:  Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.  In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.  Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits,  he said in Lucknow, the state capital. Wider Industry Hit In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up. Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur's Small Tanners' Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers' organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.  More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,  said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy once called  untouchables  are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them. Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month's inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff. Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem's cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather. He now earns 3,000 rupees  - or $47 - a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father's income supports three sisters and his mother.  I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,  he said.

Japan's taxi industry, faced with a labor crunch due to an aging population, has been looking at new technologies to drive growth. The sector may also have to deal with more competition in the future if the government allows ride-sharing services such as Uber to operate across the country.  Autonomous taxis and the taxi industry can grow and prosper together,  Taniguchi told reporters, after announcing ZMP's partnership with Hinomaru Kotsu.  Hinomaru said it had 607 cars and that it was one of the top ten Tokyo taxi firms by fleet size.  We have been trying to improve diversity by hiring more new graduates, women and foreigners, but this will not be enough to ease labor shortages,  Hinomaru President Kazutaka Tomita said.  We will have to compensate for the lack of supply by using autonomous driving technology.   ZMP is developing automated driving hardware and software based on laser and stereo cameras, which it hopes to sell to transportation companies and automakers.

The Tour is less complex now because of radios,  American LeMond said in an interview with broadcaster Eurosport for whom he will again be chief analyst this year.  Riders are told everything. Maybe they could have one-way radios to call in mechanical problems, or for more water, but when you basically have the team tactician in the car calling all the shots it takes away from the race.  Team orders rule these days making epic duels like that between team mates LeMond and French great Bernard Hinault on Alpe d'huez in 1986, chronicled in the book Slaying the Badger, rare. LeMond thinks that is partly down to technology.  Last year was boring because Team Sky controlled it.  Riders have become robotic. Racing is not just physical it's also tactical and psychological,  he said.  But now the team just calls up on the radio and says 'kid this is what's happening, get up there and ride. I think without that it would be less predictable. The fans would love it.  Californian LeMond's expertise has become an essential ingredient of the Tour for millions of armchair fans who will this year, for the first time, be able to watch every minute of every stage thanks to Eurosport's enhanced coverage.  Until now viewers worldwide could not watch the whole stage.  It's massive thing,  Eurosport's CEO Peter Hutton told Reuters of the upgraded rights agreement with European Broadcasting Union and Amaury Sport Organisation that will see 54 markets across Europe benefit from up to 25 hours more live Tour de France coverage in each of the next three years.  We are changing it forever. This is the start of a different era. Logistically it's a massive challenge, but will provide a service the fans want. Imagine saying to cricket fans you could only see the last day of a test match and they would think that you are mad.  Last month's Eurosport coverage of the Giro broke their own viewing records -- partly because the race was so exciting with Dutchman Tom Dumoulin sealing victory on the final stage. LeMond, who has also campaigned vigorously against doping and mechanical doping, believes Dumoulin would have a great chance of a Giro/Tour de France double if Tour organizers had included a longer time trial this year.  Unfortunately for Tom Dumoulin the time trials are not a little longer,  LeMond, who won the race in 1986, 1989 and 1990, told Eurosport.  There are not too many mountain top finishes which is good for Dumoulin but I think it still favors riders like (Chris) Froome.  LeMond believes this year's race which he says is  not so difficult on paper  will be less predictable than in recent year's when Team Sky largely controlled it, allowing Froome to win three of the last four editions.  It's going to be very interesting, it could be very close. It's not incredibly difficult,  LeMond said.  The climbing stages are very hard but I think it's not so difficult as last year when the riders were hesitant and there was a lack of action. Apart from Froome, I think it's out of Richie Porte and (Alberto) Contador.  I would like to see Dumoulin be there and you never know but he needs a longer time trial to make up time.

A court on Wednesday sentenced Enis Berberoglu, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) on charges of giving an opposition newspaper a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. Berberoglu is the first lawmaker from the secular CHP to be jailed since the government crackdown that followed last year's failed coup. More than 50,000 people have been jailed and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in the aftermath of the July 15 attempted putsch. The leader of the CHP, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has called the decision lawless and politically motivated. On Thursday, he launched a 425 kilometre (265 mile) march from Ankara to the Istanbul jail where Berberoglu is being detained. Party officials said they expect the walk could take the 68-year-old politician at least 20 days.  Erdogan is waving his fingers at everyone who is against him,  said Nuran, a retired teacher who declined to give her surname.  The arrest was made to send a message but we are not afraid. We will resist until they jail every single one of us.  She was among the crowds that packed into the central Ankara park where Kilicdaroglu started his march. Many people held banners, waved Turkish flags and wore t-shirts emblazoned with the word  Justice . Others carried posters of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the secular founder of modern Turkey, and the CHP. Police imposed tight security measures at the site of the protest on Thursday morning, setting up security barriers and sealing off nearby roads and carrying out searches with bomb disposal teams and dogs. Water cannons and armoured police vehicles waited nearby the park.  Our march will continue until there is justice in this country,  Kilicdaroglu told reporters before heading for the park. Turkey currently has 160 journalists imprisoned according to Turkish journalists union and has also jailed eleven lawmakers over terror charges. It has also shut down 130 media outlets following last July's failed coup. The government says such measures are necessary, given the vast security threats it is facing. Rights groups and some of Turkey's Western allies have voiced concern at the scope of the crackdown, decrying what they say is growing authoritarianism.

We need people doing everything they can to ensure the election comes as early as possible,  McDonnell was quoted as saying the newspaper.  The newspaper said some left-wing groups plan a mass protest on July 1 to put pressure on May.

Just think if the TUC put out that call - that we want a million on the streets of London in two weeks' time,  he was quoted as saying by the Daily Mirror.

Atkins, which agreed in April to be acquired by SNC for C$3.6 billion ($2.7 bln), said a strong performance at its North American business helped lift its underlying pretax profit by 18 percent in the year through March to 164.6 million pounds ($209.7 million). Revenue rose 12 percent to 2.08 billion pounds. The results beat analysts' expectations for an annual pretax profit of 158.03 million pounds on revenue of 2.07 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. SNC-Lavalin, which agreed to buy Atkins at a price of 2,080 pence per share, said last month it would not raise its offer for Atkins unless it faces a rival bid. In April, U.S. activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed it had taken a 6.8 percent stake in Atkins. Analysts said the strong results justified SNC's offer price and should smooth the takeover process.  A gate-crasher to the deal now seems increasingly unlikely,  Liberum analyst Joe Brent said.  We expect the deal to close prior to the long stop date of 31st July 2017,  he added. Atkins, which serves companies including BP and Network Rail, said revenue in North America rose 32.5 percent during the financial year, helped by new transport projects. The company had earlier expressed optimism over its outlook, saying it should benefit from plans by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost infrastructure spending. Shares in WS Atkins have risen 33 percent since the election of Trump last November. They were largely unchanged at 2,073 pence by 0810 GMT on Thursday. The company said its Middle East and energy markets, which have proved to be its weak spots in the first half of the year, performed in line with market expectations during the full year. $1 = 0.7849 pounds Reporting By Justin George Varghese; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wsatkins-results-idUSL3N1JC2O7"},

Ltd.'s (Marble II) USD500 million 5.3% senior notes due 2022 a final rating of 'BB'. The final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received and is in line with the expected rating assigned on 5 June 2016. The notes are secured by Marble I Pte. Ltd.'s 100% equity stake in Marble II and the interest reserve account. The notes are rated in line with Marble II's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating as they will represent its direct, unconditional, secured and unsubordinated obligations. Proceeds will be used to refinance Marble II's existing debt, prefund six months of interest on the proposed notes, cover transaction fees and other expenses incurred in the note issuance and pay dividends to Marble II's ultimate shareholders, The Blackstone Group LP (A+/Stable) and GIC Private Limited. The notes will be structurally subordinated to any future debt at India-based IT service provider, Mphasis Limited, in which Marble II owns a 60.4% stake, and Marble II's other operating subsidiaries. However, the subsidiaries have a working capital loan of USD40 million and have limited room for additional indebtedness within the terms of the proposed notes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Moderate Market Position: Marble II's ratings reflect its mid-tier position in the global IT services industry and modest cost and technology advantage over peers. Its ratings are supported by solid long-term relationships with key customers, given the moderate-to-high costs to its customers to switch to competitors, strong domain expertise in the banking, financial services and insurance sectors, stable revenue buoyed by minimum revenue guarantees from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE, BBB+/Stable) related clients, including DXC Technology Company (BBB+/Stable), HP Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and Micro Focus International plc. High Customer Concentration: Marble II has high customer concentration; its top10 clients contribute 55% of its revenue, if we exclude HPE-related clients. However, this risk is more than offset by, at least in the medium term, the revenue guarantees from its HPE-related customers of USD990 million in the next five years. The company also has a strong record of retaining solid relationship with key customers, with an average tenor of 14 years. Expanding Direct-Channel Revenue: We expect revenue from key strategic customers excluding HPE-related clients, to increase strongly over the next three years, significantly influenced by Marble II's strong relationships with strategic clients and opportunities from Blackstone portfolio companies. We believe the overlap in the Blackstone portfolio's industries and geography will help Mphasis increase its revenue faster than the industry average of 9%-11% annually. We expect Marble II to continue to generate a majority of its revenue from non-HPE clients (financial year to end-March 2017: 76%). Strong FCF at Mphasis: We expect Mphasis to continue generating positive FCF with a 5%-7% margin due to its low capex with capital intensity likely to be 1%-2%, modest working capital requirement, rising revenue and stable margins. Mphasis is likely to maintain a healthy balance sheet with minimal debt, similar to most India-based IT services companies. Mphasis only had USD40 million (INR2.6 billion) in working capital loans against cash and cash equivalents of USD464 million, including mutual fund investments, as of end-March 2017. However, this amount decreased after its April 2017 share buyback programme. Proportionate Consolidation, Higher Leverage: Marble II's debt service ability depends on dividends up-streamed from Mphasis. We analyse the Marble group by proportionally consolidating Mphasis due to the substantial level of minorities. On this basis, we expect Mable II's FFO-adjusted net leverage to increase to 5.0x at end-March 2018, from 1.1x at end-March 2017 after the proposed note issuance. However, higher operating cash flow and FCF should enable this leverage to fall below 3.0x by end-2020. Marble II will have limited ability to take on additional debt above the proposed notes due to the incurrence covenant on its notes of debt/EBITDA of 3.5x on a 100% consolidated basis (post- issuance debt/EBITDA: 3.6x), excluding a USD60 million carve-out. Lower H1B Visa Dependence: Any restrictions on US H1B temporary working visa approvals would negatively affect Indian IT companies, including Marble II. We do not expect a complete H1B ban or major restrictions on outsourcing from the US, but stricter rules or delays in granting visas would increase labour costs for onsite staff. However, Marble II has a lower exposure to such visa issues compared with peers. Its visa filing of labour condition applications as a percentage of total employees, at 3.5%, is among the lowest of peers (industry average: 10%). DERIVATION SUMMARY Marble II's credit rating of 'BB' is supported by its market position as a mid-tier Indian IT services provider, which we believe to be stronger than that of HT Global IT Solutions Holdings Limited (BB/Stable) in terms of operating scale, domain expertise especially in the banking, financial services and insurance sectors and higher utilisation rate. In addition, the company's master service agreement with HPE, with a minimum revenue guarantee of USD990 million for the next five years with a total tenor of 11 years, provides some visibility of revenue generation. The stronger business profile is somewhat constrained by Marble II's weaker financial profile, as its proportionally consolidated financials have higher leverage than that of HT Global. Marble II's FFO-net leverage will increase to 5.0x following the note issue, compared with HT Global's 4.6x on a like-for-like basis. Mable II's credit profile is constrained by its smaller scale and lack of technology and cost leadership compared with leading Indian IT companies. We believe it has limited capacity to win the largest IT orders due to its smaller scale and inability to deliver a full IT services portfolio. Nevertheless, it has demonstrated the ability to build strong customer relationships within its niche. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -Revenue growth of 8%-10% over the next two years -Operating EBITDAR margin to remain flat at around 15%-16% -Capex/ revenue to remain low at around 2% from 2018 -Marble II to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 1.0x, excluding interest reserve accounts RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Higher-than-expected shareholder returns, greater competition or loss of key customers leading to deterioration in proportionally consolidated FFO-adjusted net leverage to above 5.0x. - Operating EBITDAR margin declining below 15% for a sustained period Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: - An improvement in proportionally consolidated FFO-adjusted net leverage to below 3.0x on a sustained basis - An improved market position, demonstrated by higher profitability and lower customer concentration. We are unlikely to consider an upgrade until we can confidently forecast FCF of over USD125 million (financial year ended March 2017: USD50 million), given the company's small size. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Mphasis' liquidity was adequate as of end-March 2017, with cash and cash equivalents of USD96 million comfortably covering total debt of USD40 million, which was all short-term obligations. In addition, the company has substantial investments in open-ended liquid mutual funds of around USD349 million (INR22.7 billion), most of which we treated as readily available cash. Marble II had cash and cash equivalents of USD11.5 million at end-March 2017, of which USD9.2 million was restricted, against a USD15.7 million acquisition loan, which is payable within a year. The company is looking to refinance the loan with the proposed notes.

China regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be brought back under its sovereignty by force, if necessary. The pressure from Beijing on the UAE, Bahrain, Ecuador, Jordan, and Nigeria follows Panama's decision this week to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and instead recognize China and its  One China  policy. Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement China wanted the five countries to ask Taiwan to use names, such as  Taipei Trade Office , that do not suggest Taiwanese sovereignty.  China is acting to suppress us in an impertinent way that has seriously offended the sensibilities of Taiwan's people,  the statement said. Taiwan and China have tried to poach each other's diplomatic allies ever since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations in 1971, to allow formal recognition of China.  Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, did not confirm Taiwan's claim, but said the  one China  principle was  an important political prerequisite  for the country to establish diplomatic ties.  China highly appreciates and approves of relevant countries' handling of Taiwan-related issues in line with the one-China principle,  Lu told a regular news briefing.  Taiwan's office in Jordan is now called the  Commercial Office of the Republic of China . The Republic of China is Taiwan's official name and dates back to the ROC government's control of mainland China before it fled to the island at the end of China's civil war. The cross-strait rivals have often engaged in  dollar diplomacy , dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, although Taiwan has struggled to compete with an increasingly powerful China. Panama became the second country to switch its recognition to Beijing since Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen took office last year, following Sao Tome and Principe last December, reducing to 20 the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies. Taiwan had as many as 30 diplomatic allies in the mid-1990s.  Its remaining formal ties are with mostly smaller and poorer nations in Latin America and the Pacific.

The new service is part of a push by the  fintech  - or financial technology - sector to compete with established financial institutions, by using digital technologies to offer cheaper and more user-friendly services, often via smartphones.   Boston-based Circle Internet operates its app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin.   One of the most well-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O).  Circle Internet's international money transfer service, built on a type of blockchain called Ethereum, will allow customers to send payments between U.S. dollars, British pound sterling or euros on their mobile phones. There are no fees or foreign exchange mark-ups.  International payments, according to Circle's chief executive officer and founder, Jeremy Allaire, should not take days to be processed and should be as easy and frictionless as sending an email.   When's the last time you sent a 'cross-border email'?  Allaire said in an interview.  The idea of cross-border payments is going to completely go away. ... Our vision is for there to be no distinction between international and domestic payments.   Circle, which processed over $1 billion in transactions in 2016 and whose customer base increased more than 10-fold in the year up to last month, does not make money from its payments service, nor does it plan to, as it reckons consumers expect these services to be free.    We don't think there is any money to be made in payments anymore,  said Allaire.  The entire business model of extracting a toll or having time delays around the movement of value is going away completely.  Instead, the company makes money by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both on digital currency exchanges and over the counter, at a time when the value of such web-based currencies has reached record highs. Last month alone, Circle traded over $800 million in digital assets, it said in a statement.  In May the company appointed trader Daniel Matuszewski to take over its trading division, following the departure of former treasury and trading operations chief Joshua Lim, the company's head of marketing confirmed.

Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, has said he wants to run for the presidency in March 2018. Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for 17 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term, but has yet to confirm he will do so. Navalny has become the most prominent opposition challenger after organizing some of the biggest anti-Kremlin protests in years, seeking to leverage public anger over what he says is grotesque official corruption to boost his popularity. But he suffered a setback in February when a court handed him a suspended five-year jail term for embezzlement in a case he said was trumped up to frustrate his presidential bid. Ella Pamfilova, the head of the Central Election Commission, told TV Rain late on Wednesday that the conviction meant a presidential run by Navalny was out of the question.   I am afraid to be discourteous,  said Pamfilova.  But I understand - and he understands himself - that he has no chance of being registered for the election due to his previous conviction.  Her comments, made days after Navalny organized another big anti-Kremlin protest, follow those of another senior election official who last month said Navalny would have to overturn his embezzlement conviction to be able to run. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, said he thought the authorities were bluffing.   The more they say this, the greater my certainty that there will be no other option but for them to register him,  Volkov said on social media.  For now, opinion polls show Navalny would be defeated by Putin, 64, by a wide margin if he did run. But Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer, has embarked upon a campaign he hopes will improve his chances by harnessing the Internet and by making frequent visits to the provinces where he is less known. He is currently serving out a 30-day jail sentence after a judge found him guilty of repeatedly violating the law on organizing public meetings following big June 12 protests.

Poultry company profits should continue to rise as raw material costs are set to remain depressed and demand rises due to the political fight over cattle slaughtering in India, home to the world's biggest population of Hindus, who hold cows to be sacred, plays out in the courts. On May 31, the Madras High Court in the southern state of Tamil Nadu overturned a government ban on cattle trading for slaughter, an industry dominated by Muslims, but the case is set to go before India's Supreme Court. The cattle restrictions have been good for poultry producers as average broiler chicken prices in Mumbai have jumped 47 percent so far in 2017 to 100 rupees ($1.55) a kg, while corn and soymeal prices, the main chicken feed ingredients, have fallen 7 percent and 2 percent respectively.  For the first time, broiler prices sustained above 100 rupees (per kg) for a fortnight,  said Uddhav Ahire, the chairman of leading poultry firm Anand Agro Group based in the western city of Pune.  The average margin of integrated poultry firms was more than 30 rupees.  Usually soymeal and corn rise during the summer as supplies drop, but this year bumper harvests and sluggish exports have kept prices in check, Ahire said. Feed typically makes up two-thirds of poultry production costs. Back-to-back droughts that crimped grain output in India in 2014 and 2015 pressured the poultry farmers but that has changed. Shares of Venky's Ltd, India's biggest poultry producer, shot to a record high on Thursday after the company reported net profit more than doubled during the quarter that ended in March and full-year profit was a record 1.25 billion rupees. Poultry profits may be even higher in the June quarter on the rising average chicken prices, said Prasanna Pedgaonkar, general manager at Venky's, which is also the owner of Blackburn Rovers Football Club in Britain. Venky's profit during the next fiscal year could rise by 32 percent to 1.652 billion rupees, estimates Shalini Gupta, an analyst with Quantum Securities. Global Grain Glut Feed costs should remain lower as ample monsoon rains lifted corn and soybean production in 2016/17. But farmers are also struggling to export crop surpluses as the rupee has appreciated and grain and soymeal values are pressured by a global glut.  In December we were exporting more than 300,000 tonnes, but now shipping 100,000 tonnes per month is a challenge,  said Davish Jain, chairman of the Soybean Processors Association of India. Chicken demand has risen because of the cattle restrictions, especially in northern states where Muslims are a large minority, says Ahire of Anand Agro. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. In May, after state elections bolstered his power base, the government handed down the cattle restrictions. Even with the court suspension, cattle movement remains disrupted after incidents of Hindu activists beating cattle handlers.

The move is the latest sign of international interest in the French start-ups scene, which is gaining traction, after Facebook picked the same Paris campus as the site of its first ever start-ups incubator earlier this year. Dubbed  Space Green , the Korean-funded incubator is slated to welcome about 10 early-stage European companies in a 300 square-meter space with 80 desks.  There's a wish to contribute to the European ecosystem, because there's a belief that big tech champions can emerge in Europe,  said Pellerin. Korean-born Pellerin, a former French digital economy minister, is credited with launching the  French Tech  initiative in the early years of ex-President Francois Hollande's mandate, which put the country's burgeoning tech scene on the map. The Station F campus was built with 250 million euros ($281 million) in funds from Niel and is in the southeastern part of the French capital, a stone's throw away from the river Seine. It aims to be the world's biggest startup campus with 34,000 square meters of space and plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades, as well as bars and restaurants open 24 hours a day. Naver, which operates South Korea's biggest search engine, and Japanese subsidiary Line Corp, a popular messaging app in southeast Asia, each invested 50 million euros last year in K-Fund 1, a venture fund steered by Korelya Capital. $1 = 0.8912 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain and Gwenaelle Barzic; Editing by Michel Rose and Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/naver-tech-france-idUSL8N1JC12Q"},

Prime Minister Theresa May's shock loss of her parliamentary majority in last week's election increases the likelihood the government will listen to calls to retain some British access to the European Union's single market, said McFarlane, who is chairman of Barclays (BARC.L) as well as TheCityUK.    I do think it is a new game because it's a new political landscape and different political influences,  McFarlane said in an interview in his office at the Barclays headquarters in the capital's modern Canary Wharf financial district. He said financial firms may look to engage with a wider array of political actors such as the Scottish Conservatives, who are pushing for the economy to be at the heart of the government's strategy for Brexit, as well as an emboldened Treasury.  Business leaders complained before the election that they felt excluded from the Brexit decision-making process and accused the government of pursuing anti-business policies, including pledges to cap immigration and leave the single market. McFarlane said although the chances of a so-called softer Brexit, including a staggered exit from the EU and more relaxed immigration controls, have increased, so too have the chances of a chaotic Brexit because Britain now has a minority government.  The hope has risen, but I also think the difficulty has risen,  he said.  We don't know who is calling the shots, where is the political power between the ministries and the other parties.    McFarlane said the idea of Britain's main political parties engaging in cross-party talks to forge a common approach on Brexit, discussed in recent days, is workable.  After the war Britain was rebuilt with an all-party coalition,  he said.  We have done it before on important matters and this is an important matter.  When asked if he thought it was possible that Britain could remain in the single market, he said  it has opened up all sorts of possibilities  and that if a referendum on whether to stay in the EU was held today it may produce a different result.   Although McFarlane is chairman of one of Britain's largest companies and the most powerful financial services lobby group, he said he had never met May and described the levels of engagement with business under the last government as  weak.     You can't ignore them (business), a major slug of the economy, where the wealth is created,  he said. By contrast McFarlane praised the performance of opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a veteran socialist, saying his election campaign was  bang on .  He said the surge in support for left-wing policies meant businesses would need to work on how they interact with this support base.   Business also needs to have a societal tone to it because ordinary people have spoken out and they are finding it hard,  he said.  That is who is calling the shots at the moment . British finance minister Philip Hammond has the chance to revive his calls for a more business-friendly exit from the EU when he addresses an annual gathering of London's financial elite later on Thursday. McFarlane said much of the finance industry's lobbying remains focused on convincing European officials that they should give financial services a special deal to continue to operate unrestricted across the single market. The election of Emmanuel Macron as French president, a deeply pro-European figure, was largely seen as a reinforcement of the European project and that may make it harder to get a deal as in order to prevent further disintegration of the bloc, Britain would need to be punished for exiting, he said.  He said banks need to focus on achieving an outcome that will help the economies in Britain and the EU.    There is this foundation for this meeting of minds here if people are sensible,  he said.

Turnbull, who had a frosty first telephone call with the U.S. president early this year, was recorded mimicking Trump at a media ball at Parliament House in Canberra late on Wednesday, which was strictly off the record.  The Donald and I ... we are winning in the polls. We are! Not the fake polls. We are winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls. They are so easy to win,  Turnbull said in the leaked recording, adding:  I have this Russian guy...  An Australian journalist later broadcast the recording saying because he had not been at the event, he was not bound by the confidentiality rule. Turnbull later told the 3AW radio station he was disappointed by the leak, which he said was a breach of protocol. He said his  affectionately light-hearted  speech was a  good humoured roast  in which he was the butt of his own jokes. The U.S. embassy in Canberra said it understood that the Mid-Winter Ball was the equivalent of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, an annual Washington event at which the media and president traditionally rib each other.  We take this with the good humour that was intended,  the embassy said. Turnbull was one of the first foreign leaders Trump spoke to after he took office on Jan. 20. During their telephone call, the president became irritated about an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centres on remote Pacific islands. In return, Australia would resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Trump broke off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes and later tweeted that the refugee agreement was  dumb . Vice President Mike Pence visited Australia in April and made clear that while Trump was not happy about the refugee agreement, the United States would honour it. The two leaders were all smiles during their first face to face meeting in New York last month, when they declared that they  get along great . (Reporting by Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE.

As widely expected, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.0-1.25 percent on Wednesday but it also gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. That undid all of the damage done to the greenback earlier in the day and pushed it higher as European traders got down to business on Thursday. By 0806 GMT, the index which measures the dollar's broader strength was up 0.2 percent at 97.145.  Market expectations may have been more on the dovish side, the Fed did not confirm them - they kept the rate outlook very much stable, supported and they did not react on somewhat weaker data of late,  said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist with Credit Agricole in London.  Long term Fed expectations remain very much supported - that is the main reason why the dollar is remaining supported for now.  A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalisation at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting. Deepening political turmoil in Washington did not seem to weigh on the greenback after the Washington Post reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice. Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 109.57 yen, above Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen. On Friday, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged, and reassure markets it will lag the Fed in tapering its massive stimulus programme, as Japan's inflation remains low despite a strengthening economy. The euro was 0.3 percent lower at $1.1191, down a full cent from a seven-month peak of $1.1296 scaled overnight. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.7599, moving back toward its 2-1/2-month high of $0.7636 hit on Wednesday, after a better-than-forecast employment report. But the New Zealand dollar skidded 0.7 percent to $0.7222 , moving away from the previous session's four-month high of $0.7319. Data showed that New Zealand's economy grew 0.5 percent in the three months to March, lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll and well below the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth.

Drax, whose huge Yorkshire coal-fired power plant was once Europe's most polluting station, said on Thursday it would pay shareholders 50 million pounds ($64 million) in dividends this year, up from 10 million in 2015 and the first payout rise in seven years. It pledged to continue increasing dividends annually. The power producer also said it expects to be able to deliver earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 425 million pounds by 2025, more than three times its core earnings in 2016. Most of these profits, or around 300 million pounds, will come from Drax's power generation business, it said, the core part of the company that has been hit hardest in recent years by weak electricity prices and sudden changes in government subsidy payments. Drax has been modernising its coal-fired power plant to run on wood pellets instead as Britain has imposed a coal plant shutdown by 2025 to curb carbon emissions. The power producer is now banking on the need for its biomass units and flexible gas plants, which it intends to build in the coming years provided they obtain contracts to produce back-up electricity, to complement solar plants and wind turbines.  These are very, very competitive plants in the capacity auction and we believe there are a number of factors that could lead to an improvement in the conditions of the capacity auctions going forward as the market is tightening,  Drax Chief Executive Officer Dorothy Thompson told Reuters.

Weaker U.S. retail and inflation data overshadowed a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, raising doubts about the improvement in the economy and pressurizing the dollar.                   Although the Fed is saying the data is transitory, the market is struggling to align with this view,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.       Thus we are seeing the U.S. dollar under pressure which has been positive for gold in the short-term.       Spot gold        rose 0.2 percent to $1,262.86 per ounce by 0800 GMT. It hit a low of $1,256.65 in the previous session, its weakest since May 26.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery fell 0.9 percent to $1,264.50 an ounce.         We are looking for gold to hold support around USD $1,260, with expectations that the recent soft U.S. data and ongoing geopolitical concerns should be supportive,  MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note.      Risk sentiment was hit after Washington Post reported that Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice.                       As long as uneasiness around the Trump government among speculators and investors exists, gold will hold up pretty well, said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at ICBC Standard Bank.        Gold considered a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty.          Spot gold was also supported by short-term interest in physical gold in Asia, especially from Shanghai this morning,   Halley said.     In the wider markets, U.S. stock futures and Asian shares slid on Thursday with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan                 dropping 0.7 percent.     The dollar index        was little changed against a basket of currencies on Thursday after having slid to its lowest since November on Wednesday.           Among other precious metals, silver        rose 0.2 percent to $16.91 per ounce after it snapped a five-session losing streak and settled higher on Wednesday.         Palladium        fell 1.1 percent to $853.50 per ounce, while Platinum        was down 0.6 percent at $929.50 per ounce .

Having hit multi-week lows on Wednesday, euro zone government bond yields edged higher across the board, tracking a move in U.S. Treasuries overnight after the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points and signalled it would begin selling assets accumulated over years of money printing.  They have taken a cautious approach to balance sheet normalisation, but they have begun it and it's definitely a tightening of policy,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  The meeting was definitely tilted towards the hawkish side.  Any action by the U.S. central bank tends to reverberate across the debt markets of developed countries, as many investors have European, U.S. and Japanese government bonds in their portfolio and switch between them when there are changes in yields. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, rose 1 basis point to 0.24 percent, off a seven-week low hit on Wednesday at 0.225 percent. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose as much as 4 basis points from a seven-month low of 2.10 percent hit after weaker-than-expected U.S. data on Wednesday. Lower-rated Southern European government bonds - which tend to be most sensitive to any changes or tweaks on monetary policy - were up 2-3 basis points in early trade.  The periphery had rallied the most on Wednesday, led by Portugal, so maybe investors are thinking hold on, we may have gone a bit too far,  said Van Vliet. Portugal's 10-year borrowing costs dropped 14.5 bps on Wednesday, their steepest one-day fall in nearly a month. Greek government bond yields remained steady on Thursday ahead of a key Eurogroup meeting later. Euro zone finance ministers will meet later in the day to discuss whether or not to approve the disbursement of aid to Greece, money that the country needs to avoid defaulting on upcoming debt obligations. Most analysts expect the aid to be approved, but said an agreement on debt relief is unlikely to be reached today.  So far each episode in the Greek drama has always ended up with a last-minute temporising solution and this time euro area finance ministers are likely to approve the disbursement of the next tranche of aid and to postpone discussions about debt relief until after the summer,  BBVA strategists said in a note. An agreement on debt relief is a pre-requisite for the International Monetary Fund to participate in a deal for Greece, which in turn would pave the way for the European Central Bank to involve Greek government debt in its asset purchase scheme.

I haven't met Schaeuble yet and I don't want to be impolite, but his behavior seems dishonest to me,  he added. Papadimitriou said German resistance to debt relief for Greece raised questions about the very idea and structure of the euro zone. The success of right-wing populists in Europe also showed dissatisfaction with such European structures, he said.  Greece is being made a sacrificial lamb,  he said. Papadimitriou also warned Schaeuble against making decisions based purely on domestic politics, noting that Germany had also received debt relief when it was rebuilding after World War Two. Debt relief is needed to help Greece expand its economy, he said, noting that Athens was not asking for a debt cut, but rather lower interest rates or longer repayment schedules. Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos also called on the euro zone finance ministers to spell out concrete measures to reduce the Greek debt burden.  Greece has fulfilled its commitments and adopted the required reforms. Now it is time for the Europeans to comply with their commitments on debt relief,  Pavlopoulos said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt. German opposition politicians also criticized Schaeuble by honing in on the fact that the IMF is likely to participate in the third bailout, but will only disburse any loans when debt measures have been clearly outlined. Gerhard Schick from the Greens party accused Schaeuble of a  lousy trick  with the IMF participation. Thomas Oppermann, senior member of the co-governing Social Democrats (SPD), told Bild newspaper:  Schaeuble must put his cards on the table ahead of the election and say what German taxpayers will have to expect.   The IMF believes Greece needs a debt haircut, which Germany rejects. IMF chief Lagarde has suggested a deal whereby the IMF would stay on board in the bailout, as Berlin wants, but not pay out further aid until debt relief measures are clarified. A spokesman for Schaeuble told a government news conference on Wednesday he expected agreement on a sustainable overall package at Thursday's meeting, but said there was no guarantee that Athens would get debt relief. It remains Germany's view that debt relief measures for Greece could only be decided after the existing third bailout ends in 2018, the spokesman added. Schaeuble said on Tuesday he was confident that Greece would reach a deal with lenders this week. Last month he said everything pointed to stronger growth in Greece.

Riyadh's stock index was down 0.3 percent after half an hour after Brent crude dipped below $47 a barrel; half of the 14 listed petrochemical producers fell, with PetroRabigh down 0.9 percent. But small propylene maker Alujain surged 6.7 percent after it announced that minority shareholders had voted to remove the current board of directors and an election of new members would take place on Thursday. National Commercial Bank edged up 0.1 percent after its board recommended a cash dividend of 1.1 riyal per share for the first half of the year, up from the 0.6 riyal paid out for the prior-year period. The Saudi central bank responded to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate hike by lifting its reverse repo rate, at which commercial banks deposit money with the central bank, by the same amount to 1.25 percent but keeping its repo rate, used to lend money to banks, unchanged at 2.00 percent. This is expected to be net positive for Saudi banks' margins, but shares of other lenders were mostly lower on Thursday because the move had largely been priced in. Alawwal Bank fell 0.7 percent. In Abu Dhabi, mid-sized banks were the main laggards despite the United Arab Emirates central bank's rate hike with Sharjah Islamic Bank dropping 2.7 percent and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank down 0.8 percent. The index was down 0.3 percent. In Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank lost 0.5 percent. Emaar Properties fell 0.6 percent to 7.85 dirhams after profit-taking from a rally this month triggered by its plan to spin off its local real estate unit. The Dubai index edged down 0.3 percent. Banks in Qatar, which have been beaten down by the sanctions imposed on Doha by four Arab states last week, were mixed. Large-cap Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan was up 0.4 percent but Qatar Islamic Bank fell 1.2 percent. The index was down 0.1 percent. Doha's central bank has not yet announced its decision on interest rates. After the Fed's last hike in March, it was much slower than the other Gulf central banks to announce it was following soon, only doing so in the late afternoon of the next day.

A regulatory crackdown on a surge in shadow lending is starting to bear fruit, central bank data shows. Yet corporate bond issuance has also plummeted, and regulators are slowing IPO approvals. Once again the economy risks overdependence on bank lending. China has upped the ante in its fight against spiraling corporate debt in 2017, with some degree of success. May credit data, released by the central bank on Wednesday, showed that new trust loans, entrusted loans and bankers’ acceptances - common forms of non-bank or ‘shadow’ credit in China – collectively expanded by a mere 28.9 billion yuan ($4.3 billion) in May, sharply down from April and at the slowest pace in seven months. That suggests deleveraging efforts have found traction after showing mixed results in the first quarter, when shadow borrowing quadrupled on an annual basis, jumping by 2 trillion yuan. Graphic: Conventional bank loans are the dominance source of credit in China: reut.rs/2suXcBF This may be welcomed by chief bank regulator Guo Shuqing, who vowed in March to fight  chaos  in China’s banking sector ahead of a key communist party congress later this year. In focus is China’s expanding shadow banking sector, which Moody's estimated at $9.5 trillion yuan in assets at the end of 2016. While lending by non-bank players can perform a vital funding function, economists are concerned by the sector’s more than doubling in size in just five years. But pushing back too hard on alternative lending can have the unintended consequence of choking off credit to productive companies at a time while market financing avenues are being cut off. Net corporate bond issues fell last month by 246.2 billion yuan, the sharpest contraction on record according to Thomson Reuters data. Part of that is due on regulatory pressures on issuances by local governments and property developers, but it is also likely a reaction to rising interest rates. Meanwhile China’s securities regulator has pulled the brakes on IPOs, with weekly approvals down to less than half in funds term than a year ago. That's bad news for startups and private equity investors. Keeping different funding channels open can help allocate capital more efficiently. That won’t happen if bank loans remain the only source of credit in China.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Trump,Eleni Demertzis,Michael Madigan,Rahm Emanuel,US,CHICAGO,MAYOR,Crime / Law / Justice,General News,Illinois,Elections / Voting,Picture available,Pictures,Government / Politics,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democrats face years of work, focusing on “kitchen table” economic issues over several election cycles, if they want to regain ground lost to Republicans, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Wednesday. The Democratic mayor of the nation’s third largest city also said Republican President Donald Trump’s legal and political troubles give Democrats a chance to regain a large slice of the more than 1,000 seats Democrats have lost in Congress and state legislatures since 2008. With Democrats controlling cities and Republicans dominating rural areas, the battle will be fought among swing suburban voters, he added. “It’s not going to be done in a singular election,” Emanuel told Reuters in a wide-ranging, exclusive interview.  “The real crux question to me as a party is what I call kitchen table economics,” Emanuel said. Home ownership, affordable college, job security, retirement savings and health care are key issues, he said. Chicago has faced fiscal problems and untamed street violence since Emanuel first was elected mayor in 2011. The release in 2015 of a dashcam video showing a Chicago police officer fatally shooting an unarmed teenager led to street protests that hurt the mayor's standing with voters. Black Lives Matter sued the city Wednesday, seeking to force Emanuel to agree to federal oversight of proposed police reforms. Emanuel said the Justice Department under President Trump will not participate. “I can’t wish a different Justice Department,” Emanuel said. Instead, he is focused on police body cameras, more training and the hiring of new cops in supervisory roles, he added. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks during an interview at City Hall in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. June 14, 2017.Joshua LottEmanuel cited improvements under his leadership, public transportation in particular. “Eighty-five percent of our people in the city are happy with our public transportation system. In New York, I don’t think you could get 85 people, let alone 85 percent,” he said, citing not-yet-published data from an annual ridership survey for the Chicago Transit Authority.  Emanuel blamed Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner for gridlock that has put the state’s credit rating near “junk” status and helped bring the Chicago Public Schools to the brink of insolvency. Slideshow (8 Images)“There is a fundamental flaw here in the inability to find a way to say, ‘Yes,’” Emanuel said.  Rauner spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis said the mayor and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan are to blame for the state’s budget stalemate and “saying no at every turn.” In national politics, Emanuel is positioned to play a role as a leader of Democratic Party efforts to recover from the 2016 electoral defeat. He has served as White House adviser to President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton and led the 2006 mid-term campaign that returned Democrats to a majority in Congress.  With a 38 percent approval rating in a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, Trump’s unpopularity figures to be a dominant issue during the 2018 mid-term elections, Emanuel said. He declined to predict whether Trump will finish his term. “It’s a parlor game right now,” he said.

Crude prices wallowed near a seven-month low as doubts grew over OPEC's ability to cut oil supplies, weighing on stocks worldwide.

Basic resource stocks Anglo American, Randgold Resources and Polymetal were among the worst fallers. Retailers were also weak, as lukewarm results and downbeat company updates sent the pan-European index to a two-month low.

The tournament for the leading tour players aged 21 and under will feature a new scoring system, no lets, limited medical time-outs and shot clocks as the men's governing body seeks ways to appeal to younger audiences. The scoring system is the most radical change to the traditional format, with five-set matches decided through first-to-four-game sets, instead of the usual six, with tiebreaks played at 3-3.  Tennis is doing very well right now but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the case in the future, so I think it's important to try new formats, different scoring systems and see if it works,  Murray told reporters.  It is good to try new things... at least it's trying something different. You have to give credit for doing that, because tennis has often been accused of being too traditional, not wanting to try new things.  The only new rule that Murray specifically opposed was the no-advantage scoring rule, where each game will be decided by a sudden-death point at deuce.  I would prefer to try a shorter set with the same scoring, rather than the sudden-death deuce points,  Murray added.

Google has been locked in a months-long dispute over allegations by Indonesia's government that the search giant had not made enough annual payments. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday that Indonesia had now reached a tax deal with Google for 2016. She declined to disclose the settlement sum. The search giant's dispute with Indonesia has been seen as a bellwether of how the government of the country with the world's fourth-largest population may pursue other technology companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) for taxes.  On the solution for future taxes, they (Google Asia Pacific) have agreed with the government,  said Rudiantara, Indonesian Minister of Communications and Information, who has oversight on internet-based companies operating in the country. This may be subject to a change in Indonesia's regulation for the advertising business, which has been proposed by the communications ministry, said Rudiantara, who goes by one name.  The ministry will work with Indonesia's investment coordinating board on the regulation, he added. Rudiantara declined to comment on whether Google had reached an agreement with Indonesia on its taxes for previous years. Indonesian tax officials have alleged that most of Google's revenue generated in the country is booked at its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore and its local entity, PT Google Indonesia, simply acts as a sales service provider. Under a new agreement, Google's Indonesian entity will receive the revenue and pay expenses for its business in the country, said a senior government source, who declined to be identified as the information was not public. A sticker reading 'Review us on Google' is pictured at a food stall in Jakarta, Indonesia June 15, 2017.Agoes RudiantoIt is unclear if Google will set up a new domestic unit that is separate from PT Google Indonesia.  Google did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Indonesia's tax office declined to comment. Smaller Than Mooted A senior tax official had said in September that Indonesia planned to pursue Google for five years of back taxes and the company could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it were found to have avoided payments. Indonesian tax officials had estimated that the total advertising revenue for the industry in Indonesia was around $830 million, with Google and Facebook accounting for around 70 percent of that. But Google had pointed to a joint study by the firm and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia's digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015. The overall tax settlement amount will reflect the fact that Google's Indonesia revenues are  much smaller than the bombastic figures that Ministry of Finance officials have been mooting , the senior government source said. Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last year, Google agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($165.7 million) in back taxes to settle a probe by Britain's tax authority, while Thailand is studying plans to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms.

Approving our first equity investment is another milestone for the Bank and will enhance our potential to source and fund high quality, private sector projects,  said D.J.

Terrorism insurance policies were developed after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, but until recently covered only businesses that had been physically damaged. The deaths of two hostages taken at a cafe in Sydney in Dec 2014 and attacks in Paris in Nov 2015 that killed 130 people were catalysts for new types of cover taking into account the impact of heavy loss of life on businesses not directly hit. Recent deadly attacks in London and Manchester underlined the need.  The focus of terrorism has shifted to loss of life, rather than money, which can cause devastating loss of revenues to industries like hospitality,  said Chris Folkman, director of product management at risk modelling firm RMS. Some of these newer policies are difficult to price and hard to model, but insurers are developing them to meet demand and maintain market share in a highly competitive market which has suffered several years of falling premiums. Insurance against attacks is typically offered as a standalone policy or add-on to property insurance and is underwritten by specialists such as Lloyd's of London insurers Beazley, Hiscox and Talbot and U.S. insurers like AIG. Additions to the standard policies have begun to include  denial of access  policies to compensate for loss of business as a result of a police cordon following an attack, as well as  loss of attraction  policies to cover loss of revenue due to potential customers staying away from businesses further from the attack. A new-style policy including physical damage and business interruption cover for a hotel in central Manhattan which may have suffered from or merely been close to an attack, for example, would cost around $500 for $100,000 of cover, said Steven Tebbutt, political violence underwriter at Talbot. London Bridge Insurers say the global market for terrorism insurance can now cope with potential claims totalling more than $3 billion as the industry responds to growing demand. For instance, Chubb said this week it had increased the risk by 300 percent that it is willing to take on for each client account through terrorism and political violence insurance in the last two years, citing  growing client demand for certainty and comprehensive cover . AIG has expanded its global capacity to cover attacks on property to $1 billion, in part by employing engineering experts to help clients make their buildings less of a target, said George Stratts, AIG's President of Property and Special Risk. David Abrahamovitch, chief executive of a chain of coffee shops including London Grind, which is near the scene of this month's London Bridge attacks, has begun the process of claiming from his insurer. London Grind was closed for a few days as it was inside a police cordon. The chain switched insurance companies last year which gave it suitable cover, Abrahamovitch said, adding:  It will take a little while for footfall to recover.  In order for such insurance to be triggered, a government needs to declare an event an act of terrorism. But in the United States, a strict legal definition of terrorism for insurance purposes does not apply to many acts, or threats, of violence, said Bruce Smiley-Kaliff, senior underwriter for specialised programs at Kaliff Insurance and Lloyd’s North American underwriter, which focuses on events coverage. For example, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing did not meet criteria for the U.S. Treasury to determine it an act of terrorism under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.  The terrorism statute was a congressional kneejerk to 9/11,  Smiley-Kaliff said.  It never entered anyone’s minds that we’d have to worry about the county fair.  Kaliff Insurance, based in San Antonio, Texas, is now developing coverage that would more broadly cover “violent acts” such as bombs, shootings, or multiple stabbings, at events such as concerts and outdoor festivals. Opportunities, Risks Insurance broker Arthur J Gallagher said it had seen growing interest in its crisis resilience policy, underwritten by AIG, which costs small businesses around 500 pounds and includes post-incident trauma counselling and  24/7 access to experienced response consultants . While insurers develop some policies with an eye to new business, other claims for compensation may be forced upon them. In Britain, a rule change earlier this year means people injured by a vehicle, like those targeted in the Westminster and London Bridge attacks, can now seek compensation from insurers or the industry-backed Motor Insurers' Bureau. Previously, the vehicle's insurer would probably not have been liable. The policy riskiest for insurers, though of growing interest to customers, is loss of attraction, provided to a business nowhere near an attack which loses revenue as a result. Paul Bassett, managing director of crisis management at AJ Gallagher, said its  denial of access  policies have a 2.5-mile radius, while  loss of attraction  has a 10-mile radius. Those distances vary among insurers. Jessica Johnson, underwriting manager malicious acts at Lloyd's insurer Barbican, said a loss of attraction policy could provide cover, for example, to a hotel group with hotels in four UK cities. A physical attack on a hotel in one city could also allow the group to claim for loss of revenue in the other three. Insurers use forensic accountants to judge whether a business has lost attraction as a result of an attack which did not affect it directly. This type of policy could have helped hotels in Paris, for example, where revenue per available hotel room (RevPAR) plunged 14.6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, according to research firm MKG Consulting.  It’s an emerging, volatile type of coverage,  said Gordon Woo, catastrophist at RMS, adding:  We’re thinking of modelling it. Our clients are interested in this.” But insurers are cautious about offering too much of this and other such cover to avoid breaching the levels of risk that they have calculated are safe to have on their books.  Loss of attraction is something we're looking into...it's been asked about a lot by clients – especially in the entertainment area,  said Christof Bentele, global head of crisis management, at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty.  As an underwriter, you have to make sure that you’re not oversubscribing yourself.

The mid-point of the price range for DP Eurasia, which is Domino's fifth largest master franchise, amounts to an expected offer size of 203 million pounds and an expected free float of more than 65 percent, including the exercise of the over-allotment option. DP Eurasia, which was acquired in 2010 by local private equity firm Turkven and Aslan Saranga, who is now chief executive, currently operates 571 stores, the bulk of which are in Turkey with some in Russia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The company plans to open around 70 new stores this year - around 30 in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia and 40 in Russia - and about 70 to 90 more stores every year in the medium term. A successful listing would boost confidence in the ability of private equity firms to take advantage of Turkey's comparatively strong economic growth and young population, despite concerns over a political crackdown which has pressured the lira currency TRYTOM=D3.  DP Eurasia's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased to 75 million lira  ($21.43 million) in 2016 from 25 million lira in 2014, during a period in which the lira fell sharply against the dollar. Shares in DP Eurasia's British-based  counterpart, Domino's Pizza Group (DOM.L), trade on a 14.87 multiple of enterprise value to forecast EBITDA, according to Reuters data.

Molefe said Lipolelo died on the scene while her friend was taken to a nearby hospital. Molefe said the motive of the shooting was unknown and that investigations were ongoing.

Big hits, great defensive plays, clutch pitching -- and even premature fireworks. The fireworks went off after Angels right fielder Kole Calhoun made a leaping catch at the right-field wall to end the Angels' 7-5 victory. But, as the fireworks roared and Angels players high-fived, Yankees manager Joe Girardi called for a replay review.  I thought I heard the ball off the wall,  Girardi said.  So obviously we called right away and called for the replay.  Replays showed that the ball hit by Aaron Hicks deflected off the wall before going into Calhoun's glove, so the call was overturned and Hicks was credited with a double. That brought up major league home run leader Aaron Judge, representing the tying run. The drama quickly subsided, however, when Judge hit David Hernandez's first pitch on the ground to third baseman Yunel Escobar, who threw out Judge to end it. Andrelton Simmons' two-run homer in the seventh inning was the difference, snapping a 5-5 tie and helping the Angels take two of three in the series. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AngelsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch We had a chance to win every game,  Girardi said.  We didn't execute at times defensively; we didn't execute offensively at times. We had a lot of opportunities tonight and just didn't get it done. That's baseball.  Reliever Ronald Herrera (0-1) joined the Yankees on Wednesday after being called up from Double-A Trenton to give the bullpen some needed depth. He entered the game in the seventh inning and got the first two batters. But, after a walk to Luis Valbuena, Herrera threw a 79 mph breaking ball to Simmons on the first pitch. Simmons went down and got it -- he actually appeared to hit the ball as his right knee hit the ground. He got enough of it to hit it into the left-field bullpen for his seventh home run of the season.  I don't remember, maybe softball,  Simmons said when asked if he had ever hit a home run from one knee.  I was on (the pitch) the whole way; it just kept going low. I didn't want to pull off it so ... the videos I watched from (Adrian) Beltre maybe helped.  Angels reliever Blake Parker (2-2) got the win with 1 1/3 scoreless innings, and David Hernandez pitched the ninth for his first save. But the key pitcher for the Angels was reliever Parker Bridwell. Bridwell was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake earlier in the day to give the Angels long relief in the bullpen, and it turned out they needed it. Starter Matt Shoemaker had to leave the game in the fourth inning because of a strained right forearm. Bridwell pitched 3 2/3 innings and had to dodge some bullets, giving up seven hits. But he allowed only one unearned run.  The real story tonight was what Parker Bridwell did, what Blake Parker did and what David Hernandez did,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  That's a packed lineup they've got. Bridwell and Parker were sensational.  Yankees starter Michael Pineda got knocked around early but managed to stick around six innings. He gave up five runs on 10 hits and one walk.  I give him some credit,  Girardi said.  He struggled mightily in the first three innings and was able to get through six. But his location wasn't sharp tonight.  After a flurry of offense in the early innings, both teams lost some steam in the middle innings. The Angels led 5-4 heading to the sixth, but the Yankees tied the game on Chase Headley's RBI single. The Yankees would have had more if not for the defense of Eric Young Jr. in left field. They had two on and two out in the fifth when Stalin Castro singled to left. Young seemed to double-clutch after fielding the ball, but he threw a perfect one-hop ball to the plate, nailing Judge trying to score from second. In the seventh, the Yankees had runners on first and second with nobody out when Judge hit a liner to left. Young made a diving catch, and the Yankees' offense stalled from there. The Yankees got out of the gate fast, scoring four runs off Shoemaker in the top of the first inning -- three coming in on a homer by Gary Sanchez, who finished with three hits. The Angels threatened to get all four runs back in the bottom of the inning, but center fielder Hicks robbed Luis Valbuena of a grand slam, reaching over the wall in center to pull the ball back and turn it into a long sacrifice fly. NOTES: Yankees LHP CC Sabathia had an MRI on his left hamstring, one day after injuring himself in his start against the Angels. Results on the MRI showed a Grade 2 strain, meaning Sabathia likely will be placed on the disabled list. Before the results were known, Sabathia and Yankees manager Joe Girardi expressed optimism that it would not be a disabled list situation because Sabathia said he woke up Wednesday morning feeling almost no soreness. ... The Angels called up RHP Parker Bridwell from Triple-A Salt Lake and optioned RHP Mike Morin to Salt Lake to make room. The Yankees called up RHP Ronald Herrera from Double-A Trenton and optioned RHP Ben Heller to Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre. Bridwell and Herrera have been starting in the minors, but they will serve as long relievers out of the bullpen.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKR8T71"},

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.2 percent, to 3,528.79 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,132.49 points. The Shanghai SE 50 Index, an index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai, lost 0.6 percent after slumping the most in six months the previous session. On the other hand, the tech-heavy start-up board index ChiNext rose 1.4 percent to a one-month high. Data on Wednesday showed solid industrial output and retail sales growth in May, though investment is starting to cool as credit conditions tighten in the world's second-largest economy. China's central bank left interest rates for open market operations unchanged on Thursday, shrugging off an overnight increase in the U.S. Federal Reserve's key policy rate. Though China didn't follow the Fed in raising rates, as it did with short-term rates in March, analysts pointed out that borrowing costs in the country's interbank market have already risen sharply this year, as money supply in May grew at the slowest annual rate in over 20 years.  We're seeing more equity supplies but less liquidity, so China's stock market will likely remain sluggish,  said Wei Jianfei, analyst at Lianchu Securities. Traders say the market is also worried that profit growth at listed Chinese firms could stagnate, as producer price inflation may have peaked. Data this week showed that China's economy generally remained on solid footing in May, but tighter monetary policy, a cooling housing market and slowing investment reinforced views that it will gradually lose momentum in coming months. Most sectors fell for the day, led by banking and consumer stocks which traded near their record highs.

Full-year sales at Naked Wines, which was acquired in April 2015, surged 26.3 percent to 142.2 million pounds ($181.25 million). U.S. sales for the unit rose by 28 percent. Profit for the full year at Naked Wines rose to 48.2 million pounds, despite the previously reported failed direct marketing campaign hurting profit by 2 million pounds. Under the direct mail campaign, the company sent mailers to new customers last year inviting them to support winemakers and in exchange get preferential prices.  Profits could have been much higher but we increased our rate of investment..., a portion of which was badly spent on a failed Direct Mail campaign that will not be repeated,  Majestic said. The group's full-year sales came in at 461.1 million pounds. Majestic Wine has 210 wine warehouses across Britain as well as two branches in France, while Naked Wines operates across the United States, Britain and Australia. Other than Naked Wines, sales also grew at its specialist fine wine unit, Lay & Wheeler, by 36.2 percent. However, full-year adjusted pretax profit fell to 12.9 million pounds from 15 million pounds a year ago, reflecting the investment in the business, it said. Separately, the company said chairman Phil Wrigley will retire at the annual general meeting in August. Greg Hodder, a non-executive director since October 2015, will be appointed as chairman-designate with immediate effect, Majestic Wine said.

Bpifrance, the country's state investment bank, has led the effort over the past five years, acting as a catalyst for the burgeoning industry and a go-between for large cash-rich corporations and young entrepreneurs in need of funds to launch their business. It has in effect become in the country's number one venture capital fund, having injected 191 million euros in 53 startup companies last year. This taxpayer financing is 13 percent higher than the previous year and Bpifrance is adding 400 million euros to its so-called Large Venture fund, with individual investments of 10 million euros or more, bringing the total up to 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion), chief executive officer Nicolas Dufourcq told Reuters.  The tide has been turning in our favour for about year now,  Dufourcq said in an interview ahead the opening of the French capital's second technology conference, dubbed Viva Tech, on Thursday.  It is as if the French Tech's boss had been elected as the new president,  he said, referring to an initiative led by the former government to promote new online and data-driven French companies. Since 2012, notable investments by Bpifrance in venture capital have included biopharmaceutical company DBV Technologies, online and mobile booking platform Doctolib, the developer of a wireless low-energy network for connected objects Sigfox, and the maker of high-tech audio devices Devialet. Foreign investors began considering France as potentially lucrative new turf for disruptive companies about a year ago, Dufourcq and industry specialists say, even before independent centrist politician Macron made his candidacy official. Generous tax incentives for companies' research and development spending, renowned engineering and mathematical schools and private initiatives, such as the upcoming mega-campus for startups, Station F in Paris, funded by billionaire Xavier Niel, are some elements that explaining the trend.  Whether it be Britain, Germany or Nordic countries, there's a clear interest for France,  said Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures, which invested in two of the most successful former startups, Europe's biggest car-sharing company Blablacar and Nasdaq-listed Criteo which provides web advertising services.  All funds are starting to have one or two French or Francophile people that spend their time reviewing the French market. And that's clearly new,  he said. Estimates differ between research companies, but all show that France is catching up with Germany and Britain, the two leading startup havens in Europe, in number of deals and total amounts invested. Venture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu. It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in the venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic. This remains below Germany, with investments of 937 million. Still, over the first three months of this year, Paris saw 41 venture capital deals for a total value of 235 million euros, compared with 39 deals totalling 210 million euros, according to PitchBook, a data provider. The gap between the two countries highlights the relatively smaller size of investment tickets in France, underscoring the need for larger venture capital funds to help promising startups going international, Dufourcq said. For instance, London-based Vitruvian Partners invested 58 million euros in January in French luxury resale store Vestiaire Collective to support its growth. Private-equity funds such as Partech, Isai have developed their own growth equity funds with larger investment tickets. New venture capital funds were created lately in France, such as Korelya Capital, founded by former digital economy minister Fleur Pellerin, and Daphni. Over the last few years, energy companies Total and Engie as well as insurer AXA have all created their own venture vehicles. The new French government, which polls predict will win a large majority in the final round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday, is likely to push reforms that may further support spending on startups. Macron's manifesto included pro-business measures such as cutting corporate tax to 25 percent from 33.3 percent, shifting the wealth tax to property only, which would exempt the ownership of company stakes, and introducing a flat 30 percent tax on capital gains, from up to 50 percent currently. The new president also said before he won the presidency on May 7 that he wanted privatisations to help fund a 10 billion euro government drive to boost industry and innovation.  People need to know that if they come to France, they can make a fortune and won't get fleeced,  Dufourcq said. But tax reforms alone may not be enough for Paris to beat London on its turf.  We shouldn't delude ourselves, London still has a considerable advantage,  Mignot said, citing its cosmopolitan culture and tax credits for investing in startups.  But this advantage was built over 15 years. There's no reason Paris can't achieve it.

The move shows Google casting an increasingly wide net as it pumps cash into global medical research, seeding what it believes will become a core long-term healthcare business. Novartis and Verily, a unit of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), are cornerstone investors in the new fund, along with the European Investment Fund, Medicxi said on Thursday.  Verily already has deals with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Novartis and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to apply novel technology in areas ranging from diabetes management to robotic surgery. Last month it landed former U.S. Food and Drug Administration head Robert Califf as part of its team. Another Google offshoot, Calico, is working on treatments to fight ageing, while the group's arms-length GV venture capital  operation has invested in dozens of healthcare start-ups, mostly in the United States. The latest initiative will now see it delving deeper into drug development by investing in late-stage European biotech companies.  The new fund will back both private and public firms with products that have already reached mid-stage Phase II clinical development, providing them with a new source of growth capital.  There is a funding gap because there is a maturing class of biotechnology companies now in Europe,  said Francesco De Rubertis, co-founder and partner at Medicxi. The fund is a first for Medicxi, the former life sciences arm of Index Ventures, which has so far invested in early-stage biotech. It also reflects the redrawing of traditional industry borders as tech companies take a hands-on role in healthcare innovation, as highlighted by the fact that Verily will appoint two members to the new fund’s scientific advisory board.     Other tech companies, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), are also investing in healthcare in the belief that modern computing capabilities and miniaturization can help accelerate advances in medical treatment. Europe boasts world-class universities and scientists, but its biotechnology sector has long been a poor relation to the bigger U.S. industry, where emerging life sciences firms are able to access a much deeper pool of capital. By providing funds for late-stage drug development, the hope is that more firms will be able to stay independent and continue to build up the value of their experimental medicines, rather than selling out prematurely to larger players. De Rubertis said much of the investment was likely to be channeled to companies in Britain, Switzerland and a region spanning Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam. Europe has only a small roster of successful biotechs, such as Danish cancer specialist Genmab (GEN.CO), currently worth $13 billion, and Switzerland's Actelion. Actelion was Europe's top biotech firm for many years, thanks to its market-leading position in pulmonary arterial hypertension, before it was bought by J&J; this year for $30 billion. Total revenues for Europe's biotech industry were $25 billion in 2015 against $108 billion for the U.S. industry, according to consultancy EY.

But 38-year-old vigilante Dala Aisami Angwalla is undaunted  by two nearly fatal brushes in the last year with Boko Haram, one involving a landmine, the other an ambush, and is determined to rid northeast Nigeria of the jihadists. It is a sentiment shared by thousands of other volunteer vigilantes who have been instrumental in checking Boko Haram's progress but whose presence now casts a shadow over longer-term efforts to bring stability to the troubled Lake Chad region.  Why do I do it? Because it's my country,  the father-of-five told Reuters in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and epicenter of Boko Haram's bloody, eight-year campaign to build an Islamic caliphate in the southern reaches of the Sahel.  My children are OK. When I go out, they say 'Go well, father. May God keep you safe,'  he said, fingering a charm around his neck that he believes keeps him from harm's way. Angwalla belongs to the 30,000-strong  Civilian Joint Task Force  (CJTF) now fighting on the front line of Nigeria's struggle against Boko Haram after helping the military push the Islamists from towns across Borno in the last three years. Despite a string of victories, the CJTF has drawn criticism. Rights groups accuse its members of abuses ranging from extortion to rape and say their entry into the fray three years ago may be the reason for a sharp rise in Boko Haram violence against civilians. CJTF leaders, who say 670 of its  boys  have been killed in action, say bar a  few bad people  its members are registered, impartial and professional. Fear of Armed Groups The CJTF, most of whom are unemployed men, has asked the government to provide payment for its operations, a demand seen by political observers as ominous given the blurred lines in Nigeria between local politics and orchestrated violence.    With national elections in 2019 and the long-term illness of President Muhammadu Buhari pointing to a power vacuum, fears about organized armed groups are on the rise.  In Nigeria in particular, vigilantism did much to turn an anti-state insurgency into a bloodier civil war, pitting Boko Haram against communities and leading to drastic increases in violence,  the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, said.  In the longer term, vigilantes may become political foot soldiers, turn to organized crime or feed communal violence,  it said in a February report. Few in Nigeria would question the significance of the CJTF's role against Boko Haram, whose fighters have killed at least 20,000 people and displaced 2.7 million. Aid experts say 1.4 million are on the brink of famine after years without harvests. Set up as a Sunni fundamentalist group influenced by the Wahhabi movement, Boko Haram has led a violent uprising since 2009. The group, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden', has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Cutlasses and Arrows Building on Nigeria's long-standing tradition of communal self-defense, the vigilante group was founded in Maiduguri in  2013 when groups of young men decided they had had enough of the Islamist militants living in their midst. A member of the local militia group, otherwise known as CJTF, Dala Ishami Angwala, who was injured during a gun battle with Boko Haram, sits for a portrait photograph in a compound in the city of Maiduguri, northern Nigeria June 5, 2017. Picture taken June 5, 2017.Akintunde AkinleyeTheir cutlasses, bows and arrows, and rudimentary shotguns were little match for Boko Haram's modern weaponry, mostly captured in raids on Nigerian army and police positions, but their local knowledge was decisive. Hundreds of suspected militants were detained by soldiers and police acting on CJTF tip-offs in raids that turned the tide against Boko Haram in Maiduguri, a city of a million established as a military outpost by British colonial authorities in 1907.  Within one week, we secured the whole center of Maiduguri,  said Abba Aji Kalli, a 51-year-old accountant who is also CJTF's state-wide coordinator.  The army were strangers but we live with Boko Haram in the same community, in the same neighborhood. We know who are the members of Boko Haram.  Three years on, the CJTF forms the backbone of Borno's anti-Boko Haram defenses, attracting the praise of Buhari, who in December declared the Islamist group  technically  defeated.  They have been of tremendous help to the military because they are from there. They have local intelligence,  Buhari said. Cheek-by-Jowl With Boko Haram Slideshow (13 Images)Now, most day-to-day security in Maiduguri and the refugee camps that surround it falls to black-clad CJTF members patrolling entrances to markets or sitting behind sandbag barricades with machetes, muskets and bows and arrows.  Without the CJTF, there would be no security at all,  said Tijani Lumwani, head of the 40,000-strong Muna Garage refugee camp, hit by several suicide bombers in March.  They live in the community. We trust them. Without them, we would have no peace.  Most CJFT vigilantes, including Angwalla, go unrewarded for their efforts, although 1,850 who have received paramilitary training are given a 15,000 naira per month ($48) stipend by the Borno government. Around 450 have been incorporated into the main security forces and 30 into the intelligence services, group coordinator Kalli said, although he and his colleagues believe that is not enough and want more money and jobs to follow. Buhari spokesman Femi Adesina said there would be  some sort of demobilization  for CJTF members but denied any obligation to provide jobs.  The CJTF was a voluntary thing. There was no agreement that 'You do this, and the government will do that.'  Borno state attorney general Kaka Shehu Lawal said the local government was investing heavily in agriculture and other industrial projects to create jobs for unemployed CJTF members who otherwise had the potential to become trouble-makers.  We need them not to be idle because an idle man is the devil's workshop,  Lawal said. What Price Peace? However, allegations of CJTF abuses have raised fears among diplomats and rights workers that the counter-insurgency effort has spawned a provincial militia the authorities may not be able to control. Amnesty International researcher Isa Sanusi said he had credible reports of  widespread  abuses by CJTF guards in Borno, including extorting money from refugees seeking access to camps or sexual favors in exchange for food. Kalli said a handful of culprits had been arrested. Rights groups say that if the vigilantes fail to receive what they feel is due to them, they are likely to become another long-term source of instability.  They will come out of this crisis with some kind of entitlement that will make them think they are above the law,  Amnesty's Sanusi said.

After decades of strong growth, H&M; has repeatedly missed sales forecasts over the past year while earnings have come under pressure from heavy investment and stiff competition from budget rivals and new online players. H&M;, second in size only to Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC), reported a 4 percent year-on-year rise in local currency sales for the month of May, missing a mean forecast for growth of 6 percent seen in a poll of analysts.   In the first half of the month sales were affected by tough market conditions in several countries,  the retailer, which is controlled by the founding Persson family, said in a statement.  Sales improved considerably in the second half of the month.  Inditex has outperformed H&M; and other rivals over the past few years on the back of online growth and its flexible fast-fashion model. But while the market leader this week posted a 18 percent rise in first-quarter profit, it too saw sales growth slow slightly over the past month.

Terrorism insurance policies were developed after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, but until recently covered only businesses that had been physically damaged. The deaths of two hostages taken at a cafe in Sydney in Dec 2014 and attacks in Paris in Nov 2015 that killed 130 people were catalysts for new types of cover taking into account the impact of heavy loss of life on businesses not directly hit. Recent deadly attacks in London and Manchester underlined the need.  The focus of terrorism has shifted to loss of life, rather than money, which can cause devastating loss of revenues to industries like hospitality,  said Chris Folkman, director of product management at risk modeling firm RMS. Some of these newer policies are difficult to price and hard to model, but insurers are developing them to meet demand and maintain market share in a highly competitive market which has suffered several years of falling premiums. Insurance against attacks is typically offered as a standalone policy or add-on to property insurance and is underwritten by specialists such as Lloyd's of London insurers Beazley BEZG.L, Hiscox (HSX.L) and Talbot and U.S. insurers like AIG (AIG.N). Additions to the standard policies have begun to include  denial of access  policies to compensate for loss of business as a result of a police cordon following an attack, as well as  loss of attraction  policies to cover loss of revenue due to potential customers staying away from businesses further from the attack. A new-style policy including physical damage and business interruption cover for a hotel in central Manhattan which may have suffered from or merely been close to an attack, for example, would cost around $500 for $100,000 of cover, said Steven Tebbutt, political violence underwriter at Talbot. London Bridge Insurers say the global market for terrorism insurance can now cope with potential claims totaling more than $3 billion as the industry responds to growing demand. For instance, Chubb (CB.N) said this week it had increased the risk by 300 percent that it is willing to take on for each client account through terrorism and political violence insurance in the last two years, citing  growing client demand for certainty and comprehensive cover . AIG has expanded its global capacity to cover attacks on property to $1 billion, in part by employing engineering experts to help clients make their buildings less of a target, said George Stratts, AIG's President of Property and Special Risk. David Abrahamovitch, chief executive of a chain of coffee shops including London Grind, which is near the scene of this month's London Bridge attacks, has begun the process of claiming from his insurer. London Grind was closed for a few days as it was inside a police cordon. The chain switched insurance companies last year which gave it suitable cover, Abrahamovitch said, adding:  It will take a little while for footfall to recover.  In order for such insurance to be triggered, a government needs to declare an event an act of terrorism. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past flowers and tributes left for the victims of the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on a wet and windy morning in London, Britain, June 6, 2017.Marko Djurica/File PhotoBut in the United States, a strict legal definition of terrorism for insurance purposes does not apply to many acts, or threats, of violence, said Bruce Smiley-Kaliff, senior underwriter for specialized programs at Kaliff Insurance and Lloyd’s North American underwriter, which focuses on events coverage. For example, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing did not meet criteria for the U.S. Treasury to determine it an act of terrorism under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.   The terrorism statute was a congressional kneejerk to 9/11,  Smiley-Kaliff said.  It never entered anyone’s minds that we’d have to worry about the county fair.   Kaliff Insurance, based in San Antonio, Texas, is now developing coverage that would more broadly cover “violent acts” such as bombs, shootings, or multiple stabbings, at concerts and other events, such as concerts and outdoor festivals. Opportunities, Risks Insurance broker Arthur J Gallagher said it had seen growing interest in its crisis resilience policy, underwritten by AIG, which costs small businesses around 500 pounds and includes post-incident trauma counseling and  24/7 access to experienced response consultants . Slideshow (8 Images)While insurers develop some policies with an eye to new business, other claims for compensation may be forced upon them. In Britain, a rule change earlier this year means people injured by a vehicle, like those targeted in the Westminster and London Bridge attacks, can now seek compensation from insurers or the industry-backed Motor Insurers' Bureau. Previously, the vehicle's insurer would probably not have been liable. The policy riskiest for insurers, though of growing interest to customers, is loss of attraction, provided to a business nowhere near an attack which loses revenue as a result. Paul Bassett, managing director of crisis management at AJ Gallagher, said its  denial of access  policies have a 2.5-mile radius, while  loss of attraction  has a 10-mile radius. Those distances vary among insurers.  Jessica Johnson, underwriting manager malicious acts at Lloyd's insurer Barbican, said a loss of attraction policy could provide cover, for example, to a hotel group with hotels in four UK cities. A physical attack on a hotel in one city could also allow the group to claim for loss of revenue in the other three. Insurers use forensic accountants to judge whether a business has lost attraction as a result of an attack which did not affect it directly. This type of policy could have helped hotels in Paris, for example, where revenue per available hotel room (RevPAR) plunged 14.6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, according to research firm MKG Consulting.  It’s an emerging, volatile type of coverage,  said Gordon Woo, catastrophist at RMS, adding:  We’re thinking of modeling it. Our clients are interested in this.”  But insurers are cautious about offering too much of this and other such cover to avoid breaching the levels of risk that they have calculated are safe to have on their books.  Loss of attraction is something we're looking into...it's been asked about a lot by clients – especially in the entertainment area,  said Christof Bentele, global head of crisis management, at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty.  As an underwriter, you have to make sure that you’re not oversubscribing yourself.

Asian markets were spooked after The Washington Post reported U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice, citing unidentified officials. Gold edged up from a near three-week low as worries of political instability in the U.S. saw money moving into the safe haven.

In the first half of the month sales were affected by tough market conditions in several countries,  the retailer, which is controlled by the founding Persson family, said in a statement.  Sales improved considerably in the second half of the month.  Inditex has outperformed H&M; and other rivals over the past few years on the back of online growth and its flexible fast-fashion model. But while the market leader this week posted a 18 percent rise in first-quarter profit, it too saw sales growth slow slightly over the past month. H&M; shares are down 16 percent this year, sharply underperforming a 9 percent rise for Inditex.   H&M; has disappointed market expectations on sales trends for many months now,  Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow said.   The young value fashion market, in which the H&M; concept operates, is very difficult, as we have seen from recent reports of sales and profit declines at chains in the UK, such as New Look and Arcadia.      May is the final month of the group's fiscal second quarter and H&M; said net quarterly sales reached 51.4 billion Swedish crowns ($5.91 billion) for the period, up from a year-ago 46.9 billion but short of the 51.9 billion seen by analysts.

Terrorism insurance policies were developed after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, but until recently covered only businesses that had been physically damaged. The deaths of two hostages taken at a cafe in Sydney in Dec 2014 and attacks in Paris in Nov 2015 that killed 130 people were catalysts for new types of cover taking into account the impact of heavy loss of life on businesses not directly hit. Recent deadly attacks in London and Manchester underlined the need.  The focus of terrorism has shifted to loss of life, rather than money, which can cause devastating loss of revenues to industries like hospitality,  said Chris Folkman, director of product management at risk modeling firm RMS. Some of these newer policies are difficult to price and hard to model, but insurers are developing them to meet demand and maintain market share in a highly competitive market which has suffered several years of falling premiums. Insurance against attacks is typically offered as a standalone policy or add-on to property insurance and is underwritten by specialists such as Lloyd's of London insurers Beazley BEZG.L, Hiscox (HSX.L) and Talbot and U.S. insurers like AIG (AIG.N). Additions to the standard policies have begun to include  denial of access  policies to compensate for loss of business as a result of a police cordon following an attack, as well as  loss of attraction  policies to cover loss of revenue due to potential customers staying away from businesses further from the attack. A new-style policy including physical damage and business interruption cover for a hotel in central Manhattan which may have suffered from or merely been close to an attack, for example, would cost around $500 for $100,000 of cover, said Steven Tebbutt, political violence underwriter at Talbot. London Bridge Insurers say the global market for terrorism insurance can now cope with potential claims totaling more than $3 billion as the industry responds to growing demand. For instance, Chubb (CB.N) said this week it had increased the risk by 300 percent that it is willing to take on for each client account through terrorism and political violence insurance in the last two years, citing  growing client demand for certainty and comprehensive cover . AIG has expanded its global capacity to cover attacks on property to $1 billion, in part by employing engineering experts to help clients make their buildings less of a target, said George Stratts, AIG's President of Property and Special Risk. David Abrahamovitch, chief executive of a chain of coffee shops including London Grind, which is near the scene of this month's London Bridge attacks, has begun the process of claiming from his insurer. London Grind was closed for a few days as it was inside a police cordon. The chain switched insurance companies last year which gave it suitable cover, Abrahamovitch said, adding:  It will take a little while for footfall to recover.  In order for such insurance to be triggered, a government needs to declare an event an act of terrorism. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past flowers and tributes left for the victims of the attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on a wet and windy morning in London, Britain, June 6, 2017.Marko Djurica/File PhotoBut in the United States, a strict legal definition of terrorism for insurance purposes does not apply to many acts, or threats, of violence, said Bruce Smiley-Kaliff, senior underwriter for specialized programs at Kaliff Insurance and Lloyd’s North American underwriter, which focuses on events coverage. For example, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing did not meet criteria for the U.S. Treasury to determine it an act of terrorism under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.   The terrorism statute was a congressional kneejerk to 9/11,  Smiley-Kaliff said.  It never entered anyone’s minds that we’d have to worry about the county fair.   Kaliff Insurance, based in San Antonio, Texas, is now developing coverage that would more broadly cover “violent acts” such as bombs, shootings, or multiple stabbings, at concerts and other events, such as concerts and outdoor festivals. Opportunities, Risks Insurance broker Arthur J Gallagher said it had seen growing interest in its crisis resilience policy, underwritten by AIG, which costs small businesses around 500 pounds and includes post-incident trauma counseling and  24/7 access to experienced response consultants . Slideshow (8 Images)While insurers develop some policies with an eye to new business, other claims for compensation may be forced upon them. In Britain, a rule change earlier this year means people injured by a vehicle, like those targeted in the Westminster and London Bridge attacks, can now seek compensation from insurers or the industry-backed Motor Insurers' Bureau. Previously, the vehicle's insurer would probably not have been liable. The policy riskiest for insurers, though of growing interest to customers, is loss of attraction, provided to a business nowhere near an attack which loses revenue as a result. Paul Bassett, managing director of crisis management at AJ Gallagher, said its  denial of access  policies have a 2.5-mile radius, while  loss of attraction  has a 10-mile radius. Those distances vary among insurers.  Jessica Johnson, underwriting manager malicious acts at Lloyd's insurer Barbican, said a loss of attraction policy could provide cover, for example, to a hotel group with hotels in four UK cities. A physical attack on a hotel in one city could also allow the group to claim for loss of revenue in the other three. Insurers use forensic accountants to judge whether a business has lost attraction as a result of an attack which did not affect it directly. This type of policy could have helped hotels in Paris, for example, where revenue per available hotel room (RevPAR) plunged 14.6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015, according to research firm MKG Consulting.  It’s an emerging, volatile type of coverage,  said Gordon Woo, catastrophist at RMS, adding:  We’re thinking of modeling it. Our clients are interested in this.”  But insurers are cautious about offering too much of this and other such cover to avoid breaching the levels of risk that they have calculated are safe to have on their books.  Loss of attraction is something we're looking into...it's been asked about a lot by clients – especially in the entertainment area,  said Christof Bentele, global head of crisis management, at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty.  As an underwriter, you have to make sure that you’re not oversubscribing yourself.

Slideshow (3 Images)After four weeks of hearing testimony from Wilson herself, local journalists and several Hollywood celebrities, the jury of six at Victoria's Supreme Court found unanimously in her favor.

Hammond will address an annual gathering of London's financial elite who, like many other business leaders, fear that May's insistence that  no deal is better than a bad deal  will cost them business in the European Union. Britain's giant banking industry sees Hammond as its most powerful ally and bankers were worried when it appeared he might lose his job in the run-up to the election.  It is in everyone's interests that UK financial services remain strong and competitive,  City of London Lord Mayor Andrew Parmley is due to say at the Mansion House dinner where Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will speak.  This sector should help shape our negotiations with the EU,  Parmley says, in speech excerpts released to media. Until a few days ago, it had seemed likely that Hammond would not be giving the Mansion House speech. Newspapers said he had fallen out with May's powerful aides and speculation was rife about who might replace him. But with May reeling from the loss of her Conservative Party's parliamentary majority last week, she reappointed Hammond to his job, and it was her aides who lost theirs.  Hammond is in a much more powerful position than he used to be,  said a bank executive who regularly meets government officials.  Hammond is a pragmatist, he is business-friendly, and the Treasury have done all the serious work on Brexit.  In contrast to May's uncompromising tone with a focus on controlling immigration, Hammond has stressed the importance of ensuring that British employers can continue to find the skilled workers they need from the EU. On Friday, the day after the election, he tweeted:  Pleased to be re-appointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity.  The Times newspaper has said Hammond wanted May to keep Britain in the EU's customs union, allowing tariff-free trade within the bloc but preventing trade deals with other countries.  The Sun newspaper said Hammond won the backing of interior minister Amber Rudd on the need to focus on the economy in Brexit. Two former Conservative prime ministers have also urged May to soften her approach. Austerity Fatigue Hammond may use his speech to signal how the government will respond to the weariness among many voters over the spending cuts needed to turn Britain's budget deficit into a surplus, something the government says will take until the mid-2020s. Inflation is at its highest since 2013, at 2.9 percent, while growth in basic pay lags at 1.7 percent, tightening the squeeze on households. Figures due to released at 0830 GMT on Thursday are expected to show retail sales fell in May. The opposition Labour Party fared better than expected in the election with its promises of measures such as the end to a 1-percent cap on public sector pay increases, and a higher minimum wage. Labour has also said Britain needs to spend more to prevent the kind of attacks carried out recently by Islamist militants and it has linked a fire disaster in a London tower block this week to constraints on spending. However, Hammond's options for a significant loosening of the purse strings appear limited, not only by his fiscally hawkish instincts and Britain's still weak public finances, but also by the Conservative Party's diminished clout.  Although many in parliament would agree with some change in the fiscal stance, it could be hard to reach agreement on a fully comprehensive package of fiscal measures and in particular how to fund them,  JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said. In a nod to the concerns among some businesses about their funding options, the Treasury said it will step up the level of financial support it provides to firms ranging from start-ups to  infrastructure providers. Also on Thursday, the Bank of England is set to signal once again that, with the economy struggling to regain momentum, it is in no hurry to raise interest rates from their all-time low.  Its policymakers are likely to focus more on the spending power squeeze for many households than rising inflation, which they expect will prove a short-lived consequence of the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. Growth slowed sharply in early 2017 and the BoE may see the uncertainty caused by May's election flop as another reason to keep borrowing costs low, or even consider providing further stimulus to help growth if needed. The BoE is due to publish its latest monetary policy statement at 1100 GMT.

Also souring sentiment was a Washington Post report that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel for possible obstruction of justice. The Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower at 19,831.82, after briefly entering positive territory in early morning trade.  Overall sentiment was soured after the yen strengthened... Both weak U.S. economic data and the Trump probe report would become reasons for the yen to be bought,  said Isao Kubo, an equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management. The dollar dropped to an eight-week low of 108.81 yen overnight before recovering to trade at 109.59 yen, pressuring exporters. Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.1 percent and Panasonic Corp tumbled 1.6 percent. Financials underperformed on falling U.S. yields, with the banking sector shedding 1.5 percent and the insurance sector stumbling 1.8 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group declined 2.0 percent, T&D; Holdings stumbled 2.2 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings fell 1.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate to a range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent as expected, and gave its first clear outline on how it plans to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. Fed policymakers also signalled they were likely to raise rates once more this year. But the Fed rate hike was overshadowed by poor inflation and retail sales data.  The market is relieved that the big event has passed. But the result left the market with lots of questions after weak U.S. economic data,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. Consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April. Retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month - the largest fall since January 2016 and below economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain.  It is difficult for investors to imagine that the U.S. economy will recover from the first quarter and that inflation will rise anytime soon,  said Daiwa's Takahashi. Bucking the trend was Nintendo Co, soaring 4.3 percent and extending its gains after it announced on Twitter the previous day that it would release Super Mario Odyssey for Switch on Oct. 27. The broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,588.09. (Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-stocks-close-idUSL3N1JC2ID"},

Putin,US,WEINER,SESSIONS,COMMENTARY,Crime / Law / Justice,Elections / Voting,Russia,Commentaries,Europe,Government / Politics,United States","sector":"Blogs","content":"We stand confronted – as former Senator Bob Dole said after seeing ex-Presidents Ford, Carter, and Nixon standing together at the funeral of the Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat – with Hear no Evil, Speak no Evil, and Evil.  Hear no evil was represented at Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate intelligence committee by Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. He said “I don’t recall” and “I don’t remember” so often that it sounded like a highlight reel from the Watergate hearings.  Speak no evil was played by Republican members of the committee, who gave a free pass to Sessions’ protestations that he knew nothing substantive about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. In fact, no senator of either party had the temerity to ask about his recent offer to resign, made directly to President Trump, for reasons on which we can only speculate.  Evil starred the Russians for attacking American democracy. Sessions, by his own account, knows nothing about Moscow’s alleged intervention in the 2016 presidential race.  He is willfully seeing no evil, he seemed to suggest, because he has recused himself from the whole Russian affair. This decision, in his view, prevents him from being informed about the investigation but not from recommending the dismissal of James Comey, the former FBI director who was leading it until Trump fired him.  Sessions led off by indignantly denouncing the “appalling and detestable lie” that he himself had colluded with the Russian attack. No one has accused him of such criminal conduct.  For good measure, he again insisted that he himself did not have contact with the Russians. That is not the whole truth. He fuzzed over his two meetings with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, who has a face that is hard to forget. Sessions had failed to disclose these meetings in written testimony submitted at his confirmation hearings.  More from Reuters Commentary  Tim Weiner: How's Comey's 'smoking gun' could kill the Trump presidency Amir Handjani: Inside Trump's Middle East mess Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia asked whether Sessions knew if any members of the Trump administration had met with Russian officials. How about retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, inquired Manchin. After all, there’s that famous picture of Flynn, the former national security adviser, dining with a certain V. Putin. Everyone in Washington knows that then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House in December that Flynn’s continuing contacts with Russians left him vulnerable to blackmail.  Everyone, it seems, save Sessions. “I don’t recall,” the attorney general said, for the umpteenth time. Sessions’ seemingly selective amnesia was too much for Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. “We are talking about an attack on our democratic institutions, and stonewalling of any kind is unacceptable.”The word “stonewall” itself harks back to Watergate. That was Richard Nixon’s advice to his former attorney general and campaign manager John N. Mitchell as the FBI closed in on the Oval Office.  “I am not stonewalling,” Sessions shot back to Senator Wyden. “I am following the historic policies of the Department of Justice.” Sessions was actually following a sheaf of memoranda from the Reagan administration’s Justice Department on the question of executive privilege, which are historic only in the sense that they are 30 years old.  Then came questions over the president’s decision to dismiss Comey, an act construed as a potential obstruction of justice since Comey was investigating the possibility that members of Team Trump aided or abetted Team Putin’s attack on the 2016 election.  First, Sessions said that he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had discussed removing Comey as far back as early February. Second, Sessions insisted that firing the FBI director was justified because of the way Comey announced his decision to close the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails in July. He so advised the president.  This is strange for two reasons. Sessions wholeheartedly supported Comey’s conduct back then. It’s on tape. And secondly, Trump has said his mind was made up to fire Comey because of his handling of the Russia investigation, no matter what Sessions and Rosenstein advised. That’s on tape too. Sessions was a member of the Senate five short months ago. He called the members of the intelligence committee “colleagues.” But collegiality and comity were in short supply Tuesday.  Things got tense when Senator Martin Heinrich accused Sessions of “impeding this investigation.” They practically exploded when California Senator Kamala Harris received a flurry of non-answers to direct questions about whether any Trump officials met with Russians – which the record reflects they did. It seems like only yesterday that Trump himself was laughing it up with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office. Sessions batted away almost everything Harris threw at him.  This was, in short, no way to run a hearing. Sessions asked to appear in public before the Senate intelligence committee, which at present is the only panel in Congress doing a credible job investigating what the Kremlin may have done to roll out the red carpet for the present occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But the attorney general had little intelligence to offer. He concealed more than he revealed, hiding behind the veil of executive privilege - a privilege only the president can invoke. His testimony was in essence one long memory lapse interrupted by protestation of his own probity.  The Jesuits teach us that there are two kinds of ignorance in this world: Invincible and vincible. Invincible ignorance consists of mysteries we’ll never know, because it’s a fallen world and God works in mysterious ways. Vincible ignorance is comprised of all the things you ought to know but you don’t want to know, because they are too hard to handle. The attorney general’s testimony was an object lesson in the latter. We may see its like again in the course of this investigation. Let’s hope it’s not any time soon.

A Washington Post report saying a special counsel is investigating U.S. President Donald Trump for possible obstruction of justice added to the weakness in the U.S. currency.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.02 percent at 0544 GMT.     The U.S. consumer Price Index dipped an unexpected 0.1 percent in May, and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, suggesting a softening in domestic demand.      But the Fed went on to raise the benchmark rate for the second time in three months, and also forecasted one more rise this year with its rate-setting committee holding the view that a recent softness in inflation as largely transitory.       I take the view that the Fed is on a normalization path. Our view is that they have moved from 1 hike per year in 2015 and 2016 to 1 hike per quarter this year,  said Philip Sung Seng Wee, DBS senior currency economist.      Lifting the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, Chair Janet Yellen brushed off the recent mixed data on the back of a robust labour market.     Regional currencies were largely up with the Thai baht  at near two-year highs, adding 0.13 percent, while the Malaysian ringgit gained 0.07 percent, hitting its highest in 6 months.     The South Korean won rose 0.08, while the Chinese  yuan edged up 0.1 percent.      China's central bank left interest rates for open market operations unchanged on Thursday, unfazed by a rate hike by the U.S. Fed.      Some traders in China had opined that the People's Bank of China had decided to  synch  its moves with those of the Fed in a bid to reduce persistent depreciation pressure on the yuan.      On the other hand, the Singapore dollar slid 0.13 percent, snapping two gaining days.      INDONESIAN RUPIAH     The Indonesian rupiah inched up to touch a more than one-month high of 13,270 to the dollar,  but then the gain was erased.      In May, Indonesia's exports and imports surged more than expected, but the trade balance was smaller than anticipated, the statistics bureau said on Thursday     After 0700 GMT Thursday, Indonesia's central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.

The 10-year cash JGB yield edged down half a basis point to 0.055 percent, while the September 10-year JGB futures contract added 0.10 point to finish at 150.46. The yield curve flattened slightly as prices rose in the superlong zone, with the 20-year JGB yield falling 1.5 basis points to 0.555 percent, and the 30-year JGB yield shed one basis point at 0.795 percent. On Friday, the BOJ is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged, and reassure markets it will lag the Fed in tapering its massive stimulus programme, as Japan's inflation remains low despite a strengthening economy. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is also seen dismissing market speculation that the central bank is engaging in  stealth tapering  by stressing that the recent slowdown in its Japanese government bond buying is simply the result of a stable bond market, according to sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking. In its purchase operations on Thursday, the BOJ bought 280 billion yen ($2.55 billion) of one- to three-year JGBs, 300 billion yen of three- to five-year JGBs and 100 billion yen of floating-rate JGBs. An overnight drop in U.S. Treasury yields added pressure to JGB yields. The U.S. Federal raised interest rates on Wednesday as widely expected, and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. But the moves were overshadowed by inflation and retail sales data earlier in the day that fell short of market expectations, and sent the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a seven-month low. The Fed also tweaked down its inflation forecast, saying it expects U.S. inflation to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent it previously expected.

LOUIS -- Eric Thames was almost the toast of the baseball world in April. Until Wednesday night, May and the first half of June hadn't gone quite so well. But the Milwaukee Brewers' first baseman found his early-season form against the St. Louis Cardinals, belting a two-run homer and an RBI double in the first two innings that helped Milwaukee notch a rain-delayed 7-6 victory at Busch Stadium. After clouting a franchise-record 11 homers in April, Thames cooled off considerably. He managed five over the last six-plus weeks and saw his average dip from .345 to .253 when he stepped into the batter's box in the first inning against Mike Leake. A meaty 1-2 changeup down the middle appeared for Thames' benefit. The ball flew 411 feet over the St. Louis bullpen in right-center, cashing in Eric Sogard's leadoff walk. An inning later, Thames lashed an 0-1 pitch down the right-field line for a double that again scored Sogard. Thames later came home on Travis Shaw's single that finished a six-run uprising in the first two innings. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at CardinalsMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch Leake is good at nibbling on the corners,  Thames said.  I was lucky to get a changeup a little up. It was great to get some early runs. We need that against this team.  Sogard played a key role as Thames' wingman. He spoiled a tough 3-2 pitch in the first before earning a free pass, then laced a two-run double to left-center in the second that chased Keon Broxton and Matt Garza home. That trip around the bases led to trouble when Garza took the mound for the bottom of the second with a touchdown lead. Four straight one-out hits, including a two-run triple by Jose Martinez and an RBI double by Kolten Wong, cut the deficit in half. Matt Carpenter rifled a two-out run-scoring double through an overshifted defense, finishing a 42-minute inning in which the teams combined for eight runs on nine hits. After that, Garza (3-2) didn't allow another hit. He made it through the five innings necessary to earn the win, allowing four runs on five hits and two walks, with four strikeouts.  The second inning got me,  Garza said.  I didn't have my legs underneath me. They barreled a whole lot of balls, and that's the nature of the beast.  Offense was the early story. Rain was the star of the endgame. Shortly after Hernan Perez's two-out RBI single in the seventh gave the Brewers a 7-4 lead, the game was stopped for 50 minutes. Aledmys Diaz lined a two-run homer through a downpour in the eighth, pulling the Cardinals (30-34) within a run. Immediately after Diaz finished his trot, the grounds crew raced on the field to cover it. During a 60-minute stoppage, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell faced a tough decision. He opted to bring closer Corey Knebel in for a four-out save. Knebel's first pitch was lined by Jose Martinez to Shaw at third. Knebel fought through command issues in the ninth, fanning Dexter Fowler with Carpenter at first for the last out at 12:14 a.m. CT. It was Knebel's 10th save in 13 chances.  Playing through the rain at the end was a little dicey,  Counsell said.  You couldn't really tell what would happen. Getting that first-pitch out meant (Knebel) came in really clean for the ninth.  Leake (5-6) lost his fourth consecutive start. He gave up nine hits and six runs in six innings, walking two and whiffing three. Leake's ERA, once the National League's lowest, rose to a season-high 3.14.  It looked like a lot of close misses early,  St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said.  He's been so precise on the plate. It was just one of those days he had to make the adjustments. He did, but they had already capitalized on them.  NOTES: Milwaukee designated former closer Neftali Feliz for assignment. The veteran right-hander, signed for $5.25 million in the offseason, is 1-5 with a 6.00 ERA and eight saves in 29 appearances. He allowed his eighth homer in 27 innings Tuesday. ... St. Louis 2B Kolten Wong (right forearm tightness) left the game before the start of the sixth inning and was replaced by Greg Garcia. Manager Mike Matheny said Wong was injured on a checked swing and couldn't throw the ball. ... The Cardinals optioned LHP Marco Gonzales to Triple-A Memphis. Gonzales started the second game of Tuesday's doubleheader as the team's 26th man.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKQ376Z"},

I had this situation earlier,  said Castillo, who also collected a career-best five RBIs.  I'm not afraid to fail. This game is about making adjustments. ... (White Sox starter Miguel Gonzalez) left me a fastball up and over and I put a good swing on it.  The homer was Castillo's lone hit, and Trey Mancini went 3-for-4 to lead a 13-hit attack for the Orioles (32-32) in a game that started 90 minutes late due to rain. Baltimore starter Dylan Bundy (7-5) worked five innings, allowing five runs (four earned) on six hits. He walked three and struck out four. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at White SoxBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch We didn't pitch particularly well tonight,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  We were fortunate. There were a lot of balls that were hit hard, but we made some good plays. It was apropos that Dylan got the benefit of a good offensive night.  Both starting pitchers were hit for early runs and Gonzalez (4-8) took the loss, departing after five rocky innings. He gave up eight runs on nine hits, walked two and struck out three. Chicago (28-36) saw a two-game winning streak end. The White Sox had the bases loaded in the first inning and Tim Anderson -- fresh from a day off -- delivered a hit to left-center to score Jose Abreu and Avisail Garcia. The Orioles got one run back in the second as Mancini reached on a ground-rule double down the third-base line and scored as Jonathan Schoop lined a double over center fielder Willy Garcia. Matt Davidson's second home run in two days -- a leadoff shot in the second inning on a 1-1 Bundy pitch -- gave Chicago a 3-1 lead. Davidson, who now has a team-leading 13 homers, hit a grand slam Tuesday.  We got to him (Bundy) early and then he kind of got that confidence back getting that lead and cruised after that,  Davidson said. The White Sox scored twice more in the second inning. Yolmer Sanchez was hit by a pitch, reached third on Melky Cabrera's hit to left and scored when Schoop's throw to third went wide. Cabrera ended up on third and came home on Abreu's sacrifice to right to make it 5-1. The Orioles added three runs in the fourth, the first coming when Castillo grounded into a bases-loaded fielder's choice that scored Mark Trumbo. The bases remained loaded and Baltimore added two more when Hyun Soo Kim's single to right drove in Mancini and Schoop to cut the deficit to 5-4. Gonzalez got into another bases-loaded jam in the fifth and Castillo made him pay with a two-out grand slam to center as Baltimore seized an 8-5 lead.  He was working through some traffic a little bit and we were needing that out,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  Obviously nobody anticipated the big blow there. He wasn't able to get out of that inning without the damage, and he was done after that.  The Orioles added more against White Sox reliever Juan Minaya in the sixth inning. Adam Jones' single drove in J.J. Hardy, and Jones scored on Mancini's two-out hit to left for a 10-5 lead. Pinch hitter Alen Hanson hit his first career home run in the ninth, on a first pitch from reliever Mychal Givens, to make it 10-6. NOTES: The Orioles placed 1B Chris Davis on the 10-day disabled list following a right oblique injury suffered on Monday. ... Baltimore called up 1B/OF David Washington from Triple-A Norfolk on Wednesday. He was batting .291 with 10 home runs and 26 RBIs in the minors. ... Orioles RHP Chris Tillman (1-4, 8.01) hopes to break a four-game losing streak as he goes against White Sox LHP David Holmberg (1-0, 2.74 ERA) in Thursday's series ender. ... RHP James Shields is expected to return to the White Sox following rehab work and start Sunday in Toronto. He was 1-0 with a 1.62 ERA in three starts until he landed on the disabled list with a strained back muscle. ... Chicago embarks on a six-game trip that includes stops in Toronto and Minnesota before returning for three games against Oakland, June 23-25. ... The Orioles head back home to open a three-game interleague series on Friday against the St. Louis Cardinals.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKQBH70"},

World coal consumption dropped by 1.7 percent in 2016,  according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which was published on June 13. Consumption fell by 53 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe), which equates to about 79.5 million tonnes of hard coal on an energy basis, the review said. Global production of coal plunged 6.2 percent to 3,656 mtoe, or about 5.5 billion tonnes of hard coal, the review said, the largest annual drop on record. That's the good news for efforts to curb the use of the most-polluting major global energy source. The bad news is that 2017 may well see coal output and consumption increase from last year, and as usual with most things coal, it's all about China, which accounts for about half of global consumption. China is also the world's largest producer and importer of the fuel and while the authorities in Beijing have had success in reducing coal's share of the country's energy mix, so far this year is on track to see an increase in demand. This is largely because 2016 was somewhat exceptional in China from a coal perspective, with two factors combining to lower output and demand. The first was a policy driven move to restrict production by limiting the working days of domestic mines, which was aimed at boosting prices to ensure the viability of the industry as well as curbing air pollution. If anything the policy was too successful, resulting in a 9 percent drop in output in 2016 to 3.64 billion tonnes, the third consecutive annual decline. But rapid price gains and worries over a shortage of domestic coal prompted Beijing to reverse course, allowing mines to boost output in order to ensure adequate stocks and reduce reliance on imports, which surged 25.2 percent last year. China's coal production rose 12 percent in May to 297.8 million tonnes from the same month last year, according to official data released on Wednesday. For the first five months of the year, coal output is up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes, and a hot start to summer and low levels of inventories suggest that both domestic production and imports may rise in coming months. Weather to Boost Coal Use The weather was the other factor behind the decline in China's coal demand in 2016, with both a mild summer and winter curbing the need for electricity. If this summer does prove to be warmer than usual, it's likely that this alone will be enough to boost coal demand for the year. Imports are also still rising in China, with 111.7 million tonnes imported in the first five months of the year, up 29.6 percent from the same period in 2016. Rising imports will support coal production in China's main suppliers, Australia, Indonesia, Mongolia and Russia. If China's domestic coal output maintains the growth rate for the first five months of 2017 for the entire year, it implies production will rise by about 160 million tonnes from 2016. This is slightly less than half of what global coal output fell by in 2016, according to the BP review. It's also likely that coal output will gain in other countries, with India's state-owned producer targeting production of 660 million tonnes in the fiscal year from April 2017 to March 2018. If achieved, this would be an increase of 106 million tonnes from the 2016-17 fiscal year, but it's extremely unlikely Coal India will get anywhere near its target, if history is a guide. In 2016-17 the company fell 44 million tonnes short of its target, but still managed to produce some 25 million tonnes more than it did the prior year. Nonetheless, it's likely that India will increase output in the current year, and even an increase of the magnitude achieved in 2016-17 will add significantly to global production. Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal, is expected to boost output by nearly 5 percent in 2017, or about 20 million tonnes, to 460 million tonnes, according to the country's coal mining association. And if U.S. President Donald Trump has his way, coal output in the world's second-largest producer will rebound, although most analysts dismiss this as unrealistic. What is more likely is that coal output in the United States may stabilize, with higher production of coking coal used to make steel offsetting any declines in coal for power generation. Colombia, the world's fifth-largest coal exporter, plans to boost output by 4 million tonnes this year to around 95 million tonnes, a government official said on March 22. Another factor to consider with coal is price, and it's likely that part of the decline in consumption in 2016 was related to the strong rally over the year. The Asian benchmark weekly thermal coal price at Australia's Newcastle port more than doubled from the start of 2016 to the peak of $109.69 a tonne in November. It has since slipped back to $80.79 a tonne for the week ended June 9, with this decline improving the competitiveness of coal against other generating fuels, such as natural gas. Overall, with major coal producers planning to boost output this year, it's possible that 2017 will see an increase in production and consumption, or at least a sharp slowdown in the rate of decline.

South Korea's Iranian crude intake fell 18.7 percent in May from a year ago to 1.02 million tonnes, or 242,058 barrels per day (bpd), customs data showed on Thursday. That was the lowest since last October when Seoul imported 902,987 tonnes. South Korea's crude imports data includes an ultra-light oil known as condensate, but a breakdown is not available.  South Korean buyers purchased less condensate from Iran because of high prices and diversified condensate import sources,  said a spokesman at SK Innovation, owner of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy. South Korea imports condensate mainly from Iran and Qatar. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is exempt from that group's drive to curb oil supply to boost prices, pushing to regain market share lost during years of sanctions over its nuclear programme. But it has already used up oil stocks it had in floating storage - mostly made up of condensate - and it is now fighting to boost crude output to support export volumes. Iran's crude exports were set to fall to a 14-month low in May, a person with knowledge of Tehran's loading schedules told Reuters in April. South Korea, one of Iran's major Asian customers, took in 8.12 million tonnes of its crude, or 394,324 bpd, over the January-May period. That was up nearly 60 percent from 5.08 million tonnes at the same time last year. Meanwhile, South Korea's crude imports from Saudi Arabia rose in May even though the OPEC-led push to curb supply was last month extended until the end of next March. Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC. South Korea imported 4.23 million tonnes of crude oil, or 999,680 bpd, from the world's top crude exporter in May, up 18.6 percent from 3.56 million tonnes in April. Overall last month, the world's fifth-biggest crude importer shipped in 12.37 million tonnes of oil, or 2.93 million bpd, the data showed, steady with 12.43 million tonnes a year ago. In the first five months of 2017, South Korea imported 60.62 million tonnes of crude, or 2.94 million bpd, up 1.5 percent from 59.73 million tonnes over the same period in 2016. Final data for May crude oil imports by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) is due later this month.

S&P; mini futures dipped as much as 0.3 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.7 percent, led by resource shares. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.3 percent. European shares were expected to get off to a tentative start, with spread-betters looking at a flat open in Germany's DAX and a 0.1 percent fall in Britain's FTSE. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected on Wednesday and gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of bonds. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the process could start  relatively soon , while projections of the Fed board members also showed they expect one more rate hike by the end of year. A majority of Wall Street's top banks now expect the Fed to start reducing re-investment in bonds in September, compared to their previous median forecast of such a move in December. Yet the Fed's decision and confidence in continued U.S. economic growth was over-shadowed by surprisingly weak data released earlier in the day.  The Federal Reserve was a little bit more hawkish than market expectations. They are following up on their plan outlined in March even as inflation has fallen short of forecast for three months in a row,  said Tomoaki Shishido, senior economist at Nomura Securities. Consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April. Investors' inflation expectations gauged by the spread between the 10-year inflation-linked bonds and conventional bonds fell to 1.726 percent, completely wiping out its rise since the U.S. presidential election. Retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month - the largest fall since January 2016 and way below economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain - amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending. Risk sentiment was also hit by fear of more U.S. political turmoil after the Washington Post reported that Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice. Mueller is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump's legal team denounced the report. The news came just after the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, Steve Scalise, was shot by a gunman angry with Trump and other Republicans. Scalise was listed in critical condition. The weak U.S. data had knocked the dollar and U.S. bond yields to its lowest level in seven months against a basket of currencies. The dollar index  was little changed on Thursday after sliding to as low as 96.323 on Wednesday, having shed nearly 6 percent on the year, before bouncing back a tad on the Fed's policy tightening. The euro traded at $1.1220, after scaling a seven-month high of $1.1296. The dollar fetched 109.54 yen , not far from Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield had slipped to as low as 2.103 percent and last stood at 2.134 percent.  You cannot help the impression that there is a gap between the Fed's bullish inflation forecast and the weakness in actual data,  said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.  The Fed seems to think the weakness is temporary. But that view will be tested in coming months,  he added. Money market instruments such as Fed fund futures show market players see the likelihood of one more rate hike this year as less than 50 percent. Following the Fed's rate hike, China's central bank left interest rates for open market operations unchanged on Thursday, unlike in March when it lifted short-term interest rates in what economists said was a bid to stave off capital outflows and further depreciation pressure on the yuan. Analysts had been split on whether China would follow the Fed again, noting the yuan is in much better shape than a few months ago after authorities' recent moves to flush out depreciation bets against the currency. The yuan held stable in early trade, trading at 6.7854 per dollar in the offshore trade. The British pound stood little changed at $1.2746 ahead of the Bank of England's policy meeting that is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold. Crude oil prices were listless after having slumped nearly 4 percent to their lowest close in seven months on Wednesday, on an unexpected large build in gasoline inventories. Brent crude futures fetched $46.83 per barrel in late Asian trade, flat on the day but not far from a five-month low of $46.64 touched in early May. Many other commodity prices are also under pressure. Thomson Reuters CRB index tumbled to 14-month lows, having fallen almost 12 percent from this year's high hit in January.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not explain its rationale for keeping rates unchanged, after it followed a Fed hike within hours in March. But the yuan is on steadier footing now, while domestic liquidity conditions are similarly tight. Markets had been divided over whether the PBOC would raise short-term rates again in lockstep with the Fed, with those in the  hold  camp noting that China's short-term money rates and bond yields have already been trending higher. Traders pointed out that liquidity is traditionally tight in June, and memories are still fresh of a cash crunch in late June 2013 that sent money rates soaring and spooked global markets. Earlier on Thursday, the PBOC injected a net 90 billion yuan  ($13.25 billion) into the financial system, saying it wanted to counter  liquidity stress  from seasonal tax payments and maturing reverse repurchase agreements. Banks are also hoarding cash ahead of a rigorous quarterly inspection of their books by the central bank. The PBOC later said it was keeping the rate for seven-day reverse repos at 2.45 percent, the 14-day tenor at 2.60 percent and the 28-day tenor at 2.75 percent. Encouraged by improving economic growth, China had already nudged up short-term rates several times earlier this year as part of a broader push to reduce risks and leverage in the financial system after years of debt-fuelled stimulus. Those rate moves, while modest, were accompanied by  regulatory crackdowns on riskier forms of financing and shadow banking, which have tightened credit conditions and led to China's bond curve inverting in recent months. There have been no signs the PBOC is contemplating a bolder move in policy such as the Fed's, for fear it could hit economic growth. China's benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates have remained unchanged since October 2015. To be sure, a slew of data over the past week showed the economy has been largely resilient to tightening so far, with solid industrial output, retail sales and exports cushioning the impact of cooling investment. Still, if sustained, rising funding costs are expected to translate into higher borrowing costs eventually, dragging on business activity. Some companies are already reporting higher financing costs while banks are raising mortgage rates. Economists at BofA Merrill Lynch said in a note that they believe policymakers are unlikely to reverse their tightening bias as long as growth is likely to be stronger than the official full-year target of around 6.5 percent.  Game Changer?    One key game changer for China may have been a sharp reversal in market expectations for further depreciation in the yuan CNY=CFXS and capital outflows, after the PBOC moved aggressively in May to flush out speculative bets against the currency and allowed it to jump sharply against the dollar.  There've been a lot of pre-emptive moves by the PBOC and regulators to kind of more balance exchange rate expectations in recent months, and so I think really China had done a lot of preparation ahead of the FOMC rate hike that was widely anticipated anyway,  said Nomura economist Rob Subbaraman. The yuan is now up 2.3 percent so far in 2017, after tumbling 6.5 percent last year. While a narrower interest rate differential with the U.S. should pressure the yuan, it was little changed in spot trade on Thursday at 6.7939 per dollar by midday.  The market was stable. The (Fed) rate hike had already been priced in,  said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. Capital Flight Also Under Control? China's efforts to clamp down on capital outflows - a pressing concern earlier in the year - also appear to be holding up, with foreign exchange reserves rising more than expected in May. A more sluggish dollar has also helped take pressure off the yuan and outflows this year. One currency trader believed that China also refrained from raising rates on Thursday because it did not want to establish a pattern of following the Fed. But Deng Haiqing, chief economist at JZ Securities, said the decision was  debatable .  It was a good chance to fix the gap between the interest rates on the OMO and market rates,  Deng said. The one-year Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) SHICNY1YD= has climbed to two-year highs and is currently at 4.42 percent, above the PBOC's official lending rate of 4.35 percent. The weighted average for the 7-day reverse repo was at 2.7921 percent at 0230 GMT on Thursday - more than 30 basis points above the rate as fixed by the central bank. Some traders said earlier in the week that a short-term rate rise was still possible in July if liquidity tightness eased.

Some traders said earlier in the week that a short-term rate rise was still possible in July if liquidity tightness eased.

In lifting its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent and forecasting one more hike this year, the Fed seemed to largely brush off a recent run of mixed economic data. The U.S. central bank's rate-setting committee said the economy had continued to strengthen, job gains remained solid and indicated it viewed a recent softness in inflation as largely transitory. The Fed also gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. It expects to begin the normalization of its balance sheet this year, gradually ramping up the pace. The plan, which would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities, did not specify the overall size of the reduction.  What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference following the release of the Fed's policy statement. She added that the balance sheet normalization could be put into effect  relatively soon.  Related CoverageInstant View: Fed raises rates, gives details on balance sheet reductionFed poised to move on plan to gradually trim its bond holdingsThe initial cap for the reduction of the Fed's Treasuries holdings would be set at $6 billion per month, increasing by $6 billion increments every three months over a 12-month period until it reached $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, rising by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reached $20 billion per month. U.S. stocks edged lower and prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains after the Fed's policy statement. The dollar .DXY was largely flat against a basket of currencies after reversing earlier losses, while the price of gold fell.  The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they haven't slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities. Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen arrives for a news conference after the Fed releases its monetary policy decisions in Washington, U.S., June 14, 2017.Joshua RobertsEyes on Inflation The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis.  Fed policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts, which showed only temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years. Slideshow (6 Images)They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017, an increase from the previous projection in March. Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast. A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. But the Fed maintained its forecast for three rate hikes next year.  The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months. Yellen indicated the Fed still remained confident inflation would rise to its target over the medium term, bolstered by what she described as a robust labor market that is continuing to strengthen. The Fed's estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent, the current level, and to 4.2 percent in 2018, indicating the Fed believes the labor market will continue to tighten. The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate, which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy, was unchanged at 3.0 percent.

This programme will replace SCB's existing THB50 billion short-term debenture programme, which expires on 19 July 2017. Debentures issued under the programme will have a maturity of no more than 270 days and can be issued in separate tranches. Proceeds will be used for the bank's general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS The programme is rated at the same level as SCB's National Short-Term Rating of 'F1+(tha)', as the issuance under the programme will constitute the bank's direct unsubordinated and unsecured obligations. SCB's ratings reflect its extensive universal banking franchise, with a particular strength in retail banking. The operating environment remains negative for SCB's asset quality and performance, but is not expected to significantly impair the bank's capital and reserve coverage buffers. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change in SCB's National Short-Term Rating will affect the rating of the programme. SCB's National Short-Term Rating is already at the top end of the scale, hence there is no upside.

Note to Editors: Fitch's National ratings provide a relative measure of creditworthiness for rated entities in countries with relatively low international sovereign ratings and where there is demand for such ratings. The best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(tha)' for National ratings in Thailand. Specific letter grades are not therefore internationally comparable.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Hapag-Lloyd completed the merger with UASC last month, resulting in Qatar owning a 14 percent stake in the combined business and Saudi Arabia a 10 percent stake.  Since then, a dispute between Qatar and four Arab nations including Saudi Arabia has led to a break-off in diplomatic ties and transport disruptions.  The tie-up with UASC is going to plan,  Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said in an interview.  The blockade of Qatar (by neighboring countries) has so far not caused any significant problems in our business. Operationally speaking, everything is under control.  Business with Qatar's neighbors in the region was continuing as normal, he added. Habben Jansen confirmed the merger was on track to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2017, and that staff levels would be cut by 10 to 12 percent over the next 18 to 24 months. The merger had been delayed from the end of last year by some funding snags. Habben Jansen said the extra time had helped with a number of processes, such as reserving office space, which now allowed for a quicker execution of tasks. The merger is meant to generate synergies and help the combined shipping group, the world's fifth largest, weather a prolonged industry downturn, brought about by overcapacity, weak freight rates and high bunker fuel costs. Freight rates continued to recover in the second quarter but it was too early to say whether this would continue, Habben Jansen said, adding the picture might be clearer in early August when peak summer business could be better assessed. Bunker prices had stabilized around $300 a tonne, he said. Consolidation in the industry was likely to slow for a year or two after a recent wave of insolvencies, mergers and alliances, Habben Jansen said. But further out, there was a high likelihood of more consolidation among smaller players, he added.

He has put a major U.S. ally, Qatar, in a geopolitical crisis and damaged his cabinet’s efforts to calm regional tensions. Trump’s recent trip to the area was intended to bring together like-minded Arab states and Israel to hold the line against Iran. That effort has instead divided longstanding American allies.  Soon after Trump left the region, several Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, a key enabler of regional U.S. military operations. One of the primary reasons for this rebuke was Qatar's refusal to buy into the narrative that Iran must be isolated from its neighbors.  Qatar has reasons for taking a more pragmatic approach with Iran. The source of Qatari wealth is a shared gas field with its  neighbor. The North Dome field (“South Pars” to the Iranians) is the largest gas reservoir in the world. None of Qatar’s Arab neighbors’ economic fortunes are so deeply tied to their relationships with Iran.        By not leaving diplomatic space for Iran and its Arab neighbors to manage their differences, Trump has set the United States alongside the House of Saud on a collision course with Iran’s Shi’ite regime.  This is what the Obama administration tried to avoid (with little success) by concluding the nuclear deal with Tehran and trying to lighten Washington’s footprint in the Gulf.  It seems lost on Trump that other Arab states like Oman and Kuwait also have pragmatic working relationships with Tehran that could prove as useful to this administration as they did for President Obama, who was able to consult with the Sultan of Oman at the start of Washington’s nuclear negotiations with Iran.   MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Tim Weiner: How Comey's 'smoking gun' could kill the Trump presidency John Lloyd: Theresa May is right to stay. For now. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 21, 2017.Jonathan ErnstPeter Van Buren: Trump's silver lining in Iraq Trump’s “new” approach is a repackaging of an old idea: that isolating and chastising Iran will produce peace and security for Washington’s allies. And yet the Trump administration has promised to sell more military hardware to Saudi Arabia - a country that has exported the most intolerant form of Sunni Islam around the world. The state-sponsored hard-line Wahhabism promulgated from Riyadh has provided the ideological foundation for groups such as IS and al Qaeda.  The recent Islamic State attacks in Tehran have shown that Iran is also a target of the violence that has struck European cities like Paris, Manchester and London. But Trump seems to have little appetite for the nuances and subtleties that previous presidents struggle with as they formulate policy out of often-competing interests.  Slideshow (2 Images)More sophisticated weaponry from Washington will not make Tehran cower. It will have the opposite effect by pushing Tehran to accelerate its ballistic missile program while spending only a fraction of what U.S. allies do on defense. It also presents Russia and China with an opportunity to further fuel a regional arms race by selling armaments to Tehran.  Furthermore, Iran’s power extends beyond its borders to Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Tehran’s armed forces are tested and battle hardened. The Saudis, meanwhile, are still struggling to defeat Houthi rebels in Yemen after two years of airstrikes. It is no coincidence that four of the top five countries of origin for IS’s recruits are also Washington’s top Sunni-majority military partners in the Middle East. Trump seems oblivious to this when crafting his order to ban travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations.  Trump’s embrace of the Saudi narrative will also have terrible consequences for U.S. operations in Shia-led Iraq. It is no secret that Iranian-backed militias are on the ground fighting IS, nor that Tehran has great influence in Baghdad. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric could fracture this fragile coalition and further alienate Shi’ites in other parts of the Middle East.    The irony for Trump is that he needs Iran and its Arab neighbors to work together in finding holistic solutions for the sectarian wars that have enflamed the region. Washington can’t impose its will on Tehran without a military confrontation. Trump has promised to bring peace and security to Washington’s Arab partners and to put an end to the Arab/Israeli conflict. Antagonizing Iran and taking actions that embolden regional countries to isolate one another is a recipe for more chaos - not solutions.

Other Southeast Asian stock markets traded in a narrow range as soft U.S. economic data and a relatively hawkish Federal Reserve hurt investor sentiment.     The Fed raised interest rates as expected on Wednesday and gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of bonds.     However, the Fed's decision and confidence in continued U.S. economic growth was over-shadowed by surprisingly weak data released earlier in the day.     U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May while retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months.     In Asia, China's central bank left interest rates for open market operations unchanged on Thursday, shrugging off the Fed rate hike.     In the Philippines, real estate stocks accounted for more than one-third of the gains on the benchmark stock index.      The Philippine property sector is generally interest rate- sensitive,  said Jeffrey Lucero, an equity research analyst with RCBC Securities.      Since there were no surprises (in the Fed rate increase), property stocks are rebounding.      Vietnam shares hit a fresh nine-year high, rising as much as 0.3 percent, with index heavyweight Vingroup JSC  gaining 1.2 percent.      Malaysian shares touched a two-year high in early trade, gaining as much as 0.2 percent, with one-third of the gains concentrated in the financial sector.      CIMB Group Holdings Bhd gained 0.7 percent and Malayan Banking Bhd rose 0.3 percent.      Singapore shares fell 0.6 percent with the financial sector accounting for more than half of the losses.      United Overseas Bank Ltd and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd declined 1.6 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.

Yet for all the excitement it is generating within European Union institutions, opt-outs secured by major telecoms firms and member states' refusal to give up their lucrative national airwaves may leave many holidaymakers disappointed this summer - and facing higher bills at home. Ending the practice of adding hefty charges to surf the internet, call or send texts when abroad within the EU has been a cause celebre for the European Commission and Parliament which saw it as an affront to common market ideals.  The European Union is about bringing people together and making their lives easier. The end of roaming charges is a true European success story,  the institutions said on Wednesday. The Commission draped a victory banner down its Berlaymont headquarters reading  Goodbye roaming fees . The change in legislation finally passed several months ago was certainly welcomed by some visitors to Brussels.  I think it's excellent,  said Charlie Wild, a musician from Scotland.  I've been in Europe for two weeks spending three pounds ($3.80) a day to be able to use my phone, and tomorrow I don't have to, and it's great.  Julie DuBlanc, visiting from France for work, said,  We'll be checking our phones more often, as we would in Paris.  But she may need to be careful. The project has faced numerous setbacks as mobile phone operators have lobbied to maintain what has been a significant source of revenue while the realities of a fragmented telecoms market have confounded politicians' efforts to do away with the charges. The snag was that while customers can no longer by law be asked to pay extra when using phones abroad, operators still face wholesale fees from the foreign networks that connect them. A solution which involves capping wholesale charges has proved fiendishly complex since it means setting a cap that suits companies in all 28 member states, even though domestic mobile rates vary hugely. North vs South In northern Europe countries, which are effectively net exporters of tourists, there is concern that high wholesale fees being paid to networks in southern holiday destinations, combined with the loss of roaming revenue, could force firms to stop letting customers use their phones abroad at all. Alternatively, the companies in the north could raise charges at home to offset the losses, effectively forcing poorer, stay-at-home customers to subsidise travellers. In the tourist-magnet south, governments argued that low wholesale charges would hurt their local phone operators which play host to visitors, and force them to jack up rates for customers at home as well. The compromise struck pleased the larger operators but smaller firms said the wholesale roaming caps were still too high, and the effects are beginning to ripple out.  The regulated wholesale cost still remains relatively high comparative to usage,  said Phillip Malloch, vice-president and head of group public affairs at Swedish operator Telia. As a result, Telia will stop offering roaming as part of its Swedish data-only mobile broadband price plans, Malloch said. Operators in Scandinavia and the Baltics, including Telia in Estonia and Lithuania, have also applied for exemptions from the obligation to stop levying roaming charge - something EU rules allow if the companies face at least a 3 percent revenue hit. Some in the business were not impressed by the loopholes.  It's a real shame and disappointment that the incumbent operators, who fought against lower roaming charges so hard, are now abusing the system to over-charge their customers,  said an executive at a virtual network operator, or a company that offers network services using the networks of other providers. Credit Suisse analysts estimated in April that the introduction of roam-like-at-home was leading to increases in base tariffs to offset the lost revenue, which is expected to be between 2 percent and 5 percent across Europe. However, Malloch at Telia said it was too early to say who would be the winners and losers, as the end of roaming was likely to lead to higher data consumption as people lounging on the beach stop holding back from sharing their holiday snaps.  It definitely carries some opportunity also,  Malloch said.

Dana said on Tuesday it had received legal advice that its sukuk, or Islamic bonds, which mature in October, were not compliant with the Islamic sharia code and had become  unlawful  in the United Arab Emirates. The firm said it would halt payments and proposed that creditors exchange the sukuk for new Islamic instruments offering profit distributions less than half those of the existing sukuk. Worryingly for the Islamic finance industry, Dana said its sukuk were unlawful  due to the evolution and continual development of Islamic financial instruments and their interpretation . This has raised the prospect that other firms with Islamic debt could justify not honouring obligations by claiming sharia-based financial standards had changed since the debt was issued. It risks hurting a growing market. Issuance of longer-dated sukuk across core markets reached $40 billion in 2016, up from about $32 billion in 2015, Standard & Poor's said. In a conventional bond, the issuer pays bondholders interest and principal. Since interest is banned as  usury  in Islamic finance, sukuk holders are usually paid with returns from assets linked to the sukuk - in this case, Dana's gas assets. Dana has struggled to obtain payments from its production assets in Egypt and Iraq's Kurdistan. With a cash balance of just $298 million in March, it had been expected to have difficulty redeeming its sukuk in October. Nick Firoozye, a managing director at Nomura International in London, said Dana's case appeared to be the first time that a company under financial pressure had used uncertainty over sharia compliance in this way.  The possibility that companies could by whim choose to restructure un-compliant sukuk whenever there is some credit deterioration, based on their own newly strict interpretations, sets a terrible precedent,  he said. Mohammed Khnifer, a senior associate at Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank, said:  This specific sharia compliance risk is unprecedented. This incident has startled our Islamic finance industry.  Some holders of the Dana sukuk contacted by Reuters said they hoped a committee of creditors would resist Dana's action, on the grounds that the sukuk were declared valid when issued four years ago. One person with knowledge of the case said the mudaraba structure which Dana used for its sukuk, while once common, had been superseded in the industry by other structures such as ijara, an Islamic form of leasing. Mudaraba is a type of investment management partnership.  Dana is keen to engage constructively with sukuk holders to reach a consensual agreement,  the person said. Shifting Interpretations One characteristic of Islamic finance is that there is a wide range of opinions about what is sharia-compliant among the scholars who design instruments and advise investors what is permissible to buy. For example, an instrument commonly accepted in Malaysia might be viewed with suspicion by Gulf Arab issuers and investors. And views can change over time: a common practice called commodity murabaha has been increasingly criticised by scholars in the last few years. Prices of other corporate sukuk in the Gulf did not appear to react to Dana's announcement. But Firoozye, a specialist in structured and fixed income products, said several sukuk might eventually trade based on the possibility that their sharia-compliance could be questioned.  Sharia risk leading to an excuse for write-downs means sharia risk is now truly toxic,  he said. Investors could demand higher yields from corporate sukuk to compensate for the risk, and structuring sukuk to limit risk may become more time-consuming and expensive. Khnifer said investors might seek peace of mind by obtaining multiple fatwas, or religious rulings, from several banks endorsing a single sukuk. Dana has applied to a UAE court to have its sukuk declared invalid. Resolving the case could take many months. The firm said the first UAE court hearing would be on Dec. 25 and in the meantime it had obtained an injunction blocking claims on it. A source with direct knowledge of its position said Dana would argue its existing sukuk were invalid since the repurchase price was fixed in advance, while coupon payments were decided with an interest-based calculation and paid regardless of the firm's performance. If those arguments where applied elsewhere, almost all other publicly issued sukuk would be deemed non-compliant, said Khalid Howladar, managing director of Dubai-based Acreditus Advisors. He saw some similarities to a legal dispute in 2009 between Kuwait's The Investment Dar (TID) and Lebanon's Blom Bank. TID argued in an English court that an Islamic financial contract into which it had entered was void because it was not sharia-compliant in the first place. The court set aside that argument and viewed the transaction on its contractual terms. That case may be relevant for Dana because Dana's sukuk are governed by English law, while the gas production assets behind the sukuk fall under UAE law, according to its prospectus.  It remains to be seen whether applying sharia non-compliance as a legitimate restructuring driver is successful in this case,  said Howladar.  In TID's case it was not, and the industry was spared an unpleasant trial.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in May shipments were set to drop from June, particularly to the United States, as the top OPEC producer aims to limit supply to help balance the market. Exports in May, when the kingdom's total production was 9.880 million bpd, averaged below 7 million bpd, three industry and shipping sources told Reuters. Early indications suggest that remains the case this month, one of the sources said.  I'm only looking at the first week of June, and on the face of it there's not much change,  said Roy Mason of Oil Movements, a UK-based firm that estimates supply by tracking tanker shipments. Indicating lower Saudi exports, he said tanker movements suggested shipments to the United States were  less than would be seasonally normal.  Lower exports could help reduce bloated inventories in the United States, the world's largest and most transparent oil market. High stockpiles have weighed on crude prices. U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia were above 1 million bpd from May-August last year, according to U.S. government data. So far in June, Saudi exports to the United States were below 1 million bpd, according to shipping data and industry sources. Overall, Saudi exports are set to be lower than last year, when the kingdom shipped about 7.4 million bpd on average from May to August. This is partly because Saudi Arabia usually burns more crude in power stations at home in the summer months to meet extra demand for power as people rely on air conditioners to deal with temperatures that can reach 50 degrees Celsius. This year, Saudi Arabia is also leading OPEC and other producers in a pact to cut output, a deal initially due to run during the first half of 2017 and now extended until March 2018. Under the deal, the kingdom should not produce more than 10.058 million bpd until March. In the first five months of 2017, its output has been below that target. Industry sources with knowledge of Saudi crude exports data said state oil company Saudi Aramco aimed to cut its exports to the United Sates to below 1 million bpd in June and July. Aramco has raised its official selling oil prices (OSPs) for its crude to the United States for July, a move seen as discouraging a further buildup in U.S. oil inventories.  The high-price numbers prompted U.S. refiners to lower nominations,  one industry source said. The company has cut allocations in July to the United States by 35 percent and to Europe by 11 percent in July. Allocations to Asia were cut by some 300,000 bpd. Reuters shipping data also points to Saudi exports below 7 million bpd in the first two weeks of June, averaging 6.98 million bpd. Last year, Saudi Arabia burnt 700,000 bpd of crude to generate power in the peak summer months. That figure was expected to fall by about 100,000-120,000 bpd this year, as the kingdom uses more natural gas, one industry source said. Two sources said Saudi Arabia could draw from inventories to meet local and export requirements if needed. Saudi inventories rose to 267.854 million barrels in March from 264.704 million in February, according to official data. But the kingdom would still keep crude production and supply within its OPEC target, another source said.

The two are among nine gay and transgender couples planning to get hitched on the cruise heading to Japan in a week-long series of gay pride events in China, where same-sex marriage is illegal and homosexuality frowned upon. The Chinese ceremony is important to Liu because his parents only accepted his sexuality last year, although he has been out of the closet for almost two decades.  It's amazing to have my parents there as witnesses,  said Liu, who traveled to the ceremony on an overnight train from the southern province of Guangzhou.  Over all these years, I have been paving the way to acceptance bit by bit.   The event, held soon after Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage last month, underlines the limits of tolerance for gay rights in mainland China, even though it is growing. [nL3N1J45MX] It is not illegal to be gay in China, although homosexuality was regarded a mental disorder until 2001.  Many big cities now have growing gay scenes, but gay men and women still face family pressure to marry and have children. Bisexual and transgender men and women also face discrimination, although society has become more accepting. Passengers prepare to board a cruise ship at International Cruise Terminal Station in Shanghai, China June 14, 2017.Aly SongTen years ago, when most people were unfamiliar with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, romance was conducted underground as people could not openly seek out partners, Liu said.  Now it's completely different,  he added.  Many cities have lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community activities.  That does not rid such individuals of government oversight, however, although Beijing vacillates between indifference and intolerance.

[nL3N1IX294] Official and mainland Chinese media have adopted a cold attitude to Taiwan's legalization of gay marriage, in contrast to people commenting online, said Liu Hung-En, a law professor at National Chengchi University in Taiwan.  Mainland China is more cautious, it will adopt measures to avoid social conflict,  said Liu.  I believe this is a very serious consideration for officials - stability.  Still, gay clubs and bars are often left alone. [nL3N1J31QR] Many of those waiting on the dock to board the cruise liner  hoped China's tolerance would continue to grow.  Due to our courage to take a stand and progress now, I think gay marriage will be legal in 10 years,  said Liu.

The move by Jeddah-based Sedco, an Islamic firm managing $1.8 billion worth of Luxembourg-listed funds, could help develop green investing in the Middle East and make Islamic finance appeal to a wider client base. The two areas of investment share several characteristics, such as excluding investment in tobacco, alcohol and gambling. Green finance is increasingly important for Islamic firms seeking to differentiate themselves from peers, the Bahrain-based General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions said in a December report. Sedco, in a statement on Thursday, said its new strategy, dubbed Prudent Ethical Investing, would focus on due diligence and transparency around investment structures, while integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.  We want to expand our relationships globally and one of the most important elements is the awareness of responsible investing,  Chief Executive Officer Hasan Aljabri said in an interview ahead of the announcement.  For our Luxembourg funds we see some clients which are conventional gradually trickling in,  he said, referring to investors who do not traditionally put money into Islamic funds. The firm launched two ESG funds in 2012 and has published research which it said showed how a combined investment approach can outperform conventional funds. According to its research, such a strategy can lead to investments with lower financial leverage and better cash conversion qualities, adding a prudential element to those portfolios. Islamic fund managers have predominantly followed passive filters that exclude prohibited sectors, but ESG can encourage them to take a more active approach.  We are a lot more focused on energy efficiency, water preservation and management, and we are also looking into social factors like labour relations,  Aljabri said. In 2014, Sedco became the first Saudi asset manager and first fully sharia-compliant asset manager to become a signatory of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing.

The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday and forecast one more hike this year. The Saudi central bank responded by lifting its reverse repo rate, at which commercial banks deposit money with the central bank, by 25 bps to 1.25 percent but keeping its repo rate, used to lend money to banks, unchanged at 2.00 percent. This is expected to be net positive for Saudi banks' margins, though the move has largely been priced in. Kuwait's central bank decided to keep its discount rate flat, which may be modestly negative for banks there, while Qatar's central bank has not yet announced a response. Brent crude futures fell to a November low of $46.74 on Wednesday and are now trading a little above $47 a barrel. This may be the biggest factor for Gulf markets on Thursday, dragging petrochemicals in particular lower. Global equity markets in general are weak; S&P; mini futures are down 0.3 percent and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has dropped 0.7 percent.

Emaar, last at 7.90 dirhams, has been strong since it said it would spin off its local real estate unit and offer its shares to the public, giving the proceeds to its shareholders as a dividend.

As expected, the Fed hiked on Wednesday by 25 basis points to 1.0-1.25 percent, but did so against an inflation and consumer backdrop which casts grave doubt that it will actually be able to reach the 3 percent 'terminal' rate it sees as a future baseline. Arguing that recent shortfalls in inflation were “transitory,” the Fed kept to its forecast of one more 25-basis- point rate hike this year and three in 2018. This despite the fact the Fed hasn’t actually hit its 2 percent annual inflation target on its preferred measure in more than five years. The Fed also expects to carry on hiking rates, presumably in part in order to get some ammunition to expend when next the economy falters, while at the same time moving forward with plans to begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet “this year”. The financial markets aren’t having any of it, and are pricing in one more increase in the next year. Little wonder after today’s data, which should have given a data-dependent central bank good reason to pause. U.S. consumer price inflation in May fell 0.1 percent month-on-month while core, excluding food and energy, is up just 1.7 percent in a year, down from 1.9 percent a month ago. Core consumer sales also stalled in May, growing not at all. All of this makes the Fed’s forecasts, and the hawkish tone struck by Fed Chair Janet Yellen at the press conference, look as if they are, in part, seeking to signal confidence so as to achieve ends not justified by the data. “The Fed remains the test case for whether central banks can ever ‘normalize’ rates. We expect it to try, but fail - hiking the funds target just once or maybe twice more in future forecast-round months,” Neil Williams, Group Chief Economist, Hermes Investment Management, said after the hike. “With the lagged effects of previous hikes yet to come through - it takes an average 18 months before rate hikes affect consumer spending in full - delayed tax cuts, potential protectionism and cold winds elsewhere, this should mean a ‘peak’ rate under two percent.” Beyond the broader economic implications of a peak or, if you will, terminal rate below 2 percent, the prospect puts the Fed in the ticklish situation of very likely heading into a downturn dependent not just on interest rate rises but also on its willingness to begin buying assets once again. That and forward guidance, yet another largely discredited policy. Heading Lower Remember too, that one key difference since last the Fed hiked in March is that there is now much less confidence in the Trump administration’s ability to carry out either meaningful stimulative spending or midwifing a tax cut package which would do more than pump up equity prices. To be sure, the Fed is still saying that inflation will head back up toward its 2 percent target. But with core PCE up just 1.5 percent now, the Fed’s year-end forecast of 1.7 percent is still two tenths of a percent lower than in March. “The unemployment rate has dropped by half a point in the past four months, but the Fed now expects, comically, no further decline across the rest of the year. This makes no sense at all and likely will have to be revised in September,” Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients. The Fed also appears not to expect labor force participation to increase meaningfully. If so, unemployment, now 4.3 percent, could tick down from here. What is striking is that the unemployment rate is falling further below the rate at which the Fed figures unemployment should accelerate, but yet it accelerates not. Unemployment and inflation simply are not interacting as textbooks say they should. Markets are looking at the data and taking it seriously; the Fed is sticking, for now, with the textbooks. “One side has to blink, and given the Fed's 50-year obsession with the unemployment rate, it's unlikely to be Dr. Yellen,” Shepherdson wrote. If inflation finally comes through, the Fed will look like heroes; if not, like auto mechanics with the wrong set of tools and the wrong manual.

Mitch Haniger and Mike Zunino homered as the Seattle Mariners took an early five-run lead and held on for a 6-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday.  That's what good teams do  Haniger said.  Yesterday, I felt like we still swung the bats pretty well. They just got to our pitching. It's a new day and you've got to put it behind you.  Ben Gamel and Robinson Cano added three hits apiece for Seattle (33-34) while former Twin Danny Valencia drove in a run as the Mariners rebounded from allowing 28 hits Tuesday. Gamel added an outstanding catch of Joe Mauer's slicing drive down the left field line in the eighth as he hung on after crashing into the wall in foul territory.  Not much you can say about Ben Gamel,  Seattle manager Scott Servais said.  What a game. Awesome at the plate, the catch in the field against the wall, just going after it.  Eduardo Escobar, Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano homered for the Twins, who scored all their runs on homers. Haniger hit a two-run homer in the first off Ervin Santana and Zunino added a three-run shot with two outs in the third. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at TwinsSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch I had in the back of my mind with a runner in scoring position he could throw the slider,  Zunino said.  I was just looking for something he gave me thigh-high that I could handle and was able to get that first pitch and put a good swing on it.  It was Haniger's fifth homer of the season and the first since April 16 for the right fielder, who missed six weeks with an oblique injury. Zunino came up again with two out and nobody on in the fourth and Santana hit him with the first pitch. Zunino jawed at Santana on his way to first base and home plate umpire Greg Gibson warned both benches. Santana insisted he did not intend to hit Zunino.  That's not my game anyway,  Santana said.  I know he was diving the whole game and I just wanted to go inside so I hit him so that's it.  Valencia drove in the final run with a bases-loaded single in the sixth against Buddy Boshers. Minnesota cut the deficit to 6-4 when Sano followed Mauer's single by homering to left-center field. Sano's 16th homer of the season chased Seattle's Sam Gaviglio (3-1). Before Sano homered, Gaviglio baffled the Twins most of the night and the right-hander allowed four runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings.  He shut us down early, it looked like he was hitting his spots,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  He had us a little bit off in terms of off-speed, fastball combination.  Seattle's bullpen took over and shut out the hot-hitting Twins the rest of the way.  Great job by our bullpen tonight, against a team that's really been swinging the bat well,  Servais said.  Came in and shut them down there at the end.  Staked to the early lead, Gaviglio retired the first seven hitters without a ball leaving the infield until Byron Buxton doubled in the third. Buxton went 3-for-3 with a walk and stole his 11th and 12th bases of the season a day after sitting out Minnesota's record-setting 28-hit barrage on Tuesday.  He was able to put that ball in play his first at bat and sneak it down the line and then he got another off-speed pitch that he hit out,  Molitor said.  He's working very diligently on trying to get his game on track.  offensively and we're seeing a little bit of signs from time to time. After throwing just 91 pitches in a complete-game shutout at San Francisco last week, Santana allowed five runs and a season-high nine hits in five innings.  I think Ervin will tell you he had to battle tonight and probably didn't have as good of a feel for his slider as he did his last game out,  Molitor said. The Twins threatened in the late innings but Edwin Diaz struck out Kennys Vargas to end the eighth with two on and closed out his 11th save by retiring Brian Dozier with runners at second and third. NOTES: Seattle RHP Chase De Jong was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma before Wednesday's game. De Jong replaces right-hander Casey Lawrence, who was optioned to Tacoma after giving up six earned runs on 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings (63 pitches) in Tuesday's 20-7 loss to the Twins. ... Twins LHP Hector Santiago, on the 10-day disabled list with shoulder soreness since June 7, played long toss from a distance of 200 feet on Tuesday and will throw a bullpen session on Thursday before being re-evaluated. ... Mariners SS Jean Segura (ankle), who was batting .341 before going on the disabled list, did some running and agility work at Target Field on Wednesday afternoon and participated in on-field batting practice with the team prior to the game.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKL6H52"},

Left fielder Derek Fisher homered and reached base four times in his debut while right-hander Francis Martes excelled in his first career start as the Houston Astros cruised to a 13-2 victory over the Texas Rangers at Minute Maid Park. Fisher ignited a nine-run sixth inning with a leadoff home run off Rangers reliever Jeremy Jeffress for his first career hit. Center fielder Jake Marisnick followed with his seventh homer as the ensuing six batters reached base for the Astros (45-22), two against Jeffress and four against right-hander Tony Barnette. Fisher added an RBI single later in the sixth and scored ahead of Marisnick when George Springer lined a two-run double to right-center field off righty Dillon Gee. The Astros sent 13 batters to the plate in the inning to salvage the series finale. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at AstrosTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchBatting seventh, Fisher finished 2-for-3 with two walks and two RBIs. Astros second baseman Jose Altuve was 3-for-3 with two doubles and three runs scored.  Something you can dream of,  Fisher said.  I can't say that I would expect to have something like that my first night. But definitely happy that it happened.  Every Astros starter reached base, with Carlos Beltran chasing Rangers starter Andrew Cashner (3-6) with an RBI single in the fifth inning for a 4-1 Houston lead.  They put together some good at-bats, and that's a good hitting team,  said Cashner, who allowed four runs on 10 hits and one walk with four strikeouts over four-plus innings.  But for me, most of the balls they hit in play was just a lack of execution.  Martes followed his shaky debut against the Los Angeles Angels on June 9 with a steely performance. He retired the Rangers in order in the first and second innings and sandwiched two strikeouts around a Jurickson Profar single in the third. In fact, Martes wasn't truly challenged until the fifth inning, when he loaded the bases with no outs and the Astros leading 2-0. He allowed just one run after that mess, and that came on a wild pitch that scored Jonathan Lucroy. Martes induced an infield popup from Shin-Soo Choo for the second out and, with the bases still full, got a called third strike on Nomar Mazara to cap his night.  In the situation we were in, to be able to strike out those hitters was really emotional for me,  Martes said.  I was a little bit nervous in the first outing, but tonight, I was more comfortable, I accepted my pitches and threw strikes. That was the biggest difference between the last outing and tonight.  Martes allowed one run, three hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. Texas (32-33) had its five-game winning streak snapped.  Look, it was a 5-1 road trip that didn't quite end the way we wanted it to, but I think we still got some good momentum going home,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  We found an identity in how we play and how we grind it out. When you talk about momentum, it's about how you play, the attitude by which you play, how you attack, how your starters approach the game, and I thought we did a good job this road trip.  NOTES: The Astros placed OF Josh Reddick on the seven-day concussion disabled list and selected OF Derek Fisher to the major league roster. Reddick was concussed Monday night running into the wall in right field. Fisher, the Astros' fourth-ranked prospect and 37th overall selection in the 2014 draft, posted a slash line of .335/.401/.608 with 16 home runs and 45 RBIs in 60 games with Triple-A Fresno. ...

Ross, who signed as a free agent on Jan. 19, had been sidelined after undergoing offseason thoracic outlet syndrome surgery. ...

British projects and businesses can currently bid for financing from the European Investment Bank, which has provided around 48 billion euros for transport, energy, housing and water investments across the country. Similarly, start-ups in sectors such as tech and life sciences can draw on support from the European Investment Fund.  With Britain due to begin its divorce talks with the EU next week, Finance Minister Philip Hammond will on Thursday set out how the government intends to provide its own support for projects that, for example, run beyond the 2019 deadline when Britain leaves the bloc.  The role of the EIB in Britain will also be complicated by the fact that London will need to review EU legislation as part of the Brexit process, including the laws that cement the EIB's role in the country. Hammond will tell an annual gathering of London's financial elite on Thursday evening that the British government is in talks with the EIB and is committed to providing the necessary assurances to ensure continued access to funding, according to a statement released ahead of the speech.  He will say the British Business Bank will extend the limits in its current venture capital investment program and a UK Guarantee Scheme will offer new types of support, including construction guarantees, for major projects.   Investors need certainty in order to continue to support the UK economy and create jobs as we leave the EU,  Hammond will say.  That is why we will fortify the vital financial support that helps businesses to grow - from cutting-edge start-ups right through to large-scale infrastructure projects.

Enrique Hernandez's pinch-hit home run off Andrew Miller ignited a four-run eighth-inning rally as the Los Angeles Dodgers extended their winning streak to six games with a 6-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday night at Progressive Field. It was the second consecutive game the Dodgers hit a home run in the eighth inning off Miller (3-2), who prior to facing the Dodgers had not allowed a home run all year. Cody Bellinger homered off Miller in the Dodgers' 7-5 victory Tuesday.  Miller is one of the best in baseball,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  To do it to him last night, then again tonight. That was big for us, against a really good pitcher.  Dodgers reliever Josh Fields (3-0), who blew a save by giving up a game-tying home run to Jose Ramirez in the seventh inning, got the win. Kenley Jansen pitched the ninth to pick up his 13th save. Cleveland has the top bullpen in the American League, with a 2.56 ERA, while the Dodgers (2.78) lead National League relief corps.  I was really looking forward to watching these two bullpens go at one another, but the offenses have had their way with them,  Roberts said. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at IndiansLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchWith the score tied at 2-2, Miller, in relief of starter Corey Kluber, retired the first batter of the eighth inning. But the right-handed Hernandez, pinch-hitting for Chase Utley, hit a 1-2 pitch over the right-field wall for his sixth home run.  I was looking for his slider, but he threw me a fastball. I took an emergency swing, and fortunately the ball went out,  Hernandez said.  When I threw the pitch and saw the swing, I thought I'd be fine,  Miller said.  A home run never crossed my mind. Obviously I misread the swing. It was just a bad pitch.  Corey Seager followed with an infield single, and the next two hitters, Justin Turner and Bellinger, drew walks to load the bases. Cleveland appeared to get out of the inning when Yasmani Grandal grounded to shortstop Francisco Lindor, who started an apparent 6-4-3 inning-ending double play. But the Dodgers challenged the call, saying Erik Gonzalez did not have his foot on second base when he took the throw from Lindor. After a short video review, the call was overturned. Seager scored on the play, and there were runners at second and third.  We saw (Gonzalez) come off the bag. It was pretty obvious,  Roberts said.  Obviously a huge play. I was actually surprised they called him out in the first place,  Indians manager Terry Francona said. Instead of the inning being over, Zach McAllister relieved Miller and gave up a two-run single to Chris Taylor. In the two appearances against the Dodgers, Miller's ERA has gone from 0.29 to 1.60.  He's human,  Francona said.  He's been so good, so incredibly good, that when he gives up a run it's shocking to people.  Cleveland's last two runs came in the eighth inning, on a double by Michael Brantley and single by Edwin Encarnacion. Trailing 2-0, the Indians scored a run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Brantley and tied it in the seventh on Ramirez's home run. Dodgers starter Brandon McCarthy pitched 5 1/3 innings, giving up one run on three hits, with two walks and no strikeouts.  I was lucky to get that far. I threw like 10 pitches all night that worked,  McCarthy said. Indians starter Kluber pitched seven innings, allowing two runs on four hits, with 10 strikeouts and one walk. NOTES: Indians manager Terry Francona was back in the dugout Wednesday night after leaving Tuesday's game in the eighth inning because he was feeling light-headed and his heart rate was up. Francona was taken by ambulance to the Cleveland Clinic, where he underwent a battery of tests.  It scared me a little bit, but everything checked out. They think I was dehydrated,  Francona said. ... RHP Josh Tomlin, who will start Thursday for Cleveland, is averaging a major-league-best 0.5 walks per nine innings (four walks in 66 innings). ... Indians 2B Jason Kipnis was a late scratch from the starting lineup because of neck spasms. He was replaced by INF Erik Gonzalez. ... Dodgers OF Yasiel Puig has been suspended for one game and fined an undisclosed amount by Major League Baseball for making obscene gestures toward fans at Progressive Field after hitting a home run in the second inning Tuesday. Puig is appealing the suspension and is eligible to continue playing. ... Dodgers LHP Rich Hill, who made 63 relief appearances for Cleveland in 2013, will make his first career start vs. Cleveland on Thursday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-indians-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKLOS5L"},

Kelimbetov told reporters the Central Asian nation planned to choose an option under which the IBA debt it holds would be exchanged one-on-one for 15-year Azerbaijan sovereign Eurobonds paying 3.5 percent.  According to preliminary information, the voting (by creditors) will be called either today or tomorrow and take place before mid-July,  he said. Kazakhstan's central bank acquired 10-year bonds issued by the International Bank of Azerbaijan via private placement for its pension fund in 2014, when Kelimbetov was the chairman of the central bank. But IBA's plan to restructure $3.3 billion of debt, including the chunk held by Kazakhstan, has sparked anger and led Kazakh authorities to launch an investigation into the purchase . Kazakhstan is a close political ally of its ex-Soviet peer Azerbaijan and a source told Reuters that representatives of the central bank had been in touch with the IBA, but the Azeri side gave Astana no special treatment. The notes held by the Kazakh pension fund would put it in the category of IBA creditors who are required to swap their holdings for longer-dated paper or take a writedown.

Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index dropped 1.1 percent to 25,601.68 points by the lunch break, touching the lowest level since May 29. Still, the gauge is up 16 percent this year. Selling was more intense in mainland companies. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 1.5 percent, to 10,362.12, on track for its biggest loss in six weeks. Hong Kong's central bank raised its base rate 25 basis points earlier in the day after the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted its policy rate as expected overnight. Hong Kong rates move in line with the U.S. due to the city's currency peg. The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Norman Chan, said he expects banks in the territory to gradually raise mortgage rates, which could hit shares of property developers. China shares, which are less vulnerable to global capital flows, also weakened, amid signs that Beijing's deleveraging campaign has made some progress in reducing liquidity in the financial system. Tighter credit conditions, in turn, are expected to drag on economic activity in coming months. The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.4 percent to 3,519.68 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1 percent to 3,127.19. Although the Federal Reserve's rate rise was expected, Chair Janet Yellen's more-detailed plans to reduce the Fed's balance sheet was viewed by some as negative to equities in Asia. The move would  reduce market liquidity over the long term and could impact the performance of equities and other assets,  China Investment Securities (HK) wrote in a report on Thursday. Echoing such a view, the HKMA's Chan said he expects there could be an increase in capital outflows from the financial hub due to arbitrage trade with the local currency. Although China on Thursday didn't follow the Fed in raising rates, as it did with short-term rates in March, analysts pointed out that borrowing costs in the country's interbank market have already risen sharply this year, as money supply in May grew at the slowest annual rate in over 20 years.  We're seeing more equity supplies but less liquidity, so China's stock market will likely remain sluggish,  said Wei Jianfei, analyst at Lianchu Securities. Traders say the market is also worried that profit growth at listed Chinese firms could stagnate. Data this week showed that China's economy generally remained on solid footing in May, but tighter monetary policy, a cooling housing market and slowing investment reinforced views that it will gradually lose momentum in coming months. Most sectors fell in both China and Hong Kong, with the decline in Hong Kong led by the real estate sector, which is vulnerable to higher borrowing costs.

British projects and businesses can currently bid for financing from the European Investment Bank, which has provided around 48 billion euros for transport, energy, housing and water investments across the country. Similarly, start-ups in sectors such as tech and life sciences can draw on support from the European Investment Fund.  With Britain due to begin its divorce talks with the EU next week, Finance Minister Philip Hammond will on Thursday set out how the government intends to provide its own support for projects that, for example, run beyond the 2019 deadline when Britain leaves the bloc.  The role of the EIB in Britain will also be complicated by the fact that London will need to review EU legislation as part of the Brexit process, including the laws that cement the EIB's role in the country. Hammond will tell an annual gathering of London's financial elite on Thursday evening that the British government is in talks with the EIB and is committed to providing the necessary assurances to ensure continued access to funding, according to a statement released ahead of the speech.  He will say the British Business Bank will extend the limits in its current venture capital investment program and a UK Guarantee Scheme will offer new types of support, including construction guarantees, for major projects.   Investors need certainty in order to continue to support the UK economy and create jobs as we leave the EU,  Hammond will say.  That is why we will fortify the vital financial support that helps businesses to grow - from cutting-edge start-ups right through to large-scale infrastructure projects.

Yet former British Open champion Justin Leonard thinks the run of six successive first-time major winners is set to end at the hands of one of the big hitters.  I think the guys that hit it a long ways and keep it in play for the most part are going to be at an advantage,  Leonard told Reuters on the eve of Thursday's opening round.  I’m in that Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Adam Scott kind of area.  Guys that drive the ball a very long ways and hit it pretty straight.  The sprawling, 7,741-yard course, the longest ever to host a U.S. Open, has been softened by rain this week. If Leonard's crystal ball is accurate, the string of new major champions will end, following breakthrough wins by Sergio Garcia (2017 Masters), Jimmy Walker (2016 PGA), Henrik Stenson (2016 British Open), Johnson (2016 U.S. Open), Danny Willett (2016 Masters) and Day (2015 PGA). Asked who was best placed to keep that streak alive, Leonard nominated world number nine Rickie Fowler.  I think that the next guy that’s probably due is Rickie Fowler, just because of the talent level and the fact that three years ago he finished top five in all four majors,  said Leonard, the 1997 British Open winner at Royal Troon and now a commentator on Golf Channel.  His game is showing that kind of maturity.  Leonard said emerging young players Hideki Matsuyama of Japan and Jon Rahm of Spain, seeking their first major, had the talent to win but their lack of experience might let them down. He felt the USGA was already a winner, however, for choosing Erin Hills as a first-time major venue.  I think it's great. I think it presents lots of different challenges. I like that it keeps the driver in the players' hands,  he added.  You can say it is not a classic U.S. Open course.  But credit the USGA (U.S. Golf Association) for going outside the box a little bit for the next great venues in the United States.

San Diego Padres third base coach Glenn Hoffman immediately trotted toward home plate to have a word with the 22-year-old rookie center fielder from the Dominican Republic. Rough translation of their conversation:  Franchy, no.   On Franchy's behalf, he's selfless,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  But we don't want him bunting there.  So Franchy swung and pulled a single to right, driving home the tie-breaking run to lead the Padres to a 4-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds and a sweep of a three-game series.  That kid has hurt us,  Reds manager Bryan Price said. Ya think? Related CoveragePreview: Reds at PadresCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchIn the three-game series, Cordero went 7-for-14 with a double, his first three major league homers, five RBIs and five runs scored. For good measure, he chased down some long drives in center.  It's a good trend, three straight game-winning hits,  Green said of Cordero, who is hitting .339 since being promoted from Triple-A El Paso on May 27 to sub for injured center fielder Manuel Margot, who some viewed as a Rookie of the Year candidate. Cordero was one of three Padres standouts Wednesday as they ran their record against the Reds to 19-9 over the past four seasons. Cincinnati lost a ninth straight road game overall. Padres right-handed starter Jhoulys Chacin improved to 6-5, allowing two runs on solo homers by Jose Peraza and Joey Votto. He allowed only three other hits and a walk with four strikeouts in seven innings. Chacin is now 4-1 in seven starts at Petco Park this season with a 1.72 earned-run average. Hunter Renfroe snapped out of an 0-for-18 drought with a game-tying, two-run homer in the sixth and a run-scoring ground out in the seventh after Cordero's go-ahead single.  Chacin early didn't quite have his stuff,  Green said. Evidence was Peraza's homer. Part of the Padres success in the first two games of the series was keeping swift Reds lead-off hitter Billy Hamilton off base in eight of his 10 plate appearances. With Hamilton taking Wednesday off to rest a sore thumb, Peraza -- who was giving Zack Cozart a break at short -- moved into the lead-off slot and homered on the third pitch offered by Chacin. Peraza's homer traveled 388 feet into the left field stands and was the first game-opening homer of Peraza's career and the Reds' first of the season. Votto made it 2-0 with his 19th homer of the season leading off the fourth. His 407-foot drive to right-center barely cleared Renfroe's leap at the fence.  I got more aggressive after the first,  Chacin saud.  And my slider was good today. What I needed was what Renfroe delivered.  Reds' starter Amir Garrett entered the sixth working on a five-hit shutout. But Yangervis Solarte opened the inning with a single to left and Renfroe lined a 429-foot drive to left that banged off the railing at the top of the second deck. The home run was Renfroe's 14th of the season, tying him with Nate Colbert (1969) for the most homers in the first half of a season by a Padres' rookie. Garrett allowed two runs on seven hits and two walks with eight strikeouts over six innings.  I felt this was a step forward,  said Garrett (3-6, 6.91 ERA).  I was able to locate all my pitches. I'm back to my normal self. I made a mistake to Renfroe, but stuff like that happens. But to do what I did today and what I did at the beginning of the season, I can pitch with the best of them.   It's a big step, a necessary step,  Price said of Garrett's performance. But as soon as Garrett departed, the Padres were threatening Lorenzen. Pinch-hitter Matt Szczur and Jose Pirela opened the seventh by drawing back-to-back walks off the right-handed Lorenzen. Cordero then pulled a single to right to score Szczur. With one-out, Lorenzen intentionally walked Solarte to load the bases. Renfroe hit a high chop back to the mound that ticked off Lorenzen's glove to ruin a chance for an inning-ending double play and scoring the final run Earlier, the Padres had a tying run cut down at the plate. Erick Aybar singled in the second and tried to score from first on a double to left center by catcher Luis Torrens. But Aybar was thrown out at the plate on a perfect relay from center fielder Arismendy Alcantara to shortstop Peraza to catcher Tucker Barnhart. NOTES: The Padres are 19-9 against the Reds at Petco Park since 2012 . . . Both teams are off Thursday . . . The Reds rested CF Billy Hamilton Tuesday due to a sore thumb, and SS Zack Cosart was out of the starting lineup for a second straight game as he rested a sore quad muscle . . . Padres' starting RHP Trevor Cahill, who has been on the disabled list since May 14 with right shoulder inflammation, felt good after a bullpen session Tuesday and will travel with the Padres to Milwaukee and Chicago. Cahill is expected to face hitters in Milwaukee and begin a rehab assignment before the Padres return home June 23 . . . RHP Jered Weaver, who has been on the disabled list since May 20 with a left hip injury, will also join the Padres on the trip and throw bullpens.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED6EK6IFDP"},

Google has been locked in a months-long dispute over allegations by Indonesia's government that the search giant had not made enough annual payments. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday that Indonesia had now reached a tax deal with Google for 2016. She declined to disclose the settlement sum. The search giant's dispute with Indonesia has been seen as a bellwether of how the government of the country with the world's fourth-largest population may pursue other technology companies such as Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) for taxes.  On the solution for future taxes, they (Google Asia Pacific) have agreed with the government,  said Rudiantara, Indonesian Minister of Communications and Information, who has oversight on internet-based companies operating in the country. This may be subject to a change in Indonesia's regulation for the advertising business, which has been proposed by the communications ministry, said Rudiantara, who goes by one name.  The ministry will work with Indonesia's investment coordinating board on the regulation, he added. Rudiantara declined to comment on whether Google had reached an agreement with Indonesia on its taxes for previous years. Indonesian tax officials have alleged that most of Google's revenue generated in the country is booked at its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore and its local entity, PT Google Indonesia, simply acts as a sales service provider. Under a new agreement, Google's Indonesian entity will receive the revenue and pay expenses for its business in the country, said a senior government source, who declined to be identified as the information was not public. A sticker reading 'Review us on Google' is pictured at a food stall in Jakarta, Indonesia June 15, 2017.Agoes RudiantoIt is unclear if Google will set up a new domestic unit that is separate from PT Google Indonesia.  Google did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Indonesia's tax office declined to comment. Smaller Than Mooted A senior tax official had said in September that Indonesia planned to pursue Google for five years of back taxes and the company could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it were found to have avoided payments. Indonesian tax officials had estimated that the total advertising revenue for the industry in Indonesia was around $830 million, with Google and Facebook accounting for around 70 percent of that. But Google had pointed to a joint study by the firm and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia's digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015. The overall tax settlement amount will reflect the fact that Google's Indonesia revenues are  much smaller than the bombastic figures that Ministry of Finance officials have been mooting , the senior government source said. Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last year, Google agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($165.7 million) in back taxes to settle a probe by Britain's tax authority, while Thailand is studying plans to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms.

Left unchecked, Toshiba would pursue a course that clearly violates these rights,  he added. Western Digital has filed its suit with the Superior Court of California, seeking an injunction until its arbitration case against Toshiba is heard. It is concerned about how Toshiba, the Japanese government and other stakeholders are handling the auction process, a second source said. The second source added it had submitted a revised bid on Wednesday that satisfies Toshiba's requests on deal certainty and price but did not receive a favourable response. Toshiba has demanded at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations concerning the auction. Toshiba said in a statement that it was proceeding with selecting a preferred bidder for its memory unit by the second half of June as planned and hoped to reach a definitive agreement on a sale by June 28. Toshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Satoru Oyama, senior principal analyst at research firm IHS, said Western Digital's argument made sense from a common-sense point of view and that developments were moving towards a worst-case scenario for the Japanese company.  Toshiba has more to lose in the dispute because it is running out of time,  he said.  Toshiba and Western Digital eventually have to talk. They cannot afford to keep fighting when Samsung is taking advantage of the NAND market boom and investing massively.  A third source familiar with the matter said Western Digital expects to get a ruling on its injunction request by mid-July and that arbitration cases generally take 16-24 months to resolve. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the centre of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. It has been in talks with Bain Capital and the group now includes South Korea's SK Hynix Inc, sources have said. INCJ was, however, also part of a proposed bid tabled by Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP, other sources familiar with the matter have said. Other bidders include Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest known bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said.

The finance ministry said on Tuesday it will issue 14 billion yuan ($2.06 billion) of treasury bonds denominated in yuan, and $2 billion in dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. IFR said it would be China's first dollar bond offering since October 2004. The ministry said the treasury bonds will be issued in Hong Kong in two separate tranches of 7 billion yuan each. The first will be issued by June 30, and the other in the second half of this year. China has sold yuan denominated bonds over the last few years as part of efforts to internationalise its currency.

The Muslim holy month, due to end in late June, is half over, and how much shopping Indonesians do during Ramadan is regarded as a reliable sign of the mood in an economy where private consumption accounts for 57 percent of gross domestic product.  I will be shopping more this year because I've just got a job,  said 24-year-old Dwi Kurnia Putri, before entering the shop at the Gandaria City Mall, in the south of the capital.   In the future, it looks like everything will turn out better ... but it will depend on how well I manage my money,  joked Putri, who now works for an electricity company. The central bank will hope that her optimism is infectious, as policymakers think consumer spending could lift economic growth closer to 5.3 percent this year, having dawdled at 5 percent or below in recent years.  We are confident ... the next leg of economic growth will come from consumption,   Dody Budi Waluyo, head of the economic and monetary policy department at Bank Indonesia, told Reuters. Looking Up There are several signs that the outlook is brightening for  Asia's third largest consumer market and the world's largest Muslim population. A survey by Bank Indonesia showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest since 2000.  Prices for commodities vital to the Indonesian economy, have stabilized, as has the rupiah currency IDR=.  Loan growth IDLONY=ECI has topped 9 percent, and unemployment has fallen steadily. Export growth IDEXG=ECI is expected to surpass 15 percent in May, boding well for the large workforce employed by that sector.  Central bank surveys also show companies have begun hiring more, and increasing their marketing budgets, while a sovereign credit rating upgrade awarded by Standard & Poor's last month has encouraged firms to raise more debt. The political mood in the capital, which accounts for a fifth of the archipelago nation's economy, has also recovered, after a religiously-charged election campaign for the Jakarta governorship that saw a hardline Islamist movement lead mass protests against an incumbent Christian governor who went on to lose the vote.  The feel-good factor is evident in places far beyond the capital as well, with the BI survey showing the outlook among consumers has improved particularly in commodity-reliant regions such as Sumatra and Sulawesi, probably reflecting a recovery in prices for palm oil and coal. A customer holds a shirt during late night Ramadan shopping at Gandaria City Mall in Jakarta, Indonesia, June 10, 2017.Beawiharta The commodity crisis is kind of done ... and the economy  is showing a smart recovery, so I would expect that the growth rate in consumption to rise in the second half,  said Ali Potia, international consulting firm McKinsey's Singapore-based leader for consumer practices in Southeast Asia.  The expectation in the retail sector is that this (Ramadan) is going to be busier than they've seen in a very long time.  Buying new clothes during Ramadan, and eating out to break fast with friends and family are part of Indonesian culture. Workers in the big cities look forward to returning to their kampungs, or villages, laden with bags full of gifts for the family. If they go home with few presents for the Eid festival at the end of the fasting month, it would be a sign of hard times.  Slideshow (6 Images)Vat Revenues Improving Jakarta's malls organize their sales on different weekends from each other, recognizing that the city's notoriously awful traffic makes it difficult for shoppers to get around. And, Stefanus Ridwan, the president director of PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk, a property company that operates Gandaria City mall, said the results of last Saturday's midnight sale were  good  and the shopping center was  more crowded , compared to last year.  Private consumption growth on a year-on-year basis has been 5 percent or less for every quarter during the past two years, lagging economic growth, and was only 4.9 percent in the first quarter of this year.  But, motorbike sales in May were up 15 percent, the highest growth since 2014, while April car sales showed growth running at 6 percent.  Certainly, revenues from value-added tax have improved, Suahasil Nazara, head of the finance ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters.    The other day I talked to retailers ... and they feel that they started to sense the pick up began in May,  he said.  Without getting carried away, retailers reckon a recovery has begun.  Fetty Kwartati, corporate secretary of PT Mitra Adiperkasa (MAPI.JK), which oversees brands such as Zara and Starbucks,  expects the company to show 13 percent sales growth this year, but she is  cautious  about the outlook.  The worst is over,  Kwartati said.

The cuts come as Bank of America is aiming to cut costs to boost financial targets Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has set.      Although Bank of America is also hiring, the employees that it is trying to reduce cost more than those who are joining, Moynihan said at a conference last month. The bank has also been cutting costs by shuttering data centers and moving information to less costly systems run by technology firms. For any large bank, technology and operations costs run high. Old systems are reliable but dated, while new ones are expensive to develop. Separately, at a conference on Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said the global banking and markets unit has roughly 1,300 applications that cost about $1.3 billion to maintain and run. As the bank sorts through those platforms and decides which to eliminate, some jobs will be lost, said spokesman Dan Frahm.

They persevere,  Colorado manager Bud Black said of his club.  They stay at it. There's sort of a quiet tenacity to our group.  The Rockies managed to leave town still in a virtual tie for first place in the Nationa League West thanks to five effective innings from rookie right-hander German Marquez, some clutch bullpen work and an Ian Desmond home run. An unlikely source also provided a spark. Speedy rookie Raimel Tapia, who was 2-for-19 coming in, started in place of slumping outfielder Carlos Gonzalez and had four hits -- two infield -- and scored three runs. Marquez (5-3), who threw 80 pitches in three innings against the Cubs on Friday in his previous start, needed 26 pitches to get through the first inning, but the Pirates failed to score. Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at PiratesColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchHe said he wasn't having any flashbacks.  I just knew I needed to maintain my aggressiveness and continue my plan of attacking the hitters,  he said. Desmond led off the second with a solo home run off Pirates right-hander Chad Kuhl and Marquez breezed through the next three innings on 28 pitches. Kuhl (1-6) walked Desmond leading off the fifth and Tapia followed with an infield single. Trevor Story's single made it 2-0. After a fielder's choice put runners at first and third, first baseman Josh Bell misplayed Marquez's bunt, which was ruled a sacrifice, and Tapia scored to make it 3-0.  He got a good jump and Bell had to make a quick play and just bobbled it, because of (Tapia's) speed,  Black said. Andrew McCutchen singled with one out in the Pirates' fifth. Marquez then hit Francisco Cervelli on the left shoulder. Cervelli, in his first game after coming off the seven-day concussion disabled list, had some words with Marquez and catcher Tony Wolters, and within seconds both dugouts and bullpens emptied. Cervelli said Wolters  started saying a lot of things and I didn't like it.   Nothing came of the dust-up and the Pirates failed to score off Marquez even after the runners advanced on a wild pitch, when pinch-hitter Jose Osuna grounded out to end the threat.  He hung in there,  Black said.  There's a couple of big outs he had to get in the fifth inning.  Adam Frazier doubled leading off the Pirates sixth and Josh Harrison singled to put runners on first and third.

Xi, an avid soccer fan, has launched an ambitious drive to improve Chinese football from the ground up and spoken of his wish for the country to qualify for another World Cup, host the tournament and eventually win it.     China has invested heavily in the sport in recent years, boosting its domestic league by signing a number of high-profile, international players and coaches. In a statement released late on Wednesday, FIFA said Xi and president Infantino's meeting centered on soccer's popularity in China and the government's commitment to improving access to the game.   In addition, the Chinese President expressed his hope, and the dream of many Chinese people, that the country would have the opportunity to host a FIFA Men’s World Cup at some stage in the future,  it said.  Chinese state media outlets, which are tightly controlled by the government and especially so when reporting the official activities of senior Communist Party leaders, did not report Xi's World Cup comment. Nevertheless, speculation has grown that China wishes to launch a bid for either the 2030 or 2034 tournaments. China's 82nd-ranked national team has qualified only once for the World Cup, losing all three matches and failing to score a goal in the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. Their failure to return to the finals has long frustrated local soccer fans. China are all but certain to miss out on qualifying for next year's tournament in Russia after a late goal by Syria in their 2-2 draw on Tuesday.  There is still a very large disparity in the general standard of China's football today compared to major footballing nations,  state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying in his meeting with Infantino.  The true meaning of football is not just about competition, it is more about cultivating people's patriotism and collective fighting spirit.  China's growing influence within FIFA was reflected in the election of Zhang Jian to the governing body's executive Council in May, and FIFA has appointed a number of Chinese companies as sponsors for the World Cups in Russia and in Qatar in 2022.  Today marks the kick-off of a new and closer cooperation between China and FIFA for the future of football,  Infantino said in the FIFA statement.

The finance ministry said on Tuesday it will issue 14 billion yuan ($2.06 billion) of treasury bonds denominated in yuan, and $2 billion in dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. IFR said it would be China's first dollar bond offering since October 2004. The ministry said the treasury bonds will be issued in Hong Kong in two separate tranches of 7 billion yuan each. The first will be issued by June 30, and the other in the second half of this year. China has sold yuan denominated bonds over the last few years as part of efforts to internationalise its currency.

In eighth inning Wednesday night, however, Smith allowed Logan Morrison's two-run home run as he coughed up a three-run lead to the Tampa Bay Rays. Martin set things right for Smith when he led off the bottom of the eighth the go-ahead home run as Toronto beat Tampa Bay 7-6.  It felt good,  Martin said.  You give up a lead with one of our pitchers who has been throwing the ball extremely well all year long, Smitty, I felt like I picked him up right there. The team at that moment needed that. A nice bounce-back win, a collective win. I feel we kind of battled that one out.  Martin hit his sixth home run of the season against Tampa Bay left-handed reliever Jose Alvarado (0-1) after the Rays tied the game with three runs in the top of the eighth.  He threw me a fastball in the middle of the plate and I put a good swing on it,  Martin said.  After that first pitch I thought I was in for a tough at-bat. We got lucky and he threw it into my swing. I'll take it.  Related CoveragePreview: Rays at Blue JaysTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchSmith (3-0) got the win. After Morrison's homer, he allowed a sacrifice fly by Derek Norris before getting the final out. Kendrys Morales hit a three-run homer and had four RBIs as the Blue Jays rebounded from Tuesday's 8-1 loss to gain a split of the two-game set. Francisco Liriano allowed three runs (two earned) and five hits and struck out nine in seven innings.  He was dynamite,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  Tonight, he was as crisp as we've seen him. Good breaking ball and looked like his fastball had some jump to it. Against a hot lineup, too. He did a hell of a job. They've got a lot of guys with power in their lineup, too, they can strike pretty quick. It was a good ballgame, especially after that egg we laid last night.  Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth to earn his 17th save of the season. Rays starter Jake Odorizzi allowed five runs (three earned), five hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings. He gave up the home run to Morales, the ninth straight game in which the right-hander has yielded at least one homer.  It was just one of those games where I didn't have anything,  Odorizzi said.  They happen from time to time throughout the year. There's really no explanation for why.  After taking the lead with a four-run fifth, Toronto tacked on a run in the sixth when Martin scored on a wild pitch by reliever Chase Whitley on a strikeout of Kevin Pillar. Martin led off the inning with a single followed by a single by Dwight Smith Jr., a seemingly routine fly that dropped in among fielders who lost sight of the ball in the twilight with the roof open. Ryan Goins sacrificed the runners to second and third. Corey Dickerson hit a two-run triple in the third inning to give Tampa Bay a 2-0 lead. It scored Taylor Featherston who reached first base on an error by second baseman Goins and Peter Bourjos who trickled an infield single up the third-base line. The Jays scored once in the bottom of the inning. Pillar walked, stole second as Josh Donaldson struck out and continued to third on the throwing error by catcher Norris. Jose Bautista walked. Pillar scored when Morales forced Bautista at second on a grounder to second. The Rays loaded the bases with no outs in the fourth inning on two walks on a bunt single by Mallex Smith but scored only once, on Featherston's sacrifice fly. Goins led off the fifth inning with a single. He was running when Featherston committed an error on Pillar's grounder to second and continued to third. He scored on Bautista's single up the middle that left runners at the corners for Morales who lined a 3-1 splitter to right for his 13th homer of the season to give Toronto a 5-3 lead.  That was probably the most off I've seen (Odorizzi) from a strike-throwing point in a long time, maybe ever,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  I like the way he battled. He had some 3-0 counts, he had some 2-0 counts, he was able to get back in. And at the end of the day, you look up and before the home run, it's one run and it's in.

That's baseball -- sometimes they're easy, sometimes they're not, but they're always entertaining,  Blevins said following a never-easy but nonetheless stirring 9-4 comeback win by the Mets over the Chicago Cubs at Citi Field. The Mets fell behind 2-0 two pitches into the game, lost second baseman Neil Walker to a left leg injury in the third inning and watched starting pitcher Matt Harvey toss 87 mph fastballs until he departed after four innings due to a fatigued arm. But the Mets' comeback began in the fourth, when pitcher Steven Matz, pinch-hitting for Harvey with the bases loaded and one out, keyed a two-run rally by beating out a run-scoring infield single to quiet the thousands of Cubs fans seated among the crowd of 34,566.  The big thing to take away from that, even though we were down 4-1, the sense was that we were down a lot more than that with all the Cubs fans here cheering as loud as they were,  Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson said.  (It) continued to keep guys realizing this thing is far from over, we've got a lot of opportunities left.  Matz, who is batting .185 with eight RBIs in 54 major league at-bats, had to pinch-hit because the Mets' best right-handed bench bat, Yoenis Cespedes, is battling a heel injury and needs an extended warm-up period before he's ready to pinch-hit. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MetsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch We got the guys on and I turned around, I looked at (bench coach) Dicky Scott, I said, 'Please tell me Cespedes is ready to hit,'  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  And he wasn't. So we just said, well, we'll go with Steven Matz. And he saved the manager tonight, I can tell you.  Center fielder Juan Lagares, pressed into duty with Cespedes and Michael Conforto (back) sidelined by injuries, laced a game-tying RBI triple in the sixth. Granderson, who appeared to be headed for fourth outfielder duties before Cespedes and Conforto got hurt, snapped the tie by hitting his 300th career homer leading off the eighth. The Mets piled on later in the inning thanks to a three-run homer by Lucas Duda, who began the game on the bench but entered when Walker got hurt, and an RBI single by T.J. Rivera, who finished with three hits in just his third start since May 21. Paul Sewald, Fernando Salas and Blevins combined to limit the Cubs to two hits in four innings, with Blevins (4-0) striking out three over 1 1/3 perfect frames. Addison Reed wriggled out of a bases-loaded jam during a non-save situation in the ninth as the Mets (30-34) won for the sixth time in the last eight games.  This was a good one,  Blevins said.  This was a fun one to watch as a fan, too.  It may have been a costly one as well for the Mets, who overcame numerous injuries to key players to reach the World Series in 2015 and the National League wild-card game last season. Walker was injured trying to beat out a bunt in the third and collapsed in pain in foul territory before touching first base. He was able to walk off the field under his own power but is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Thursday. Harvey, who underwent Tommy John surgery in 2013 and surgery to repair thoracic outlet syndrome last July, is also scheduled to see doctors on Thursday. He said he last threw fastballs in the 87 mph range during his freshman year of high school.  Just pretty tired,  said Harvey who gave up the four runs on four hits and one walk while striking out five.  My arm was just not working at all.  Anthony Rizzo and Ian Happ opened the game with homers for the Cubs (33-34) while Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run blast in the fourth. It was the second straight leadoff homer for Rizzo, who never batted leadoff before Tuesday, when he went 3-for-5 in a 14-3 win.  Their bullpen pitched well,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  We got off good again and we definitely had control of that game and gave it up.  Jon Jay had three hits for the defending World Series champion Cubs, who have lost six of eight.  There's a certain unpredictability about us,  Maddon said,  That's what happens when you're .500 -- you don't play that same good game every day.  Carl Edwards Jr. (2-1) took the loss for the Cubs after giving up three runs in an inning-plus. Starter Mike Montgomery allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits and one walk while striking out four over five innings.

Under the  Banking and Financial Services Commission of Inquiry Bill 2017 , introduced by a group of non-government cross-bench senators, banks would be forced to testify before a powerful parliamentary inquiry. Bank bosses currently face questioning by the lower house of parliament at least once a year. For a more powerful inquiry to become a reality, the Senate bill must now be passed by the lower house where the government holds a slim majority and says financial and consumer watchdogs already have enough authority over lenders. Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the Senate's support for the bill gives Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull the choice to start  his own royal commission or he runs the risk that parliament does it without him . Turnbull has previously ruled out holding a bank royal commission, the most powerful inquiry in Australia. Australia's four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank - have come under fire after scams involving misleading financial advice, insurance fraud and interest-rate rigging, as well as for hiking mortgage rates independently to the central bank. The left-wing Greens party, which co-sponsored the bill, said it hopes rural government lower house member George Christensen will break from his party and support the bill, given his history of criticising banks. A spokeswoman for Christensen told Reuters the lawmaker would  stay true  to previous public support for the bill, provided that the inquiry includes Australia's insurance and pension industries.
