[{"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The president\u2019s eldest son and senior campaign aides attended a meeting last year to discuss allegedly incriminating information about       Hillary Clinton       they were told was being offered by the Russian government in support of       Donald Trump\u2019s       candidacy, according to emails Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday.The release of the emails, following days of news reports about the June 2016 meeting, offers evidence that senior officials in the Trump camp entertained offers of Russia\u2019s help in last year\u2019s election. That appears to contradict longtime statements by members of the campaign that they were unaware of a Russian effort to support Mr. Trump last year.During the campaign and since his election victory, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised President       Vladimir Putin       and cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia sought to interfere in the election. Last week, he said in Warsaw: \u201cNobody knows for sure.\u201dThe meeting last June was also attended by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who was a senior campaign aide at the time and is now a top White House official, and       Paul Manafort,        then the campaign chairman.The email release is likely to pull the younger Mr. Trump, who had a significant role in the campaign but never joined the Trump administration, further into the center of the matter being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. President Trump has said little about the episode, aside from a tweet late Tuesday in which he called his son a \u201cgreat person who loves our country.\u201d But he has been closely following the reports, aides said, and in private, the president has been consulting with his eldest son and giving him advice, a person familiar with the matter said.In a statement read to reporters by a White House spokeswoman on Tuesday, President Trump said: \u201cMy son is a high quality person and I applaud his transparency.\u201dAfter reading the statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House principal deputy press secretary, said: \u201cbeyond that I\u2019m going to have to refer everything on this matter\u201d to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney.Richard Painter, White House ethics attorney in the       George W. Bush       administration, said it is illegal for a political campaign to accept \u201cforeign contributions of money or services,\u201d which he said would include the information apparently described in Mr. Trump\u2019s email exchange. The younger Mr. Trump has said information about Mrs. Clinton was offered but that it was of little value.Still, Mr. Painter said the extent to which the Trump campaign entangled itself in Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign wasn\u2019t clear from the correspondence. The Russian government has denied trying to influence the campaign, and the president and his operatives have long said there was no collusion, with Mr. Trump also contradicting the intelligence community by saying other countries besides Russia could have interfered with the election.\u201cIt\u2019s one more shoe to drop,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThey said there\u2019s no collusion and now we see clearly that Donald Trump Jr. wanted to collude.\u201dIn an email to the younger Mr. Trump dated June 3, 2016, a British publicist said that a top Russian prosecutor had \u201coffered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201dThe publicist said the prosecutor had communicated this offer to Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, who along with his son, pop star Emin Agalarov, organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow with the president and developed a relationship with the Trump family.\u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u2014helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d the publicist, Rob Goldstone, who was working for the Agalarovs, wrote in the email to the younger Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?\u201dDonald Trump Jr. responded by offering to speak to Emin Agalarov about the matter. \u201c[If] it\u2019s what you say I love it,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump wrote, appearing to suggest the information would be good to release \u201clater in the summer.\u201dThe correspondence appears to show the younger Mr. Trump forwarded the chain and meeting plans to Messrs. Kushner and Manafort. Over the weekend, the younger Mr. Trump said he told the two aides \u201cnothing of the substance\u201d of the meeting before it occurred.In a statement Tuesday, the younger Mr. Trump said he believed the Agalarovs had political opposition research about Mrs. Clinton and wanted him to meet with a Russian lawyer in New York about the matter.In an interview Tuesday night on Fox News, the younger Mr. Trump said it was common for people to act on an interesting email. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if there was any credibility, I didn\u2019t know if there was anything behind it, I can\u2019t vouch for the information,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone sends me an email\u2014I can\u2019t help what someone sends me. You know, I read it, I responded accordingly.\u201dDonald Trump Jr. said he didn\u2019t tell his father about the meeting because it was \u201csuch a nothing.\u201d He said he probably had met with other Russians but not in the context of a \u201cformalized meeting.\u201d He was also asked if anyone else came to him offering information about Mrs. Clinton that he remembered, and he said, \u201cNo.\u201dThe younger Mr. Trump hired a private attorney Monday and said he would work with congressional investigators who have sought his testimony since he said he arranged the meeting with top campaign aides and the Russian lawyer. On Tuesday, Sen.       John Cornyn       (R., Texas), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee that is investigating Russian activity, called for the younger Mr. Trump to testify before the committee.The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, told reporters Tuesday that there was \u201ca very demonstrable pattern of obfuscation and dissembling\u201d about the Trump family\u2019s dealings with the Russians. Mr. Schiff said the House committee, which is conducting its own probe, would like to call everyone involved in the meeting to testify in the near future.Mr. Schiff said the activity described in the emails could constitute criminal violations under certain circumstances, but beyond that, he said that collusion with a foreign power contravened Americans\u2019 basic civic responsibilities.\u201cIt is absolutely not only a breach of norms, but a breach of civic responsibility to the country. If you get approached by a foreign government offering to interfere in a presidential election, you go to the FBI. You report it. That\u2019s what a decent citizen would do,\u201d said Mr. Schiff.A special counsel appointed by the Justice Department earlier this year, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, also is investigating whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Moscow.The president\u2019s son said in a statement Tuesday that the Russian lawyer he met, Natalia Veselnitskaya, wasn\u2019t working for the Russian government, and Ms. Veselnitskaya herself has denied ties to the Kremlin. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn\u2019t know Ms. Veselnitskaya and \u201ccannot keep track of every Russian lawyer and their meetings within the country or abroad.\u201dBut Ms. Veselnitskaya and the Agalarov family have extensive ties to Russian officials. She counts among her clients state-owned companies and relatives of top government officials. Her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region. In one of the emails released by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday, Mr. Goldstone, the publicist, described the lawyer as a \u201cRussian government attorney flying over from Moscow.\u201dMs. Veselnitskaya said in an NBC interview broadcast on Tuesday before the younger Mr. Trump released the emails that she didn\u2019t take the meeting with the intent of supplying \u201cdamaging\u201d information on Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,\u201d she said.Ms. Veselnitskaya has been involved in a broad Russian campaign to discredit the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law that punishes Russian officials accused of human-rights violations. Moscow banned Americans from adopting Russian children in response to the U.S. law\u2019s passage.In a July 24, 2016, interview with CNN, the younger Mr. Trump said the charge that Russia had mounted a campaign to help his father was \u201cso phony.\u201dMark Corallo, a spokesman for Marc Kasowitz, the president\u2019s private attorney, said Tuesday: \u201cThe president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.\u201dOn the same day Donald Trump Jr. confirmed the meeting with Mr. Goldstone\u2014two days before the meeting took place\u2014the elder Mr. Trump at a rally promised to give a \u201cmajor speech\u201d days later that would address \u201call of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re going to find it informative and very, very interesting,\u201d Mr. Trump said to a round of applause.Mr. Trump ultimately focused that speech on terror threats in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting that happened that weekend.\u2014Reid J.

A 2014 EPA report said the Pebble mine could have \u201csignificant\u201d adverse effects on the fisheries and the Native Alaskan communities that depend on them.The EPA said in a statement that it will seek public comments for 90 days\u00a0on Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0decision.The move follows a settlement agreement between the agency and Pebble Partnership, reached in May, that allows the mining project to proceed the \u201cnormal course\u201d permitted under Clean Water Act rules and other environmental regulations, without being subject to what the company called \u201cextraordinary development restrictions.\u201dNow, Northern Dynasty said, the EPA\u2019s move clears the way for it to get going on an environmental impact study, which could take several years. Under the terms of the settlement, Northern Dynasty has agreed to hire the US Army Corps of Engineers to complete the study.The junior mining company said it would also seek a senior financial partner to help finance construction of a mine it said is the largest undeveloped gold resource in the world.Ron Thiessen,        Northern Dynasty\u2019s chief executive officer said the planned environmental study will \u201cdemonstrate that Pebble is a project of merit that will provide very substantial benefits\u201d to the state.A spokeswoman for the EPA didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\u2014Jacquie McNish and Eli Stokols contributed to this article.Write to Sara Schaefer Mu\u00f1oz at Sara.Munoz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 21:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/epa-moves-to-roll-back-proposed-restrictions-on-alaskan-mine-1499823880", "news_title": "EPA Moves to Roll Back Proposed Restrictions on Alaskan Mine ", "keywords": "clean water act,epa,mining,pebble mine,salmon,Environmental Protection Agency,Northern Dynasty Minerals,NDM.T,CA:NDM,non-metallic mineral mining,quarrying,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "Surprised by the disclosures involving President       Donald Trump\u2019s       son, some White House aides fear the story will make it increasingly difficult to advance the president\u2019s policy agenda.\u201cThis is more significant and serious than anything else we\u2019ve seen,\u201d one administration official said.The disclosure of emails showing that President Donald Trump\u2019s son and two other top campaign advisers had a meeting with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin comes as Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing Russia intervention in the 2016 presidential and whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in it. Mr. Trump and his aides have denied that they had any role in Moscow\u2019s meddling.A White House official said there was no directive from senior staff about how to manage the response to the president\u2019s son\u2019s emails.

But he has been following the reports, aides said. In private, the president has been consulting with Donald Jr. and giving him advice, a person familiar with the matter said.On Tuesday morning, the story took another surprising twist when the younger Mr. Trump released a series of emails showing that he took the meeting with the lawyer believing he would get damaging information about       Hillary Clinton       that came from the Russian government. His father approved of the release and, in a Tuesday statement, applauded his son\u2019s \u201ctransparency.\u201dOn Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted that his son would be interviewed on Fox News, adding \u201cHe is a great person who loves our country!\u201dThe revelations about the Trump Tower meeting last June\u2014which also included former campaign manager       Paul Manafort       and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser       Jared Kushner      \u2014have put a new focus on the role of Donald Jr. inside the campaign and in the wake of his father\u2019s victory.The younger Trump was part of a tight inner circle on the campaign\u2014mostly family and a handful of staffers new to presidential politics\u2014that remained one of few constants for Mr. Trump during his nearly two-year race. He helped bring in new staff and, in the case of former campaign manager       Corey Lewandowski,        advocated for the dismissal of others.Among the three eldest Trump children who were involved with the campaign, including brother, Eric, and sister, Ivanka, no one was a more vocal supporter than Donald Jr. when it came to encouraging his father to run for president.A vice president in the family real-estate and branding business who has said he may run for public office when his small children are older, it was Donald Trump Jr. who most closely sounded like one of the hard-core supporters in his father\u2019s grass-roots base of white, working-class voters.At the Republican National Convention, he gave a charged speech rich in conservative orthodoxy, criticism of the political establishment, and stories of his father\u2019s knack for inspiring employees and refusing to back down.By the end of the campaign, when Donald Trump Jr. was dispatched to western states for campaign rallies, he would consistently draw bigger crowds than Mr. Pence, then Indiana\u2019s governor, who focused mostly on the Midwest.Early on in the campaign, he was among his father\u2019s chief surrogates, leaning into issues he was familiar with, including support for the Second Amendment. His involvement with the National Rifle Association encouraged his father to accept an invitation to become the first sitting president to speak at the group\u2019s annual convention in more than three decades.After the convention, Donald Trump Jr. started stepping up his involvement, including at weekly meetings for senior staffers. He occasionally sat in on meetings, along with Mr. Kushner, about the campaign\u2019s use of voter analytics and data, according to former campaign officials.\u201cDad prepared us our entire lives to run the business,\u201d Don Jr. told The Wall Street Journal last year. \u201cBut politics? We jumped in with zero experience.\u201dThe inexperience has now come haunting.Veterans of Republican presidential campaigns said that in such circumstances, the best response to the email offering incriminating information from a foreign government would have been to decline the meeting and alert the campaign\u2019s lawyer.Ryan Williams, who worked on Republican presidential candidate       Mitt Romney\u2019s       past campaigns, said: \u201cMost people who\u2019ve worked in major campaigns would agree the standard practice when you receive an odd or suspicious email like this, would be to forward it to the legal counsel and ask their opinion.

He first emailed the younger Mr. Trump on June 3, 2016, with hopes of setting up a meeting for Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney who is alleged to have close ties to President       Vladimir Putin.\u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Goldstone wrote in an email to the younger Mr. Trump.\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\u201d he responded.The meeting between Ms. Veselnitskaya and three senior campaign officials took place six days later at Trump Tower.The president\u2019s son posted the email exchange with Mr. Goldstone on Twitter on Tuesday morning, moments before the             New York Times                   posted a story documenting the exchange.He said in a statement Tuesday that the Russian lawyer he met, Ms. Veselnitskaya, wasn\u2019t working for the Russian government, and Ms. Veselnitskaya herself has denied ties to the Kremlin.       Dmitry Peskov,        a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn\u2019t know Ms. Veselnitskaya and \u201ccannot keep track of every Russian lawyer and their meetings within the country or abroad.\u201dMr. Goldstone, who had been more forthcoming in interviews earlier this week, referred all questions about his emails with Mr. Trump to his attorney after their release.Mr. Goldstone founded his publicist firm, Oui 2 Entertainment, with David Wilson in 1988 after years of work in the music-marketing business. The Manhattan-based company has partnered with EMI Music Publishing,             Best Buy                   and The Friar\u2019s Club, according to Oui 2\u2019s website.Born in Great Britain, Mr. Goldstone studied as a journalist and \u201cworked for daily newspapers and radio stations in London,\u201d according to the website. He left journalism for the bright lights of the music industry, the website states, moving to Sydney, Australia, \u201cafter being chosen by Michael Jackson to accompany him exclusively on his 1999 Australian tour.\u201d In 2010, he wrote a New York Times op-ed titled, \u201cThe Tricks and Trials of Traveling While Fat.\u201dRep.       Adam Schiff       of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Tuesday that Moscow\u2019s alleged use of Mr. Goldstone to set up the meeting seemed \u201cconsistent with Russian tradecraft.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s clearly very much of a self-promoter and a promoter generally and it\u2019s clear he saw this meeting as a way for him to get in the game with Trump,\u201d said       Christopher R. Hill,        who served Republican and Democratic administrations as U.S. ambassador to several countries including Iraq. \u201cThe Russians, who are good at finding these sort of useful idiots, obviously saw the value in using him.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Goldstone said that he didn\u2019t pay attention to what was said in the June 9 meeting between Ms. Veselnitskaya and the three senior campaign officials\u2014the president\u2019s eldest son, then-campaign CEO       Paul Manafort       and       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and now a senior White House adviser.\u201cI was [there] but took no notice as I was simply there to introduce them and then wait and take them out again,\u201d he said. \u201cI work in music\u2014politics is a foreign language for me.\u201dBut on the day after President Trump\u2019s surprise victory in last year\u2019s election, Mr. Goldstone posted a photograph to Instagram in which he wore a T-shirt with a large \u201cRUSSIA\u201d logo. He captioned the picture: \u201cHedging bets.\u201dThe photograph was no longer visible on Sunday, when Mr. Goldstone appears to have locked his account from public view.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus, Felicia Schwartz and Lukas Alpert contributed to this article.Write to Eli Stokols at eli.stokols@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Publicist Thrust Into Spotlight.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 20:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-jr-s-emails-put-spotlight-on-u-k-publicist-1499820068", "news_title": "Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Emails Put Spotlight on U.K. Publicist ", "keywords": "donald trump jr. ,donald trump jr. russia,rob goldstone,russia hillary clinton,trump clinton,Donald Trump Jr,Rob Goldstone,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Thousands\u00a0of uniformed officers filled the Grand Concourse in the Bronx\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0to remember New York City Detective Miosotis Familia, a single mother of three who was fatally shot in a police vehicle.Officers from as far away as San Francisco and the United Arab Emirates gathered at the World Changers Church to hear of Detective Familia\u2019s deep dedication to her blood family and her blue family.Detective Familia, promoted to that rank posthumously, \u201cwanted with all of her heart to be a New York City police officer,\u201d Mayor       Bill de Blasio       told mourners.\u201cShe was strong but kind, resourceful and energetic. She embodied the American dream,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cShe loved this city and this country because she understood its magic.\u201dThe 12-year veteran was praised as a hero who had an infectious smile and always a word of inspiration for colleagues. She loved shopping with her mother and filled her home with colorful hearts on Valentine\u2019s Day, her favorite holiday, to show her children how deeply they were loved.Through tears, Detective Familia\u2019s eldest child, Genesis, 20 years old, recalled her mother\u2019s last warm embrace, her dark brown eyes and soft skin. \u201cMy mother lived for us. She went to work every day for us,\u201d she said. Detective Familia also leaves behind 12-year-old twins, a boy and a girl.In the July 5 attack, Detective Familia, 48 years old, was sitting in a mobile-command center vehicle located in Fordham Heights, a high crime area of the Bronx. Shortly after\u00a0midnight,       Alexander Bonds       walked up to the vehicle and shot her once in the head, killing her, officials said.Bonds, 34, who acted paranoid for about two weeks before the shooting and thought police were following him, was shot and killed by officers who had chased him from the crime scene, authorities said. Bonds pointed his gun at the officers, they said.Detective Familia is the sixth member of the NYPD killed since 2014. She is the third female officer to be murdered on the job, New York Police Department Commissioner       James O\u2019Neill       said.Mr. O\u2019Neill, who became emotional during his eulogy Tuesday, said Detective Familia was a kind and authentic woman, serious and sharp-witted. The youngest of 10 children born to Dominican immigrants, she was \u201cthe glue that held her large family together,\u201d and the sibling responsible for mediating disputes among six sisters, he said.Raised in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights neighborhood, Detective Familia later moved to the Bronx; she joined the force when she was 36 years old.\u201cShe epitomized why many people choose to become police officers,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neill, addressing her children. \u201cYour mom believed in the possibility of being part of something larger than herself.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. O\u2019Neill stressed that Detective Familia was assassinated because of what she represented, and that violence against police \u201cis a dishonor\u00a0to civilized society.\u201d\u201cAll her killer could see was a uniform,\u00a0even though Miosotis was so much more,\u201d\u00a0he added.Bonds\u2019 criminal history and social-media presence indicate animosity toward police. In 2001, he was arrested for the assault of a police officer in Queens with brass knuckles, police officials said. A video posted on Bonds\u2019             Facebook                   page last year criticized police treatment of residents, referring to officers in derogatory terms.On Tuesday outside the World Changers Church, dozens of officers watched the funeral service on their smartphones, some wiping tears from their eyes and embracing colleagues.\u201cIt\u2019s like a sister died,\u201d said       Brett Woodard,        an NYPD officer assigned to the 73rd Precinct in Brooklyn. \u201cIt feels like a family member was killed.That\u2019s why we all come together.\u201dStella Vesga,        a sergeant at the city\u2019s Parks Enforcement Patrol, said Detective Familia\u2019s death struck a chord. \u201cThe fact that she was doing her job and she was ambushed and the fact that she was a mother and the children are left without her,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com and Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Fallen Detective Mourned by Thousands.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 20:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-gather-for-nypd-officer-miosotis-familias-funeral-1499799422", "news_title": "Thousands Gather for NYPD Detective Miosotis Familia\u2019s Funeral ", "keywords": "miosotis familia,new york cop killed,new york police department,nypd police funeral,nypd police shooting,NYPD,Miosotis Familia,assault,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "A \u200bgovernment witness in       Martin Shkreli\u2019s       securities-fraud trial offered an intimate view of the 34-year-old former pharmaceutical executive, portraying himself as a \u201cpersonal mentor\u201d to Mr. Shkreli.Steven Richardson,        who testified Tuesday, was among the first investors in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s hedge fund, MSMB Capital, and helped him found the pharmaceutical company             Retrophin Inc.       Mr. Shkreli is fighting eight criminal counts stemming from what Brooklyn federal prosecutors allege was a series of frauds connected to his management of MSMB and Retrophin.Lawyers for Mr. Shkreli, who has pleaded not guilty and denied wrong doing, have sought at trial to portray his investors as savvy businessmen who took advantage of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cgenius.\u201dProsecutors questioned Mr. Richardson, a 63-year-old former American Express executive, in order to tease out details on Mr. Shkreli\u2019s management of MSMB Capital and his departure from Retrophin.In some ways, Mr. Richardson\u2019s story echoed those of the other investors who have testified in the trial. Impressed by Mr. Shkreli\u2019s apparent intelligence and reported track record, they invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in MSMB Capital, then watched as reports of outstanding returns gave way to losses, excuses and evasions.When those investors finally got their investments back, months or even years after seeking a cash redemption, at least some of it came instead in the form of Retrophin shares\u2014which they have acknowledged ultimately earned them a profit.But as MSMB Capital imploded, and other investors were chasing Mr. Shkreli for their cash, Mr. Richardson said he and Mr. Shkreli continued to enjoy what he described as a deep, yearslong friendship and professional partnership.Mr. Richardson told the jury that he met Mr. Shkreli at a cocktail party in Manhattan in the fall of 2009. After Mr. Shkreli, then in his mid-20s, told him about his plans for a hedge fund, Mr. Richardson told him, \u201cBoy, you\u2019re quite cocky,\u201d he told the jury.After asking a mutual acquaintance about Mr. Shkreli and visiting the fund\u2019s lower Manhattan office, Mr. Richardson invested $200,000 in MSMB Capital in October 2009 and $200,000 more in February 2010.Mr. Richardson told the jury he felt personal affinity with Mr. Shkreli, because of \u201cparallels\u201d in their lives: both came from \u201cworking-class backgrounds\u201d and, having thrived, were supporting their families. He found the friendship \u201cintellectually very provocative,\u201d Mr. Richardson said.Mr. Richardson urged him to stay fit and stop sleeping in his office and \u201cnudged\u201d him to have more social engagements. Early on, he said he helped Mr. Shkreli smooth over a dispute with his business partner. Mr. Richardson also gave Mr. Shkreli relationship advice, he told the jury.Months before Mr. Shkreli told investors he was liquidating MSMB Capital, in September 2012, Mr. Richardson had told Mr. Shkreli to move his entire $400,000 MSMB investment\u2014which Mr. Shkreli had told him was worth more than $583,000\u2014to Retrophin. Prosecutors allege Mr. Shkreli looted Retrophin to repay MSMB investors, as part of his fraud.Mr. Richardson gave Retrophin at least $35,000 in the coming months, as he and Mr. Shkreli built a board of directors and faced challenges taking their young company public.During this time, Mr. Richardson testified, he wasn\u2019t aware of any problems with MSMB Capital or with Mr. Shkreli\u2019s management of the millions of dollars invested in the hedge fund. Prosecutors have shown evidence that, by February 2011, MSMB Capital had lost nearly all of the investors\u2019 money and had stopped trading activity.Mr. Richardson\u2019s testimony is expected to continue Wednesday.Appeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Witness Details Shkreli Friendship, Investments.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 20:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/witness-in-martin-shkreli-securities-fraud-trial-describes-friendship-investments-1499819506", "news_title": "Witness in Martin Shkreli Securities-Fraud Trial Describes Friendship, Investments ", "keywords": " hedge fund,martin shkreli, msmb capital, pharmaceutical company, retrophin, securities fraud,shkreli,Retrophin,RTRX,Steven Richardson,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,securities fraud,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,health care,life sciences,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va.\u2014Two years ago, a safety area\u00a0at the end of a runway\u00a0designed to mitigate emergencies at Yeager Airport caused one instead when it broke free and slid down a hillside, crushing a church and forcing more than 100 people from their homes.The accident prompted airport officials to develop a far-reaching emergency infrastructure project to improve safety, as well as bring the airport, opened in 1947 amid hilly terrain outside this city of 50,000, into the 21st\u00a0century. Airport officials have a wish list of 15 items totaling $395 million, including a runway extension, new lighting systems and the replacement of the 67-year-old terminal.That\u2019s a big ask, even spread over multiple years, considering the current level of airport infrastructure spending nationally.The federal program that funds most airport projects gave a total of $3.2 billion in grants for 1,768 projects nationwide last year, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which administers the program.\u00a0The agency estimates that level of spending is about half the $6.5 billion in capital needs that airports will have in each of the next five years because of increasing passenger levels and aging facilities.So far this year, the FAA announced grants totaling about $863 million. That includes $904,000 for Yeager Airport, which officials said would pay for studying parts of the facility\u2019s infrastructure plan. Other grants included nearly $13 million to reconstruct taxiways at Charlotte/Douglas International, a large hub in North Carolina, and $2 million to build a terminal at a small airport in Rock Springs, Wyo.Airport officials say such funding, however, is generally failing to keep pace with infrastructure needs. They want Congress to eliminate the cap on fees that airports charge passengers to pay for capital improvements\u2014a move opposed by airlines.The fees are now capped at $4.50 per flight segment.\u201cBy any measure, airports need additional resources to upgrade aging facilities, accommodate rising demand, and to keep pace with evolving safety and security standards,\u201d\u00a0      Todd Hauptli,        CEO of the American Association of Airport Executives, testified at a Senate hearing in March to argue for lifting the cap.Officials here are keenly aware of President Donald Trump\u2019s pledges to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including upgrading its airports.\u00a0In May 2016, then-candidate Trump flew into the airport before giving a speech in Charleston. He carried West Virginia with nearly 69% of the vote.\u201cWe watched the national election very closely and saw where President Trump was saying he wanted to do things for airports,\u201d said Terry Sayre, executive director of the airport. \u201cHe won West Virginia big. It\u2019s time to give back.\u201dAirports\u00a0across the country are beset by congestion\u00a0and delays and often rank poorly in comparisons with facilities in other countries,\u00a0as funding in the U.S. has\u00a0failed to keep pace with the growth in air travel and much-needed upgrades.Yeager is a prime example. Its\u00a0air-traffic-control tower is 67 years old and its outdated terminal gets by with a small security checkpoint with little space for passengers to line up.The airport, while smaller than many others in the U.S., still provides an economic boost to West Virginia and the Charleston region, which have been hard-hit by the decline in coal. Yeager supports $174 million a year in economic activity and more than 1,800 jobs, according to a study commissioned by the airport.Officials said their plan would create construction and other jobs. The upgraded airport would also increase the amount of commercial, military and cargo traffic and make the region more attractive to out-of-state businesses, they said.\u201cWe believe it will be a huge economic development [boon] for the whole state,\u201d said Kent Carper, president of the Kanawha County Commission. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to fix anybody\u2019s airport, why not this one?\u201dThe most pressing safety issue at Yeager Airport is repairing the runway safety area that broke away in March 2015.\u00a0Since then, the airport has removed 540,000 cubic yards of collapsed earth at a cost of $9.6 million. A lawsuit filed by the airport against the engineering firm and contractors that built the extension is pending.Officials want to rebuild an emergency system that acts like a runaway truck ramp to stop planes from going over the edge of the elevated runway. In 2010, the former system was credited with saving the lives of 33 people aboard a US Airways flight when it stopped the plane during an aborted takeoff.An interim system would cost $14 million. It would include building\u00a0a short wall, 200-foot-long bed of materials that would collapse to stop a plane traveling at 40 to 70 knots, and turn on an instrument-landing system at that end of the runway so planes could land using instruments-only during bad weather.Mr. Carper of the county commission said he hoped this system would quickly be funded either by the FAA or by Congress, saying it wasn\u2019t much money for the safety enhancements. \u201cThat would be like putting in new ashtrays at some airports,\u201d he said.Named after Chuck Yeager, a test pilot from West Virginia who broke the sound barrier in 1947, the airport sees about 130 takeoffs and landings each day for about 430,000 passengers a year.The plan\u2019s biggest changes would involve extending the end of the runway\u00a0opposite from the proposed safety area, to increase the airport\u2019s current 5,724 feet of landing distance to well over 6,000. The longer runway would allow bigger planes and additional carriers to fly out of the airport and eliminate weight restrictions that sometimes require airlines to reduce the number of passengers on flights.Under the proposal, a valley would be filled in, partly burying a park, but creating more flat land for a new athletic complex.Mr. Sayre, the airport\u2019s executive director, sees the project as a way to help the state reinvent itself.\u201cWest Virginia\u00a0has been married to coal forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to be able to expand businesses in our region, we need access to the global economy.\u201dWrite to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Airport Awaits Funding Takeoff.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 20:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/west-virginiaairportofficials-await-big-infrastructure-takeoff-1499808906", "news_title": "An\u00a0Airport\u00a0Awaits Infrastructure Takeoff", "keywords": "Federal Aviation Administration,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014Brazil\u2019s Senate approved a bill Tuesday that will make extensive changes to the country\u2019s labor laws, cheering investors and giving embattled President       Michel Temer       some much-needed good news.The bill was passed on a vote of 50 to 26, after hours of delay as a group of opposition senators protested the measure by occupying the table where the chamber\u2019s leaders would normally be seated.The bill will update the country\u2019s decades-old labor regulations, permitting more flexible employment rules, eliminating union dues and making it harder for workers to sue their employers, among other things. Senators were still voting on amendments that could change some of the details on Tuesday evening.Brazil\u2019s economy contracted in 2015 and 2016 as the country suffered through its worst recession on record. The new law will give executives more confidence in the economy and help spur growth, said       Rafael Sabadell,        a fund manager at S\u00e3o Paulo-based GGR Investimentos, which manages about $300 million in assets.\u201cBrazilian labor rules are extremely rigid, and in a strong recession more flexibility will help the economy recover more quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness owners will be more open to hiring new workers\u201d with the new rules, he said.Labor unions have held multiple protests and rallies around the country in recent weeks to oppose the changes, including one Tuesday in front of the Congress buildings in the capital of Bras\u00edlia.The labor reforms \u201cremove all the rights of the working class, to the benefit of financial, agricultural and business\u201d interests, Brazilian union organization CUT said on its website.The Senate vote came as Mr. Temer is fighting to stay in office. The lower house of Brazil\u2019s Congress is due to vote in coming days on whether or not Mr. Temer should face a trial in the country\u2019s Federal Supreme Court on charges he accepted bribes.Mr. Temer has denied any wrongdoing.If the chamber votes in favor of a trial, Mr. Temer will have to step down for up to six months while the process plays out in the high court. If found innocent, he\u2019ll return to office. If found guilty, he\u2019ll be removed from power and a new president will be elected by Congress to fill in until the next scheduled election, in 2018.The Senate vote is unlikely to give the president much of a boost in his quest to stay in power, some analysts said.The reforms and Mr. Temer\u2019s backing in Congress \u201care two separate issues,\u201d said       Thiago Vidal,        a political scientist at the Prospectiva consulting firm in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cThe reforms have their own support, independent of the president.\u201dMr. Temer took office last year after his predecessor and running mate, President       Dilma Rousseff,        was removed from office for violating budget laws. The new president unveiled a series of proposals intended to regain investors\u2019 confidence and spur a recovery, and scored a quick success with a constitutional amendment limiting government spending increases that was passed in December.His more controversial reforms, to Brazil\u2019s insolvent pension system and the just-approved labor proposal, have met with more resistance and the pension bill appears to be stalled in Congress while the president grapples with the corruption accusations.Write to Jeffrey T.

But Russia does have an equivalent: the prosecutor general\u2019s office, run by Yuri Chaika.Donald Trump Jr. said information about       Hillary Clinton       was offered but it was of little value. Instead, he said he found himself in an unhelpful meeting with a Russian lawyer lobbying for the reversal of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law that enraged the Kremlin by sanctioning Russian human rights violators.The meeting with the lawyer in New York came as the Russian government campaigned against the law and against Bill Browder, a fund manager turned Kremlin critic who lobbied for the measure.Mr. Chaika\u2019s office at the time had been pressing American officials to repeal the law, which resulted in sanctions on some of his associates.A spokesman for Mr. Chaika didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.For Mr. Chaika, the campaign against Mr. Browder appeared to be personal. He publicly accused the hedge-fund manager in 2015 of working with U.S. security services to produce a documentary that aired corruption allegations against the Chaika family.After the film\u2019s release, Russian authorities opened a probe into whether Mr. Browder organized the murder of his own attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in Russian prison after alleging that Russian authorities helped perpetrate a giant tax fraud and theft against Mr. Browder\u2019s fund. Mr. Browder has dismissed the allegation that he had anything to do with Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death and denied involvement in the documentary\u200babout Mr. Chaika.When a Russian opposition campaigner released the documentary on Mr. Chaika\u2019s family, one notable person jumped to the prosecutor\u2019s defense: Aras Agalarov, the Russian-Azerbaijani businessman who organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow with President Trump.Mr. Agalarov wrote a defense of Mr. Chaika and his family in Kommersant, a Russian business newspaper. \u201cAccording to a saying by the Nazi criminal Goebbels, the propaganda minister for Hitler\u2019s Germany, a lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth,\u201d Mr. Agalarov wrote, suggesting the documentary was a lie.The correspondence that Donald Trump Jr. released Tuesday suggests that Mr. Chaika may have sought to influence the Trump campaign through Mr. Agalarov, who along with his pop-star son Emin developed a relationship with the Trump family during the 2013 pageant.Rob Goldstone, the British publicist who sent the June 3, 2016, email to Donald Trump Jr., was working for the Agalarovs. The publicist didn\u2019t mention Mr. Chaika by name but said the elder Mr. Agalarov had met with the \u201cCrown prosecutor of Russia,\u201d who had offered to provide the Trump campaign with the damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u2014helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d Mr. Goldstone wrote.Mr. Goldstone also offered to hand the information directly to the elder Mr. Trump via the president\u2019s longtime personal assistant.No mention was made of the Magnitsky Act in the correspondence. But when Donald Trump Jr. showed up at the New York meeting looking for the promised information on Mrs. Clinton, he instead found Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya making a case for why the U.S. should lift the Magnitsky Act.A lawyer for the Agalarovs didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The meeting arranged through the Agalarovs wouldn\u2019t have been the first time Mr. Chaika\u2019s office sought to influence American officials regarding the Magnitsky Act.In April 2016, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) traveled to Moscow on an official congressional trip with four other members of Congress and two staffers. As part of their trip, the members of Congress met with Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the International Affairs Committee in Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. At that meeting, Mr. Kosachev passed a note to Mr. Rohrabacher asking if he would talk to Russian prosecutors afterward about the Magnitsky affair, according to people familiar with the trip.The follow-up meeting took place the same day. One of Mr. Chaika\u2019s deputies, Viktor Grin, himself sanctioned in the U.S. by the Magnitsky legislation, passed Mr. Rohrabacher a document marked \u201cConfidential\u201d that cast doubt on the facts of the Magnitsky affair that led American lawmakers to adopt the law, according to people familiar with the meeting.That document, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, said a re-evaluation of the Magnitsky story in Congress could result in \u201ca very favorable response from the Russian side on many key controversial issues and disagreements with the United States.\u201d The document suggested Moscow could lift the ban on Americans adopting Russian children, which Russia enacted in response to the Magnitsky Act.Ms. Veselnitskaya denies working for the Russian government and says she was advocating on behalf of a Russian client facing a U.S. money laundering case related to the Magnitsky Act.

He most recently worked for financial-software producer             Intuit Inc.,        INTU 1.15%       where he was senior vice president of finance for the $2.5 billion division that delivers QuickBooks to customers. Before that he was finance chief of             RPX Corp.        RPXC 1.43%      , a small San Francisco-based company that helps clients manage patent-related risks.Prior to that, Mr. Segal spent nearly 17 years at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,        GS -0.20%       where he worked closely with Mr. Noto, whom he will replace as finance chief. Mr. Noto has held two jobs at Twitter since becoming its chief operating officer in November following the departure of longtime executive       Adam Bain.       Mr. Noto now will act solely as COO, the company said.Bringing in a former colleague to fill a key role could help solidify Mr. Noto\u2019s influence. He has taken on increasing responsibility since joining Twitter three years ago, after stints including head of technology, media and telecom investment banking at Goldman and as finance chief for the National Football League.Twitter said its entire management team participated in the search for a new finance chief, meeting with several candidates, though Chief Executive       Jack Dorsey       made the final decision. Mr. Segal \u201cbrings a principled, engaging and rigorous approach to the CFO role, with a track record of driving profitable growth,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in a statement.Twitter has struggled for years to translate its popularity into profit. For the first quarter of this year it reported declining revenue for the first time since its initial public offering in 2013, despite a series of turnaround measures announced after Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder, returned as CEO in late 2015.More than a dozen executives and leaders have left Twitter in the past 12 months, including Chief Technologist Adam Messinger, Vice President of Product       Josh McFarland       and Vice President of Finance Celia Poon.In May, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s co-founder, Biz Stone, said he was rejoining Twitter to focus on its culture and work on conveying elements of Twitter\u2019s culture externally.Mr. Segal\u2019s annual salary will be $500,000, and he will receive about 795,000 shares of Twitter\u2019s stock, in addition to more shares if the company meets certain metrics, Twitter said in a filing.Twitter\u2019s stock, which ended trading Tuesday up 3.1%, was flat after hours following the announcement.The shares have gained ground this year, but remain at less than a third of their peak value shortly after their IPO.Intuit said in a statement: \u201cIn line with our values, we support employee mobility in and out of Intuit.\u201dIntuit\u2019s finance chief,       R.

According to court documents filed on Tuesday, Ms. Hill has the ability to cooperate with prosecutors as part of her plea agreement. Ms. Hill was hired by Insys in 2012 and eventually became the company\u2019s regional manager for the southeast, which included parts of Florida and Alabama.In a separate case,       Natalie Levine,        33 years old, also pleaded guilty in federal court in Connecticut to one count of conspiring to violate the anti-kickback law as part of a Subsys-related scheme that defrauded federal health programs and resulted in $4.5 million in losses to Medicare, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut said.Ms. Levine was employed by Insys from March 2013 to October 2014, prosecutors said. She is married to Insys\u2019 former chief executive,       Michael Babich,        said Thomas Carson, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Mr. Babich was arrested in December and charged by federal prosecutors in Boston with racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud conspiracy and violations of the anti-kickback law, among other crimes. Mr. Babich has pleaded not guilty to the charges. In addition to Mr. Babich, five other former Insys executives and managers were also charged with participating in the racketeering conspiracy and other crimes.Ms. Levine\u2019s attorney, Thomas M. Gallagher, said by email he wasn\u2019t available to comment immediately. Ms. Hill\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Hill and Ms. Levine are the latest former Insys employees to plead guilty to federal charges related to the sale of Subsys, a mouth-spray formulation of fentanyl that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat extreme cancer-related pain.Elizabeth Gurrieri,        the former head of Insys\u2019 reimbursement unit, pleaded guilty in June to one count of wire fraud conspiracy as part of a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors in Boston. Another former Insys saleswoman,       Natalie Perhacs,        testified in February that she participated in a kickback scheme with two Alabama pain doctors. She pleaded guilty to participating in the kickback scheme last year as part of a cooperation pact with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Mobile.Ms. Hill on Tuesday also pleaded guilty to participating in the kickback scheme with Ms. Perhacs and the two Alabama doctors. As an Insys sales manager, Ms. Hill instructed her employees to bribe doctors with payments disguised as fees for conducting promotional talks about Subsys, according to a factual resume filed on Tuesday with the plea agreement. During a 2012 telephone call with an Insys sales rep, Ms. Hill explained the best way to identify doctors willing to be promotional speakers and get paid to write Subsys prescriptions, according to the court filing.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how,\u201d Ms. Hill said, according to excerpts of the phone call included in the court filing. \u201cAny doctor that\u2019s money hungry, or that are just going through divorce, or doctors opening up a new clinic, doctors who are procedure heavy. All those guys are money hungry.\u201dIn addition to the charges brought against Mr. Babich and the other former Insys executives, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Boston has been conducting a yearslong investigation of the company. Insys has said it is seeking to finalize a settlement with the Boston prosecutors.Subsys was approved by the FDA in 2012, and the drug\u2019s fast-growing sales helped make Insys the best-performing initial public offering of 2013. But the company\u2019s aggressive sales tactics have attracted attention from prosecutors in multiple jurisdictions, and sales of the drug have fallen considerably over the past two years.Insys, based in Chandler, Ariz., was co-founded in 2002 by John N. Kapoor, a longtime pharmaceuticals entrepreneur and billionaire who retired as the company\u2019s CEO and executive chairman in January. Dr. Kapoor hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing and he remains on the Insys board of directors, and is the company\u2019s largest shareholder.Dr. Kapoor is also a director and shareholder in             Akorn Inc.,       a Lake Forest, Ill.-based drugmaker that agreed in April to be acquired for $4.3 billion by German health care company             Fresenius SE                   & Co.

The requirement excludes savings bonds and the data collected isn\u2019t intended for public dissemination, said       Ray Pellecchia,        a spokesman for the self-regulator.Reporting trades was a goal of regulators after the bond market showed signs of instability in an October 15, 2014 episode that became known as the Treasury \u201cflash rally\u201d because it sent prices surging and yields plummeting before they quickly rebounded. The event drew comparisons with the 2010 stock market \u201cflash crash\u201d in which the Dow plunged several hundred points within minutes. Reporting on government bond trades has lagged behind the stock market\u2019s requirements and even reporting for other types of debt.The action in October 2014 was attributed to the influx of nontraditional high-speed traders using computers and algorithms to buy and sell bonds, rather than the traditional firms who historically traded over the phone.A report on the day\u2019s trading by regulators included a new examination of nonpublic transaction logs, before, during and after the 12-minute window on Oct. 15, 2014. That report concluded that regulators needed to support efforts to improve reporting on Treasury trading, and consider new registration requirements for firms conducting certain types of automated trading.After the episode, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a series of measures to provide regulators with new tools to monitor changes in the market. Their cooperation required new agreements between regulators, who had varying access to data.In October 2016, the Fed Board of Governors in Washington announced that it planned to use Finra as its data collection agent for Treasurys. Spokespeople from the Fed and SEC declined to comment, while Treasury didn\u2019t respond to requests.Transaction reporting has been required since 2002 for corporate debt and is required within 15 minutes of trading, with some exceptions, while mortgage-bond trades have had to be reported within one hour since 2011.

The Kentucky Republican said he had confidence in the continuing Senate Intelligence Committee probe into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election\u2014and said his colleagues were eager to move forward on a health-care overhaul next week.\u201cWhat I have a lot of confidence in is the intelligence committee handling this whole investigation,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.The House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting investigations, and Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller is supervising an FBI criminal probe into possible collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow.Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, publicly released an email exchange on Tuesday in which he was told that damaging information on Democrat       Hillary Clinton       was being offered by the Russian government in support of his father\u2019s candidacy. The documents appear to show he forwarded that correspondence to       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and       Paul Manafort,        who was then campaign chairman.In a statement read to reporters by a White House spokeswoman on Tuesday, the president said: \u201cMy son is a high-quality person, and I applaud his transparency.\u201dOn Capitol Hill many Republicans appeared eager to discuss other items: health care, executive nominations and the Senate leadership\u2019s decision to delay the August recess.\u201cThe president fired the FBI director, he didn\u2019t fire the FBI. He didn\u2019t fire the Senate Intelligence Committee,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.). \u201cThe FBI\u2019s going to get to the bottom of all of this.

But we don\u2019t know any of that yet\u2026All of this is speculation until the FBI finishes its investigation.\u201dSen.       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah) dismissed the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s revelations as \u201ca bunch of bunk\u201d and reiterated his support for the president.\u201cLook, it\u2019s President Trump that\u2019s making the decisions and I know him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to pay attention to anybody except people that are really chosen to do the work.\u201dHe added he didn\u2019t think the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s correspondence, with a publicist representing the son of an Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire with ties to the Kremlin, was \u201crelevant to the Trump administration.\u201dStill, other Republicans were willing to chastise the younger Mr. Trump. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican and a supporter of the president, wrote on Twitter that the meeting disclosed by the younger Mr. Trump was \u201ca big no-no.\u201dDemocrats said the emails were the first clear evidence that officials and family members in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit colluded with a foreign government to affect the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201cToday we see acknowledgment in black and white that this was the crown prosecutor of Russia and part of a Russian government effort to try to discredit Clinton and help Trump,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner (D, Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that he would like to hear from the younger Mr. Trump about his meetings.Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump campaign should have notified law enforcement upon receiving the emails because \u201cit does cross a line of a foreign government trying to influence our election.\u201d\u201cTo go into that meeting was compromising,\u201d Mr. Cardin said. \u201cThe proper thing to do would have been to notify authorities of this contact, and I don\u2019t understand how Mr. Trump went into this meeting, who advised him to do it, and why he would go into the meeting.\u201dVirginia Sen.

He has been demonized by the government, with some officials referring to him in official pronouncements as \u201cthe Monster of Ramo Verde.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s transfer was seen by opposition moderates as a positive sign for the mediators, who started working months ago to break the political deadlock that has engulfed the country amid social turmoil and economic collapse. As word of the foreign mediators\u2019 efforts has filtered out in recent months, however, they were criticized for having secured few, if any, tangible concessions from the government.Venezuela\u2019s Information Ministry didn\u2019t respond to phone calls and an email seeking comment about the talks, but people in Mr. Maduro\u2019s administration have said more political prisoners could receive a reprieve in the near future.On Tuesday, Venezuela\u2019s human-rights ombudsman,       Tarek William       Saab, a close ally of Mr. Maduro, said he was working to commute the sentences of jailed opposition lawmaker       Wilmer Azuaje       and activist Yon Goicoechea.\u2018He\u2019s still a prisoner but learning to adapt.\u2019Lawyers in Venezuela who represent political prisoners say that while some have been released, hundreds more have been arrested, leaving the country\u2019s jails now holding 437 government foes. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that these negotiations have focused on political leaders, leaving all of the other political prisoners orphans,\u201d said       Gonzalo Himiob,        director of the rights group Foro Penal.Under the conditions of his transfer, Mr. L\u00f3pez, can\u2019t speak with the press or leave his apartment, and he must wear a monitoring ankle bracelet. His mother,       Antonieta Mendoza,        said he remains politically active, holding meetings with members of his party.\u201cHe\u2019s still a prisoner but learning to adapt,\u201d Ms. Mendoza said, adding her son is also spending time with his two small children. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief, I feel a spiritual peace because Leopoldo is safe.\u201dThe secret effort by Mr. Zapatero and others had been going on for months, initiated to break the political deadlock that has engulfed the country amid social turmoil and economic collapse, these people say.Mr. Zapatero met with Mr. L\u00f3pez in the Ramo Verde military prison three times over the past year. He was accompanied by two close confidants of Mr. Maduro, the former foreign minister,       Delcy Rodr\u00edguez,        and her brother Jorge, mayor of a district of Caracas, both of whom are seen as receptive to calls for political rapprochement with the opposition.Mr. Maduro\u2019s government was open to Mr. L\u00f3pez release, but domestic political tension delayed the process, these people said.They said the idea gained momentum over the past two months, as protests intensified and criticism of the government mounted.

Instead, in black and white, were messages showing that someone offered help from the top of the Russian government to distribute damaging information about       Hillary Clinton      \u2014and that the president\u2019s son, in his own words, was eager to get it. Indeed, he scheduled a meeting to receive it.As a result, government investigations and media inquiries of 2016 election maneuvering just got a load of new fuel. The stakes now seem higher, and previous responses more suspect. The prospect that all of this will go away soon has grown dim, if not extinguished entirely.Moreover, the disclosure of the emails raises the prospect of divisions breaking out within Trump world. The president\u2019s son released them on his own, but only after it was clear that they were about to become public. That suggests someone else had put them in circulation, possibly to point a finger of blame for a questionable decision at Donald Trump Jr.In sum, it is now more clear that the Trump White House has a long-term rather than a short-term problem on its hands. Moving forward, it likely will need a clearer way to separate its handling of investigations from the daily task of conducting presidential business.To be sure, while the disclosure shook Trump world, it didn\u2019t change the White House\u2019s basic line of argument, which is that collusion with the Russians remains a myth. Essentially, Trump aides are arguing that Donald Trump Jr. was showing a willingness to accept opposition research from Russians, not to coordinate with them in hacking into the emails of Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats, which is the truly explosive idea at the heart of the election-year inquiries.\u00a0The former, they argue, is a far cry from the latter.Moreover, Trump aides say nothing of substance was produced or handed over in the meeting with a Russian lawyer arranged by those emails\u2014an account the lawyer corroborates. They believe the revelation has created more a perception problem than a legal one.In a normal and fully formed presidential campaign, it is likely that such a meeting never would have happened. There would have been a system to set off alarm bells over such a suspicious offer of help from the fringes of the political world, and it would have been rejected outright or shuffled off to some lower level for vetting.But the Trump campaign wasn\u2019t a normal campaign. It clinched the nomination with only a skeletal organization in place. In June 2016, when the emails were sent, the Trump campaign, seemingly stunned by that success, was still tiny, without the traditional fully formed organization in place.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Indeed, the campaign inner circle consisted of essentially a handful of family members and loyalists\u2014a circle certainly including Donald Trump Jr.\u2014minus the kind of legal, political and fundraising apparatus that is the norm for modern presidential campaigns. There was a lot of winging it going on\u2014including, apparently, by the president\u2019s elder son.Now, of course, the key question is what the new shock does to the course of the inquiries now under way, as well as the White House\u2019s handling of them. The silver lining in the election-controversy clouds remains the fact that the American people seem far less fascinated with the election-collusion question than do those in the nation\u2019s capital. Whether that will continue to be the case remains to be seen, of course.The second key question, as it has been all along, involves the attitude of Republicans in Congress. They have remained largely supportive of President Trump, which is crucial for him. But their willingness to stand with the president on tough policy questions inevitably is affected by their perception of his standing and strength.What the president really needs now are some policy successes to shift the conversation while the investigative process plays out. That means, in the first instance, making progress on health care, taxes and funding the government.Keeping Republicans on board on those topics may require convincing them that there won\u2019t be more nasty surprises on the question of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And that, in turn, may require the White House to be less dismissive of questions on that topic, and more aggressive and transparent in answering them.Write to Gerald F.

China\u2019s most prominent dissident is fit enough to travel, according to both a German and an American doctor who examined him. The U.S. Embassy has asked China to release the prodemocracy activist, and a spokesman for German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       called on China to give \u201ca signal of humanity.\u201dThe international concern over the man China calls a \u201ccriminal\u201d and sentenced to 11 years in prison for \u201csubversive\u201d writings puts President       Xi Jinping,        who must ultimately decide how to respond, on the spot. So far he refuses to let Mr. Liu go.While officials use the standard line that other countries should not interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, the state-controlled media are airing video of the foreign doctors examining Mr. Liu, a gross invasion of privacy, to bolster the case that he is receiving adequate care. The German Embassy protested the video in a statement, which read in part: \u201cIt seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts. This behavior undermines trust in the authorities dealing with Mr. Liu\u2019s case, which is vital to ensure maximum success of his medical treatment.\u201dSecurity is tight at the First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, with journalists prevented from talking to Mr. Liu.

If the condition had been detected earlier, his treatment options and life expectancy today would be much better.The government that imprisoned Mr. Liu for his beliefs and failed to ensure his health can\u2019t ask the world to trust that it will give him the best care.

Emails released Tuesday reveal that the Trump associates were told they would receive allegedly compromising information about       Hillary Clinton       from the Russian government in an effort to support Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential tun.Here is a rundown of the major people who attended or helped arrange the meeting.Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son, hosted the June 2016 meeting, which was attended by       Jared Kushner,        the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser,       Paul Manafort,        President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at the time, and a Russian lawyer who has been linked to the Kremlin. A publicist who helped arrange the meeting,       Rob Goldstone,        also sat in on the meeting.Mr. Trump Jr. was told that the subject of the meeting would be allegedly incriminating information about Hillary Clinton he was told was being offered as part of the Russian government\u2019s support of his father\u2019s candidacy, according to the emails he released Tuesday.\u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u2014helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d Mr. Goldstone wrote in an email ahead of the meeting to Mr. Trump Jr.Mr. Trump Jr. said no information came out of the meeting.Jared Kushner disclosed the meeting earlier this year in a required form to obtain a security clearance, according to a statement by his attorney,       Jamie Gorelick.\u201cMr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr.,\u201d Ms. Gorelick said.Two previously disclosed meetings Mr. Kushner held with key Russians\u2014the head of a state-run bank that has faced U.S. sanctions and       Sergei Kislyak,        the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014had already drawn the interest of agents conducting a counterintelligence investigation to determine the extent of those contacts. Mr. Kushner agreed earlier this year to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the first White House official to do so.Paul Manafort, along with Mr. Kushner, wasn\u2019t informed \u201cof the substance\u201d of the meeting beforehand, according to a statement released by Mr. Trump Jr. on Sunday.Mr. Manafort resigned about two months later amid reports of his connection to pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine. Investigators are examining whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for foreign interests violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act and related laws.Mr. Manafort\u2019s spokesman has said he is taking the \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to respond to guidance from federal authorities about his FARA disclosures.In the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, said she possessed information on Russia-connected individuals funding the DNC and supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. She then raised the issue of the Magnitsky Act, which placed sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers, according to Mr. Trump Jr.\u2019s statement.Ms. Veselnitskaya said in a statement Monday that she met with Mr. Trump Jr. in her capacity as a private attorney, and has no ties to the Russian government. \u201cThe purpose of my brief meeting with Mr. Trump, Jr. was to explain the facts of my client\u2019s position,\u201d she said. She said she has also met with members of Congress to discuss the Magnitsky Act on behalf of her clients.Ms. Veselnitskaya said in an NBC interview broadcast on Tuesday before the younger Mr. Trump released the emails that she didn\u2019t take the meeting with the intent of supplying \u201cdamaging\u201d information on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said. Asked why Mr. Trump believed she had information about Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Veselnitskaya said: \u201cIt is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information.\u201dMs. Veselnitskaya counts among her clients state-owned companies and family members of top government officials, and her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region.Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani pop singer and son of billionaire Aras Agalarov, asked his publicist to set up a meeting between Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Trump Jr. Emin Agalarov\u2019s publicist, Rob Goldstone, reached out to Mr. Trump Jr., who agreed to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya.Emin Agalarov performed at the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia, and he and his father sponsored the event, which was then co-owned by the elder Donald Trump.Mr. Goldstone, a publicist, was asked by Emin Agalarov to help set up the eventual meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides.\u201cI reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and he agreed to squeeze us into a very tight meeting schedule,\u201d said Mr. Goldstone. \u201cAt the meeting, the Russian attorney presented a few very general remarks regarding campaign funding and then quickly turned the topic to that of the Magnitsky Act and the banned U.S. adoption of Russian children\u2014at which point the meeting was halted by Don Jr. and we left.\u201dWrite to Sharon Nunn at sharon.nunn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-who-in-trump-campaigns-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-1499732854", "news_title": "Who\u2019s Who in Trump Campaign\u2019s Meeting With Russian Lawyer", "keywords": "clinton,donald trump jr,jared kushner,lawyer,paul manafort,russia,russian lawyer,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Many decisions by the Trump-for-president campaign were ill-advised. Certainly that goes for a meeting between the president\u2019s son and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on       Hillary Clinton       but was really trying to get her foot in the door to lobby the Republican nominee against the Magnitsky Act.The Washington Post celebrates the latest revelation as a \u201cgrave new set of facts.\u201d Maybe this really is the beginning of the end, but an awful lot depends on the email bluster of a former British tabloid journalist who apparently was the go-between.Before keeling over, remember what else was going on at the time. The U.S. media even then were getting ready to pour considerable resources into trying to corroborate lurid \u201cTrump Dossier\u201d accusations explicitly attributed by the dossier\u2019s author to Russian intelligence, and assembled at the expense of Republican and Democratic opponents of Mr. Trump.A lot of what you\u2019re seeing is just naked political warfare, at which Team Trump is failing badly, in fact getting buried.With qualification, we might even recommend former drama critic       Frank Rich\u2019s       New York magazine cover story insisting on a Watergate parallel. No, Mr. Trump is not       Nixon,        and Watergate, in its antecedents, was more like the polar opposite of what is now befalling the Trump administration. Nixon and colleagues were lifelong political operatives, on their way to a genuine and sweeping mandate, and their crimes were crimes that Mr. Trump has hardly had time yet to master.But Mr. Rich dwells on the dubious Watergate analogy for the sake of a more newsy point: It took many, many months for Nixon\u2019s political base to unravel and drive him from office.In fact, Mr. Rich\u2019s speculations that Mr. Trump, Nixon-like, might resign will sound very much like speculation you\u2019ve read in this column. The presidency is hard work. Mr. Trump keeps finding himself cast in the role of \u201closer.\u201d The damage to his business and personal brand is becoming intolerable.Now an investigation is under way. Even if special counsel       Robert Mueller       dispenses with collusion, even if he runs out the string on obstruction, is it conceivable that a competent prosecutor\u2014with the 185,053-page code of federal regulations in one hand and Mr. Trump\u2019s every loan application, conservation easement, etc. in the other\u2014won\u2019t find something, and probably 100 somethings?The relevant text here isn\u2019t the Watergate memoirs Mr. Rich consults, but \u201cThree Felonies a Day\u201d by Boston civil-rights lawyer Harvey Silverglate, who says the government can always find something on anyone.It was Nixon himself, Mr. Rich tells us, who said it\u2019s not the crime, it\u2019s the coverup. But it would be even truer to say it\u2019s the investigation. The existence or nonexistence of an investigation is almost an exogenous factor of its own.Mr. Rich fancifully likens Russia\u2019s hacking to Nixon\u2019s DNC break-in, and implies Trump complicity. What likely won\u2019t be investigated, though, is the numerous illegal intelligence leaks meant to harm Mr. Trump, though these are far more reminiscent of the Nixon White House sending ex-CIA agents to burglarize dirt on political opponents.The one Russian intervention that may actually have influenced the election was fake intelligence planted about Hillary Clinton that prompted FBI Chief       James Comey\u2019s       decision to clear Mrs. Clinton publicly of email charges. This likely won\u2019t be investigated either, under the guise that the intelligence is too \u201csensitive,\u201d but also because it fits neither party\u2019s preferred narrative of blame-laying.Also unlikely to be investigated is the Trump dossier, though it may well be a Russian plant, apparently was financed by U.S. political operatives, and has been exploited by Trump opponents to claim a dark conspiracy.Each of these episodes features either the FBI, U.S. intelligence leakers, the press or major party figures \u201ccolluding\u201d (in one sense of the word), wittingly or semi-wittingly, with Russian intelligence. But there will be no investigation. Unlike Mr. Trump, these institutions are not expendable. The gnashing of teeth would be so much greater than any from merely driving out of office an \u201coutsider\u201d president, arguably an incompetent one, who is not fulsomely claimed by either party, and whose election is regarded as an institutional and statistical aberration anyway.The great irony is that Mr. Trump, for all his public vulgarity and personal sleaziness, is the political innocent in this drama, and will be sacrificed to protect the sophisticates.Yesterday, Democratic and news media types were already pronouncing the verdict treason. We can\u2019t resist ending with Mr. Rich\u2019s 1974 quote from       Elizabeth Drew       about Nixon, which applies as much to some of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics today: \u201cThere was no one to challenge his assumptions, to set him straight in his confusion of political opponents with enemies. He didn\u2019t recognize boundaries. He never learned to observe limits\u2014anything went.\u201dAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-agonistes-1499812424", "news_title": "Trump Agonistes", "keywords": "don jr.,mueller,russia,russia collusion,trump,white house,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The Trump administration on Tuesday approved a plan letting Alaska set up a federally funded reinsurance program to shore up the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace, a model that other states will likely emulate.The state sought a waiver to use ACA money to reimburse insurers for their costliest customers.

But although \u201cdemocracy is not a fragile flower .\u00a0.\u00a0. it needs cultivating.\u201d The West must act to assist the \u201ccampaign for democracy.\u201dReagan spelled out the elements of this campaign: to foster the \u201cinfrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose their own way.\u201d To those who objected to the promotion of democracy as \u201ccultural imperialism,\u201d he had a forthright reply: It is \u201cproviding the means for genuine self-determination and protection for diversity.\u201d Indeed, \u201cit would be cultural condescension, or worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.\u201dNoting that Western European nations were already engaged in this endeavor, Reagan promised to mobilize U.S. leaders across party lines to join and strengthen it. \u201cIt is time we committed ourselves as a nation\u2014in both the public and private sectors\u2014to assisting democratic development,\u201d he declared, and he went on to spell out how he intended to do so. \u201cLet us ask ourselves, \u2018What kind of people do we think we are?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he concluded. \u201cLet us answer, \u2018Free people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so but to help others gain their freedom as well.\u2019\u00a0\u201dToward the beginning of his speech, Reagan observed that Poland was \u201cat the center of European civilization\u201d and was contributing to this civilization as he spoke by resisting oppression. Poland resisted to regain its national independence, but also \u201cto secure the basic rights we often take for granted.\u201d The \u201cstruggle to be Poland\u201d was inextricably tied to the struggle for democracy.Thirty-five years later, the current U.S. president addressed a crowd in Warsaw. In his speech last week       Donald Trump       barely mentioned democracy. He spoke instead of the \u201cwill to defend our civilization.\u201d Although he did not offer an explicit definition of this civilization, the basic thrust of his understanding emerged. Our civilization rests on bonds of \u201chistory, culture, and memory.\u201d It puts \u201cfaith and family\u201d at the center of our lives. It is best summarized in the words one million Poles chanted in response to       Pope John Paul II\u2019s       Warsaw sermon in 1979: \u201cWe want God.\u201d This is the heart of the matter, said Mr. Trump: \u201cThe people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out, \u2018We want God.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhile this may well be true for the most devoutly Catholic nation in Europe, it would come as a surprise to most other Europeans. It is an inherently\u2014perhaps intentionally\u2014divisive interpretation of what we allegedly share as participants in Western civilization. Freedom of religion\u2014the right of each to worship in his own way or not at all\u2014would have been a more accurate way of putting it. It would also have been unifying. If this is what Mr. Trump meant, he should have said so. He is, after all, the president of a country dedicated like no other to the principle of religious liberty. But had he framed it that way, his audience might not have chanted his name. They certainly would not have done so if Mr. Trump had summoned the courage to say what many Poles and most Europeans know\u2014that along with Hungary\u2019s       Viktor Orban,        the current Polish government is Europe\u2019s leading threat to liberal democracy.There is no evidence that Donald Trump cares much about democracy, one way or the other. He regularly praises autocrats as strong leaders and reserves most of his blame for democratic leaders whose policies he doesn\u2019t like. If he had been born in an autocracy, he would not have been a dissident.If Ronald Reagan had been asked to define the phrase \u201cAmerica First,\u201d his initial reaction probably would have been: Those were the people too myopic to see why the United States should oppose fascism and Nazism. To judge from his Westminster address, his deeper answer would have been that America puts itself first when it is true to itself. And being true to itself means understanding that our constitutive principles apply beyond our borders. Indifference to democratic self-determination for other peoples is not putting America first; it is a betrayal of who we are.Appeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-does-trump-mean-by-the-west-1499812381", "news_title": "What Does Trump Mean by \u2018the West\u2019?", "keywords": "presidential speech,reagan,the west,trump,warsaw,westminster,British Parliament,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Fifty years ago Wednesday a black taxi driver in Newark, N.J., named       John Smith       was stopped shortly after dusk by two white police officers for a traffic violation. The officers later said that Smith, who was driving with a suspended license, became profane and abusive. Bystanders countered that the cops physically attacked him without provocation. Smith suffered a broken rib during the encounter and was taken to the local precinct, charged with assault and resisting arrest, and put in a holding cell. But rumors spread quickly that he had been killed by the police.Over the next four days, Newark experienced one of the worst riots in U.S. history, resulting in 26 deaths, more than 700 injured, nearly 1,500 arrests and damage to some 1,000 businesses. Subsequent journalistic accounts and government reports on the causes of the disorder would cite racism, segregation, economic distress, deindustrialization and police misconduct\u2014the same explanations offered for more recent racial unrest in places like Ferguson Mo., and Baltimore. Those factors almost certainly have played a role, but they also don\u2019t tell the whole story.Recall that the Newark riots were preceded by those in the Watts section of Los Angeles two summers earlier, when 34 people died, 4,000 were arrested, and more than 1,000 stores were looted or seriously damaged. Yet Watts was no Newark. It was full of single-family homes, not housing projects. In the mid-1960s, the Los Angeles economy was expanding and blacks had access to good jobs. Just a year before Watts went up in flames, the National Urban League, a black civil-rights organization, released a survey of 68 cities in the U.S. where blacks were prospering. L.A. topped the list.The 1967 Detroit riots, which began only a week after Newark\u2019s ended, also complicate the popular explanations of economic deprivation and \u201cblack rage.\u201d The black unemployment rate in Detroit at the time was 3.4%, lower than the jobless rate for whites nationally. The black poverty rate in Detroit was half that of blacks nationally, and the homeownership rate among blacks in the Motor City was one of the highest in the nation. The city had a large and growing black middle class and the smallest black-white income gap in the country.Today\u2019s black leaders and their liberal sympathizers in the media like to attribute a political consciousness to ghetto rioters, but a previous generation of black activists had a less romantic view. In his 1968 book, \u201cThe Unheavenly City,\u201d       Edward Banfield       writes: \u201cMost civil rights leaders dismissed the idea that the riots were conscious protests; that was not merely an after-the-fact rationalization,       Kenneth B. Clark       said, it was an \u2018independent of the fact\u2019 one.\u201d       Bayard Rustin       saw more opportunism than activism on display in the rioting: \u201cThey riot either out of sheer cussedness or for criminal reasons, and in some instances because mob action seems to be taking on the aspects of a fad. .\u00a0.\u00a0. Bedevil the police, strip stores, shout and yell, crush anyone who opposes you .\u00a0.\u00a0. and if the police try to stop it, just yell \u2018brutality.\u2019 This is the pattern.\u201dThat pattern persists today, and it\u2019s countenanced by groups like Black Lives Matter, the media and others on the political left who lack the honesty and courage of a Bayard Rustin. They are not doing the black underclass any favors. The racial gap in average earnings among male workers was narrowing in the 1940s, \u201950s and \u201960s\u2014even though racism was more prevalent and blacks had little political clout\u2014but that trend has slowed significantly since 1970 as black males have left the labor force.The economists       William Collins       of Vanderbilt University and       Robert Margo       of Boston University argued in a 2004 paper that black job prospects have been harmed since the 1970s by a \u201criot effect\u201d that dates to the previous decade. The effect is not only felt in the immediate aftermath but can linger for decades. The riots had \u201cnegative effects on blacks\u2019 income and employment that were economically significant and that may have been larger in the long run (1960-1980) than in the short run (1960-1970),\u201d they wrote. \u201cAfter a riot, firms and residents might revise their expectations of the benefits, costs, and risks of locating in or near a particular central-city neighborhood even if they were not directly affected by the riot.\u201d In other words, Detroit and Chicago and other cities didn\u2019t riot after the factory jobs left. The riots came first.Inner-city residents have legitimate grievances today\u2014the quality of public schools, for example\u2014just as they did when Newark exploded a half-century ago. But arson and looting in the guise of protest is a form of self-sabotage that consigns yet another generation of blacks to society\u2019s margins.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/still-living-with-the-riot-effect-50-years-later-1499812338", "news_title": "Still Living With the \u2018Riot Effect,\u2019 50 Years Later", "keywords": "newark riots,race,race relations,race riots,racial tension,riots,assault,political,general news,crime,legal action,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "President       Trump       has been a vigorous and outspoken supporter of manufacturers. That\u2019s why his nomination of       Scott Garrett       as president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank is such a disappointment.Manufacturers have enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump\u2019s previous nominees and his initiatives on comprehensive tax reform, infrastructure investment and regulatory reform. We were energized by his endorsement of the Ex-Im Bank. But Mr. Garrett\u2019s confirmation would be a terrible trade deal for our country. His record of aggressively undermining the Ex-Im Bank is tantamount to a vicious trade war against American manufacturing workers.A quick look at the Garrett record as a congressman before he lost re-election last year shows his contempt for the agency he now seeks to lead. In 2012 and again in 2015, he voted against multiyear reauthorizations of the bank and declared to his House colleagues: \u201cWe have the opportunity today to keep the Export-Import Bank out of business. We should take each of those opportunities.\u201dThe Ex-Im Bank is an agency that returns a profit to the U.S. Treasury. Some suggest pragmatic reforms to improve its benefits to U.S. exporters. But Mr. Garrett isn\u2019t a reformer; he\u2019s a destroyer. He has worked consistently to restrict the agency\u2019s ability to support U.S. jobs through exports, voting more than a dozen times to prevent the agency from fulfilling this critical mission.If we want to make manufacturing in the United States even greater, we cannot get there by letting other countries take deals away\u2014losing business with the 95% of the world\u2019s customers who live outside our borders.The Ex-Im Bank, when fully functioning, is our most effective tool to level the playing field when trading with other countries. At least 85 foreign-government-backed export credit agencies are working aggressively to support their own domestic industries, pulverizing manufacturers in America. While the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s board has been hobbled without a quorum, countries like China and Germany are devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to their official export credit agencies and inflicting long-lasting harm on the U.S. manufacturing base.One small energy company, FirmGreen Inc., had to take $180 million in business for U.S. manufacturers to China because the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s board lacked a quorum to approve the deal. Elsewhere, U.S. companies have lost foreign satellite sales because the Ex-Im Bank isn\u2019t fully operational yet. Singapore-based Kacific Broadband Satellite told U.S.-based companies not to bother bidding on its new project unless Ex-Im financing is available.For his part, Mr. Trump understands exactly what is at stake. American manufacturers are thankful to have a president who is willing to break through all of the rhetoric and misinformation about the Ex-Im Bank in order to get it\u2014and America\u2014back in business. But the politician who wants to lead it, Mr. Garrett, would do exactly the opposite.Those like Mr. Garrett who have stood in the path of a fully functioning Ex-Im Bank are responsible for moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to other countries.

The blowback followed months in which the often-troubled relationship had improved after the city hired more officers and completed a union contract.\u201cWhat he should have done is demonstrated his words by being here with us,\u201d said       Patrick Lynch,        the president of the city\u2019s biggest police union, the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, outside the funeral.Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, said the latest dust-up added fuel to a longstanding narrative the mayor has sought to change, particularly as he is seeking re-election. \u201cThe message will be that Bill de Blasio is antipolice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201dA spokesman for the mayor,       Austin Finan,        played down the idea that there is widespread discontent among the city\u2019s 36,000-member force with the mayor\u2019s leadership. \u201cA couple dozen people showed up to partake in a bogus controversy ginned up by the media and those looking to politicize Detective Familia\u2019s death.

One is well-known:       Nathan Hale,        the American spy who regretted that he had but one life to lose for his country. The other is       Moses Dunbar,        a lowly Anglican Loyalist whom most of his countrymen wanted to forget.It didn\u2019t have to turn out that way,       Virginia DeJohn Anderson       wisely reminds us in her dual biography of Hale and Dunbar, \u201cThe Martyr and the Traitor.\u201d If Britain had won the war, as most observers at the time expected, we\u2019d probably remember Hale as a traitor\u2014if we remembered him at all\u2014and celebrate Dunbar, the Loyalist. In juxtaposing two young lives and two early deaths, Ms. Anderson, a historian at the University of Colorado, returns us to the war\u2019s uncertain early years, when betrayal\u2014of either Britain or the colonies\u2014was in the eyes of the beholder and perilously hard to avoid for those caught up in the conflict.Hale\u2019s story dominates Ms. Anderson\u2019s narrative. After all, Hale\u2014wealthier and better educated than Dunbar\u2014left behind more archival tracks. When he arrived in New Haven, Conn., to begin college at Yale, it was his first time traveling far enough to see the sea. When he left, he was fluent in languages and literature and clever conversation. Earnest, ambitious and outgoing, he became a schoolteacher who delighted his students by jumping out of barrels \u201clike a cat.\u201d But when he became a spy for the Continental Army, Hale proved too gregarious for his own good. After he told a friend about his upcoming mission\u2014an early sign, perhaps, that he lacked discretion\u2014the friend warned that Hale was \u201ctoo frank and open for deceit.\u201d In any case, the friend worried, many gentlemen considered espionage dishonorable.Hale undertook the mission anyway, eager to serve his new country and maybe even impress       George Washington.       Armed with a quill pen and conveniently disguised as a schoolmaster, the 21-year-old infiltrated the British encampment in Manhattan in September 1776 for several days and gathered intelligence on the British troops. He was headed back to his superiors, sketches in shoes, when he blew his cover before managing to share his discoveries. According to one account, he was too chatty with someone who turned out to be a Loyalist ranger. He was hanged in Manhattan two days later, his limp body dangling next to an effigy of Washington.By Virginia DeJohn Anderson  Oxford, 270 pages, $27.95Hale\u2019s death was heartbreaking, as young deaths always are: a tragedy of unfulfilled human potential. Dunbar\u2019s life was similarly tragic, although Ms. Anderson cannot reconstruct it in equally vivid detail owing to a paucity of sources. Unlike the privileged Hale, Dunbar was born on the economic margins, and he died there too. In between, he lived a life of hardship and heartache: an overbearing and overextended father, a dead mother, and a consuming fear that his own children were one bad harvest away from destitution, no matter how hard he hoed his little farm.Why would a poor man like Dunbar become a Loyalist? Certainly not because he had extra tax money sitting around to send to Parliament. His loyalty stemmed from his faith. Around 1764, he had left the local Congregational church, with its querulous worshipers and angry doctrinal schisms. Instead he joined the nearby Anglican Church, whose pastor breathed less hellfire and more harmony. Although Dunbar\u2019s conversion stemmed from local conditions rather than imperial politics, the political consequences proved enormous. Over the following decade, as Whig radicals readied their tar and feathers for anyone at odds with their protests of imperial policy, Anglicans in the colonies\u2014who were part of England\u2019s state church and who tended to fear mob rule even more than parliamentary rule\u2014became objects of suspicion.At first the mobs came for the clergy, who had sworn loyalty to the king upon ordination. Then they came for laymen like the 29-year-old Dunbar, who had stubbornly professed his sympathy for Britain. In the winter of 1775-76, Dunbar didn\u2019t stand a chance against the 40 patriots in Farmington, Conn., who cudgeled him nearly to death near his home. Then bad got worse: Dunbar\u2019s wife died, leaving him with five young children just as patriots finally drove him from town. The brokenhearted father joined the British in New York and recruited eight others, only to be seized on a brief furlough home and hanged for treason in March 1777, six months after Hale. He couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer for his trial.Most biographers dispense with their subjects\u2019 early years in a chapter or two before moving on to bigger things. Ms. Anderson, whose subjects died young, follows a different and revealing path. Her book explores what it was like to be young (and, it should be said, white and male) during the heady, horrifying revolutionary age. Relying on exhaustive archival research and richly informed speculation, Ms. Anderson reconstructs the fraught relationship between Dunbar and his father as well as the friendships of newly minted Yale grads who bared their feelings to one another as they navigated life, love and career after college. Although Ms. Anderson occasionally buries her narrative in extraneous detail, the overall result is a moving coming-of-age (and end-of-life) story as well as a military history and a spy thriller.Like the Museum of the American Revolution that recently opened in Philadelphia, and indeed like much current scholarship, Ms. Anderson\u2019s book emphasizes the Revolution\u2019s messiness and, at times, its ugliness. She plays down the abstract political ideologies that led some colonists to take sides; instead, she highlights the unintended political consequences of Dunbar\u2019s religious conversion and the social dimensions of Hale\u2019s decision to enlist alongside friends and patrons. By illuminating the divergent posthumous reputations of these two Connecticut Yankees, Ms. Anderson reminds us that posterity judges in unforeseen ways. You may have only one life to lose for your country, but you\u2019ll never know how that life\u2014or that country\u2014will be remembered.Ms. Fitz, a historian at Northwestern University, is the author of \u201cOur Sister Republics: The United States in an Age of American Revolutions.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lives-lost-for-their-countries-1499812053", "news_title": "Lives Lost for Their Countries", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,national,public security,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The prospect of a \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d grows likelier every day. In May the WannaCry ransomware attack, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers, disrupted health care and telecommunications across the world. American investigators now believe Russian hackers precipitated the continuing Gulf diplomatic crisis by planting false news stories on the Qatari state news agency\u2019s website. And late last month another ransomware outbreak, Petya, went global.Cyberattacks have become capable of much more than stealing consumer information or embarrassing business executives and politicians. Whether conducted by lone wolves or nation-states, they can compromise the safety of medical, food and water systems, disrupt transportation, or even destabilize nuclear plants. Such attacks can undermine democratic institutions or encourage violence by spreading false information. The cyber threat has become existential.Enhanced cybersecurity controls from private and public organizations are necessary but insufficient. The problem has not been lack of action. It is the multiplicity of programs and division of responsibility that diminish their effectiveness. At least 11 federal agencies bear significant responsibility for cybersecurity: the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department, three branches of the military, and three federal banking agencies.Congress should merge these disparate cybersecurity programs into one cabinet-level agency that also serves as the focal point for collaboration with the private economy. Call it the Department of Cybersecurity. This would be an extraordinary and risky measure, requiring careful implementation. But the magnitude of the danger, and the limits of America\u2019s current ability to defend against the cyber threat, compel a bold response. Some leaders in government and business say they doubt this kind of unification is feasible, but very few have questioned whether it is desirable.Lessons from the creation of the Department of Homeland Security 15 years ago can help Congress and the president implement the idea more smoothly. What to avoid? Fragmented congressional oversight\u2014more than 100 committees and subcommittees oversee the DHS. Constant bureaucratic turf battles have hurt the DHS\u2019s effectiveness. As did raising public anxiety while failing to provide concrete instructions for action: Initiatives like the DHS daily color codes should be avoided.The new agency would need a clearly defined mission, consolidation of reporting into a limited number of congressional committees, and an independent, expert body providing periodic review to ensure accountability. There is also an opportunity for the new agency to be formed in a more deliberate way, drawing on leadership from the private economy to promote efficiency and cost-effectiveness.Most important, the new agency should be led by someone with demonstrated management skills who is fully empowered to bring all the strands of cyberdefense together and to create a credible threat of retaliation. Leading candidates that come to mind are former NSA Chief       Keith B. Alexander,        former Assistant Treasury Secretary       Leslie Ireland,       Scott Charney       of             Microsoft                   and former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff       Edmund P. Giambastiani.This leader would inherit a group of agencies that are already collaborating more effectively than before 9/11, but there is still room to improve coordination. Civilian networks are separated from military ones. Jurisdictional limitations to domestic, or homeland, concerns impede global cooperation.Although coordination between the federal government and the private economy has improved, it is still not a substitute for a unified defense against a global threat. In today\u2019s multiagency environment, information and knowledge are too often isolated within individual agencies. As the DHS experience proved, agencies that have competing objectives eventually end up undermining the country\u2019s ability to address security challenges. These problems would be more effectively addressed by a single agency, if it had the authority to succeed.Perhaps most important, talent remains dispersed. Substantial cyber expertise exists throughout government, but these experts would be far more effective working under a unified command structure. Such an agency would be likely to attract the best and brightest at a time when those minds can mean the difference between cyber catastrophe and cyber protection.A unified federal agency would also be best suited to provide crucial coordination with state and local governments and the business community. Private companies are a critical source of technological breakthroughs and early warnings, and the states have often been laboratories for policy innovation. These efforts could be accelerated and enhanced through leadership from a single, properly structured federal authority.A new federal office for cybersecurity can provide the unification, collaboration, coherence, skills and leadership to implement a comprehensive policy that counters the existential cyber threats America must confront. Too much is at stake to ignore the problem any longer.Mr. Cohen, senior chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, served on the National Security Agency\u2019s Cyber Advisory Committee (2012-16).

A principled and active abolitionist, he participated in the Underground Railroad and defended       John Brown\u2019s       raid on Harpers Ferry. He spent a night in jail for refusing to pay taxes to support the Mexican-American War, which he regarded as an imperialist adventure and an attempt to extend slavery. His work, in revival half a century ago, helped inspire the modern environmental movement. He criticized many of the signs of industrial capitalism as it emerged in the 19th century, and he reviled the sort of people who were making it happen.Yet Thoreau was an extreme individualist. Had he lived to see the emergence of Marxist communism and other radical labor movements in the U.S., he would have skewered and dissected leftist collectivism of any and all varieties. He respected dissenters, even those he disagreed with. People in consensus\u2014or, he might say, those incapable of producing independent thought\u2014seemed to him slavish and not fully formed as persons. Above all, he was a consistent skeptic of and opponent of state power, the force which the left believes can cure the world.\u201cThe merely political aspect of the land is never very cheering; men are degraded when considered as the members of a political organization,\u201d Thoreau wrote in \u201cNatural History of Massachusetts.\u201d And in \u201cCivil Disobedience,\u201d his classic essay: \u201cGovernment never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way.\u201d He asserted that he would hate to think he was dependent on government and one of the goals of his experiment in domestic economy at       Walden Pond       was to prove he wasn\u2019t. Someone who would \u201cquietly declare war with the State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be in the streets defending ObamaCare.Thoreau argued in \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d that a man must not \u201cfor a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator.\u201d In his \u201cPlea for Captain John Brown,\u201d he added: \u201cIt is of no consequence whether a man breaks the law or not.\u201d These positions would be anathema to the state-worshipping left and the law-and-order right.Thoreau can\u2019t be explained by the modern understanding of left and right; annexing him to either side is the worst sort of anachronism. The influx of European immigrants and ideas to the U.S. in the late 19th century permanently changed politics by introducing the modern left-right spectrum, deriving in part from       Karl Marx\u2019s       writings. So beware contemporary thinkers who try to claim Thoreau as their own.Not that there is anything contradictory about the thinker\u2019s views. It is precisely their consistency that puts them at odds with today\u2019s political divisions. The modern political spectrum, embroiled in tension and contradiction, simply cannot account for many legitimate political philosophies like Thoreau\u2019s.While the 19th-century feminist and peace movements, like radical abolitionism, were driven by individualism, today\u2019s progressives appear more committed to collective identities than to any particular position. The movement is driven by an urge to merge, to become one consciousness with members of the same class, race or gender. Right-wing nationalism displays the same collective impulse.Thoreau insisted that collective identities ignore the reality of individual difference and can be simulated only by massive coercion. And since Thoreau\u2019s era, attempts to forge collective identities or combine many people into a single mind\u2014think Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution\u2014have killed millions of actual human individuals.Ever since the polarization of left and right in the late 19th century, the world has suffered from a series of dangerous isms: murderous communism and bloody fascism, nationalism and internationalism, rapacious capitalism and compulsory collectivism. Turn on your television and you\u2019ll see the world suffering from an extremely confused polarization. On Thoreau\u2019s 200th birthday, maybe it\u2019s time to think about political possibilities afresh.Mr. Sartwell teaches at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa.

A growing number of Iraq\u2019s Sunnis are disenchanted with the slow pace of reconstruction and frustrated with a Baghdad government they consider too friendly to Iran. The U.S. needs to shift its focus quickly from supporting military operations in cities such as Mosul to helping the Iraqi government better address political grievances. Failure risks sowing the seeds of ISIS\u2019s resurgence.ISIS started strong in 2014, taking advantage of Sunni grievances against the Iraqi government. At its peak, according to a Rand Corp. analysis, ISIS controlled nearly 58,000 square kilometers of territory in Iraq, home to more than six million people. But beginning in 2016 the group lost significant territory in cities like Sinjar, Fallujah, Ramadi and now most of Mosul to a combination of U.S. and allied strikes, ground assaults by the Iraqi security forces, and Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish militia advances.Despite these successes, there are troubling signs in Iraq, particularly within the Sunni Arab community. Take the western city of Fallujah. A year after Iraqi forces liberated the city, residents are disenchanted because of the slow pace of rebuilding, the absence of government services and skyrocketing unemployment. \u201cThis area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now,\u201d       Hussein Ahmed,        a Fallujah resident, told a visiting journalist earlier this year. \u201cI speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us.\u201dMany Sunnis also look warily at growing Iranian influence. Tehran is committed to increasing its influence in Iraq through such organizations as the Popular Mobilization Units, militias that include as many as 150,000 Shiite fighters. To the consternation of many Sunnis, Iraq\u2019s parliament passed a law in December 2016 formally integrating the Popular Mobilization Units into Iraq\u2019s security forces. Today, such Shiite forces are nearly as large as the entire Iraqi army.ISIS fighters are attempting to leverage these grievances in several ways. Its operatives have recruited new members who are unhappy about the pace of reconstruction in Sunni towns and cities, angry about friends or family members who have been abused by pro-government militias, and nervous about Iran\u2019s growing influence in the country. Iraq\u2019s security services have noted with alarm that ISIS cells are re-establishing intelligence networks in Ramadi and Fallujah. Even after last week\u2019s defeat in Mosul, ISIS still holds nearly 10,000 square kilometers of territory in Iraq with a total population of one million, including the western city of al Qa\u2019im. It also boasts over 15,000 fighters across the Iraq-Syria battlefield and more than $500 million in annual revenue through the end of 2016, though ISIS\u2019s monthly revenues have declined in 2017.ISIS is also shifting from conventional to guerrilla operations, including ambushes, raids, suicide attacks, car bombs and assassinations. The group is relocating its personnel and battlefield supplies to mountains, caves and desert areas around the Iraqi city of Haditha, Lake Tharthar, and the Iraq-Syria border region. ISIS has also used multi-rotor and fixed wing drones for surveillance and, occasionally, strike missions. In addition, the group is restructuring its wilayahs, or provinces, and decentralizing its organizational structure in Syria and Iraq to conduct more effective guerrilla operations.In light of these developments, the U.S. should establish a more aggressive political strategy to prevent Islamic State\u2019s revitalization. U.S. diplomats and military leaders need to encourage Iraqi leaders to better address Sunni grievances. One step would be to cut in half the number of Shiite forces under the Popular Mobilization Units and transition militia fighters to civilian employment. U.S. officials might also press Baghdad to withdraw Shiite militias from the Iraq-Syria border, including in Nineveh, where they facilitate a regional pipeline of Shiite fighters from Iran all the way to Lebanon.In addition, the U.S. should help coordinate international assistance coming into Iraq, with an emphasis on rapid repair of damaged infrastructure in urban centers like Mosul, Ramadi, Fallujah and Beiji. Reconstruction assistance should be openly associated with efforts to move the Iraqi government and Sunni Arabs closer together.Islamic State\u2019s predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, began to reconstitute itself in 2011 in part because of Baghdad\u2019s failure to address Sunni grievances and Washington\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces and inability to influence Iraqi politics. It would be doubly tragic to make the same mistake again today.Mr. Jones is director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corp. and author of \u201cWaging Insurgent Warfare: Lessons from the Vietcong to the Islamic State\u201d (Oxford).", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraq-declares-victory-in-mosul-but-the-war-is-far-from-over-1499811405", "news_title": "Iraq Declares Victory in Mosul, but the War Is Far From Over", "keywords": "daesh,iraq,isis,islamic state,mosul,raqqa,al Qaeda in Iraq,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "From \u201cFor Trump Critics, to Follow Is to Lead\u201d by       Byron York       at the Washington Examiner, July\u00a010:President       Trump\u2019s       performance at the G-20 summit in Germany produced a wave of commentary claiming the United States has abdicated its role as world leader.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.The talking point quickly became conventional wisdom in Europe.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.While there were disagreements in Hamburg between Trump and the other 19 nations on lots of things, including trade, the main factor in all the end-of-American-leadership talk was the president\u2019s decision to pull out of the       Paris Climate       Accord.The idea is that, by not going along with the other 19 nations .\u00a0.\u00a0. the United States is no longer leading.In other words: One can only lead by following the group.It\u2019s an odd formulation, reminiscent of the old       Barack Obama       \u201cleading from behind\u201d jokes.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/notable-quotable-leading-by-following-1499811353", "news_title": "Notable & Quotable: Leading by Following", "keywords": "climate change,europe,g20,leading from behind,trump,political,general news,commentaries,opinions,editorials,routine general news"}, {"content": "New York City\u2019s medical examiner ruled Tuesday that the deaths of two toddlers this week were homicides, according to city officials.Olivia Gee,        2 years old, and her brother       Micah Gee,        3, each died of \u201cblunt impact\u201d to the torso, said a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\u201cOur city is mourning the loss of two young children in a tragedy Monday in the Bronx,\u201d Mayor       Bill de Blasio       said in a statement, adding that the New York Police Department and the Administration for Children\u2019s Services were investigating the incident. \u201cAs a parent, it\u2019s very painful for me to think about the death of these two children and what the family is going through right now.\u201dThe boyfriend of the toddlers\u2019 mother saw the children weren\u2019t breathing in the early hours of Monday, law-enforcement officials said.

But with major central banks now expected to shut off the bond-buying taps, one pillar of support is fading and so too are some investors\u2019 optimistic outlook for stocks.Investors are asking: Can stocks keep climbing if the bond market gets hit?While few predict a major stock meltdown, a U.S. market that is at record highs is more exposed to any signs of an economic downturn, investors say. Many now expect returns from stocks to be more muted and for volatility to move higher.Stocks that led this year\u2019s rally, particularly U.S. technology and health-care companies, are expected to come under further pressure, and those that benefit from higher yields, like banks, have been gaining.Some investors are considering looking outside the U.S., where benchmarks like those in Europe trade at a cheaper price and are more weighted to banks.\u201cI\u2019ve been a bit more cautious in our portfolios, reducing equity exposure\u201d said       Ed Keon,        portfolio manager at QMA, a multiasset manager owned by             Prudential Financial.       \u201cEquity valuations are at historic highs, interest rates are quite low...so I think the risk that there\u2019s a miscalculation or unexpected reaction is greater than it would be under ordinary circumstances.\u201dThe value of shares depends on how much money companies are expected to generate in the future. When interest rates rise, investors may be able to get a similar return investing in a risk-free bond.Yields on 10-year Treasury notes have climbed to around 2.4% from around 2.2% in the two weeks since several important central banks started signaling an exit from stimulus programs. The S&P 500 has fallen around 1% in that period, while the Stoxx Europe 600 has given up two and half months of gains.After a long period of calm, the             CBOE        CBOE -0.23%       Volatility Index, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, has climbed 10%, albeit off ultralow levels. The S&P 500 tech sector, the first half\u2019s best performer, has shed around 2% since yields started climbing two weeks ago, while banks in the index have gained roughly 5%. Higher rates tend to benefit banks\u2019 net interest margins, while reducing the appeal of so-called growth stocks trading at a premium to the market.The latest rise in the U.S. 10-year yield hasn\u2019t reached heights that analysts fear could damage prospects for stocks, but it wouldn\u2019t take a huge selloff to get to those levels. Analysts at             Morgan Stanley,       for instance, are watching 2.75% as a threshold where they might turn less optimistic on U.S. equities.That level, combined with the average historical equity risk premium, or the extra return demanded for holding stocks over safe Treasurys, would suggest a price-to-earnings level of roughly 19 on the S&P 500. Any higher on the Treasury yield, and stocks could start to come under pressure, they say.For much of the past year, stocks actually climbed as bonds were sold. The fact that investors were dumping debt on expectations for stronger economic growth and inflation was seen as good for equity.\u201cInvestors started to think higher real rates and equities could go up because you have a robust underlying economy,\u201d said       Mahmood Noorani,        founder of Quant Insight, which looks at trading patterns across asset classes.But investors have taken recent rises in yields as more of a reflection of shifting monetary policy than a buoyant economy.Comments from central bankers in the U.S., Canada, eurozone and Britain have signaled that the days of easy money are nearing an end. Meanwhile, some analysts are less sure that American economic growth will be as robust as once thought. U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of just 1.4% in the first quarter.To be sure, bond yields remain low by historic standards and below the high of around 2.6% reached in March.\u00a0A combination of steady economic growth later in the year and brightening corporate earnings may keep the market buoyant enough to withstand an orderly adjustment of bond yields, some investors say.\u201cI think we\u2019d need to get more concerned about growth to get really bearish about equities,\u201d said       Paul O\u2019Connor,        head of multiasset at       Janus Henderson.But some investors are already planning for a further climb in yields. Investors withdrew money from U.S. equity funds last week for the eighth time in 10 weeks, while European equity funds snapped a 14-week inflow streak and emerging market equity inflows moderated to their lowest since March, according to fund-tracker EPFR Global.\u201cMy worry for the second half [of the year] is you get more economic growth, but the market doesn\u2019t respond as favorably\u00a0because it means central banks are taking away the punch bowl,\u201d said       Brent Schutte,        chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\u2014Akane Otani contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 18:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-bond-yields-spur-concern-on-stocks-1499811250", "news_title": "Rising Bond Yields Spur Concern on Stocks  ", "keywords": "bonds,central banks,easy money,equity,european central bank,monetary policy,monetary stimulus,stocks,treasury notes,S&P 500,CBOE Holdings,CBOE,central bank intervention,economic news,equity markets,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,dow jones top stories,hot stocks,top wire news,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,banking,central banking,health care,life sciences,credit,financial services,investing,securities,technology"}, {"content": "It\u2019s mid-July, which means time for iPhone Mad Libs:Hey Joanna! My iPhone [number] is on its last [part of the body plural]. Its [part of the phone] is busted. [Expletive]! Should I buy a new iPhone now? Or should I wait for the new one? Is the new one going to be so [adjective] that it defies all we know about [noun]? Or just more of the same?My answer requires no filling in the blanks. Do NOT buy an iPhone right now. It\u2019s my annual iPhone No-Buy Rule\u2122: Once summer rolls around wait for the new one, typically announced in early September.This year, there\u2019s more reason than ever to wait. According to my WSJ colleagues, in addition to an updated iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, there will be a special model that\u2019s expected to have an OLED screen, wireless charging and facial-recognition technology. Apple declined to comment on the reports.Even if you couldn\u2019t care less about fancy-schmancy new tech, there are other reasons to hold out. If iPhone-istory repeats itself, Apple will drop the price on the current iPhone 7 models by $100 or more. And now that carrier contracts are all but dead, you may have your phone for two to three years\u2014or at least until something goes wrong with it.Which brings us to our haggard iPhone 6 and 6s. It turns out most of their common problems can be fixed\u2014with money and/or time. Why sink any cash into a phone you\u2019re going to replace? Because it could up your resale value, and it will definitely empower you to buy your next phone only when the time is right.Before you walk into that new iPhone repair shop that opened up next to the juice bar, remember: Some replacement screens are hardly better than the cracked ones.How do you know you\u2019re getting the good kind? Your safest bet is going to an Apple-authorized service provider\u2014not just Apple Stores but over 4,000 locations world-wide including             Best Buy                   and many local shops. (The Apple Support app can pinpoint one close to you.)I also suggest considering iCracked. Despite its not being an authorized service provider, it does use high-quality screens. Available in 100 U.S. metro areas, the service sends a technician to where you are (home, office, coffee shop) and fixes the issue in under an hour. I\u2019ve had very good experiences with the service. If anything seems off after the repair, iCracked guarantees a part replacement at no added cost.Resale value? It\u2019s a trade-off. Send in an iPhone 6 that looks like Charlotte\u2019s web to used-phone reseller Gazelle.com, and you get $50. Or spend $90 to replace the screen at iCracked, and you can probably sell it for $120. The cost of prolonging your phone\u2019s life? $20.Yanyan Ji, Gazelle\u2019s general manager, expects prices to stay steady until after Apple unveils the new iPhones. At Gazelle, you have 30 days to send in your device after locking in a price quote, and you can back out at any time.\u201cEveryone with an iPhone 6 should get a new battery,\u201d says repair guru and iFixit Chief Executive       Kyle Wiens.After 500 charge cycles, the iPhone battery can lose 20% or more of its original capacity. If you bring an iPhone into an Apple store, geniuses will run diagnostics to check its battery capacity. If it\u2019s lower than 80%, Apple will replace the battery for $79\u2014or free with AppleCare. (They can also try to extend your phone\u2019s battery life by examining its apps and settings.) iCracked will swap any battery for $60.There\u2019s a more affordable fix: Replace the battery yourself with iFixit\u2019s $20 kit. Mr. Wiens told me that if you are \u201cremotely tech savvy,\u201d you can do it. What he should have said is, \u201cYou can do it, you\u2019ll just be terrified and sweating through your shirt the whole time.\u201d Never forget the lessons of the Galaxy Note 7: Lithium-ion batteries really are flammable. Do not puncture.Spontaneous combustion aside, if you replace the wrong screw or fail to reconnect a circuit correctly, you can create a much bigger problem. After I got the battery inside and sealed up the phone, my screen wouldn\u2019t stop flashing. I was able to go back and fix the problem, but not everyone can be so lucky.I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by the difficulty. Greenpeace and iFixit recently named Apple products among the least repairable. \u201cHighly integrated design allows us to make products that are not only beautiful, thin and powerful, but also durable, so they can last for many years. When repairs are needed, authorized providers can ensure the quality, safety and security of repairs for customers,\u201d an Apple spokeswoman said.I can\u2019t recommend this option to most, though at the end, the euphoria is a nerd\u2019s equivalent of summiting Mount Everest. If you do try it, please back up your phone data and take all the proper safety precautions. When you\u2019re done, deposit the used battery at Best Buy or another e-cycling depot.Another common power issue? A Lightning port that requires cord futzing to get the phone to charge. My iCracked technician removed the equivalent of bellybutton lint and the port worked fine. If something is really wrong, the port can be replaced for about $60.Resale value? Don\u2019t assume that a noncosmetic issue isn\u2019t worth repairing. Gazelle said trade-in values can be lowered for shoddy batteries and phones that don\u2019t reliably charge.Low storage and poor performance aren\u2019t reason enough to get a new phone. First, try some simple software fixes from the comfort of your own couch.When it comes to freeing up storage, check out my previous advice. Back up photos and videos to a cloud service, clear out hidden cached files and delete media stored in old texts and iMessages.To boost performance, use these hidden tricks:New Mad Lib: \u201cMy iPhone [number] is working so [adverb], I no longer [verb] that [adjective] new iPhone.\u201dWrite to Joanna Stern at joanna.stern@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   There are 4,000             Apple Inc.

The MSCI Emerging Market currencies index is near an eight-week low, while emerging-market stocks stand near their lowest level since late May. Investors pulled nearly $820 million out of the iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF in the five days through Friday, the biggest weekly outflow since the fund was launched in 2007, according to data from FactSet.Driving the selling are signs that central banks from Europe, the U.K. and Canada may be winding down years of stimulus, as growth finally picks up around the world. Those expectations are pushing up bond yields in the developed world and lessening the attractiveness of emerging markets, where investors take on greater risk for comparatively richer yields.Investors are closely watching the moves in emerging markets as a barometer for how other popular risky investments, such as high yield-debt, will react to a shift in global monetary policy. Emerging-market assets tumbled in 2013 amid fears the Federal Reserve was about to begin tapering its massive postcrisis bond-buying program, though few expect such a plunge now.Investors want to see whether central banks \u201ccan normalize rates without some economies tipping over the cliff,\u201d said Christian Lawrence, senior market strategist at Rabobank.The moves temper what had been a long surge for emerging markets, which rewarded investors with big gains in 2016 after three straight years of losses and have continued to power higher this year. Now some investors are culling their portfolios, dropping assets that have climbed during the rally or are vulnerable due to political concerns.Kisoo Park, a global bond manager at Manulife Asset Management in Hong Kong, said global rates would probably rise more than many investors and analysts currently expect, but not to levels high enough to spur large outflows from emerging markets.\u201cYou want to be in a country that has an improving fundamental trend and high yields, like Indonesia and India,\u201d he said, adding that he owns bonds in both countries.Write to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Emerging-Markets Rally Shows Cracks.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/funds-pulled-from-top-emerging-market-etf-as-central-banks-signal-tighter-policy-1499772105", "news_title": "Shifting Monetary-Policy Outlook Imperils Rally in Emerging Markets", "keywords": " bonds, central bank, developing, dollar debt, emerging,etf, fed, interest rates, markets, usd,iShares J.P.

If a thrifty, sensible legislator refuses a pension boost, another will displace him or her at the next election. It is unreasonable for the Journal or anyone else to expect legislators to do good if they have to wreck their careers doing so. What we need is a way to relieve legislators from the personal blame for making unpopular but sensible financial choices.One way to do this is to create an automatic feedback mechanism that ties government salaries and pension plans to reliable financial or other standard-of-living metrics such as the GDP, or a GDP for a given state or GDP per capita in any given state or city. If the metric rises or falls, pension plans and salaries would correspondingly rise and fall. That way legislators would be motivated to do everything possible to improve the standard of living or GDP per capita, rather than continually risk bankruptcy to stay in office.John BarchilonLos AngelesIn recent years, a number of states have failed to meet their legal, contractual and moral obligations to contribute to pension funds for their workers.

The new submission date is roughly two years earlier than Amicus had planned previously.Last year, under the Obama administration, the FDA asked Amicus to run an additional clinical trial to assess the drug\u2019s effect on gastrointestinal symptoms in Fabry patients, before applying for marketing approval. Amicus said in November it planned to conduct the study, and that results weren\u2019t expected until 2019.But Amicus had subsequent discussions with the FDA starting late last year, and in recent days the agency told the company it will allow it to submit its marketing application based on clinical data from prior studies, Amicus Chief Executive       John Crowley       said in an interview. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.

Dr. Gottlieb, a health-care investor and physician, has vowed to speed up a drug-approval process that in the past he has criticized as slow and burdensome, though some experts noted the agency cleared a relatively high number of new drugs in recent years.The Amicus news Tuesday suggests Dr. Gottlieb is bringing \u201ca much more pragmatic and practical approach to drug development, something less rigid a little more holistic than previous\u201d FDA practices, Cowen & Co. biotechnology analyst       Ritu Baral       said in an interview.Ms. Baral said there is already solid clinical-trial data supporting the safety and efficacy of the Amicus drug, which was approved for marketing by European regulators last year.Amicus shares rose 25.9% to $12.92 Tuesday.Mr. Crowley gained fame by leading another startup company in the early 2000s to develop a drug for a rare genetic disease afflicting two of his children.

These days, a number of nationally prominent food and drink brands have opened permanent or pop-up retail outlets in New York City.Kellogg                   has its Kellogg\u2019s NYC, a cereal cafe in Times Square where bowls of the morning favorite are served all day in a wide range of preparations. Chobani, the Greek yogurt line, has Chobani Caf\u00e9 locations in SoHo and Tribeca, where yogurt figures into everything from drinks to salad dressings.Smaller brands also are getting into the act: Dirty Lemon, an upstart beverage company that specializes in elixir-oriented drinks with names such as \u201cSleep\u201d and \u201cDetox,\u201d recently opened the Drug Store, billed as a \u201cnon-alcoholic cocktail bar,\u201d in Nolita.Brands say they are going the open-your-own-store route as a way to tell their stories\u2014rather than relying on other retailers to do it for them.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this in the grocery\u201d store, said Pure Leaf senior marketing director       Laraine Miller,        speaking of the tea house\u2019s elaborate setup.

Prosecutions related to foreign-national donations have generally dealt with charges of funneling cash. However, a donation can be \u201canything of value.\u201dThe new emails don\u2019t amount to a slam-dunk indictment of Mr. Trump Jr., the legal experts say, but could help build a criminal or civil-enforcement case.\u201cThere is a serious issue here for the special counsel to investigate,\u201d said election-law scholar       Richard Hasen       at the University of California, Irvine, referring to special counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Mr. Trump Jr. said he realized soon after meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya that she \u201chad no information to provide\u201d but said she mostly railed against the Magnitsky Act, a federal law that places sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers.\u201cI have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government,\u201d Ms. Veselnitskaya said.That Mr. Trump Jr. came away empty-handed may be a mitigating factor, but as a defense, it is limited. Soliciting a foreign campaign contribution can be illegal even if the donation doesn\u2019t pan out. What matters is that there was an expectation of getting something valuable.Opposition research on a political foe could be considered something of value, particularly if the supplier of the information spent money to obtain it, election-law experts say. The Federal Election Commission has said the definition can encompass goods or services, like air travel or food, provided free or at below-market rates. Information can be a gift too, like polling data or donor lists.The released email exchanges don\u2019t show Mr. Trump Jr. as the one approaching the Russians but convey his eagerness in acquiring information that could hurt Mrs. Clinton.After a publicist emailed Mr. Trump Jr. saying Russia was offering to provide incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump Jr. replied, \u201c...if it\u2019s what you say, I love it.\u201d Mr. Trump Jr. said in a statement he thought the meeting would provide him with political-opposition research.Lawrence Noble,        a former FEC general counsel, said he thinks Mr. Trump Jr. solicited an illegal foreign contribution.\u201cHe was told this was coming from the Russian government and was part of their effort to help Donald Trump,\u201d said Mr. Noble, who is now senior director and general counsel at the campaign-finance watchdog Campaign Legal Center. \u201cHe eagerly accepted it and agreed to meet with her. He clearly solicited a foreign contribution, with the contribution being the value of the information.\u201dSen.       Tim Kaine       (D., Va.) told reporters on Tuesday that the situation with Mr. Trump Jr. was \u201cpotentially treason.\u201d U.S. Reps.       Seth Moulton       (D., Mass.) and       Ted Lieu       (D., Calif.) also posted tweets on Tuesday that suggested Mr. Trump Jr.\u2019s behavior was treason.Legal experts say Mr. Trump Jr. is unlikely to have committed treason under the U.S. Constitution or a federal statute. The Constitution says, \u201cTreason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\u201d\u201cRussia isn\u2019t an enemy for the purposes of American treason law,\u201d said       Carlton Larson,        a University of California, Davis legal historian who has written on treason prosecutions.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com and Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Legal Problems May Await President\u2019s Son.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emails-pose-potential-problem-for-trump-jr-after-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-1499809060", "news_title": "Emails Pose Potential Problem for Trump Jr. After Meeting With Russian Lawyer", "keywords": "donald trump jr.,election meddling,natalia veselnitskaya,russia,Federal Election Commission,Donald Trump Jr,Hillary Clinton,Carlton Larson,Lawrence Noble,Natalia Veselnitskaya,Richard Hasen,Robert Mueller,Seth Moulton,Ted Lieu,Tim Kaine,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Cleveland Fed President       Loretta Mester       spoke with Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos on Thursday, July 6, in Cleveland. She discussed Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, plans to beginning shrinking the central bank\u2019s portfolio of Treasury and mortgage securities, and the outlook on inflation. Here is a partial transcript of the interview, lightly edited for clarity and length.NICK TIMIRAOS: In the [June meeting] minutes yesterday there was a little bit of discussion, it said some participants had observed or had heard from businesses about changing expectations on fiscal policy. And so I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve heard of businesses maybe dialing back their expectations because of less of a fiscal impulse.LORETTA MESTER: That\u2019s interesting. So, I mean, we queried our businesses over time to see what their expectations were in terms of sort of what their plans were for investment. And certainly, there was increased sentiment. Business sentiment went up after the election and people were saying that they expected some fiscal policy action. But most of the businesses we talked to weren\u2019t putting in plans based on that kind of policy. They anticipated that we might see some pro\u2014what they would call pro-growth policies on tax reform and regulatory changes. But they weren\u2019t actually acting on it, even though if they were responding to sentiment surveys they would say positive sentiment. So that was kind of instructive in the sense that then if their sentiment changes, they were\u2014we weren\u2019t going to see a pullback in those plans.But what they did tell me, because I was concerned about the same thing. It\u2019s like, oh, if you\u2019re putting in plans and then you don\u2019t get as much action\u2014because, as you know, it seems like it\u2019s less likely, at least from the beginning expectations\u2014are you still seeing that the environment has changed in a positive way for your business? And then they told me that even if it was just status quo, they viewed that as positive in a pro-business environment, because they were worried about increasing regulatory burden, not just from current regulation but even more. So they were sort of still positive about what they viewed as a good climate for business because of that aspect of it. So I found that was very interesting then. It was sort of like even the status quo, given the change in government, they viewed as a positive.So we haven\u2019t heard that businesses are not re-evaluating things in terms of their plans. They\u2019re basically moving forward with their plans. Some are hiring people. Some are now saying that they have to increase wages because it\u2019s very difficult to hire the staff they need with the quality workers they need. We\u2019re hearing that more, not only in high skilled jobs but also in the lower skilled jobs now. So that seems to be\u2014so the labor market, both regionally and nationally, I think, is on track. It\u2019s strong. We\u2019ll get the report tomorrow to see what the number is. But if you look at the last three months, we\u2019re well above or at the high end of estimates of a strong\u2014a strong labor market.So the labor market is on track. You know, 4.3 [percent] on the unemployment rate. The other measures that are broader measures that some people like to focus on, they\u2019re all coming down. So I think we\u2019re probably a little beyond full employment from that point of view. I have moved out my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment from 5 to about 4\u00be [percent] because when you look at sort of the data on inflation, where unemployment has moved I have to take that on board. But even with that we\u2019re still beyond full employment from the point of view of what monetary policy affect. I know there are longer term structural issues in the labor market that we might be able to change, but not with monetary policy.MR. TIMIRAOS: Has your outlook changed relative to maybe where things looked in January about what were \u2013MS. MESTER: About fiscal policy or more general?MR. TIMIRAOS: Yes, fiscal policy. What we\u2019re going to get or the timing of it. Has that changed? Has your view of that changed?MS. MESTER: Not really, because I never built in a large fiscal policy boost. I was always a little skeptical that things would all of a sudden get all these changes. And I\u2019m also wanting to see what\u2019s in the packages, right? If you\u2019re trying to evaluate what impact they\u2019re going to have over the medium run, which is the time horizon for monetary policy, you need to see what the packages look like. And we just\u2014there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about what\u2019s going to be in the packages or when they\u2019ll get enacted, just precisely what the details are. So it\u2019s kind of hard to assess it.I did build in a little bit of a stimulus\u2014you know, near-term stimulus, because I thought that that was likely. But that wasn\u2019t what was driving my outlook for being a little bit above trend growth. It was really about the momentum in the economy, the developments we\u2019ve seen in terms of businesses starting to actually invest now, which we hadn\u2019t seen before, which I think is a positive. And then consumer spending staying pretty good. I mean, we\u2019ve got some little weaker reports there, but still it\u2019s a pretty good report \u2026And so I still think that we\u2019re on basically the same trajectory that we were on, notwithstanding a couple of weak data points. But if you think about smooth through that. I think people tend to focus on each data point. And I\u2014and I don\u2019t like to do that because the data are volatile and cellphone plans can affect inflation numbers and prescription drug plans can affect them. So you have to smooth through some of that.MR. TIMIRAOS: On the labor issues, have potential changes in immigration policy\u2014do you see any potential affect that could have on the labor supply and potentially exacerbating some of these \u2026MS. MESTER: Well, I think we are in a\u2014you know, the demographics suggest that we\u2019re going to continue to need to import labor. And immigration policy obviously affects that. And we want to\u2014we want to attract high-performing, high-skilled workers to this country. So I do have some concerns, and I think I mentioned this in the speech you just mentioned that that\u2019s one of the policies that actually could be a pro-growth policy, if you have immigration that actually brings in skilled workers.So it could either way. And again, that\u2019s another one of these policies that we don\u2019t know what the details are going to be. But we do have\u2014you know, 16 percent of our workforce is immigrants. And we want to have an immigration policy that is pro\u2014you know, can help us get the skills that we need for the U.S. economy.MR. TIMIRAOS: Right. And then, thinking about the jobs report, not just the report tomorrow but in general now that we have an unemployment rate that is below I think the median forecast of Nairu [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment], now that\u2014and it has continued to tick down, I think, in each of the last three or four months\u2014what would be the most constructive data points you would be looking for, again, not just in one jobs report but over the\u2014over the near term here? What are the things that would kind of give you the most comfort? And would a continued decline in the unemployment rate be a sign of concern at this point?MS. MESTER: Well, so we\u2019re at the lowest point\u2014I think we\u2019re at\u2014we\u2019re below the lowest\u2014we\u2019re certainly at the level of, I think, 2001. And we\u2019re below the unemployment rate that we got in the last expansion. So we\u2019re getting to a point where\u2014and we had to take on board sort of what we\u2019ve learned over history. I know a lot of people want to say, like, well, this time it\u2019s different. And there certainly are things different, but you can\u2019t throw away all your history.And in the past, what we\u2019ve learned was that we can generate sustainable expansions and what people have called soft landings. But typically what you have to be doing is preemptive monetary policy. You have to move before you\u2019ve hit your goals. In other words, so even in real-time estimates of that natural rate of unemployment, right, you need to sort of begin taking away accommodation preemptively, so before you get there. And coupled with that, you need to have had some\u2014once the economy does start slowing from there, you need to have good shocks or at least small shocks at the economy.So soft landings are difficult to navigate, but we\u2019ve been able to do that. And one of the key components is being a little preemptive. So there\u2019s some people who have advocated, well, let\u2019s just wait until inflation gets up to our goal or even beyond our goal, since we\u2019ve been below our goal for a while. And I guess sure, this time could be different. Our estimates of unemployment, the natural rates, have come down, no doubt. But history tell us that you want to be preemptive. And so I always like to think about we have to be moving policy, right, before we get to our goals. You have to\u2014because monetary policy takes a while to work.So I\u2019m still viewing the economy as on track for that gradual pace of funds rate increases. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re behind the curve yet. So you\u2019re saying, well, what do you\u2014how would you assess whether you\u2019re behind the curve? So I like to look at models. I like to look at the data. I like to talk to businesses to see how much difficulty they\u2019re having hiring workers. And, sure, you want to see whether firms are raising their wages as part of that\u2014you know, as a metric ...[Wages] are rising. Are they at the levels\u2014the accelerations we saw in past cycles? No. But also, a big component of that is the low productivity growth we have, right? So if you\u2019re paid the marginal product of your labor, when productivity growth is low, wages are going to be low. And I think that explains much of it. Also, wages are lagging indicators, right? So you don\u2019t see wages go up, and then you get sort of inflation up.So again, I think it\u2019s a prudent path that we\u2019re on, in the sense that we have begun taking back some of the accommodation. The path of, at least in the [Fed\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections], is a very gradual withdrawal of that accommodation, which takes into account some of the things we\u2019re talking about, some of the uncertainties around where is the natural rate of unemployment, some of the fact that we haven\u2019t seen inflation accelerate. You know, we\u2019re still below our goal. So that prudent path, I think, balances some of these tradeoffs, right? And it also takes into account that we\u2019ve been at very low interest rates for a very long time.We do see stock prices moving up. We have very low equity premia. We have low volatility. So we\u2019re balancing those kinds of aspects too of a low interest rate policy, some of the potential risks there. And this prudent upward path, I think, takes those things into account. So that\u2019s why I think that\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m still on board with that as being sort of the thing that balances, because the whole idea is to calibrate policy in a way that sustains the recovery.MR. TIMIRAOS: So you mentioned some of the inflation softness, but also easier financial conditions. Since December, a period in which you have raised rates three times by a quarter point, do you see the easier financial conditions right now? I know they\u2019re kind of apples and oranges, but offsetting the softness in inflation when it comes to kind of charting the policy path forward?MS. MESTER: So we certainly look at financial conditions as part of the economic outlook, right? And so I\u2019d like to take those into account. But you kind of ask yourself, well, why are they\u2014you know, why are long rates lower? You know, why did\u2014the first time we raised rates the long rates went down. Well, why is that happening? Some of that was not the real rate, it was part of the\u2014you know, the premium on long rates. So in other words, there\u2019s, like, flights to quality, so people buying U.S. assets, given some of these things you learn in\u2014abroad, right, that also affects those long rates.So I don\u2019t see anything in the long rates that suggest to me that we have a fall off on demand that I would be worried about in terms of, like, going into recession, because people like to look at the shape of the yield curve as an indicator. There\u2019s a correlation there, but there\u2019s not causation. And given where the economy is, I suspect that as we continue to raise the short rate, we\u2019ll see the long rate go up. And we\u2019ve seen it bounce around. It has gone up, if you look at \u2013MR. TIMIRAOS: Yeah. The last week or two \u2013MS. MESTER: Yeah, exactly. So again, we certainly want to take that into account. When it\u2019s easier to borrow you look at that and say, OK, that could be stimulative. And so you want to calibrate your policy to it. But I don\u2019t see anything in there that would say we\u2019re going to trade that off, right? And because that\u2019s lower we may have to raise the short rate more. I mean, I like to look at sort of, like, what our outcomes are in the real economy, not sort of do a one-for-one on long rates versus short rates and twisting the yield curve. I think that\u2019s hard to calibrate and manage.MR. TIMIRAOS: [Fed] Chair [Janet] Yellen and others have said they think the softness in inflation will be transitory. I think you said that in May. Is that still your view? How concerned are you that some of the\u2014obviously the wireless and the prescription drugs are idiosyncratic and they\u2019ll fall out\u2014the drops will fall out in a year. But some of the health services measures, even I think housing\u2014the shelter components is\u2014it\u2019s slowed down a little bit. How do you judge kind of the balance of risk there?MS. MESTER: I certainly am looking at all those measures, right, because when you get a couple of reports you kind of look under the hood to see sort of, like, is that telling you that demand is falling off, because that\u2019s the concern, right? The concern on what does the inflation numbers tell you? Well, when it\u2019s going down, it\u2019s\u2014if it\u2019s going down because demand is weak, then that\u2019s telling you that you need to take that very seriously. Or, is it supply-side things, like the prescription drug prices or competition or other things which would be less indicative of sort of the demand side of the economy.At this point, I still think that an upward path, inflation moving back to 2 percent, is the right forecast, certainly my projection. But we want to look at those data and we want to keep monitoring it. I haven\u2019t changed my outlook yet, but certainly when you see a couple of weak reports you got to look at it seriously. I think these changes to the cellphone plans\u2014they can take\u2014even though it\u2019s a one-off thing, depending on when it comes in the month, it could last, like, three months and affect the numbers. So again, it\u2019s transitory, but maybe more transitory than at first blush someone might think. And so I think that\u2019s something also you have to take into account.And I always think on all of these things, is that there is this tendency to react or at least in the headlines to react to one month\u2019s number. And I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good way of thinking about monetary policy. I think we got to be sort of thinking deliberately about, OK, data comes in, does it change your economic outlook? Yes? Then you might change your policy path. If it isn\u2019t significant enough to change your medium-run outlook, then you\u2019re still on board with sort of where you think the trajectory is.So some people have said, well, the fact that the Fed moved interest rates up even though they got some weaker data suggests that they\u2019re not data dependent. I reject that. I mean, we are very much looking at the data. But we\u2019re not going to react to any one data point. We\u2019re going to react to whether the\u2014you know, the group of data is telling us\u2014what it\u2019s telling us about our outlook. You know, is growth still at or slightly above trend? Is inflation on a trajectory to move toward our goal of 2 percent? Is\u2014you know, are we at maximum employment from the point of view of where monetary policy are. And if that\u2019s still intact, then I think the policy path that we\u2019ve been saying for quite a long time is what we think is appropriate is still the appropriate path.And that\u2019s kind of where I am at this point. But of course we have time to look at sort of the incoming data, and assess the situation. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re far behind the curve in that sense. So I don\u2019t feel this need like, oh, we have to move preemptively because we\u2019re way behind. But I do think it makes sense for us at this point to continue on this gradual reduction in the amount of accommodation out there. And we knew kind of going into this nontraditional policy where we brought interest rates down to zero and then we added asset purchases\u2014we knew at some point the economy would return to health and start expanding and moving, that we\u2019d have to move back from those policies. And I think we\u2019re in that mode. And so I think that everything\u2019s intact for that. And I\u2019d like to see us continue on that path.MR. TIMIRAOS: So if it does prove that the declines were transitory, do you think that would justify more than one rate increase for the rest of this year?MS. MESTER: So I think the median policy path in the SEP is about right. You know, you can\u2014you can argue about a rate here, a rate there. But I mean, that path, that gradual path, I\u2019ve probably built in a little bit stronger rate increase farther out because I see a bit stronger economy. And probably my U-star of that natural rate of unemployment is a bit higher than\u2014I think the median is below 4\u00be, right? But in general I\u2019m on board with that. And you know, that policy path, as we go forward, we\u2019ll see where the economy is and we\u2019ll adjust to that as needed to keep the expansion going. So I think that that median path is right pretty much where I am \u2026MR. TIMIRAOS: Sure. So the balance sheet has gotten more attention, including in the minutes that were out yesterday. And I wonder what, if anything\u2014what would be holding you back from\u2014I mean, you\u2019ve said what you\u2019re going to do. The committee has said what it\u2019s going to do. Why wait much longer to initiate it?MS. MESTER: Yeah. So I\u2014one of the things that we wanted to do was make sure that we were telling people early\u2014right, market participants, the public, the Treasury\u2014what we planned to do. And so as you saw, right we mentioned in the minutes earlier, when we had discussions\u2014started discussing it, and then as you say, right, at the last meeting, we actually put out, OK, here\u2019 the plan, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do it. If you notice the details of that plan, it\u2019s a very, very gradual reduction in the amount of reinvestment, is the way I would say it, right? So again, it\u2019s meant\u2014it\u2019s designed to be sort of set it in the background, get it going stuff.So I\u2019m in favor of us moving forward with that at the appropriate time. And I would anticipate that we would do it this year, which is I think totally appropriate. Which particular meeting? I mean, that\u2019s obviously a discussion that the committee will have. But I\u2019m very comfortable, given the parameters that we\u2019ve set out, that the economy could handle that. And I think the public, as long as they have enough forward knowledge\u2014advance knowledge of when we\u2019ll actually start to implement it\u2014I don\u2019t anticipate there\u2019ll be a big reaction in the markets, or at least a long reaction in the market.The markets always react to things. Even if they know it\u2019s coming, they\u2019ll react when the actual announcement is made. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we get some market reaction. But I wouldn\u2019t anticipate it would be a long-lasting negative reaction to it, because I think we\u2019ve been\u2014we\u2019ve tried to be as clear as we can be about what the meaning of it is, in terms of it\u2019s a gradual reduction in the size of the balance sheet over time, it plays out over\u2014you know, a little bit over a year to get the limits on how much we\u2019ll\u2014or the caps on the flows out. So, again, it\u2019s very, very gradual, very concrete, so people know what we\u2019re doing.And the intention, I think, is well understood. We\u2019re not trying to change everyone\u2019s expectations about policy. And that\u2019s key. It\u2019s\u2014right? The announcement effect could have a long-lasting impact on market expectations if they changed their expectations about policy because of the announcement. But again, I think by being as forthcoming and\u2014you know, in advance communicating, I think we\u2014I hope have communicated that this is part of just the natural normalization, and not we\u2019ve changed our view of the economy, and therefore we\u2019ve changed our view of policy.MR. TIMIRAOS: Right. Are you surprised there hasn\u2019t been more of a market reaction to this point?MS. MESTER: I don\u2019t think so, because, again, we\u2014the minutes\u2014you know, the meetings I think have been\u2014you know, we\u2019ve been telling people what the discussions of the meetings have been, in the minutes. So again, my hope is that that\u2019s actually good communication and that we have been\u2014we\u2019ve been trying to be transparent. And my hope is that the reason we haven\u2019t seen huge market reactions is that it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve been communicating all along, is that this isn\u2019t, like, a whole change in the way we\u2019re viewing appropriate policy. It\u2019s just consistent with what we\u2019ve seen saying all along.And similarly, with the fed-funds rate gradual path, right? We\u2019ve been consistent, I think, all along that that path is\u2014that\u2019s consistent with how we see policy. And, yeah, it may move a little bit from meeting\u2014you know, SEP to SEP. But in general, that\u2019s been a very consistent message.MR. TIMIRAOS: In terms of the exact timing, I\u2019ve talked to people who have said maybe we should do it in September and wait on rate increases, so we can figure out what\u2019s going on in this inflation puzzle. And even some of the people who have been resistant to raising rates further seem perfectly fine putting the balance sheet into play now. I wonder, do you see that as a\u2014you know, the preferable path at this point, to do this in September and then wait until December to do the next rate increase?MS. MESTER: Well, I don\u2019t think I can make\u2014I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything, like, fundamental that says you couldn\u2019t do both at the same time, all right? So really what we do with our funds rate path depends on what the economy is doing and how we see the outlook, et cetera. The balance sheet, again, because the change in the reinvestment policy is such a gradual one, other than the signaling effect that it might have\u2014which we\u2019re hoping that the communication is handling\u2014there isn\u2019t any reason not to start that early, just because it\u2019s a very slow reduction in the size of the balance sheet. And to get the balance sheet down significantly it\u2019s going to take several years. I mean, it\u2019s not like something that\u2019ll change overnight.So again, that\u2019s sort of in the background, right? It\u2019s not really an active, what I would say, policy tool at this point. The idea was set it and forget it\u2014you know, like that old Ronco ad. You know, right? You just sort of do it, set it, let it go in the background. And then our main policy tool, of course, is going to be the short-term interest rate. And that\u2019s the way I view it. And so could we do both at the same time? Sure. It depends on what the economy is doing. But I think the end of the reinvestments or the\u2014you know, the change in the reinvestment policy and the beginning of that normalization of the balance sheet is\u2014you know, that can be sort of done sooner rather than later, get it going. And then we\u2019ll focus on the funds rate as being our main policy tool. So I\u2019d be comfortable with that.MR. TIMIRAOS: Right. But is there any\u2014is there any argument then for waiting until after December to initiate the reverse QE [quantitative easing]?MS. MESTER: So I would do it this year. I think it\u2019s consistent with the outlook that\u2014my outlook. And I\u2019d be very comfortable with doing it sometime this year. ... I don\u2019t think of that as being tied necessarily to what we do with the funds rate, right? So I\u2019d be probably in favor of doing it sooner rather than later, as long as everyone understands the parameters of our communication. And so far, it seems like they do. You\u2019d want to make sure that there\u2019s a lot of communication around this isn\u2019t a change in the outlook, this is really just in the background, et cetera, et cetera. And that\u2019s kind of what we said we wanted to do. We want to well communicate that this is just\u2014you know, we had to start reducing the balance sheet at some point. The economy can handle it. It\u2019s a very gradual reduction\u2026.MR. TIMIRAOS: The Trump administration has quarreled a little bit with other Washington institutions, like the CBO [Congressional Budget Office]. Has there been any concern\u2014have you detected any concern at the Fed that this administration might try to remake the Fed or that there would be some kind of a challenge to the institution itself?MS. MESTER: Well there\u2019s legislation\u2014you know, proposed legislation from various parties about sort of changing some of the structure of the Fed. And I am concerned about that because we know that you want the Fed to be apolitical. You want it to look farther out and not be concerned with short-run political considerations because we know, from many, many years of study both here and abroad, that you get much better economic outcomes, because you get much better policies, if the central bank is not\u2014and monetary policy is disassociated with short-run political consideration.And so I do worry about legislation that seems to not fully appreciate that. And things that look from the outside as being reasonable, but really aren\u2019t. So this\u2014the nomenclature \u201caudit the Fed,\u201d I\u2019ve always had problems with because it\u2019s like, from a\u2014from a layperson saying that it\u2019s like, well, of course the Fed should be audited. They\u2019re in control of the economy. And of course, we are audited. All our balance sheets are audited. But some of the provisions in \u201caudit the Fed\u201d aren\u2019t about that. They\u2019re really about making monetary policy less independent from the short-run political influences. And that\u2019s what\u2019s dangerous about that.This bill that\u2019s going to try to put the Fed under appropriations, again, looks like, from a layperson\u2019s view, like, well, that seems like a good idea. Why aren\u2019t they subject to it? Well, again, it\u2019s another thing that if you don\u2019t really understand what it means is it could affect the way we do bank regulation and supervision, and then feed back through how we do monetary policy. So again, things that look benign are not necessarily benign. So I do have concerns about that.Corrections & Amplifications   Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said 16% of the workforce is made up of immigrants.

Its indefatigable music director,       Will Crutchfield,        chose pieces that are all about singing, and coached the soloists and supporting artists to fulfill his vision.With few or no production elements to distract the audience, which also had minimal familiarity to fall back on, these operas were set up to be judged purely on vocal skill. Some notable voices have participated\u2014the mezzo Vivica Genaux was an early find\u2014and some of the operas have since found their way into more conventional houses.On Saturday, Bellini\u2019s \u201cIl pirata\u201d (1827) ended the opera series (there are two other concerts this month) with a bang, fielding three singers who treated Bellini\u2019s vocal challenges like child\u2019s play and made its creaky, melodramatic plot actually seem like a story about real people. In brief: A Duke, Ernesto, has defeated and exiled his enemy, Gualtiero, and forcibly married Gualtiero\u2019s beloved, Imogene.When the opera begins, it is years later. Gualtiero has become a pirate and his ship is wrecked in Ernesto\u2019s domain. The ex-lovers meet, their feelings as strong as ever, but there is no hope for their future. Bellini\u2019s settings of the encounters and confrontations among these three characters have a fascinating complexity: passion and anger, certainly, but also deeply felt bitterness and resignation.Mr. Crutchfield scooped up the soprano       Angela Meade       early in her meteoric career\u2014she won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 2007 and made her Met debut as Elvira in \u201cErnani\u201d in 2008\u2014and cast her in the title roles of \u201cSemiramide\u201d in 2009 and \u201cNorma\u201d in 2010. For the unhappy Imogene, her fifth starring role at Caramoor, everything in Ms. Meade\u2019s sumptuous instrument and artistic temperament came together. Her soprano has a bright, steely sheen; her remarkable breath control enables her to spin out long, eloquent lines; and she moves easily around her wide range, leaping effortlessly into her upper register. In earlier performances, she could frequently sound technically perfect but a bit automatic; here, she was entirely believable, communicating Imogene\u2019s terror and distress, her contempt for her husband, and the sadness of her love for Gualtiero, which is for \u201ca buried man.\u201d Her excellent diction, particularly in the shapely delivery of the accompanied recitatives, was also a plus.Santiago Ballerini\u2019s focused, exciting tenor showed no signs of strain in the role of Gualtiero, easily displaying the explosive fury of a man who has contained his desires for too long. He and Ms. Meade were splendidly matched in their two duets. Yet their finest moments were a pair of spectacularly sung back-to-back arias in the opera\u2019s final scene, both accompanied by mournful woodwind solos: First, Gualtiero, who has killed Ernesto in a duel, sadly surrenders himself to judgment; then Imogene, in an unusually contained mad scene, gives herself up to despair. As the heavy in this triangle, bass       Harold Wilson       brought a ferocious, macho character to Ernesto.The supporting roles\u2014filling out the all-important sextets\u2014were ably taken by       Robyn Marie Lamp       as Imogene\u2019s companion,       Adele      ;       Joseph Beutel       as the hermit, Goffredo; and especially       Sean Christensen,        who has a very pretty tenor, as Gualtiero\u2019s lieutenant, Itulbo. They are all members of the       Bel Canto Young       Artists program; other program participants supplied the rousing chorus numbers. Mr. Crutchfield led the Orchestra of St.       Luke\u2019s       in a sensitive, elegantly shaped performance that found the score\u2019s elegiac qualities as well as its fire. For next summer, Mr. Crutchfield plans to move his bel canto operation to SUNY Purchase; Caramoor will present touring productions, such as San Francisco\u2019s Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra performing       Handel\u2019s       \u201cAtalanta.\u201dMs. Waleson       writes about opera for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-full-throated-farewell-1499808364", "news_title": "A Full-Throated Farewell", "keywords": "Angela Meade,Bel Canto Young,Harold Wilson,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,opera"}, {"content": "Long Island City, N.Y.Each summer ushers in an architecture installation at MoMA PS1 in this Queens neighborhood\u2014one meant to be an audacious rethinking of how architecture may be built in the future. Lumen, the current offering by Jenny Sabin Studio, is no different. So what if it looks like Victorian bloomers ruffling on a line?Lumen was conceived by Ms. Sabin as a cross-pollination of architecture and biology, digital fabrication and space-frame engineering, data visualization and other challenging ideas now fermenting in the minds of forward-thinking design professionals. It is part of the Young Architects Program, a much-anticipated annual competition in which the winner\u2019s project gets installed in the former public school\u2019s sun-baked courtyard.Submissions must be aggressively innovative and provide shade and a water feature as well as places to sit. In recent years, sustainability has been added to the criteria. Tacitly, the installation had best be eye-popping: It is the setting for Warm Up, a popular summer music series and nighttime crowd magnet.Ms. Sabin finessed the contest with a cobwebby canopy. Futuristically photogenic, the cellular-looking weave stretches across the entire courtyard (a second canopy covers a smaller courtyard), supported by rope and steel rings around two 43-foot masts and anchored to the courtyard\u2019s concrete walls\u2014a circus tent by       H.G. Wells.If you think of architecture as a post supporting a beam or maybe steel holding up a cantilever, fasten your seat belts. The canopy was robotically woven out of solar-active synthetic fibers with UV photo-luminescent stripes. The fabric, with an oscillating cellular pattern, droops into funnel-shaped clusters that waft in the breeze and were inspired by ideas from biology, materials science and engineering. During the day, sunlight gradually turns patches of the fabric pale shades of green, pink, blue and purple; at night, the photo-luminescent stripes glow. Invisible tubes sewn into the funnel seams react to body warmth; as people walk by, they are lightly misted with water. Recycled industrial spools provide seating.It sounds out there, and it is. But it would be a mistake to dismiss Lumen as merely extreme-design high jinks. Ms. Sabin is exploring interesting ideas, and her interdisciplinary research involving engineers as well as scientists is heading in a potentially productive direction for architecture at a time when the discipline is sorely in need of a break from the ever taller, glaringly glassy structures now overpopulating the skyline.Ms. Sabin argues that new technologies\u2014especially robotics, digital fabrication and computational design\u2014allow for real-time control of the design process. And that helps to put architects back in touch with building their buildings rather than turning their blueprints and computer disks, along with the reins, over to the construction managers on site, and watching from the sidelines to see what gets built. It\u2019s exciting to imagine architects operating in a high-tech translation of the way that Brunelleschi and other Renaissance designer-engineers once worked.But it\u2019s more than the return of architects \u201cmaking,\u201d as the current lingo has it. There\u2019s also an intense commitment to addressing sustainability\u2014not so much by fulfilling a checklist of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts (don\u2019t use exotic materials shipped from afar; do recycle gray water) as in thinking about building as an ecosystem unto itself where structure and materials are integrated and adapt to environmental changes in ways more akin to living organisms.Ms. Sabin is at the forefront of such explorations. With funding from the National Science Foundation, she has been collaborating with engineers, cell biologists and material scientists on something called eSkin, a dynamic film applicable to new or existing glass surfaces capable of adapting to environmental changes. She envisions a \u201ctunable window\u201d that office workers could customize, for instance, changing the color or degree of transparency or even porousness according to individual preference.Right now this kind of design derring-do is limited to small-scale art galleries and special-event commissions; Ms. Sabin has designed such installations for the       Cooper Hewitt,        Smithsonian Design Museum (PolyThread, 2016) and for             Nike                   (myThread Pavilion, 2012). Lumen, the largest work Ms. Sabin has completed to date, offers the public a tantalizing foretaste of things, quite possibly, to come.\u2014       Ms. Iovine       reviews architecture for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/design-derring-do-1499808416", "news_title": "Design Derring-Do", "keywords": "MoMA PS1,Lumen,eSkin,Jenny Sabin"}, {"content": "MIAMI\u2014Much of the first half of the baseball season has revolved around one story: the enormous rise in home runs. Teams are on pace to blast 6,126 home runs this year, which would shatter the current record set in 2000 by more than 400.\u201cWe are in the process of trying to come to a conclusion as to what may be going on,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s All-Star Game.Theories have abounded in that regard, ranging from performance-enhancing drugs to a fundamental shift in offensive approach, an explanation Manfred cites frequently. But given MLB\u2019s publicly stated interest in increasing the league\u2019s sagging run production, the sudden timing of the home-run spike and comments from an increasing number of pitchers, another potential culprit has emerged: the baseball itself.Manfred said he is \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d that the baseball \u201cfalls within the tolerance of the specifications that have existed for many years.\u201d He added that MLB has conducted more tests on the ball than ever before, even hiring a second expert to audit the results.That, however, doesn\u2019t tell the entire story. MLB\u2019s guidelines for its baseballs are relatively broad, and two balls manufactured at opposite ends of that spectrum could behave very differently. An MLB-funded study in 2000 found that theoretically, \u201ctwo baseballs could meet the specifications but one ball could be hit 49.1 feet further than the other could be hit.\u201dThough Manfred said the league is \u201clooking at the issue of standards,\u201d he also suggested that MLB could consider exploring the composition of another piece of equipment.\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of taken it for granted that the bats aren\u2019t different,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Manfred said he thinks the most important factor is \u201cdramatic changes\u201d in the way the game is taught and played, such as a greater willingness to trade strikeouts for homers. Either way, at this point, he doesn\u2019t seem to mind too much.\u201cOur research suggests that the home run is actually a popular play in baseball,\u201d Manfred said.Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-run-boom-mlb-says-dont-blame-the-baseballs-1499808198", "news_title": "Home Run Boom?

Pemex said it notified Odebrecht in mid-June that it was terminating the contract due to the Brazilian company\u2019s \u201cfailure to comply with its obligations.\u201dPemex said Mexico\u2019s general comptroller found \u201cprobable administrative irregularities,\u201d and has initiated four sanctioning procedures against two affiliates of Odebrecht and its representatives, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The cancellation of the contract is the first tangible result from an investigation that Pemex and Mexican authorities began in December after a $2.6 billion settlement was agreed to between Odebrecht and authorities from the U.S., Brazil and Switzerland.As a part of a criminal investigation, the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s Office has interrogated 19 former and current officials at Pemex, as well as       Marcelo Odebrecht,        the former head of Odebrecht who was sentenced to 19 years in jail in Brazil last year for bribery. But Mexican authorities have yet to announce their results.According to U.S. Department of Justice documents, in October 2013 Odebrecht agreed to bribe a senior official at a Mexican state-owned company to help win a project, and paid the official $6 million between December 2013 and late 2014. Between 2010 and 2014, the company was said to have paid a total of $10.5 million in bribes in Mexico.One Pemex board member said the 2013 bribe is likely related to two contracts Odebrecht won to upgrade the Tula refinery. The first contract for $76 million was awarded in February 2014, and then increased by $19 million in November of that year. The second one, which has now been terminated, was awarded in November 2015.A Pemex spokeswoman declined to comment on ongoing investigations.In 2014 and 2015, Odebrecht won four engineering and construction contracts from Pemex totaling around $1.5 billion, ranging from work on refinery upgrades to a major gas pipeline in northern Mexico, according to public records. Previously, the company had just won one similar contract from Pemex.In the period that Odebrecht won the four contracts,       Emilio Lozoya       was the chief executive at Pemex. In a document filed with Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, a former top official at Odebrecht said he was asked in 2014 to pay a bribe of $5 million to Mr. Lozoya.Mr. Lozoya, a former investment banker, has said since the testimony emerged in April that he never requested or received bribes from Odebrecht or any other company and that he always acted with honesty while the head of Pemex from December 2012 to February 2016.As a state oil monopoly until 2014, Pemex for decades controlled Mexico\u2019s oil industry with few checks and balances. The state company, which had sales of $52 billion in 2016, had a free hand in awarding anything from service contracts to the purchase of ships, managed the country\u2019s pipeline networks, and had significant sway over the country\u2019s energy policy.Write to Juan Montes at juan.montes@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 17:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pemex-cancels-100-million-contract-with-odebrecht-1499807405", "news_title": "Pemex Cancels $100 Million Contract with Odebrecht   ", "keywords": "car wash,Odebrecht,Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos,corporate crime,legal action,contracts,orders,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "A labor shortage that has hampered the construction industry for most of the housing market\u2019s five-year recovery is showing signs of easing.The number of open construction jobs fell to a seasonally adjusted 154,000 in May, down from the cyclical high of 238,000 open jobs set in July of last year, according to the most recent Labor Department data.Job openings as a percentage of total employment were at 2.2%, down from 2.8% the previous month.Hiring \u201chas been expanding,\u201d said       Robert Dietz,        chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \u201cIt\u2019s just not expanding fast enough.\u201dThe monthly data is volatile and the number of open jobs still remains near historic highs.The lack of workers has been one of the housing industry\u2019s biggest challenges, slowing the construction process for single-family homes and apartments and contributing to a housing shortage.The decline in open jobs suggests employers are having a slightly easier time finding workers to hire. It could also be partly the result of a slowdown in multifamily construction activity as the apartment market becomes saturated.

As the Washington press corps debates whether the latest meeting reports amount to a threat to the republic, perhaps Beltway journalists should also spare a thought for another Washington story, and consider whether it could pose at least a small threat to their ability to practice journalism.The magazine Washingtonian recently reported:To say the least, it would not be easy to do journalism if reporters were barred from doing anything that adversely affects anyone with whom a news organization does business. And social media comprises increasingly important journalistic platforms, especially for the Post, which has been smartly increasing its online presence since its 2013 acquisition by             Amazon.com                   founder and CEO       Jeff Bezos.Mr. Bezos has introduced many innovations since taking over the principal newspaper of the nation\u2019s capital, but he should rethink this one. His paper\u2019s new social-media policy specifically lists the following among the types of communications which are now prohibited:So the Post is encouraging at least minimally respectful treatment of some companies, but businesses that neither cooperate nor compete with the Post are fair game? This type of double standard is incompatible with the healthy practice of journalism.The Post says that this new policy, which took effect on May 1 of this year, is the first formal social-media policy directed at the whole company and is meant to build on a newsroom policy from 2011. But back then, the pre-Bezos newsroom editors were not telling anyone to lay off business partners.Your humble correspondent has never known the Post to pull punches when it comes to advertisers. This column is guessing that Mr. Bezos has been vigorously imposing various best practices from the technology industry on his newspaper property and that this particular policy is corporate boiler plate accidentally imported from some non-journalistic digital outfit.

Brent, the global benchmark, rose 64 cents, or 1.37%, to $47.52 a barrel.Market participants are expecting that the U.S. Energy Information Administration will report a drop in U.S. stockpiles in its weekly report, due Wednesday morning.The weekly data has become an important barometer as investors and traders watch to see whether output reductions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers are helping to bring down global oil inventories.\u201cYou continue to see draws in the U.S., ratcheting up expectations that maybe the cuts are having an effect,\u201d said       Gene McGillian,        research manager at Tradition Energy. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to be too exposed below the lower-$40 mark.\u201dAnalysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are expecting the data to show that U.S. oil stockpiles fell by 3.2 million barrels last week.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that its own data for the week showed an 8.1-million-barrel decrease in crude supplies, an 801,000-barrel decline in gasoline stocks and a 2.1-million-barrel increase in distillate inventories, according to a market participant.Oil prices edged lower in earlier trading Tuesday on reports that Saudi Arabia pumped more oil in June, exceeding the output cap it agreed to for the first time since OPEC\u2019s cuts went into effect. A person familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia produced 10.7 million barrels a day last month, about 12,000 barrels a day more than it promised agreements struck with OPEC and other big producers like Russia late last year.But prices quickly began to move higher again, settling up for the second day in a row.\u201cWe\u2019re approaching the time frame on the calendar that is a very traditional bull market. I think the market\u2019s trying to come up with some excuse to start that cycle again,\u201d said       Donald Morton,        senior vice president at Herbert J.

Both are members of OPEC but exempt from the group-led agreement to cut global output by 2%. The exemption was meant to allow their production to rebound following years of fighting between the countries\u2019 governments and local insurgents, which blunted output. In recent months, production in those countries has risen strongly, offsetting some one-third of the cuts made so far this year by the cartel and its allies.The output-cap exemptions for Libya and Nigeria have drawn ire from some fellow producers. The issue is expected to be discussed when OPEC\u2019s monitoring panel meets July 24 in Moscow.Rising output from the U.S. has also undermined OPEC\u2019s efforts to work down the supply glut, but low prices may slow some drillers down. On Tuesday, the U.S. EIA trimmed its forecast for U.S. output next year: it now expects U.S. production to average 9.9 million barrels a day in 2018. That is still a record high level, but down slightly from its previous forecast that output would average 10 million barrels a day next year.\u201cA lower forecast for crude oil prices is expected to shave a little off projected growth in U.S. oil production next year,\u201d acting EIA Administrator Howard Gruenspecht said in a statement.Gasoline futures rose 1.76 cents, or 1.17% to $1.5183 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

We invite the other blockading countries to join.\u201dThe four countries cut diplomatic ties and imposed a travel ban on June 5 in response to allegations that Qatar funds terrorist groups. U.S. officials have said they fear the conflict could drag on for months.Qatar denies the allegations and has accused the bloc of Arab nations of waging a smear campaign. The four Arab countries rejected Qatar\u2019s response to a list of demands to try to resolve the crisis, including curbing diplomatic ties with Iran, severing links with the Muslim Brotherhood and closing the Al Jazeera television network.Mr. Tillerson will meet with officials from the four-nation bloc Wednesday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Trump administration officials want to bring an end to the conflict as well as combat the flow of funds to terrorist groups. Mr. Tillerson said some of the work on the agreement signed Tuesday began a year ago, and that experts have held discussions on the document for weeks.\u201cI applaud the leadership of his Highness the Emir of Qatar [      Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani      ] for being the first to respond to President Trump\u2019s challenge at the Riyadh summit to stop the funding of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said Tuesday.Earlier, Mr. Tillerson called Qatar\u2019s position in the feud with the four Arab nations \u201cvery reasonable.\u201dLater Tuesday, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt said in a statement that the agreement reached between Washington and Doha \u201cis not enough,\u201d and said they would \u201cclosely monitor the seriousness of Qatar in combating all forms of funding, supporting and fostering of terrorism,\u201d according to Emirati state news agency WAM. The four nations also said sanctions on Qatar would remain in place until Doha abides by their list of 13 demands.At the start of the conflict in June, President Donald Trump sided with Saudi Arabia and the other countries, criticizing Qatar\u2019s alleged support to terrorist groups and taking credit for the decision to crack down on Doha as evidence of the success of his visit to Riyadh in May. Mr. Tillerson, on the other hand, has been sympathetic to Qatar throughout and has urged calm and moderation.Before Mr. Tillerson arrived in Kuwait on Monday, a senior adviser traveling with him told reporters that the list of 13 demands put forward to Qatar by the four Arab countries aren\u2019t viable as a package.Mr. Tillerson is using Kuwait as a base to travel around the Persian Gulf region throughout the week.\u201cThey are not worth revisiting as a package but individually there are things in there that could work,\u201d       R.C. Hammond,        the adviser, told reporters in Istanbul.Mr. Hammond said both sides will need to make concessions to bring about an end to the conflict, as all nations in the region could do more to combat terror financing.\u201cThis is a two-way street,\u201d he said Monday.Qatar and its neighbors in 2013 and 2014 agreed on a number of actions that would result in Doha ending its support for political groups active in those countries and in Yemen. Details of that agreement, which were disclosed for the first time earlier this week, show that Qatar has until now failed to comply with these demands, the four Arab countries said Monday.In a joint statement, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain and Egypt said the documents \u201cconfirm beyond any doubt Qatar\u2019s failure to meet its commitments and its full violations of its pledges.\u201dIn response, Qatar said the publication of the documents was an attempt to undermine Mr. Tillerson\u2019s efforts to resolve the crisis.

The legislation would make it tougher for Mr. Trump to lift sanctions on Russia, impose new sanctions and insert a congressional review provision of such measures.The bill is now stalled in the House over legislative procedural issues that senators thought they had fixed before Congress\u2019s July 4 recess.\u201cCongress has a responsibility to act, they need to act and they need to act now,\u201d said Sen.       Ben Cardin       (D., Md.), one of the bill\u2019s sponsors. \u201cThis is a very important bill. My guess is those who are trying to weaken and defeat the bill are using every opportunity they can to do that.\u201dWhite House officials have criticized the congressional review provision, saying they support the sanctions but the measure as written would erode the president\u2019s power to conduct diplomacy.If unchanged, the bill would require the president to seek Congress\u2019s permission to relax the present set of sanctions against Russia. Without the legislation, the executive branch can decide to reverse the sanctions on its own.The oversight provision applies to existing sanctions the Obama administration imposed through executive order.Another portion of the bill would prohibit U.S. citizens and entities from exporting goods, nonfinancial services and technology in support of deep-water, Arctic offshore or shale-exploration projects involving Russian concerns. It also would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities.The administration\u2019s position is being undercut by revelations from the investigations into Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, including the president\u2019s son\u2019s emails.The news of the meeting in Trump Tower last year also came just days after Mr. Trump tweeted that sanctions didn\u2019t come up in his meeting with Russian President       Vladimir Putin       at the G-20 summit over the weekend. The White House later corrected that tweet, saying through White House spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       on Monday that sanctions were part of the discussion.Asked about the bill Tuesday, Ms. Sanders said opposition to the congressional review \u201cis more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate...and this includes working with allies and partners to present a united front to common foes and we are committed to working with Congress on those issues.\u201dSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), referenced the newly released emails and said \u201cbetween these revelations and the president\u2019s horrendous handling of the meeting with Mr. Putin, it\u2019s clear that Congress needs to step in and sanction Russia and be the roadblock to lifting sanctions because clearly the president will not be tough on Mr. Putin as he should be.\u201dHouse Republicans first raised parliamentary concerns with the sanctions bill. Yet a fix inserted before the July 4 recess is now drawing objections from some House Democrats, who say it strips power from the minority party in Congress. They are refusing to give consent for a procedural vote that would allow the bill to go back to the Senate to be amended until that language is removed.\u201cI believe this is an issue that we can quickly resolve, and I hope that Republican leadership will work with us to address this issue and bring the bill to the floor for a strong, bipartisan vote this week,\u201d House Minority Whip       Steny Hoyer       (D., Md.) said in an email.House Rules Committee Chairman       Pete Sessions       (R., Texas), who is one of the president\u2019s allies, has also voiced concern that provisions in the bill could hurt energy companies in his state.Meanwhile, Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.), the head of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, is considering moving his own bill, should the Senate bill stall, according to a person familiar with his thinking.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.), who oversaw the Senate bill, expressed impatience on Monday that the bill had not yet hit the president\u2019s desk.\u201cAll the House has to do is pass the sanctions bill,\u201d he told reporters, dismissing the procedural issues as an easy-to-overcome hurdle.\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Demand For Russia Sanctions Intensifies.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 16:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emails-by-trumps-son-boost-drive-for-russia-sanctions-bill-in-congress-1499806048", "news_title": "Emails by Trump\u2019s Son Boost Drive for Russia Sanctions Bill in Congress", "keywords": "2016 election,congress,donald trump jr.,presidential election,putin,russia,russia hacking,russia sanctions,trump,trump emails,House Committee on Foreign Affairs,Trump,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Major internet companies are preparing to launch online protests Wednesday over Republican efforts to roll back Obama-era net neutrality rules, employing a tactic that influenced policy in past years.The question is whether it will have the same impact this time. Silicon Valley and its allies don\u2019t have the same level of support in government that they enjoyed under the tech-friendly Obama administration, and the current Federal Communications Commission has already made clear its plans to significantly scale back the net neutrality rules. The GOP-controlled Congress is unlikely to intervene.The Republican-led FCC voted in May to begin the process of rolling back the rules, and it is expected to complete the process in the fall. The rules, adopted in 2015, generally require telecommunications companies that provide online access, such as             AT&T Inc.       and             Comcast Corp.      , to treat all internet traffic the same and not slow or block some sites.An online campaign helped galvanize support for the strong 2015 rules. Another protest in 2012 helped scuttle antipiracy legislation that was favored by much of the entertainment industry.Many big internet companies, such as             Amazon.com Inc.,Facebook Inc.       and Google parent         Alphabet Inc.,       would like to keep the 2015 rules in place, arguing they are important to maintaining healthy competition on the internet. The companies worry, for example, that without the strong rules the providers could use internet fast lanes to push their own online services.But the providers contend the 2015 rules\u2014an expansion of previous versions\u2014represent an overreach by the government that could stifle investment and innovation and ultimately competition. Many insist they want to maintain net neutrality, and AT&T said Tuesday it would join in the \u201cday of action\u201d as a sign of its support for open internet principles.Republicans recently have sided with the telecommunications firms, while Democrats have been more sympathetic to the internet firms.Wednesday\u2019s day of protest is generally aimed at demonstrating the grass-roots appeal of the net neutrality rules and thereby weaken political support among Republicans for the rollback.Major organizers, including a coalition of online activists known as Battle for the Net, as well as the Internet Association, a trade group, say much of the effort will be aimed at generating consumer calls and emails to Washington policy makers. That includes the FCC\u2019s three commissioners as well as members of Congress. Some sites also could run more slowly than normal, according to organizers, or at least appear to briefly.Battle for the Net has been offering online firms sample messages that mimic slowdowns, including one it calls \u201cspinning wheel of death.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, none of these will actually block, slow or paywall your site,\u201d the group says. \u201cBut, they will let your users submit a comment to the FCC and Congress without having to leave your platform.\u201dA graphic the group offers for social media users shows a cat riding a unicorn and wielding a handgun, with the caption, \u201cKeep the Internet Weird. Defend Net Neutrality.\u201dVimeo, the video streaming and sharing site owned by             IAC/InterActiveCorp,       plans to join the protest by promoting a two-minute video about net neutrality on its home page. The video urges users to call and write letters to the FCC to keep the internet open.\u201cWe live in a world where the broadband carriers can decide who gets what at what speed,\u201d said       Michael Cheah,        general counsel at Vimeo. \u201cThere is going to be a very powerful incentive for some of them to disadvantage us and our offerings.\u201dPolitical activism is becoming more important for tech startups, Mr. Cheah added. \u201cWe are seeing a large trend toward consolidation in a number of industries, and one of them is the telecom and internet content space,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important for companies big and small to voice their concerns with that.\u201dDespite the elaborate preparations, some organizers say the effort has been more decentralized than past internet protests.By comparison, the current effort is \u201cmore organic than what\u2019s been done in the past,\u201d said       Gigi Sohn,        who helped develop the net neutrality rules under then-FCC Chairman       Tom Wheeler,        and who now is working to preserve them.This week\u2019s protest also likely faces longer odds of success than the previous ones over net neutrality and antipiracy rules because Republicans on the FCC appear determined to go ahead with the rollback.\u201cWe will not rely on hyperbolic statements about the end of the internet as we know it, and 140-character argle-bargle [nonsense], but rather on the data,\u201d FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai       said in May.For their part, Republican leaders in Congress would love to draft compromise legislation to scale back, but not eliminate, the net-neutrality rules. But they have been stymied by partisan strife.Some observers say the protests could actually make compromise legislation more difficult.\u201cThis protest won\u2019t live up to the hype because it won\u2019t change the outcome at all,\u201d said Berin Szoka, president of TechFreedom, a market-oriented advocacy group. \u201cWe already know that Republican commissioners reject the [Obama-era] FCC\u2019s sweeping claims of legal authority\u2026Sadly, the goal here seems to be to make legislation harder, not easier.\u201dWrite to John D.

It runs a suite of five ETFs, focusing on China\u2019s technology sector and onshore Chinese shares, with a total $760 million of assets under management, according to the company.The KraneShares investment \u201cis the first small step toward\u201d CICC\u2019s broader efforts to expand its asset-management platform globally, said       Elaine La Roche,        chief executive officer at CICC US Securities Inc. With a footprint in the market, it will help CICC develop more ETF products in China, Ms. La Roche said.The deal is the latest in a string of moves by traditional financial-service companies to acquire ETF providers in niche areas as a way to expand into the ETF world. In 2014, New York Life Investment Management acquired IndexIQ, an ETF provider focused on real-estate strategies. OppenheimerFunds in late 2015 bought the parent company of RevenueShares, known for its smart-beta funds.In addition to the assets under management, \u201cwhat the firms get is the ETF expertise, and from the regulatory perspective the ability to launch products in a faster manner,\u201d said       Todd Rosenbluth,        director of ETF and mutual fund research at research firm CFRA.KraneShares is among the largest beneficiaries of the much-anticipated inclusion of China\u2019s onshore shares by             MSCI Inc.       into its emerging-markets index, as well as a broad-based rally of technology stocks. The firm\u2019s assets have tripled since the start of the year, including an inflow of around $400 million.Its CSI China Internet ETF, a product focusing on China\u2019s booming internet companies, has recently grown to $540 million, as shares of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       and             JD.com Inc.       soared this year. The KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF has gained $168 million so far this year to a total of $207 million, as investors piled in ahead of MSCI\u2019s decision in late June to add China\u2019s yuan-denominated shares to its widely followed emerging-markets index. The two ETFs raked in the most assets among all U.S.-listed China-focused equity ETFs so far this year, according to the company.Global investors have been piling into China-focused ETFs in recent weeks, betting that the MSCI decision could boost share prices as fund managers that track the indexes add China to their emerging-market portfolios. Last week, net flows for a total 73 ETFs investing in Chinese stocks turned positive to $1.9 million for the first time this year, reversing a long period of outflows, according to TrackInsight, an ETF data provider.But ETFs can also be at the mercy of investor whims, especially niche-oriented products, Mr. Rosenbluth said. \u201cIf investment sentiment on China weakens, some of this money will not stay,\u201d he said.KraneShares was founded by Jonathan Krane in 2011, when he returned to the U.S. after having lived in China for years in the 2000s. He said he realized there was an \u201cunder-allocation\u201d among U.S. investors to Chinese assets, despite China\u2019s efforts to open up its markets. KraneShares is set to benefit from CICC\u2019s research and its access to the Chinese market, Mr. Krane said in an interview.CICC was established in 1995 by             Morgan Stanley,China Construction Bank                   and other parties.

A day prior, shares fell below their IPO price of $17 for the first time.The waning confidence in Snap coincides with a stumble by another recent IPO. In late June, meal-delivery startup             Blue Apron Holdings Inc.struggled to find buyers in its stock offering, priced its shares below its initial expectations, and has remained under its IPO price since its second day of trading. Though it isn\u2019t unusual for a newly listed company\u2019s stock to fall below its IPO price, it isn\u2019t a great sign for two high-profile IPOs to be struggling, many traders say.Snap\u2019s decline on Tuesday came as analysts at             Morgan Stanley,        MS 3.28%one of the lead underwriters on Snap\u2019s IPO, downgraded the company to equal weight from overweight and cut their price target from $28 a share to $16 apiece. Analysts typically assign ratings to companies they follow that indicate whether they recommend investors buy, hold or sell the stocks. Morgan Stanley\u2019s new rating suggests holding on to shares of Snap at a price of $16.The bank cited increasing competition, noting that             Facebook Inc.\u2019s       Instagram \u201chas become more aggressive in competing for Snap\u2019s ad dollars.\u201d Morgan Stanley added that, as a result, it expects Snap\u2019s ad revenue growth to be \u201cmaterially slower\u201d than it previously expected.Snap shares tumbled in May, after the company reported a slowdown in user growth for its disappearing-messaging app in its first quarterly earnings report as a publicly traded company. The company also reported its revenue in the quarter nearly quadrupled from a year earlier, but failed to exceed Snap\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue.Morgan Stanley joins other banks that have now tempered their enthusiasm for Snap. In March, the average analyst target price was more than $23 a share, according to FactSet. As of July 11, that average target price slipped to a little more than $20 apiece.More volatility could hit Snap shares when restrictions on stock sales by certain insiders and early investors in the company are lifted. In late July, more than 600 million shares will be freed up for sale, according to Dealogic.Meanwhile, Blue Apron\u2019s stock dropped 12% to $7.14 Tuesday, falling further from its $10 IPO price. The broader U.S. stock market was mixed Tuesday, with the S&P 500 falling less than 0.1%. The tech sector rose 0.4%.As of Monday, 46% of U.S.-listed companies that went public in 2017 have closed below their IPO prices at some point. More than one-third were still below as of then, according to Dealogic.Another sign investors may be betting against Blue Apron and Snap: Traders are buying options contracts that tend to pay out on declines in the underlying stock. Bearish options called puts were outpacing bullish options, or calls, for both companies on Tuesday, according to Trade Alert.Snap was widely seen by analysts, bankers and company executives as a test of the IPO market for other richly valued firms considering going public. Private companies largely avoided the public markets last year because of a winter selloff and potentially disruptive elections in Europe and the U. S.\u2014opting instead to rely on cash from venture-capital investors.Last year was the slowest for U.S.-listed tech IPOs since 2009 in terms of number of deals and dollars raised, according to Dealogic data.

In his sentencing memo, he noted his client\u2019s good works, remorse and hundreds of hours spent cooperating with the government. Mr. Wildstein, he said, provided knowledge about not only those convicted, but \u201cthere were many other persons about whom David had provided information to the government.\u201dMr. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to two felony counts for his role in the 2013 lane closures, is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Newark.He was the key witness during the trial that led to the convictions last year of       Bill Baroni,        a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and       Bridget Kelly,        a former aide to New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie.The three onetime Christie allies conspired to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge, creating gridlocked traffic designed to punish Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich because he didn\u2019t endorse the Republican governor\u2019s reelection bid, prosecutors said.Mr. Baroni, who was sentenced to two years in prison, and Ms. Kelly, sentenced to 18 months, are appealing their convictions. Mr. Christie was never accused of wrongdoing, although the resulting political scandal derailed his national political ambitions, and the trial exposed what witnesses described as distasteful inner workings of his administration.In the sentencing memo, prosecutors outlined Mr. Wildstein\u2019s cooperation, which they said included turning over emails, texts, his iPad and computers. He also met with prosecutors on 14 occasions to prepare for his grand jury testimony and was on the stand for eight days during the 2016 trial.\u201cHis cooperation led directly to the indictment and convictions of Baroni and Kelly,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the document. They said Mr. Wildstein took complete responsibility for his actions, which included devising, implementing and covering up the lane closures and their political motivation.Under sentencing guidelines outlined in his plea agreement, Mr. Wildstein faced from 21 to 27 months in prison. Prosecutors recommend he receive probation, a lenient sentence that might encourage others in public-corruption cases to cooperate with the government.\u201cThe interests of justice are served because it sends a message to current and future subjects of criminal prosecution that timely, complete, and truthful cooperation can have a meaningful impact on the eventual penalties for their crimes,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the memo.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as '\u2018Bridgegate\u2019 Probation Recommended.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 16:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/architect-of-bridgegate-scheme-shouldnt-go-to-prison-prosecutors-say-1499804846", "news_title": "Architect of \u2018Bridgegate\u2019 Scheme Shouldn\u2019t go to Prison, Prosecutors Say", "keywords": "bridgegate,george washington bridge scandal,new jersey politics,Alan Zegas,Bill Baroni,Chris Christie,Bridget Kelly,David Wildstein,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a slight gain after a brief bout of selling sent it down more than 100 points.U.S. stocks dropped after       Donald Trump Jr.       released June 2016 emails about meeting with a Russian lawyer to discuss allegedly incriminating information about       Hillary Clinton,        traders said.

The ballet\u2019s controversial subject matter has highlighted a debate within Russia about cultural identity and artistic freedom as the country has grown increasingly conservative and politically isolated.Mr. Nureyev, who defected from the Soviet Union in 1961, had a reputation as a rebel and a nonconformist. Postponement of the performance is raising questions about official censorship and homophobia.\u201cThe Bolshoi ballet is vodka, a nesting doll, a bear and a balalaika in one festive candy wrapper, and any spots on its reputation are particularly sensitive,\u201d wrote ballet critic       Leila Guchmazova       in Russia\u2019s Theater magazine, describing the uproar over the cancellation. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to take the Nureyev out of \u2018Nureyev.\u2019\u201dIn a briefing on Monday, theater general director Vladimir Urin acknowledged the story of Mr. Nureyev is \u201cambiguous, with a complex fate,\u201d and that presenting his character would be challenging, Russian news agencies reported. But he denied the theater had come under official pressure.In videotaped remarks Saturday posted by the independent TV channel Dozhd, Mr. Urin explained the postponement, saying that \u201cin the state the performance is currently in, it is impossible to show it on the stage of the Bolshoi.\u201dRussia\u2019s powerful Ministry of Culture, which holds sway over the state-funded Bolshoi, told news agency RIA-Novosti that Russia\u2019s top cultural official applied no pressure to pull the performance.\u201cCensorship and bans are not the style of our organization,\u201d it said.Ballet critic       Natalia Zvenigorodskaya,        however, said few observers were convinced by the official version of events.The reaction among people interested in high culture, she said, \u201creflects an unhealthy atmosphere in culture and society\u201d that is deeply skeptical of official motives.\u201cWe are returning to a very familiar situation,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived in the U.S.S.R. and I don\u2019t want to go back to that.\u201dRussian President       Vladimir Putin       has cast himself as a defender of traditional family values, allying closely with the Russian Orthodox Church.The Russian government has clashed with the European Court of Human Rights over a 2013 law and other legislation that banned the promotion of homosexuality.Mr. Putin has come under direct criticism from Western leaders over reports that dozens of gay men have been targeted for arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killing in the southern republic of Chechnya.Natalia Antonova,        a Moscow-based writer and playwright, said the intense debate stoked by the cancellation of the premiere reflected an \u201cidentity crisis\u201d in Russian political and cultural life that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Russian officialdom, she said, \u201cwants the prestige that\u2019s associated with something like this ballet, but at the same time they have to please the religious hard-liners that they\u2019ve encouraged.\u201dThe Bolshoi, Ms. Antonova added, \u201creceived a huge blow to its reputation because of what happened.\u201dThis is not the first time the Bolshoi has been engulfed by scandal.In 2013, the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet was severely burned when a masked assailant threw acid in his face. A Russian court sentenced a star dancer to prison for ordering the gruesome attack.The director of the new ballet,       Kirill Serebrennikov,        has also courted controversy. He is known for productions that tweak Russia\u2019s conservative officials, and another Moscow theater where he is artistic director is involved in an embezzlement probe observers say is politically motivated.Mr. Serebrennikov didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the investigation and the postponement of the ballet. In comments to the newspaper Vedomosti, Mr. Serebrennikov declined to comment on the Bolshoi\u2019s decision.\u201cThis is the decision of the theater,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they decided.\"Write to Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Culture Clash Snags Bolshoi.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bolshoi-ballet-swept-up-in-russias-cultural-debate-1499788049", "news_title": "Bolshoi Ballet Swept Up in Russia\u2019s Cultural Debate ", "keywords": "russia culture,russia politics,political,general news,society,community,dance,ballet,arts,entertainment,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights"}, {"content": "Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       is likely to face questions about the central bank\u2019s plans to raise interest rates and reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet when she addresses the House Financial Services Committee, starting at 10 a.m. EDT Wednesday.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/live-janet-yellen-testifies-before-house-financial-services-committee-1499803239", "news_title": "Live: Janet Yellen Testifies Before House Financial Services Committee", "keywords": "Janet Yellen,economic news"}, {"content": "The U.S. government bond market strengthened Tuesday for a second consecutive session, offering some tentative signs of stabilization following a two-week selloff.The main boost for bonds Tuesday were emails released by Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the U.S. president, which showed he attended a meeting in June 2016 to discuss allegedly incriminating information about       Hillary Clinton.The release of the emails, following days of news reports, offers clear evidence that senior officials in the Trump camp entertained offers of Russia\u2019s help in last year\u2019s campaign.\u201cThe more bad news for the Trump administration, the less likely [the president] will be able to get any of his [pro-growth] policies enacted,\u2019\u2019 said       Mary Ann Hurley,        vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A.

Easy money policy has played a big role driving up government bond prices to historically high levels following the financial crisis.Worries over the European Central Bank to taper bond buying have in particular been growing. The Bank of Canada is widely expected on Wednesday to raise its benchmark policy rate for the first time in seven years.Meanwhile, inflation, which is a big threat to long-term government bonds, remains subdued.

In a literal sense, they are the biggest players in the game.But time and again, these towering stars shrink on the sport\u2019s biggest stages.This is especially true on the men\u2019s side, where the continuing dominance of the so-called \u201cBig Four\u201d\u2014      Roger Federer,        Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray\u2014has often come at the expense of oversized opponents like Marin Cilic and Milos Raonic.Three of the giants will get a chance to exact height revenge again Wednesday in the latest battle of Talls vs. (relative) Smalls. Djokovic and Murray, who are six-foot-2, and Federer, who is six-foot-1, will square off against players several inches taller than they are. The three men play, respectively, Tomas Berdych (6\u20195\u201d), Sam Querrey (6\u20196\u201d) and Raonic (6\u20195\u201d).Djokovic, Murray and Federer are a combined 41-6 lifetime against their quarterfinal opponents. (Nadal lost Monday in the round of 16.)\u201cWe all have our advantages and disadvantages,\u201d said 6-foot-6 Cilic, the best of the talls of late, who plays Gilles Muller in the other quarterfinal. \u201cThis is a complex game that you can play in many different ways, and you have to maximize your advantages.\u201dThat is harder these days at Wimbledon, where the courts aren\u2019t as slick as they once were and big servers no longer have the great advantages they once did. In an era when grass, hard courts and clay are so similar and a well-rounded game is required everywhere, the best players fall within a Goldilocks zone of not-too-tall and not-too-small.The height issue in tennis is particularly perplexing though because some of the tallest players have climbed up the rankings, only to bump up against a ceiling, so to speak.Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, who is six-foot-6, figured to have the best chance to lead the talls to pre-eminence when he overpowered Federer in the 2009 U.S. Open final at 20 years old. But wrist injuries have plagued his career. Cilic, who has a beautiful game but a shaky psyche, won the 2014 U.S. Open at 25, but has slumped in the biggest tournaments since.John Isner, who is six-foot-10, has never finished a season ranked in the top 10, despite hitting 146 mph on the radar gun with his serve. Ivo Karlovic, who stands six-foot-11, has won $8.6 million in his career, but never finished a year ranked higher than 20.Some of that is due, of course, to the sustained mastery of the Big Four but some also could be due to physiology.A height advantage is most apparent on the serve where, all things being equal, simple biology and physics allow for additional velocity. Longer arms generally go along with increased height. During the serve, the arm and racket function like a trebuchet, and warriors figured out more than 1,000 years ago that a longer launch rope increases velocity. Indeed, Isner and Karlovic each lead the men\u2019s tour with nearly 21 aces per match.The problems begin when tall players\u2019 serves get returned, or during the other half of the match when they aren\u2019t serving. Height almost always compromises agility, and bending for low shots can be difficult.Cilic and Berdych are ranked 9th and 11th, respectively, in serving proficiency, but 27th and 46th in their return games. Raonic\u2019s serve is the tour\u2019s third best, but his return game is ranked 60th.Height in tennis will get its stiffest test in the game in the coming years as the 19-year-old American Reilly Opelka, who is a seven-footer, tries to break through. Patrick McEnroe, the former player and director of development at the U.S. Tennis Association, said Opelka \u201chas a tremendous upside\u201d but added, \u201che\u2019s almost too tall to be a guy that can certainly consistently be at the top.\u201dBerdych has been a mainstay in the top 10 the past seven years, and figures to have a decent shot against Djokovic, who has a balky shoulder and after a scheduling foul-up was forced to play his fourth-round match against Adrian Mannarino Tuesday instead of Monday. Berdych beat Djokovic here in the semifinals in 2010.\u201cBig game, flat shots, and that is pretty good for this surface where the ball doesn\u2019t bounce very high,\u201d Djokovic said of Berdych, though he didn\u2019t seem too worried, since he is 25-2 in his career against the taller Czech. \u201cI know what I have to do.\u201dWrite to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 15:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-tennis-giants-fall-short-on-big-stage-1499802056", "news_title": "Why Tennis Giants Fall Short on Big Stage", "keywords": "milos raonic,sam querrey,tennis,tomas berdych,wimbledon,wimbledon tennis,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "Leaders of the six Western Balkan nations gather in Trieste, Italy, on Wednesday for the annual Berlin Process conference. It will be an opportunity not only to discuss pathways of integration into the European Union, but also to heal wounds, unite behind an idea and, critically, create a new platform for economic growth. We will be asked to support, among other things, the formation of a regional economic area. I will be arguing in its favor.After decades of autocracy, Albania and its neighbors have now suffered through two decades of its exact opposite. This includes war, riots, chaos and more. With this has come corruption, cronyism and clientelism, as various political factions strive for power so as to pocket the spoils.Albanians are now calling for a halt to this free-for-all. That\u2019s the message voters gave us after my country\u2019s elections last month. After four years governing in coalition with a junior partner, my party campaigned for a full mandate to clean house and was given a rare parliamentary majority. Albanians endorsed our plans for nation-building and institutional reform, plans that will ultimately depoliticize governance and deliver the rewards to ordinary people.That\u2019s how we hope to gain stability for our country\u2014that, together with continued progress toward full membership in the European Union. A decision to start accession negotiations this year is within reach, once we have fulfilled our commitment to reform our courts and justice system and strengthen the rule of law.But economic factors make themselves felt even in this. Albanians and our Western Balkan neighbors have suffered years of instability in part because of economic underdevelopment. We have corrupt judges and corrupt prosecutors because they, too, want their share of the spoils. Corrupt politicians have plagued us for the same reason.When the main driver for affluence is politics instead of personal initiative and enterprise, conflicts are inevitable. They may take different forms: ethnic nationalism in some places, religious sectarianism in others, ideological divisions elsewhere. But when resources are scarce it always comes down to who you know instead of what you know or what you can do.So that is our next priority in Albania. While we continue to modernize and democratize our government, we will also lay out the basis for economic development.That is why this week in Italy, I will be strongly endorsing a regional economic area as a stepping stone to facilitating the EU accession process.There are some misgivings about the plan. Some of my Western Balkan colleagues fear that a regional economic area will be a cul-de-sac, a way-station where Brussels will abandon us. Some member states and EU leaders have displayed reluctance about further expansion.But we have only to look at the Central European Free Trade Agreement, to which all six Western Balkan countries are signatories, to see that a regional economic area can help, not hinder, our progress. CEFTA was originally founded by the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. They used it to demonstrate their ability to work together, despite political or cultural differences, and show that they were qualified for full EU membership.The critical benefit of a regional economic area is immediate. A Western Balkan market of 20 million is more attractive to investors and trade than an Albanian market of less than four million.This is important to my government. We want to unleash our nation\u2019s capabilities and encourage the creation of jobs and production. So we will be persuading our neighbors to get behind the plan. We have some ideas we will be putting forward to help reassure them about the EU\u2019s intentions, and I know that       Johannes Hahn,        the EU\u2019s enlargement commissioner, will be doing the same.Ultimately, this is about stability. We can\u2019t have that without a growing economy.

She runs as fast as anyone, and slams her first serves. She\u2019s agile and remains quick and reactive at the net, where she loves to volley. Most impressive of all: She\u2019s old but plays like she\u2019s young.The spry Williams, age 37, continued to impress on Tuesday at Wimbledon with a 6-3, 7-5 victory against Jelena Ostapenko, the 20-year-old Latvian woman who won the French Open last month. The last time a 37-year-old advanced this far at Wimbledon was in 1994, when Martina Navratilova\u2014a winner of nine Wimbledon singles titles\u2014eventually lost in the final.This is an unusually trying time for Williams. She was involved in a car accident in early June, soon after which a 78-year-old man died. Williams, according to police in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., legally entered an intersection before being cut off by another car. When asked about the incident at Wimbledon this week, Williams began to cry and had to briefly leave her interview room. For her, the tournament has been a savior.\u201cShe said she was going to focus on tennis everyday and I think that\u2019s what she\u2019s been doing,\u201d said her coach, David Witt. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to be positive and just focus on winning.\u201dWhen Williams lost in the first round at Wimbledon in 2012, most everyone thought her career was finished. Asked if she could continue, she answered, \u201cSure.\u201d Laughter ensued. But Williams said something else, too: \u201cLife is challenging, but I\u2019m always up for a challenge.\u201dShe was 32 years old then and suffering Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can\u2019t be cured. Even with strict diets and exercise she\u2019s never certain about how she\u2019ll feel during a match, and there\u2019s not much she can do if her symptoms flare up.\u201cYou do your best while you can,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dShe\u2019s done much more than anyone would have predicted. Williams hasn\u2019t won a Grand Slam title since 2008, but she\u2019s getting closer to that goal, not farther away. She\u2019ll now be ranked inside the top 10 and could go all the way up to the top five if she wins the title. She hasn\u2019t been ranked that high since 2011.On Tuesday, Centre Court\u2019s roof was closed for Williams\u2019s match because of rain earlier in the day, so the battle was louder than usual. Both women screamed and hit hard, but Williams found out how to make Ostapenko uncomfortable: Pummel her weak serve. Williams won 43% of her return points and all three of the break points she had.\u201cI told Venus, I thought that was her weakness,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe first serve is a little suspect also, but the second serve is very, very attackable.\u201dWilliams herself was broken once and served with more than her standard pace on her second serve. This, too, is by design, especially at Wimbledon. Right now, Williams would rather go for more on her second serve and keep players from attacking her, even if she misses more.\u201cShe might have a double fault here or there but I think the risk reward is higher, winning more free points, especially on somebody like Osapenko that just tees off on both sides,\u201d Witt said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take your chances, hit a lot of body serves. I still wish\u2014I want to see more body serves.\u201dWilliams had spotty health for years\u2014one could often see her with strained and pained thighs wrapped tight. Her results suffered. The last two seasons, though, she has become increasingly healthy, Witt said. Williams reached two Grand Slam quarterfinals in 2015 and one semifinal at Wimbledon last year. This year she lost to her sister, Serena, in the Australian Open final and reached the fourth round at the French Open, which is played on clay, her weakest surface.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Witt said. \u201cShe\u2019s 37 but like I said if she\u2019s staying healthy and has no injuries, this is probably, knock on wood, one of the years where she\u2019s not bandaged up or hurting.\u201dNext up for Williams: Johanna Konta, the British star who beat Simona Halep on Tuesday in a dramatic contest, 6-7(2), 7-6(5), 6-4 in two hours and 38 minutes. The match ended in bizarre fashion. Konta had match point in a rally when a fan yelped\u2014and Halep stopped her swing and hit the ball into the net. She looked miffed as she walked ahead to shake Konta\u2019s hand.Konta serves fairly well, but her true skills are hitting clean with conviction and sharp angles. Against Halep, Konta had 48 winners, better than Halep\u2019s 26. Konta ran as quickly, too, saving several Halep shots and frustrating her to no end.For Williams, the match against Konta could be long and stressful\u2014but she seems to be ready to go for it.

F 0.68%      ,             Nissan Motor Co.

But tests showed degradation over time and with exposure to humidity, conditions that are consistent with air bags that have previously exploded, the company said.The disclosures Tuesday expanded an unprecedented safety crisis to include air bags previously deemed safer because they use a desiccant, or drying agent, to help prevent ammonium-nitrate propellants from destabilizing and later rupturing. Regulators last year pressured Takata to recall air bags that lacked drying agents meant to prevent moisture building, as opposed to recalling devices that used them. Regardless, regulators at the time said all Takata air bags using ammonium nitrate as a propellant had to be recalled by the end of 2019 unless demonstrated to be safe.\u201cThis recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takata\u2019s ammonium nitrate-based air bags,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.), a longtime critic of the supplier and regulators, adding the safety crisis could become \u201cmindboggling\u201d should more inflaters be found defective. \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t afford to wait until the December 2019 deadline for that determination,\u201d he said.\u200bThe NHTSA said the recall was the first for an inflater type that used a desiccated phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate. \u201cBecause of the proactive nature of these recalls, there are currently no reports of injuries or fatalities resulting from a rupture of these inflaters,\u201d the agency said in a statement Tuesday.The latest recall affects an older crop of air bags using calcium sulfate as a drying agent, Takata said. More recent air bags use a different \u201coptimized\u201d drying agent alongside pyrotechnic materials, the company said. Takata noted it hadn\u2019t tested the relevant air-bag inflaters in Mazda vehicles, but had evaluated some from Ford and Nissan.Takata said in a statement that the defect report filed with regulators reflected the \u201cearliest generation of dessicant\u201d used in phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate inflaters. The inflaters were produced from 2005 through 2012 and used in driver-side air bags in the U.S., the company said. Takata said it continues to test more-recent inflaters.A Ford spokesman said the company is aware of Takata\u2019s defect report and has been in regular contact with regulators. \u201cImportantly, we aren\u2019t aware of any incidents, and test data doesn\u2019t suggest any issues,\u201d the Ford spokesman said.\u200bA Mazda spokeswoman said roughly 6,000 2007-2009 B-Series trucks in the U.S. are affected by the expanded recall and that there haven\u2019t been any \u201cincidents or abnormal deployments\u201d in them. A Nissan spokesman said the recall covered roughly 627,000 2007-2012 Versa hatchbacks and sedans, about 515,000 of which were sold in the U.S., and that owners could expect more information in 60 days.The expanded recall comes a day after Honda Motor Co. confirmed another fatality linked to a Takata air bag that exploded last year while a man attempted to repair a car in Florida. The air bags, which are at risk of rupturing and spraying shrapnel in vehicle cabins, are linked to at least 17 deaths and some 180 injuries globally.In the U.S. alone, auto makers are currently in the process of eventually recalling more than 40 million vehicles with as many as nearly 70 million of the defective air bags. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan in June amid crushing liabilities stemming from the unprecedented recalls.The supplier pleaded guilty earlier this year to criminal wire fraud for providing misleading testing reports on the air bags to auto makers, settling a U.S. Justice Department probe. The company has a tentative deal to sell operations to a rival supplier and use proceeds to help pay restitution to auto makers shouldering recall costs.Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 14:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/takata-recalls-more-rupture-prone-air-bags-1499788557", "news_title": "Takata Recalls More Rupture-Prone Air Bags", "keywords": "airbag recall,airbags,takata airbags,takata recall,Takata,7312.TO,JP:7312,Ford Motor,F,Nissan Motor,NSANY,7201.TO,Mazda Motor,7261.TO,bankruptcy,product,consumer safety,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,product recalls,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "On warm nights,       Bobby Francis       and his three roommates like to hit the balcony of their Manhattan apartment, pull out their phones and change the color of the New York City skyline.With a few taps, spires atop two Midtown skyscrapers flicker blue, red and orange.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like something I should have access to at all,\u201d said Mr. Francis, who turns 23 on Wednesday. The consultant sleeps in the former kitchen of a converted two-bedroom apartment.Yet he does. Mr. Francis and his roommates are members of New York\u2019s latest exclusive club: Spireworks, a much whispered-about free app that allows users to change the colors of the spires atop two of New York\u2019s tallest buildings.The only way to join is to be invited by a current user, so access has spread through an unlikely network of colleagues, friends and denizens of the city\u2019s rooftop bars. Among fans, invites remain a precious commodity, creating a new class of haves and have-nots.The have-nots plead their case on social media, and a black market for invitations has opened up on Craigslist.org and other websites, where they sell for $100 and up. The app owners recently asked Tinder, the dating app, to take down a profile hawking a Spireworks invite for $1,000.Anthony Papavasiliou,        a 38-year-old owner of a Fort Lee, N.J., Greek restaurant, has been posting on social-media sites seeking access since a friend showed him the app in action two years ago. He donated $250 to Creative Time, a New York nonprofit that supports artists that was giving out invites, but he didn\u2019t nab one.\u201cI just have to have it,\u201d he said, describing himself as \u201cthe kind of guy who wakes up at 3 a.m. to get the latest iPhone.\u201dThe app lets users control the colors of spires atop two buildings: One Bryant Park, dubbed the Bank of America Tower after its main tenant, and 4 Times Square, home to law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and distinguished by a large neon logo of fashion label             H&M.The app is the brainchild of Mark Domino, a digital-media artist who built \u201cmultisensory musical instruments\u201d while a student at Brown University. He is the son-in-law of Douglas Durst, the real-estate tycoon whose family company, the Durst Organization, owns the two midtown office towers. Mr. Domino works as director of digital media at Durst.After sunset each night, app users can log in, choose a building and select from a palette of colors during a two-minute session. Options for sparkles add pizazz. Cloud-hosted software sorts the requests and instructs the lights that line the two spires, a combined 716 feet tall.Usually only five users are allowed to actively change the colors at a time. So, on busy nights, a digital queue forms. Waits approached half an hour on July 4th this year. Red, white and blue were the only colors available that night.\u201cWhat is more powerful than getting control of the city?\u201d asked       Vincent Bruneau,        the 36-year-old CEO of a company that runs a corporate-meeting app who scored an invite. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of supernatural.\u201dLast year on a trip to Paris, Mr. Bruneau received a 6 a.m. call from a friend back in New York begging him to change the color of the spires so he could impress guests at a party. Bleary-eyed, Mr. Bruneau obliged.Durst has added One World Trade Center, which it manages, to the app on special occasions, including the U.S. Open tennis tournament, the NYC Marathon and World AIDS Day.Seven years ago, Mr. Domino wrote the code to control the spire lights. At the Durst holiday party in 2010, his father-in-law hit the button for the inaugural color change. Durst employees invited a few friends and tenants, who each got a few invites to give away.The app\u2019s community grew slowly and by word-of-mouth. In the past year, it has increased dramatically and the number of users is now approaching 10,000, Mr. Domino said. Each user can offer five invites.Earlier this year one couple turned Durst\u2019s Times Square spire blue to reveal the gender of the baby they were expecting, and a handful of men have used it in marriage proposals, Mr. Domino said. One user hid his phone in his pocket and bet tourists near Times Square that he could change the spire\u2019s color as a magic trick, Mr. Domino said.At a 2015 party celebrating the listing of a posh Tribeca penthouse with clear views to Midtown, a broker with the app wowed potential buyers as they played rooftop croquet while being serenaded by a string quartet. \u201cTalk about being king of the castle,\u201d said       Elizabeth Kee       of Core, the listing agent. The apartment sold for $8.3 million.When       Natalia Krasnodebska       got a Spireworks invitation from her friend       Ashley Zelinskie,        she said she fired off a thank-you tweet. Almost immediately, Ms. Zelinskie, an artist currently showing at             Sotheby\u2019s,       was flooded with dozens of requests for invitations from strangers. She said she declined them all.Mr. Domino said he didn\u2019t like the velvet-rope vibe that has grown around the app. He said he wanted Spireworks to be an \u201copen system to share in moments of discovery and play.\u201dHe said he is looking for ways to cut down on \u201cbootlegging,\u201d perhaps by doing away with the invitation system in favor of one unlocked by charitable donations. Durst said it has had preliminary discussions with charity partners but declined to name them.Mr. Domino also said he was dismayed how many of the app\u2019s most ardent fans are young men who want to use it to pick up women.He said that in a recent survey of Spireworks users, bartenders at the Boom Boom Room, a millennial hot spot atop the Meatpacking District\u2019s Standard Hotel, complained the club was saturated with men using the app to try to seduce women.James Geraci,        a recent college graduate from the Boston area, tweeted to the official Spireworks account during a Memorial Day visit to New York seeking an invite. Some women were coming by his hotel room, which faced the spires, and he said he thought the app would be \u201ca power move of a pickup line.\u201dNo one ever responded. Mr. Geraci said he \u201cended up having to try to impress the girls the old-fashioned way.\u201dAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'The \u2018In\u2019 Crowd\u2019s New Pastime: Editing the Manhattan Skyline.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 14:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/friends-in-high-places-secret-app-makes-manhattan-skyscrapers-change-color-1499799251", "news_title": "Friends in High Places: Secret App Makes Manhattan Skyscrapers Change Color", "keywords": "light displays, new york city, phone apps, real estate, tallest buildings,Durst Organization,page-one stories,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Grocery chain expansions are likely to spark robust construction in the coming years, analysts said, bucking the overall trend in retail development.U.S. grocers Publix Super Markets Inc., Wegmans Food Markets Inc.,             Kroger Co.       and             Sprouts Farmers Market Inc.       as well as German grocery chains Aldi and Lidl are opening new stores and will absorb an estimated 25 million square feet of space over the next five years, according to calculations from commercial real-estate brokerage and advisory firm             Marcus & Millichap Inc.The expansion will be difficult without new development, because shopping centers in desirable locations still have strong occupancy rates and grocers are unlikely to expand in struggling areas, according to Marcus.\u201cAs new grocery stores are built, in-line space will likely accompany it, pushing retail construction out of its current flat trajectory and into a period of more aggressive development,\u201d Marcus said in a research note.The national retail vacancy rate is at a relatively low 5.4% as developers have reined in construction of malls and strip centers since the recession, preferring to build only after securing leases from tenants.

For farmers, lower crop yields due to herbicide damage could add to financial pressures after several years of low crop prices.Long used to kill weeds, new formulations of the potent chemical are being widely deployed this year as more farmers plant soybean and cotton seeds engineered by             Monsanto Co.        MON 0.68%       to withstand dicamba. The St. Louis company estimated in June that about 20 million acres of its new biotech soybeans had been sold to farmers this year, up from about 1 million sold in a limited release last year.The U.S. agriculture industry is betting heavily on new combinations of biotech seeds and chemicals like dicamba to combat weeds that have grown resistant to glyphosate, the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide. Glyphosate use has proliferated over the last 20 years as Monsanto,             DuPont Co.       and             Syngenta AG       have rolled out seeds engineered to survive that spray. That has contributed to resistant weeds, which can choke out crops and damage farm equipment if left unchecked\u2014further eroding already-slim profit margins for farmers.Sources: State agriculture departmentsBut affected farmers say that when neighbors spray dicamba onto the new biotech crops, some of the herbicide is drifting onto adjacent fields that aren\u2019t planted with resistant varieties, sometimes severely damaging them.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating dicamba-related crop damage across multiple states and is discussing the mounting complaints with pesticide manufacturers.Some states are restricting how and when dicamba can be sprayed, ratcheting up fines for misuse and mandating online training courses for farmers. On Friday, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn announced a temporary suspension of the use or sale of the herbicide in the state, following more than 120 complaints of drift damage. That same day, Arkansas lawmakers banned its use or sale for 120 days, beginning July 11.\u201cEverybody\u2019s concerned about it,\u201d said       Brad Doyle,        who raises soybeans and runs a small seed company near Weiner, Ark. The state has received nearly 600 complaints of dicamba-related crop damage this year, up from about 30 in 2016, when dicamba-resistant soybeans were introduced. Complaints have also surged in Tennessee and Mississippi.Monsanto and German chemicals conglomerate             BASF SE,        BASFY -0.29%       which makes a version of the spray, criticized Arkansas for the ban, saying it deprives farmers of a critical weedkiller in the middle of growing season.A BASF spokeswoman said Arkansas\u2019 ban \u201cneedlessly punishes growers who have successfully and lawfully used the product, while failing to provide an effective deterrent to growers who may be willing to ignore the ban.\u201d The state also boosted fines on \u201cegregious\u201d dicamba violations to $25,000 from $1,000.A Monsanto spokeswoman said the ban was premature as the causes of reported crop injuries hadn\u2019t been fully investigated. The company doesn\u2019t sell its version of dicamba in Arkansas, because academics there are still reviewing it.Developed decades ago, dicamba kills weeds by stimulating rapid growth that outstrips the plants\u2019 nutrient supply. The chemical is prone to spray drift, prompting chemical makers to recommend it be applied with special nozzles. Dicamba can also pose a threat if the pesticide evaporates and spreads in gas form. BASF and Monsanto have tried to minimize that risk in newer versions that bind the herbicide more tightly to plants.Some farmers in Arkansas and Missouri have filed lawsuits against the two companies, arguing they bear some liability for dicamba-related crop damage. BASF and Monsanto are contesting the claims.Crop scientists are researching the effects dicamba can have on unmodified soybean plants, such as reducing the number of beans produced per plant. But some of those efforts are being disrupted by the spray.Chuck Wilson, director of the University of Arkansas Northeast Research and Extension Center, said nearly all of the facility\u2019s soybean research plots were damaged by dicamba in June. About 300 acres of crops were affected, including some planted to research dicamba drift damage.\u201cWe basically had to start over and replant,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, \u201cand hope they don\u2019t get hit again.\u201d\u2014       Jesse Newman       contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 14:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arkansas-bans-herbicide-as-farmers-blame-neighbors-for-crop-damage-1499765401", "news_title": "Arkansas Bans Herbicide as Farmers Blame Neighbors for Crop Damage", "keywords": "arkansas dicamba ban,basf,crop damage,dicamba, dupont,farming,genetically modified food,glyphosate,herbicides,monsanto,syngenta,Monsanto,MON,BASF,BAS.XE,Brad Doyle,Jesse Newman,output,production,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,agricultural production,economic news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,agriculture,oilseed,grain farming,soybean farming,chemicals,pesticides,agrochemicals,basic materials,resources,seeds"}, {"content": "The Trump administration on Monday formally announced its long-anticipated nomination for the key post of Federal Reserve vice chairman in charge of bank oversight.

It put it on the field as opposed to simply reffing the game.\u201dBloomberg television interview, May 2015On Adopting a Rule for Monetary-Policy Decisions\u201cI am all for transparency; I think the Fed has that part of it right. What it has wrong is that it continues to believe that it shouldn\u2019t be following a rule.

Saudi Arabia was among 24 producers to say they would withhold almost 2% of global oil output to bring crude supplies back in line with demand and raise petroleum prices.Saudi Arabia\u2019s June production figures are set to be released officially on Wednesday in OPEC\u2019s closely watched monthly market report.The figure of 10.07 million barrels a day is Saudi Arabia\u2019s government-endorsed production number but isn\u2019t actually used by OPEC to determine production-agreement compliance levels.OPEC will also release a production figure for Saudi Arabia and other producers based on its own assessment of output, which the cartel uses for compliance rates.Saudi Arabia has scrupulously adhered to its limits until now, cutting more than it promised in a bid to convince the market the OPEC cuts were for real. In May, Saudi Arabia pumped 9.88 million barrels a day.The production-cutting deal was extended in May for 18 months through March 2018.Summer is an especially difficult time for Saudi Arabia to cut oil production because it is one of a handful of countries that generates electricity by burning crude. The kingdom typically hikes production during the summer, as domestic-energy needs soar during the scorching heat.Electricity demand was higher than normal because the Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan fell in June.

But lately executives have noticed overall book sales rising as consumers spend more time reading, partly thanks to heightened interest in politics.Global book-publishing revenue is expected to increase 9.7% from 2015 to \u20ac122.95 billion ($140.10 billion) in 2020, according to statistics cited by Bertelsmann.Electronic book sales last year made up just 20% of Penguin Random Houses\u2019s total sales, according to an analysis by book industry expert       R\u00fcdiger Wischenbart       for the Frankfurt Book Fair.Printed books \u201cwill still be around in 100 years,\u201d Penguin Random House Chief Executive       Markus Dohle       said in a document sent to Bertelsmann employees and seen by The Wall Street Journal.Executives at Bertelsmann said that the deal wouldn\u2019t affect Penguin Random House\u2019s daily operations, but Bertelsmann\u2019s increased control will give it the right to name the chairman of the publisher\u2019s board.\u201cThe decision-making powers have of course shifted in our favor,\u201d Bertelsmann CEO       Thomas Rabe       said in an internal document sent to employees.Increased control of Penguin Random House makes sense financially and strategically, with the deal set to boost Bertelsmann\u2019s earnings by more than \u20ac60 million while enhancing the prospects of its books business in China, India and Brazil, Mr. Rabe said.Under the terms of the existing New York-based Bertelsmann-Pearson joint venture, the German company had the right to appoint the CEO, a position currently filled by Mr. Dohle, a Bertelsmann loyalist who has been with the company for 23 years and ran Random House before the merger.Previously Bertelsmann had 53% of Penguin Random House. The increased stake comes after Bertelsmann this past winter announced it was targeting \u20ac20 billion in annual revenue by around 2020, with 30% coming from the U.S.Penguin Random House\u2019s enterprise value for the transaction had been set at $3.55 billion, according to Bertelsmann, which was advised by             J.P. Morgan                   Chase & Co. In preparation for the deal in the last few weeks, Bertelsmann issued a \u20ac500 million bond, according to the company\u2019s spokesman.Bertelsmann Chief Financial Officer       Bernd Hirsch       said the company had financed the acquisition at \u201cexceedingly favorable terms.\u201dAs part of the deal, Pearson can\u2019t make further changes to its slimmed-down minority stake until March 2019. Pearson finance chief       Coram Williams       said the company won\u2019t keep its stake in the joint venture forever. After the 2019 date, \u201cwe are free to do what we like,\u201d Mr. Williams said.The 2013 merger of Penguin and Random House joined 250 brands that publish more than 15,000 titles a year.Penguin Random House\u2019s stable of writers include       Dan Brown,       John Grisham,       Ken Follett,        George R.R. Martin,       John Green       and       Paula Hawkins.       Earlier this year, the house turned heads by signing a two-book deal with Barack and       Michelle Obama       that Bertelsmann called the highest advance ever paid in the history of book publishing.Bertelsmann competes with             News Corp,       which owns book publisher HarperCollins, as well as Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal.In January, Pearson issued an exit notice that its 47% stake could be up for sale. Pearson faced falling revenue from its North American higher-education business and told investors it was looking to shore up its balance sheet.The stake sale has provided Pearson with around \u00a3300 million ($387 million) of extra capital that will be used for a share buyback, said Mr. Williams, Pearson\u2019s CFO.The transaction is expected to close in September pending regulatory approval in the EU and other jurisdictions, the companies said.\u2014Olga Cotaga and Nina Trentmann in London contributed to this article.Write to Zeke Turner at Zeke.Turner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 14:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pearson-sells-22-stake-in-penguin-random-house-for-1-billion-1499754628", "news_title": "Bertelsmann Tightens Control Over Penguin Random House", "keywords": " acquisitions,bertelsmann, book publishing,dan brown,educational books,education publishers,german publisher,john grisham, mergers, obama's book deal, obamas' memoirs,pearson,penguin books,Bertelsmann,Pearson,PSON.LN,UK:PSON,Penguin Random House,R\u00fcdiger Wischenbart,Markus Dohle,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,printing,publishing,academic,scientific,trade journals,book publishing,broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "A new online retailer is betting it can get American shoppers to break up with big brands from Colgate to Heinz.Called Brandless, the San Francisco-based startup on Tuesday started selling generic, health- and environmentally conscious consumer staples, such as fluoride-free toothpaste and organic agave nectar.

With Democrats unlikely to support the bill, Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) can lose no more than two GOP votes to pass it. Vice President       Mike Pence       could break a potential 50-50 tie.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do health care next week,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to turn to other issues,\u201d he said, citing the annual defense policy bill, confirmation of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       nominees and raising the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit among the summer\u2019s goals.Such a strategy could help Senate Republicans avoid returning to their home states empty-handed in August if the health bill flops, an outcome that would likely anger Mr. Trump, conservative voters and House Republicans, who passed their version of the bill in May.Mr. McConnell has struggled for days to win over the dissidents in his party. In a move that runs contrary to GOP orthodoxy, the revised bill expected to be released Thursday likely will keep ACA taxes on affluent households that Republicans have criticized for years: a 3.8% tax on net investment income and a 0.9% payroll tax. The bill\u2019s details, sent to the Congressional Budget Office for an official assessment, assumes the taxes remain in place, one GOP aide said.Both taxes only apply to individuals with incomes above $200,000 and married couples making over $250,000. Neither threshold is indexed for inflation.Keeping the taxes would retain about $230 billion in revenue over 10 years that Republicans could spend to address concerns of GOP senators wary of the bill. \u201cI assume the rationale for that was to have more money to spend,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.).Sen.       John Cornyn       (R., Texas) said the money could go to a fund that states could use to shore up their individual-insurance market, and potentially to allow insurers to bring down premiums.Keeping the taxes would also blunt the arguments of some Democrats, who say the earlier bill reduces taxes for the wealthy while cutting spending on Medicaid for low-income people. Some Republicans\u2014including       Bob Corker       of Tennessee, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and       Susan Collins       of Maine\u2014have questioned that trade-off.Conservatives have sharply criticized the idea of retaining any of the ACA\u2019s taxes, saying they were among the most objectionable parts of the law often called Obamacare. It also isn\u2019t clear whether House Republicans would accept maintaining the levies; the House bill would repeal the 3.8% investment tax retroactively for 2017 and end the 0.9% payroll tax starting in 2023.Democrats say the move to maintain the taxes highlights Republicans\u2019 unease over a bill that, in an earlier version, would repeal taxes on wealthy households while cutting federal funding for Medicaid by $772 billion over a decade.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously an acknowledgment that it\u2019s not particularly easy to take away health care for millions, to go ahead and take away the most vulnerable [people\u2019s] health insurance, and then give tax breaks to the wealthiest,\u201d said Sen.       Robert Menendez       (D., N.J.).Mr. McConnell had reason to delay the Senate recess. Leaving Washington for a five-week break without a victory on health care or other matters would be politically perilous. \u201cI cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Monday.Such comments from Mr. Trump and scores of conservatives put pressure on Mr. McConnell to keep the Senate in session, but the delay also carries political risk. Senators use time away from Washington to meet constituents, and the prospect of lawmakers remaining in the capital, while potential opponents have the home state to themselves, presents its own challenges.The Senate recess will now start the week of Aug. 14, two weeks later than the previously scheduled start in the week of July 31.Senate Republicans also remained mired in debate Tuesday over a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) to allow insurers that sell plans complying with ACA regulations to also sell policies that don\u2019t.Health analysts say that would likely lower premiums for younger, healthier people, who would buy more limited plans, while causing premiums to rise for people with existing conditions, who would buy the more comprehensive plans that comply with the ACA.To address those concerns, a group of GOP senators is urging Mr. Cruz to alter his proposal to establish a \u201cratio\u201d that would limit the price difference between the two sets of plans, Mr. Rounds said Tuesday. That would make insurers \u201cthink twice about making a real lowball offer in one plan and then let the other plan go bankrupt,\u201d he said.It wasn\u2019t clear if the tweak would ease the concerns centrist Republicans have voiced about the Cruz plan, or whether it would be accepted by conservatives who back it. Although Mr. McConnell said the CBO will complete its estimate of the impact of the latest version of the bill by Monday, its analysis of Mr. Cruz\u2019s measure may not be ready by then, GOP aides said.That may be problematic, since some conservatives are unlikely to vote for the bill to clear a procedural hurdle next week if Mr. Cruz\u2019s measure isn\u2019t included in it.Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, said it could be technically difficult to create a firm ratio that still allows insurers to offer different benefit packages and premiums based on people\u2019s health status.\u201cIt could really constrain what could be offered in the unregulated market and could fail to accomplish the goal of the Cruz amendment, which is to give insurers much more leeway,\u201d he said.\u2014Michelle Hackman and Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Sets Health Vote for Next Week.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 14:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-health-bill-likely-will-keep-acas-taxes-on-high-income-households-1499794004", "news_title": "Senate Delays August Recess as Health Bill\u2019s Fate Hangs in Balance    ", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,cbo,gop,health care,health law,obamacare,republicans,senate health bill,senate recess,taxes,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May       welcomed an officially commissioned review recommending stronger protection for workers in the U.K.\u2019s \u201cgig economy,\u201d as her government seeks to address insecurities generated by new informal employment practices.The review is a first step toward addressing the divisions between haves and have-nots in U.K. society that the government believed were exposed by last year\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union. It is a first step in a broader effort by governments in industrialized economies to give people more security in work so as to combat a backlash against globalization.\u201cThe issues [the report] confronts go right to the heart of this government\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mrs. May said on Tuesday.The report recommended that British law should be clarified so that people working for Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s smartphone app and the like are regarded as workers\u2014it suggests the term \u201cdependent contractors\u201d\u2014and not as self-employed.They should have rights to greater worker protection, including safeguards to ensure they don\u2019t earn less than the national minimum wage plus a supplement to account for vacation pay. Firms using their services should contribute to the U.K. state\u2019s National Insurance system like traditional employers, it said.Mrs. May said lawmakers would consider the report\u2019s nonbinding recommendations over the summer and respond in detail this year. Labor-market flexibility can\u2019t be one-sided, with workers bearing the brunt of it, she said.Britain has become a battleground over the status of gig-economy workers, who are typically people who log on to smartphone apps to find short-term jobs such as chauffeuring people, delivering food or mowing lawns. Because of its relatively large population and shared language, the U.K. is one of the largest international markets for U.S. gig-economy giants such as Uber and TaskRabbit Inc.Tuesday\u2019s report cited an April study from the not-for-profit Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development that found that 1.3 million Brits, or 4% of working adults in the U.K. between ages 18 and 70, work in the gig economy.Of those gig-economy workers, the study said 58% already have a permanent job elsewhere and take gig-economy jobs to boost income.Some major companies have argued that these workers aren\u2019t entitled to employee rights, including paid holidays and minimum wage.Such workers have challenged that position around the world, including in the U.K., where a London tribunal ruled in October that Uber drivers should be entitled to rights typically offered to full-time employees. Uber is appealing that ruling.A labor union is now suing London-based Roo Foods Ltd., which runs the popular food-delivery app Deliveroo, for the right to organize couriers in north London.\u201cWe would welcome greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status,\u201c said       Andrew Byrne,        Uber\u2019s head of policy in the U.K. A Deliveroo spokesman said the company welcomed the report, saying \u201cemployment law is outdated and this is a great opportunity to make it fit for the 21st century.\u201dThe report recommended that the government develop regulation that establishes tests to determine whether workers are employees or dependent contractors. It also proposed having the government build an online tool that lets such workers easily know their rights.The U.S. is also grappling with the question of on-demand workers\u2019 employment status. Last year, a federal judge threw out Uber\u2019s attempt to settle an employment class-action suit for $100 million, saying it was unfair to drivers. But the drivers\u2019 suit was also dealt a blow by a related case that said many drivers must file their cases independently.Neil Carberry,        managing director for people and infrastructure at the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, said a number of proposals included in the report, including changes to minimum wage and agency worker rules, would be of significant concern to companies and could affect job creation.Frances O\u2019Grady,        general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said that \u201cit\u2019s no secret that we wanted this review to be bolder. This is not the game-changer needed to end insecurity at work.\u201dMs. O\u2019Grady added that \u201cTheresa May cannot use this report as shield to hide from her responsibilities.

Swaths of that half of the city were largely flattened in months of fighting, with streets impassable and basic services nonexistent.\u201cOur priority now is getting people home,\u201d said Abdulsattar Alhabbu, head of the Mosul municipality. \u201cOur focus is on west Mosul, where most of the damage from the fight happened. Our priority is bringing back the water supply. There is no life without water.\u201dIraqi Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi      proclaimed victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday. The government declared a holiday on Tuesday and a week of official celebrations. But even amid the festive atmosphere, Mr. Abadi referenced the tremendous economic and security challenges ahead. An Iraqi counterterrorism forces commander said the fight to clean up the last remaining pockets of Islamic State resistance in Mosul was continuing on Tuesday.Nearly nine months of fighting to drive the extremist group from the city displaced more than 800,000 residents, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many say they won\u2019t return home until water and other basic services are restored\u2014a task that will take at least six weeks, according to Hussameldin al-Abbar, an official of Nineveh province, where Mosul is located.\u201cNearly every building on the western side of Mosul was completely destroyed. With this level of devastation, it\u2019s very unlikely that the hundreds of thousands of displaced families will be going home anytime soon,\u201c said       Arnaud Quemin,        interim Iraq country director for aid group Mercy Corps. \u201cThis is a critical moment for Mosul.\u201dThat lack of basic services is keeping thousands of residents like       Ahmed Suleiman Abdullah       staying put in desert camps for displaced people near Mosul, even as scorching summer temperatures soar above 110 degrees. Mr. Abdullah fled in March with his two wives and nine children after his house in western Mosul was partly destroyed by fighting.\u201cOne of the major problems is there is no water supply to the area and no electricity,\u201d he said recently. \u201cHow do you survive with kids with no water?\u201dPart of his house could be repaired quickly if he had money to do it, Mr. Abdullah said.\u201cWe had no jobs for three years under Daesh,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. \u201cWe spent all our savings, and now there is no work and we have nothing.\u201dVIEW InteractiveKhalid Muhammed,        32, a stationery and cosmetics shop owner in western Mosul, said last week that he reopened last month as people started to return. But a lack of city-supplied water was limiting customers.\u201cWe are getting water tankers from NGOs, but we need the state-supplied water to be back so all the people will come back to their homes,\u201d he said, referring to aid organizations.Though government officials recently put forth a $100 billion, 10-year plan for reconstructing the country, they are short on funds. The International Monetary Fund in 2016 provided more than $5 billion in emergency loans to shore up Iraq\u2019s economy and to rebuild key cities destroyed by fighting. But it wasn\u2019t enough.The government will need hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild and compensate residents who lost their homes, businesses and factories in Mosul. But Iraq\u2019s economy has been badly battered in three years of war against Islamic State and the government has only a fraction of what it needs to repair the city.\u201cWhat we have now is nothing. We need an emergency budget for rebuilding Mosul, and international aid,\u201d said Mr. Abbar, the provincial official. \u201cFor 2017, Nineveh province\u2019s budget was $40 million. By my estimation what we need only for the restoration of infrastructure and basic services is more than $500 million.\u201dA committee of local and federal government officials is organizing the massive task of cataloging and verifying damage to homes and businesses, but it is a preliminary step. A 2009 federal law promises Iraqis compensation for damage caused by terror attacks or military operations.While life in Mosul\u2019s eastern half largely returned to normal after it was retaken by Iraqi forces in January, months of fierce fighting continued to dislodge entrenched militants from densely populated western neighborhoods, including stiff resistance this week during its last stand in the historic Old City.Islamic State took control of Mosul in the summer of 2014, seizing about one-third of Iraq. The northern city, once home to some two million people, became its stronghold in Iraq. Even after its defeat in Mosul, the group still controls a few towns in Iraq, a stretch of the border with Syria and much of the oil-rich eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzour.Some Mosul residents had already begun returning to help in the cleanup and to begin to rebuild even before Mosul\u2019s full recapture this week.In the Jadida neighborhood of western Mosul,       Hassan Falah,        20, stacked broken blocks of concrete last week at his family\u2019s house, whose roof and third story were blown off. He and his extended family are hoping for government aid for rebuilding, but they aren\u2019t waiting for it to come. They built the multifamily structure themselves decades ago, and they can build it again, he said.\u201cAfter what we saw under Daesh, we never hoped to survive,\u201d he said, recounting how his family and neighbors hid out in the basement as the battle raged above them. \u201cWe were given a new life after liberation.\u201d\u2014       Ali A.

And Marvel. And HBO.The world\u2019s most successful digital-entertainment company, movie producer, and television network are all blurring the lines between the big screen and small, between big-budget TV and mid-budget movies, and between film reboots and TV pilots to such a degree that it\u2019s tough to say what a movie really is anymore.Is it entertainment meant to be seen on the big screen?Netflix has answered that question with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d After tiptoeing into the space with art-house fare and comedies from the fading box office draw Adam Sandler, Netflix has significantly upped its movie game with the $75 million military-political-comedy \u201cWar Machine,\u201d released in May and starring       Brad Pitt,        and \u201cOkja,\u201d a $50 million modern fairy tale from South Korea\u2019s most respected director, Bong Joon Ho, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton.

These films premiere on Netflix and are intended to be streamed on televisions, tablets, and phones.What makes them different from Netflix original programs like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cDaredevil?\u201d Just their length.

Movies give you a satisfying two hours of entertainment, whereas TV always keeps you wanting more.But that doesn\u2019t apply to one of the most popular big-screen releases of the summer: \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming.\u201d The Marvel Studios-produced movie is really the best television pilot of the year.Like a lot of hit TV shows, it features a character spinning out of a long-running hit\u2014see the new Spider-Man\u2019s cameo in last year\u2019s Marvel blockbuster \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d \u201cHomecoming\u201d features a relatably insecure protagonist still learning how to be Spider-Man, an out-of-his-league love interest, a nerdy best friend, a mentor who thinks our hero still has a lot to learn, and a single mom (technically his aunt) from whom he\u2019s hiding his double life.Between all those characters, \u201cHomecoming\u201d introduces a lot more questions, tensions, and conflicts than it resolves and ends on a twist that leaves you needing to find out what happens next\u2014exactly what the best television pilots achieve. Set a season pass on your DVR now for all the \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d episodes coming in the next few years!This is what Marvel has been doing brilliantly for years. It doesn\u2019t make self-contained movies with a beginning, middle, and end or even trilogies that eventually reach a conclusion, like \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201dThe Marvel cinematic universe is one big ensemble television series with episodes that focus on one set of characters or another but whose overarching storylines are always expanding, not resolving.Perhaps what differentiates movies then is the scale. You can\u2019t get the overwhelming spectacle of a big-budget visual-effects spectacle on an             Imax                   screen at home.Then again, have you seen \u201cGame of Thrones?\u201d HBO spends more than $10 million an episode for a fantasy show with dragons and swordfights and sieges that rival the biggest and best you can see at the multiplex. No single episode approaches the nine-figure budget of a movie like \u201cHomecoming,\u201d but a 10-episode season certainly does.The finale of the coming season 7 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will run an hour and 22 minutes, it was recently revealed, and episodes of the eighth and final season will regularly be the same length. Almost as long, in other words, as a movie.You might even be able to watch some of them at a movie theater. Imax previously screened the final two episodes of the fourth season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and in a few months, it will premiere the pilot of Marvel\u2019s \u201cInhumans\u201d before it debuts on ABC.So is that a movie or a TV show or what?In a few years, it\u2019s doubtful anyone will care. It\u2019s all content. And if that word scares you, well, it could be worse. There could be nothing good to watch.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Movie?

Two of the architects involved in the project, and its general contractor, also aren\u2019t sure or no longer have the records.City officials say the use of such combustible panels would have complied with both the building code in place when construction of the hotel began in 1998, as well as the current code, and they said such panels are allowed when a building has sprinklers. But experts in U.S. fire-safety regulations raise questions about whether the panels would have passed muster, then or now.The panels in question have cores made of polyethylene, a common variety of plastic derived from petroleum or natural gas that can be highly combustible.For decades U.S. regulators have generally restricted metal composite panels on tall buildings unless they had fire-resistant cores. However, panels with polyethylene cores have been widely used in the U.K., including on London\u2019s recently refurbished Grenfell Tower, which went up in flames June 14.In an interview,             Arconic Inc.,       which made the Grenfell Tower panels, declined to comment on whether the same panel type was used on the entire Marriott in Baltimore. \u201cWe sell our products with the expectation that they are used in a [wall] system that complies with local building codes and regulations,\u201d a company spokesman said.On its website, Arconic, formerly part of Alcoa Inc., says the 750-room Marriott Waterfront used 83,000 square feet of the type of panel used on Grenfell Tower, marketed as Reynobond PE.\u201cAt 23 feet each, these are the longest panels ever produced by Arconic Architectural Products,\u201d the website says.Two of the architects involved in the Marriott\u2019s design said in interviews they don\u2019t recall what type of panels encase the hotel, located in the city\u2019s high-end Harbor East district. One, Peter Fillat, said he discarded the project file about six years ago following normal protocol.Marriott International Inc.       said it is working with the hotel building\u2019s owner to identify the type of cladding. \u201cThe safety and security of our guests and associates is a top priority,\u201d spokesman Jeff Flaherty said in an email.The general contractor that built the hotel said the firm doesn\u2019t keep specifications on finished projects as old as the Marriott.Aluminum composite panels first appeared in buildings in Europe in the 1970s and became popular in the U.S. during the 1980s. The panels gave architects a lightweight alternative to masonry and other materials.From the start, though, U.S. safety engineers recognized the rigid cores sandwiched between two sheets of aluminum that gave the panels strength would easily burn during a fire.\u201cThere\u2019s always been nervousness about putting combustibles on the outside of buildings,\u201d said Beth Tubbs, a senior staff engineer the International Code Council, which developed the model International Building Code in use across the U.S. since 2000. Most U.S. states and large cities, including Baltimore, routinely adopt the IBC into their local ordinances.Building codes in the U.S. have mostly limited the use of composite panels with flammable cores to buildings no taller than 40 feet, or about the maximum reach for most firefighting equipment. Amendments to the code in recent years have allowed flammable panels to be used above 40 feet only under certain conditions and limits.In the late 1990s, the Massachusetts-based National Fire Protection Association, a trade association, said in guidelines that wall assemblies that could pass a fire test could be installed on high-rises. But in the nearly 20 years since the standards were created, the only composite panels to pass have been those made with fire-retardant cores. Panels with polyethylene cores or foam insulation still haven\u2019t been certified for use in the U.S. above about 40 feet.Baltimore officials said Friday they don\u2019t know what is on the Marriott Waterfront despite a permitting process that involves a multiagency review of construction plans and a series of inspections, including fire safety.Tania Baker, a city spokeswoman, said Baltimore doesn\u2019t require developers to submit the names of specific building products and that it is \u201cultimately the architect\u2019s responsibility\u201d to ensure those materials comply with the building code.But Ms. Baker also said the use of polyethylene panels would have complied with the code in place when the hotel went through the approval process\u2014and would do so under the current code\u2014because the building had internal sprinklers as fire extinguishers.She said the International Building Code has height limits for Reynobond PE panels \u201cunless, as is the case here, the building is sprinklered.\u201dHowever, nothing in the city\u2019s building code in place at the time of the Marriott\u2019s construction, nor in the current one, says the installation of sprinklers automatically negates the 40-foot limit, experts say.The ICC\u2019s Ms. Tubbs said the 1990s-era building code required exterior panels to undergo heat and fire testing to determine whether and in what amounts they could be used on the structure, in addition to the required sprinklers in high rise buildings. It isn\u2019t clear whether such tests were done.Ms. Tubbs said the IBC today allows metal composite panels on taller buildings if sprinklers are provided, but only if certain other criteria are met and if no more than 50% of a building has such cladding. Otherwise, she said, compliance with the fire-test standards developed by the National Fire Protection Association would be mandated, along with the use of thermal barriers.Ms. Tubbs said she wasn\u2019t commenting specifically on Baltimore or any changes cities might have made to the code.Robert Solomon, a division manager at the National Fire Protection Association, agreed that the building code used by the city at that time included a 40-foot limit for flammable panels as well as provisions subjecting panels to fire testing if they were used at higher elevations.Douglas Evans, a consultant who retired as a fire-protection engineer for Clark County, Nev., said interior sprinklers can help keep a fire from reaching a building\u2019s exterior. But if the outside of a building catches fire due to an external source like a burning dumpster or car, \u201cinterior fire sprinklers will have no effect,\u201d he said.Corrections & Amplifications   Arconic is formerly part of             Alcoa,       Inc.

They have made the divorce bill one of several priorities that must be addressed upfront\u2014along with citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit and the situation in Ireland\u2014before they are willing to begin discussions on a future EU-U.K. trade deal.The clash over the financial settlement comes ahead of the start Monday of the second round of negotiations over the U.K.\u2019s departure from the bloc. In recent days, European officials have voiced concerns that the U.K. is seeking to sidestep discussions on the divorce bill.During a parliamentary debate in London on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson said Britain should tell the EU to \u201cgo whistle\u201d if it repeats its demands for a large exit bill.\u201cThe sums that I have seen that they propose to demand from this country seem to me to be extortionate,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.EU officials and diplomats involved in the negotiations say the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator,       Michel Barnier,        wants at least to touch on all the priority issues during next week\u2019s talks. However, so far, Britain hasn\u2019t set out its thinking and European officials are concerned British officials are looking to avoid the issue.The \u201ccommission will talk about money,\u201d one of the diplomats said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the U.K. will say.\u201dAn EU official said Tuesday that \u201cthe hard work begins,\u201d adding that the EU expects Britain \u201cto engage substantially on all the\u201d priority issues in next week\u2019s talks. Any effort to brush aside the divorce settlement \u201cwon\u2019t fly at all,\u201d the official said.A diplomat close to the negotiations from an EU country said he expected the U.K. would ask next week for greater clarity on the bases for the EU\u2019s claims, but didn\u2019t expect the U.K. to set out its own position. \u200b \u200bThe divorce bill has long been one of the most sensitive points in the Brexit discussions. While U.K. officials have said they would abide by their legal obligations, senior officials have dismissed calls for Britain to pay tens of billions of euros.During last month\u2019s one-day opening Brexit discussions, U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis didn\u2019t accept the EU\u2019s legal case for the divorce bill, saying there were different legal views on the issue, according to officials involved in the talks.The EU says the U.K. owes the money partly because of its commitments in 2019 and 2020 under the current EU budget period. However, the EU also contends that Britain has legally committed to pay its portion of future EU pension arrangements and for EU programs that have been promised but not yet delivered.Mr. Barnier has said he doesn\u2019t expect a divorce bill figure to be agreed in the coming Brexit talks but wants to settle on a methodology for calculating Britain\u2019s commitments. However, some European diplomats say there needs to be significant flexibility left to come back and settle on a final figure once the Brexit negotiations move to a conclusion next autumn.\u201cThere needs to be a mutual understanding of what the limits are on an eventual deal,\u201d a senior diplomat said.However, with EU countries facing a battle next year over agreeing a new multiyear budget for after 2020 without Britain\u2019s large annual EU payments, there is a shared incentive among the 27 other governments for the U.K. to pay as much as possible.Other large net EU contributors such Germany and the Netherlands have said they won\u2019t pick up the British tab, raising the prospect of sharp cuts to future EU programs.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 13:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-to-press-u-k-over-brexit-divorce-bill-1499793192", "news_title": "EU to Press U.K. Over Brexit Divorce Bill", "keywords": " bill, brexit, britain, divorce, eu, payment,u.k.,European Union,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,society,community,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Amazon.com\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       popular Prime Day is best understood as a big investment by the company to showcase its retail prowess. And when it comes to big spending by Amazon, Wall Street is primed for even more.The e-commerce giant has ramped up its capital expenditures significantly over the last few years. This feeds both the vast distribution network that powers its retail business as well as its state-of-the-art technology backbone that drives a fast-growing cloud services business. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures hit $6.7 billion last year\u2014up 46% from the prior year and nearly double from three years ago.

But as one European capital after another dropped out of the competition, the organization\u2019s leaders decided they could not lose either of the two remaining candidates, Paris and Los Angeles, as a future host city.Now, after just a few weeks of consideration, the roughly 100 members of the IOC have approved President       Thomas Bach\u2019s       request to change the organization\u2019s decades-old rules so that they can award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at once this September.\u201cIt is better to have one big bird in the hand rather than a small one on the roof,\u201d Bach said. \u201cWhat we have here is two big birds in our hands.\u201dIt is likely that Paris will get 2024. The French have explained that land needed for their proposed Olympic Village won\u2019t be available for 2028.In contrast, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city would relish hosting the Games \u201cin two months, if we were asked,\u200b or in two decades.\u201d       Casey Wasserman,        the leader of the bid, said Tuesday, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in ultimatums, we believe in partnerships.\u201dThe move gives Bach time to reform the entire process of how the IOC makes its most important decision. He aims to change it from a beauty contest in which the organization hopes contestants show up to the pursuit of a strategic partnership with a desired location.John Coates, an IOC vice-president, said the organization needs to use the time to convince the traditional winter sports capitals in Europe to bid for the Games again after none of them sought the 2022 event\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make more of an effort,\u201d he said.It\u2019s part of a broader move that finds the IOC moving with uncharacteristic urgency to maintain its prominence as the sports and entertainment landscape shifts beneath its feet.Michael Payne, the former director of marketing for IOC and a leading international sports consultant, said Bach is making up for the the stasis of former president Jacques Rogge\u2019s 12 years of leadership.\u201cThis is stuff that should have been done previously,\u201d Payne said. \u201cAiming to broaden its appeal amid a declining television audience, especially in the U.S., the IOC has already done away with what had been a seven-year process for adding sports to its program. Last month, for example, the IOC added the three-on-three basketball and freestyle BMX to the 2020 Games.Another problem emerged in June when the IOC and             McDonald\u2019s Corp.abruptly parted ways after a nearly four-decade relationship. The deal between the two parties, valued at more than $50 million a year, ran through 2020.A sudden termination would have been unthinkable a decade ago, when the association with the Olympic rings was a key tool for McDonald\u2019s international expansion. But people with knowledge of the process say both sides had grown dissatisfied with the partnership, as the IOC wanted to broaden its connection to the food industry.Two people with knowledge of McDonald\u2019s executives\u2019 thinking, including one former executive, said the deal wasn\u2019t profitable for the fast-food franchise, and franchisees had to help pay for it. That made sense for branding when audiences were glued to Olympic telecasts but not in a digital world of streaming highlights and declining ratings.NBC averaged\u200babout \u200b27.5 million total daily viewers \u200bfor last year\u2019s Rio Games, down \u200bnearly 10% from the 2012 Summer Games\u2019 in London. NBC in 2014 committed more than $8 billion to distribute the Games in the U.S. through 2032\u200b, but badly missed its guaranteed television audience. Nonetheless, NBC declared after the Games that it was the most successful media event ever, in part because of the online audience..No decision highlights the IOC\u2019s more urgent approach to change more than the move to revamp the host-selection process just two months before it was scheduled to pick a 2024 host. That\u2019s especially true because Paris, making its third bid since 2000, is far from a perfect candidate.According to an IOC technical report released last week, just 63% of the population in Paris and France at large supported the bid earlier this year, down from 85% support for the city\u2019s 2012 bid.Last week\u2019s report also noted the significant security investments Paris will have to make in a country where the security threat level is now classified as \u201chigh.\u201d The IOC\u2019s evaluation team also said the Paris bid needs to produce a \u201cdetailed financial and operational model,\u201d especially given the more than $2 billion investment required to build a village for the athletes.Imperfect or not, Bach has decided the IOC needs Paris and Los Angeles. In recent years, Budapest, Rome, Oslo, Hamburg, Stockholm, Boston and Krakow all pulled out of Olympic bids in the face of political opposition. Only Almaty, Kazakhstan remained in the race when the IOC selected Beijing for the 2022 Winter Games race. Also, leaders of the U..S. Olympic Committee have made it clear that, after the IOC turned away New York in 2012 and Chicago in 2016, the U.S. will be on the sidelines for a long time if Los Angeles doesn\u2019t land a slot in this round.\u2014Julie Jargon contributed to this article.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 13:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/olympic-committee-clears-path-for-paris-in-2024-l-a-in-2028-1499792035", "news_title": "Olympic Committee Clears Path for Paris in 2024, L.A. in 2028", "keywords": "International Olympic Committee,olympics,sports,routine general news"}, {"content": "As             Tesla Inc.        TSLA -0.91%       begins a pivotal launch of its first mass-market car, the company said it plans to triple its capacity to repair vehicles, adding 1,400 technicians, dozens of new service centers and hundreds of maintenance vans that can be dispatched to an owner\u2019s home.The Silicon Valley auto maker started production last week\u00a0of the Model 3, a $35,000 sedan that Chief Executive       Elon Musk       is betting will boost Tesla\u2019s production to 500,000 vehicles next year from 84,000 last year. The surge of cars\u2014coupled with any possible mechanical glitches that could arise with a new model\u2014would likely tax a small\u00a0network of about 150 Tesla service centers around the world.Over the next 12 months, Tesla plans to add another 100 service centers world-wide, according to a company executive. But since most of the repairs are routine and can be done remotely, Tesla will expand its fleet of service vans by 350 this year\u00a0from several dozen currently, the executive said.\u00a0The\u00a0new\u00a0vans will come equipped with espresso machines and snacks for the customers.Tesla is bracing for\u00a0the most critical test in its 14-year history, as it aims to transform from a niche luxury player into a mainstream auto maker. The first 30 Model 3 cars will be handed over to customers by the end of July and Mr. Musk has said he is targeting monthly production of 20,000 by December.The rollout of Tesla\u2019s Model X sport-utility vehicle was riddled with a number of mechanical malfunctions last year that underscored the challenges of the company\u2019s mass-market ambitions. Tesla moved quickly to resolve those new-model glitches.Buyers of some of its vehicles have criticized Tesla for slow service.In March,       Jon McNeill,        Tesla\u2019s sales and service president, posted a letter on an online Tesla user forum responding to complaints of long wait times to get vehicles fixed at third-party body shops.

A soon-to-be-launched startup Parallel similarly will rent blocks of units from landlords, decorate them and rent them out to overnight guests with an in-house hospitality team.Pillow Residential, which last month raised $13.5 million in funding, offers a platform that allows building owners to access information about Airbnb guests and see which units in their building are being rented out and when.The services are sprouting up just as the red-hot U.S. apartment market is beginning to cool.In all, there are roughly 29 million apartment units in the U.S., according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. Nearly 800,000 new units have been built since the beginning of 2014, according to             CoStar Group Inc.But the vacancy rate for apartments in downtown markets rose to 8.1% in the first quarter from 6.8% a year ago, according to CoStar. Some 45% of buildings completed in the first quarter of 2016 were more than 10% vacant after a year, compared with 38% for those built in the first quarter of 2015, suggesting properties are taking longer to lease.The startups, which are expected to typically operate eight to 16 months in a building, see potential in helping the developers of those buildings wring revenue out of units that aren\u2019t yet leased.WhyHotel piloted its concept with 50 empty units in a Pentagon City, Va., building owned by             Vornado Realty Trust.       Prices were $179 to $329 a night on units that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have generated revenue until they were rented to long-term tenants. The service ran from January through May, when there were enough tenants to bring the building close to full occupancy.\u201cThey\u2019re very easy conversations to have because there\u2019s a lot of product coming online,\u201d said       Jason Fudin,        co-founder and chief executive of WhyHotel and a former vice president of strategic initiatives at Vornado. Mr. Fudin declined to disclose what percentage of the nightly rental fee Vornado received, saying it is different for every deal.Mr. Fudin said his team hammered out an agreement with local officials that permitted it to operate the hotel for no more than 24 months. He said the business model makes sense only in buildings that are 200 units or more, in which significant structural modifications aren\u2019t needed to bring the buildings up to hotel-like codes and they can get enough scale to make it worthwhile to operate as a hotel for only a short time.While WhyHotel avoids converting apartment units permanently to hotel rooms to help dodge the controversy of housing becoming tourist lodging, other companies are embracing that model.YouRent takes control of a block of units in high-end apartment buildings and rerents them as hotel rooms.       Brian Ferdinand,        YouRent\u2019s chief operating officer, said the company hopes to take advantage of the glut of luxury-apartment inventory and demand for hotel rooms in hip urban cores.The company is expanding in Miami; Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tenn., and plans to fan out to San Diego, Denver and Boston. Mr. Ferdinand said a two- or three-bedroom unit rents for about the price of a hotel room on a nightly basis.Mr. Ferdinand said that in some cases, YouRent pays landlords 20% above what they could get from a typical tenant because the short-term rental business is so lucrative. The company\u2019s average guest stay is 3.5 nights.YouRent is aiming to provide a more structured alternative for landlords, Mr. Ferdinand said, offering detailed screening to weed out people with criminal records or sexual predators, paying applicable local taxes and obtaining permits and buying rental insurance.These new services aim to get around an issue that Airbnb has been confronted with: Historically, landlords have been reluctant to allow tenants to rent out units because they didn\u2019t receive any of the revenue. Most apartment leases forbid tenants from subletting units without permission.Airbnb has been trying to recruit owners of big apartment buildings, which represent a crucial growth opportunity for the company because the sleek modern buildings with doormen, fitness centers and contemporary finishes are likely to appeal to business travelers.Airbnb rolled out its own program last fall that would give landlords who allow tenants to rent units a cut of the revenue.The initial reception was cool. Landlords are wary of liability, disrupting the sense of community in the building and having the risks of tenants who hadn\u2019t gone through the full screening process.A spokesman for Airbnb said the program has expanded to about 10,000 eligible units and the program \u201ccontinues to grow.\u201dPillow Residential aims to make it easier for landlords to allow tenants to rent units on Airbnb.       Blake Hayunga,        chief operating officer at Virt\u00fa Investments, said the company is using Pillow\u2019s services in two buildings and plans to roll it out in 11 more.Tenants who use the platform typically give 10% of the rental revenue to the landlord, as well as a 10% to 20% commission to Pillow.Though the upside for landlords, Mr. Hayunga said, is mostly in marketing the perk to potential tenants and helping tenants afford higher rents.\u201cYou\u2019ve got millennial residents who travel several weeks a year and are struggling to pay the rent,\u201d he said.Mr. Hayunga said when tenants are considering renting a unit, he shows them a matrix of how much they can offset their rent by using Airbnb. Short-term rentals are already happening, he said. \u201cThis just allows us to take control of the process.\u201dWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 12:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-help-landlords-turn-apartments-into-hotel-rooms-1499770801", "news_title": "Startups Help Landlords Turn Apartments Into Hotel Rooms", "keywords": " airbnb,apartment building occupancy, hotel rooms, landlords, short-term rentals, startups,vc analysis,Airbnb,Virt\u00fa Investments,CoStar Group,CSGP,Vornado Realty Trust,VNO,WhyHotel,YouRent.com,Pillow Residential,Blake Hayunga,Brian Ferdinand,Jason Fudin,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,retail,wholesale,etailing,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,e-commerce,online service providers,leisure,arts,hospitality,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "Is time running out on one of the most fabled names in media?Senior executives at             Time Inc.        TIME 1.80%       recently met to discuss a potential rebranding of the company that could include changing the publisher\u2019s corporate name, according to several people familiar with the situation.Such a move would be aimed at Time Inc.\u2019s business and marketing partners, and would be intended to reposition the publisher as a modern media company with growing digital and video ventures.\u201cWe\u2019re excited about our business strategy and momentum, and we are in the early stages of considering a rebranding effort to reinforce the success of our transformation from a legacy publishing company to a multi-platform consumer media company,\u201d said a Time Inc. spokesman.Time Inc. isn\u2019t contemplating changing the names of any of its magazine titles, which include TIME, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune. Time Inc. could also launch a major rebranding campaign that would reposition the company without changing its name, one of the people familiar with the situation said.Although no decisions have been made, Time Inc. has held preliminary conversations with some branding firms to better understand how those companies would approach a potential rebranding.Among the names batted around by Time Inc. is \u201cLife,\u201d although one person briefed on the internal discussions said it is \u201cway premature\u201d to suggest that Time Inc. will change its name.\u201cLife\u201d is the title of the now-retired magazine heavy on photojournalism, whose heydey was in the mid-twentieth century. Time Inc. recently revived the brand for a virtual reality platform.Doing away with one of the iconic brands of American media would be a dramatic move, symbolic of how legacy publishers have been upended by the rise of digital media.Time Inc. was co-founded by Henry Luce and Briton Hadden, who published the first issue of Time magazine in 1923.Time Inc., facing steep print advertising declines like the rest of the industry, recently ended discussions with potential buyers of the company. Time Inc. has been emphasizing digital investments, including the purchase earlier this year of Adelphic Inc., an automated advertising buying platform, and the launch of such new social video brands as The Pretty, a beauty brand aimed at young women.For the quarter ended March 31, Time Inc.\u2019s total advertising revenue fell 8% to $331 million, as a 32% increase in digital advertising wasn\u2019t enough to offset a 21% decline in print. The company also said it would cut its quarterly dividend. Last month, in a major restructuring, the company said it was eliminating about 300 jobs in the U.S. and abroad, or 4% of its workforce.The idea of rebranding came up internally as a potential part of the company\u2019s strategy moving forward, one of the people familiar with the situation said.Changing one\u2019s corporate name can be a risky business, as other media companies have discovered.Univision\u2019s Fusion Media Group said this month that its digital publication Fusion will become the news and politics site \u201cSplinter,\u201d effective July 24, prompting jokes about the cartoon \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d (where a rat with ninja abilities was a major character).In June,             Verizon Communications Inc.       merged AOL with             Yahoo                   and created a content and advertising unit called Oath. And in 2016, Tribune Publishing, whose newspapers include the Los Angeles Times and the             Chicago Tribune,       changed its name to Tronc as part of a shift to digital publishing.The names failed to win over many social media users, but the companies have defended their choices.Write to Jeffrey A.

The higher rates met resistance from some advertisers, and prompted some to reduce the amount of airtime they buy.Televisa, the world\u2019s biggest producer of Spanish-language television programming, merged its content development in January with partner Univision Communications Inc., a U.S. Spanish language network for which Televisa is the main content provider, in a bid to shore up flagging ratings at both broadcasters.Univision       executive Isaac Lee,        who is heading that effort, said Tuesday the ratings gap between Channel 2 and its competitors has widened as the company applies an \u201caudience-centric, data-driven programming strategy,\u201d and a \u201cleaner and more efficient production scheme.\u201dHe said he expects the benefits of the overhaul in content production processes to be fully achieved in 2018.Televisa\u2019s overall revenue in the second quarter fell 1.5% from a year earlier, with losses in advertising compensated by gains in satellite television, cable and telecommunications. Net profit rose 2.6% from a year before.\u201cThe strategy to rely less on advertising is paying off,\u201d Mr. De Angoitia said, noting that the Sky satellite television and the cable and telecommunications businesses each generate more revenue than advertising, and that combined they account for almost 65% of Televisa\u2019s operating profit.

FB 0.79%       has spent years developing two of the world\u2019s most popular messaging apps. Now, with slowing revenue growth in its core service, it wants to cash in.Starting Tuesday, Facebook will show advertisements inside Messenger, the chat app that Facebook says is now used by 1.2 billion people every month. The ads will be shown between users\u2019 messages, similar to the way ads are sandwiched between posts in Facebook\u2019s news feed, the main scroll of pictures, videos and posts that greets everyone who uses the service.Facebook plans to roll out the ads \u201cslowly and carefully\u201d to Messenger\u2019s users, said       Stan Chudnovsky,        Messenger\u2019s head of product, replicating the strategy followed by its photo-sharing app, Instagram, which started showing ads to users in 2013 and took a couple of years to implement more widely.Facebook also has been studying ways to profit from WhatsApp, the company\u2019s other messaging app.Facebook is trying to make money from Messenger as it braces for an expected slowdown in revenue growth from news feed, the primary source of Facebook\u2019s revenue today, starting in mid-2017. Executives have told investors that Facebook would no longer increase the number of ads shown to users in the news feed. The increases helped juice revenue in prior years, but risked turning off users by jamming too many ads in their feeds.Facebook has positioned itself to keep driving growth beyond news feed, with its acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and with heavy investments in messaging. It spun out Messenger as a stand-alone app in 2011 and continued to develop it separately after buying WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion.\u201cWe believe that messaging, it\u2019s one of the few things that people actually do more than social networking,\u201d Facebook Chief Executive       Mark Zuckerberg       said that year.Both Messenger and WhatsApp, which also claims 1.2 billion users, have been studying moneymaking strategies centered on connecting users to advertisers. Facebook has said two billion messages are sent between people and businesses every day over Messenger. Barclays Capital estimates that figure is about 2.5 billion for WhatsApp. But Messenger is more popular in affluent markets like the U.S. and Europe, while WhatsApp is more popular in developing countries that haven\u2019t yet been lucrative for Facebook.Facebook could net an extra $11 billion in revenue from the two messaging apps by 2020, Barclays Capital estimates.Facebook has been testing Messenger ads for six months in Australia and Thailand, Mr. Chudnovsky said. He said users were \u201cvery open\u201d to ads that were useful and connected them to companies.Advertisers can use Messenger ads in two ways: to drive traffic to their website or to open a messaging thread between the user and company. Facebook is urging advertisers to use Messenger ads to open a thread, where users can ask questions and seek advice about a potential purchase.\u201cOn Messenger, these ads open up a conversation and end up being higher converting for the advertiser,\u201d Mr. Chudnovsky said.Write to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 12:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-show-ads-on-messenger-to-bolster-revenue-growth-1499790600", "news_title": "Facebook to Show Ads on Messenger to Bolster Revenue Growth ", "keywords": "facebook ads,facebook advertising,facebook messenger,facebook whatsapp,messenger ads,Facebook,FB,Instagram,Stan Chudnovsky,new products,services,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,social media marketing,advertising,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "PayPal        PYPL -1.03%       Holdings Inc. said Tuesday it has hired       Mark Britto,        a financial-technology entrepreneur and a former executive at             Amazon.com Inc.,       to lead its lending business.Mr. Britto, 53, joins PayPal from Boku Inc., a company he founded that lets consumers buy goods and services using their mobile phones and pay for them alongside their usual bill from their telecommunications provider. He replaces Steve Allocca, who left PayPal in May to become the president of online lenderLendingClub Corp.PayPal in recent months has been considering options for its lending arm, which provides loans to consumers to finance purchases on e-commerce websites and to small businesses that accept PayPal. The unit has bolstered PayPal\u2019s bottom line in recent years: the consumer-credit portion accounts for around 13% of PayPal\u2019s annual operating profit, or roughly $280 million, according to analysts at             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.The company currently uses cash to fund the $5.1 billion of consumer loans and around $600 million of small business loans it has on its balance sheet. Executives are looking at alternatives that would free that cash up for other uses.Keeping loans on its balance sheet also exposes PayPal to the risk of consumer defaults, which have been on the rise at some credit-card companies and online lenders.\u201cWe will continue to be in the credit business for all of the great benefits that it provides our merchants and consumers, but maybe we can do that in a less capital-intensive way,\u201d said John Rainey, PayPal\u2019s finance chief, at an industry conference in May.The J.P.

INTC 0.09%       on Tuesday brought to market a new generation of chips used in the servers that run data centers, firing back at competitors who lately have moved to challenge its hegemony in its most profitable market.The rollout of the Xeon Scalable Family, an updated line of 58 processors priced from roughly $200 to $10,000 each, highlighted Intel\u2019s ambition to maintain its hold over all segments of the data center market.Intel makes most of its revenue on processors for personal computers, but the powerful server chips bring higher prices and profit margins. The server-chip division reported an operating-profit margin of 44% in fiscal 2016 compared with 32% in the segment that sells PC chips.The server business has become more strategic lately as sales of personal computers have plateaued in recent years.Intel holds nearly 100% of the $16.5 billion global market for server chips that run the software instructions called x86 that form the foundation of nearly all commercial software, according to Mercury Research.But Intel\u2019s server business shows signs of contracting. Although the chip giant has said it expects double-digit revenue growth in its data-center division in coming years, half of that growth will come not from chips but from ancillary products like storage and networking, according to Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. In addition, Intel has said that profit margins in its data center segment would narrow as that business absorbs more of the costs of developing new manufacturing methods.Meanwhile, the server sector has attracted a raft of rivals.             Advanced Micro Devices Inc.       in June started shipping its Epyc line of server chips aimed squarely at the lower-priced half of Intel\u2019s offerings. Those products, AMD\u2019s first entry into the data-center market since 2013, are giving server makers a welcome alternative for Intel\u2019s products. However, any impact on Intel won\u2019t become clear for some time.Qualcomm Inc.       and             Cavium Inc.       in March demonstrated chips running             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       Windows Server operating system based on technology from ARM Holdings, a division of             SoftBank Group Corp.       Microsoft has said it expects to use such chips in its Azure cloud service.             International Business Machines Corp.       has announced new server chips expected later this year.And the boom in artificial intelligence has spurred sales of graphics processors made by             Nvidia Corp.      , which has overshadowed Intel in the training phase of machine learning.Intel responded to the newly competitive environment with a New York launch event Tuesday where it touted partnerships with prominent software and hardware vendors, endorsements from             Amazon.com Inc.       and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google\u2014an early Xeon Scalable Family customer\u2014and boasts of its central role in three systems that are candidates for an annual list of top 500 supercomputers.Spanning a range of uses and cost-per-performance characteristics, the new product line is intended to encourage customers to move into higher-price products, the company said. Moreover, it is tightly coupled to Intel memory, data storage, networking, and accelerator products intended to win the company a larger portion of data-center budgets.Intel claimed that the top-of-the-line Xeon Scalable Family unit delivers nearly two-thirds higher performance, on average, than the company\u2019s previous most-powerful server processor. It presented dozens of what Intel called \u201cworld record\u201d scores on performance tests on various applications.Industry watchers tend to withhold judgment about performance until independent test results become available and generally agree that performance is only one of many factors crucial to market success.\u201cAnyone can put together a [processor] that will look good on paper from a feature-comparison standpoint,\u201d said Lisa Spelman, Intel\u2019s VP of data center marketing.

The Fed already has lifted rates twice this year and penciled in a third move later this year. That could make some Democrats nervous. Some lawmakers and activists have argued the Fed should keep interest rates lower for longer to generate more momentum in the economy to help minority and low-income groups, who are usually the last to benefit from economic expansions and the first to suffer in downturns. Some Fed policy makers also have indicated they want to hold off on raising rates again until they see inflation rebound after weakening in recent months.

The central bank launched three rounds of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, in 2008 and accumulated a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

Expect Republicans to press Ms. Yellen for more details on the Fed\u2019s balance-sheet plans.Yellen\u2019s FutureUnless President       Donald Trump       nominates her to a second term, Ms. Yellen\u2019s time as Fed leader will end in early February 2018.\u00a0That means this could be her last round of Humphrey Hawkins hearings. But she could remain on the Fed\u2019s board after her term as chairwoman ends, a move that would create one fewer vacancy for Mr. Trump to fill.\u00a0 Expect some statements of praise and gratitude toward Ms. Yellen, particularly from Democrats. And expect some probing questions, particularly from Republicans, about whether she would leave the Fed if not renominated.Monetary Policy RulesRepublicans have been pushing for legislation to force the Fed to adopt a mathematical formula such as the Taylor rule to guide its monetary policy-making. Fed officials have pushed back, saying a rule would limit their independence and make it harder for them to react to unexpected shocks in the economy.\u00a0On Friday, the Fed took a pre-emptive defensive step by including a long discussion on the drawbacks of monetary policy rules in its semiannual monetary policy report.\u00a0That probably won\u2019t stop Republicans from pressing the Fed chairwoman on policy rules.Fiscal PoliciesMs. Yellen\u2019s visit to Congress comes as lawmakers grapple with ambitious and divisive legislative goals, such as rewriting the 2010 health-care overhaul, rewriting the U.S. tax code and increasing infrastructure spending programs. Those proposals, if enacted, could have a significant economic impact. If they stimulate growth and fan inflation too much, the Fed could respond by raising rates more aggressively to prevent the economy from overheating. Expect lawmakers to try to get the Fed chief to weigh in on these debates and to offer support for their priorities. But Ms. Yellen has been through these hearings before. Don\u2019t expect her to tip her hand.Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 12:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-yellen-likely-to-discuss-rates-balance-sheet-in-congressional-testimony-1499789300", "news_title": "Fed\u2019s Yellen Likely to Discuss Rates, Balance Sheet in Congressional Testimony ", "keywords": "balance sheet,congress,fed,humphrey hawkins,monetary policy,rates,testimony,yellen,The Fed,Yellen,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "OTTAWA\u2014The Bank of Canada is widely expected on Wednesday to raise its benchmark policy rate for the first time in seven years, signaling the Canadian economy is on the path to recovery after years of tepid growth following the global slump in commodities.Canada\u2019s central bank, led by Gov.       Stephen Poloz,        is joining peers at the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank as they dial back on the extraordinary run of ultralow interest rates aimed at jump-starting the global economy in the aftermath of the recession of 2008-09.In Canada, which was hit with an income shock after the downturn in prices of oil and other commodities, low rates have resulted in an extended period of loose money that has fueled a housing boom in pockets of the country. Some analysts say soaring real-estate prices, which have stretched affordability and forced official measures to curb investing, could be a factor driving Wednesday\u2019s expected increase.Canadian housing starts rose 9.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 212,695 units in June, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said on Tuesday.Amid recent growth in gross domestic product and robust job creation, Mr. Poloz has signaled he will remove stimulus this week, monetary-policy analysts said. That is even though inflation\u2014at an annualized 1.3% rate in May\u2014remains well below the central bank\u2019s 2% target, and wage growth remains stubbornly low.Nine of the 10 primary dealers of Canadian government securities dealers surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predicted a Bank of Canada rate rise on Wednesday, from its near-record low of 0.5% to 0.75%. One firm, TD Securities, said it believed the central bank would hold off until October, arguing a rate rise now could hurt the Bank of Canada\u2019s reputation as an inflation-targeting bank.The majority who expect a rate increase mostly cite two factors: a marked bullish shift in central bank communications about the outlook; and data signaling Canadian output is expanding at its fastest pace in nearly three years, or since the onset of the commodity-price downturn.Looking UpHiring and economic growth in Canada have exceeded expectations in recent months amid low rates.

Sales remain high historically, thanks to demand for weapons for personal protection and the popularity of shooting ranges.

The longtime gun enthusiast, who built his first rifle as a teenager, chose to lead the spun-out Vista and targeted an outdoor pursuits market estimated to be worth $63 billion a year.He diversified the company away from firearms by buying the maker of Camelbak drink holders as well as firms producing paddle boards and cycling accessories.James Debney,        American Outdoors\u2019 chief executive, has since adopted a similar strategy, poaching two senior Vista executives and diversifying into new markets including last week\u2019s purchase of Gemini Technologies Inc., one of the largest makers of silencers.Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 11:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-aims-for-new-leadership-amid-gun-sale-slump-1499788768", "news_title": "Vista Aims for New Leadership Amid Gun Sale Slump ", "keywords": "ceo retirement, ceo search, firearm maker, gun sales, mark deyoung ,vista outdoor,Vista Outdoor,VSTO,Mark DeYoung,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,firearms,aerospace,defense,consumer goods,defense equipment,products,industrial goods,leisure,travel goods,sports goods"}, {"content": "A U.S. Marine plane crashed into a soybean field in rural Mississippi on Monday, killing 16 service members aboard, according to U.S. defense officials.Fifteen Marines and one sailor, a Navy corpsman, were killed in the incident.Marine Corps officials said the flight began from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina, and was headed to a naval air facility in El Centro, Calif., to transport personnel and equipment there.The Corps\u2019 Reserve headquarters, Marine Forces Reserve, is based in New Orleans.Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration contacted Marine Corps officials when the KC-130 aircraft disappeared from air-traffic control radar over Mississippi, according to Marine officials.Officials said the cause of the crash is still unknown and under investigation.

She spoke with       Marc Myers.Growing up in Harpswell, Maine, I was always conscious of the wind. The Atlantic Ocean was our front yard, and our house was completely exposed. Even playing in the woods as a child, I thought the wind was trying to tell me something.I first heard       Bob Dylan\u2019s       \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d in 1973, during my last year in high school. Someone played it for me. Even though the song had come out 10 years earlier, when I was 7, I never owned the record as a young person. I didn\u2019t have the money, and I didn\u2019t have anything to play the record on.As a child, I sensed the wind had a restless, secretive quality. The song\u2019s argument that the answers to life\u2019s vexing questions are blowing around in the wind and that you just have to listen to hear them resonated with me.From the start, I knew that \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d was a protest song, that the wind was a metaphor for a rising countercultural movement in the \u201960s. But for years, I heard the song solely as a lyric.Now I experience the song differently when I hear it on my iPhone and put the lyric in today\u2019s context. After Dylan\u2019s acoustic guitar opens the song, his voice is remarkably melodic and softly insistent.As he sings, the line that catches my ear reminds me not to overlook what\u2019s right in front of us:\u201cYes, \u2019n\u2019 how many times can a man turn his head / and pretend that he just doesn\u2019t see?\u201dMany of us walk past people living on the sidewalk asking for money and either ignore them or never see them. That\u2019s what makes the song so special: The words constantly take on fresh meaning.But much depends on where you hear them. In 1978, I went to my first Dylan concert in Augusta, Maine. He performed \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t quite the same as hearing his original recording.There were too many people there for the song to be personal, and the song\u2019s intent was brought down to an earthly level.

He\u2019s now seen by colleagues, business partners and friends as a master.Raised in India by parents who were college professors, Mr. Aradyha learned to defer to elders and others with authority. He moved to the U.S. to earn a doctoral degree in structural dynamics at North Carolina State University in 2000, and then rose through the ranks as a software engineer at several companies to become vice president of technology at Digitas in Boston in 2006.The ad agency\u2019s flamboyant culture was a shock. \u201cI was one of those button-down engineers who was quiet and held himself in the background,\u201d Mr. Aradhya says. At his first client pitch meeting, a colleague from the creative department showed up in a pirate shirt. Another wore leather pants.\u201cThey held court with clients, and they were completely respected,\u201d Mr. Aradhya says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hey, this is a new world.\u2019People trained in technology often have to sharpen their social skills to move into jobs that require selling, communicating or managing others. Mr. Aradhya made the shift by learning to explain technology to non-techies and polishing his image and conversational skills.He traded his dark suits and button-down shirts for stylish shoes and bright-colored shirts, says       Tonny Wong,        his supervisor at Digitas. Mr. Aradhya also learned to talk about his complex work without making others feel intimidated, says Mr. Wong, now chief consulting officer at HackerAgency, a Seattle marketing company.Introducing himself to strangers didn\u2019t come naturally when he began attending events. \u201cI had to force myself,\u201d he says. Without a network, he says, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to scale or build anything valuable.\u201dMr. Aradhya founded his own consulting firm, Novus Laurus (Latin for \u201cnew success\u201d) in 2009, to develop digital marketing strategies for clients, including             Staples Inc.       He also began investing in consumer tech, food and indie film ventures in 2012.Mr. Aradhya spends six to eight hours a week going to events and following up with people. He embraced as his networking mantra a formula he\u2019d heard from colleagues in marketing: You must \u201centertain, enlighten or enrich\u201d people to attract positive attention to a brand, he says. He tries to do the same for people he meets, so they\u2019ll remember him and help when they can.Mr. Aradyha began window shopping and researching men\u2019s fashions online to figure out how to project a confident, successful image. He swapped his dark suits for jackets of crushed silk or woven with metallic thread, and wears exotic-looking designer shoes by Zota or Fiesso. The look shows he\u2019s not afraid of taking risks, and tends to attract people who are curious and capable, he says. At many events, \u201cI don\u2019t even have to start a conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople will ask, where did you get those shoes?\u201dHis crushed-silk jacket caught the eye of a fashion-industry speaker at a recent conference and helped Mr. Aradhya shoot to the front of a line waiting to meet the man.His style makes him a standout at tech gatherings where \u201cthe men are in rumpled shorts and man buns and T-shirts, and you\u2019re tempted to ask them, \u2018Have you done your laundry in a month?\u2019\u201d says       Diane Darling,        author of \u201cThe Networking Survival Guide.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a very memorable figure,\u201d says Lexington, Mass., public-relations executive Bobbie Carlton. She has been sharing contacts with Mr. Aradhya since she met him at an event three years ago. He has become an investor in Innovation Women, a speakers\u2019 bureau she founded to promote diversity among conference speakers.Mr. Aradhya began studying how people use humor when networking. He noticed that people who interrupted a conversation with a joke were often ignored. Those who found contextual humor in their surroundings and interjected it gracefully into conversations fared better.He also says something outrageous now and then. The audience was dozing off at a late-afternoon program recently where he was a panelist. He was the last to introduce himself, and he jolted listeners awake by identifying himself as \u201cthe king of India\u201d who also happens to run Novus Laurus. \u201cHe definitely woke everybody up\u201d and drew a laugh, says Colleen Bradley-MacArthur, a Lexington, Mass., media-relations strategist who was present.As he enters an event, Mr. Aradhya looks for the power center in the room\u2014a group of people who appear successful and prosperous, or who are deep in thoughtful discussion.A common networking mistake is to walk up to a group, change the subject and start talking about yourself, Mr. Aradhya says. He has learned to ease in and listen for a while instead, before breaking in and turning the conversation in the direction he wants.Still, like anyone who networks a lot, he has been shot down sometimes. A bodybuilder at 5-foot-11 and 195 pounds, he can be intimidating. If he sees a person making eye contact without approaching him, he engages the person with a friendly question.Q: I\u2019m an experienced product-management executive in semiconductors looking to change industries, but I\u2019m not even getting interviews. I\u2019ve been told I should leave off my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 my college-graduation dates and any jobs I held more than 10 years ago, to avoid age bias. Any advice?\u2014B.S.A: Most hiring managers won\u2019t spend more than 10 seconds scanning your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the first go-round, so highlight experience most relevant to the job, says John Reed, head of technology recruiting at Robert Half, Menlo Park, Calif. If a job you had 15 years ago is relevant, include it, he says. If not, leave it off. If your degree helps prove you\u2019re qualified, feature that. It is fine to omit the graduation date if it is more than 10 years in the past.You may be getting cut during first-round screenings by human-resources staffers checking boxes for a few basic criteria, says Brian Binke, president of Birmingham Group, a Berkley, Mich., affiliate of the Sanford Rose Associates executive-search network. Consider researching the company, preparing a few succinct points to show why you\u2019re a good fit and calling the hiring manager directly.

Pepsi shares fell less than 1% to $113.27 in midday trading.The Purchase, N.Y., maker of Frito-Lay snacks, Gatorade and its namesake cola has been hurt as consumers spend more time at the perimeter of the supermarket browsing through produce and fresh meats and less time in the center aisles, where the company\u2019s packaged foods such as Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima are found.Still, the company has been able to achieve sales growth by raising the prices for its products. During a conference call, analysts raised concerns that the price increases could backfire, sending customers to competitors selling cheaper snacks and drinks.Pepsi Chief Executive       Indra Nooyi       said the company watches pricing \u201cvery, very carefully on a weekly basis. I think where the market is today, when we can take pricing, we should take the pricing.\u201dPepsi executives added that their strategy includes not just raising prices but shifting the company\u2019s portfolio to more premium products, such as its new snack, Lay\u2019s Poppables.Sales in its Frito-Lay and North American beverage units increased 3% and 2%, respectively, on flat volume growth. One of Pepsi\u2019s newest products, its LIFEWTR bottled-water brand, generated $70 million in sales in its first five months, the company\u2019s chief executive, Indra Nooyi, said during the call, and is on track for $200 million a year in sales.Sales slipped 1% in its Quaker Foods business, but volume held steady.PepsiCo\u2019s beverage volumes declined 2% in the latest quarter while total food and snacks volume grew 2%, driven by gains in foreign markets.In a nod to the growing importance of online sales, Ms. Nooyi said the company\u2019s e-commerce-related efforts include developing snack packaging that travels better and the cold delivery of beverages.In all for the quarter ended in June, PepsiCo posted earnings of $2.11 billion, compared with $2.01 billion a year ago.

On June 30, the Commerce Department reported the personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose 1.4% in May from a year earlier. That was a slowdown from a 2.1% annual increase in February, the only month since 2012 the index\u2019s annual increase exceeded the Fed\u2019s target.Some of the recent inflation slowdown \u201ccould be transitory,\u201d Mr. Harker said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode now\u2026let\u2019s just be pragmatic about it.\u201dIn his London appearance, Mr. Harker sounded less concerned about sluggish inflation, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to get caught up in a single decimal point, report, or even a quarter\u2019s worth of data.\u201d He said that \u201cthe importance lies in underlying trends, and, in the case of inflation, I\u2019ve seen the factors exerting downward pressure as temporary,\u201d although he added the Fed would be paying attention to data to determine if a change in trend has happened.On Tuesday, Mr. Harker also said the exact timing of the central bank\u2019s balance-sheet wind-down hasn\u2019t been decided, but he \u201cfully expects\u201d it to start this year.The Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds rate in June to a range between 1% and 1.25%.

Far-left and anarchist militants have bases in Hamburg, Berlin and Leipzig, from where they have waged low-intensity campaigns of vandalism targeting the state, utilities and international companies, but rarely individuals.Several politicians and security officials said last weekend\u2019s events meant tolerance of such groups now had to stop.\u201cWe have a broad political agreement when it comes to the fight against violence by Islamist or right-wing extremists,\u201d said       Rainer Wendt,        head of one of Germany\u2019s two police unions. \u201cBut when it comes to violence from the left, there are still some who\u2026talk about a protest culture in Germany.\u201dLast year, Berlin experienced its worst rioting in five years when radicals and squatters opposing evictions clashed with police.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 11:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-seeks-help-finding-g-20-rioters-1499780894", "news_title": "Germany Seeks Help Finding G-20 Rioters ", "keywords": "g-20,group of 20,protests,riots,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "ATHENS\u2014Greece\u2019s central-bank governor said the country has no need to return to bond markets this year, and called on the government to focus instead on privatizations as a way to win investors\u2019 confidence.\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit early\u201d to tap public markets,\u00a0      Yannis Stournaras       said in his first comments on the issue since Greece reached a deal with its international creditors in mid-June.\u201cI think it would be even better, for instance, if Greece proceeds with two or three emblematic privatizations in the period to come. That would be more helpful to tap markets later,\u201d he said.The comments indicate a division among top Greek officials over how to get the crisis-struck country\u00a0back on its feet. Greece\u2019s privatization program, which has repeatedly missed targets set under the country\u2019s bailout, is lately speeding up, despite Greece\u2019s left-wing government initially opposing many of the projects.Mr. Stournaras, a governor of the European Central Bank, separately argued that the ECB shouldn\u2019t take any steps yet to reduce its large monetary stimulus\u2014a prospect that has roiled financial markets since ECB President       Mario Draghi      hinted at it last month. ECB officials will gather in Frankfurt on\u00a0July 19-20\u00a0to reconsider their policy mix.Mr. Stournaras also hit out at northern European creditor countries such as Germany for risking the financial stability of the currency union by running large foreign surpluses.\u201cThey increased their surpluses at the time others tried to reduce our deficits,\u201d he said.After months of delays, Athens hashed out a deal in June with its international creditors, which outlines only some minimum debt relief for Greece after its bailout program ends next year, but put off any final decision.Some Greek officials are eager to follow up with a symbolic return to international bond markets, possibly this month. The head of the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund,       Klaus Regling,        suggested\u00a0Monday\u00a0that Greece should return to markets well before its bailout program ends.Greece\u2019s bailout program is set to expire in August next year, after which the country will either need to raise money from private investors or return to its public-sector creditors for a fresh bailout. Investors would likely demand a return of around 5% a year, far more than Athens pays public-sector creditors under its bailout deals.In the absence of debt-relief specification, the International Monetary Fund agreed to support the deal only in principle\u2014without providing fresh funds\u2014and the ECB refused to consider buying Greek debt under its giant bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. Bringing Greece under the QE umbrella, from which it has always been excluded, would greatly ease the nation\u2019s return to financial markets, analysts say.Mr. Stournaras criticized the lack of clarity over the longer-term sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt.\u00a0Without a deal on debt relief for Greece, a fresh bailout might loom, he warned.\u201cIf Greece\u2019s partners fail to clarify their position on debt, and if Greece is not able to tap markets at reasonable interest rates because of this, then I\u2019m afraid that a further bailout is inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody wishes that.\u201dThe central-bank governor robustly defended Greece\u2019s membership of the currency union, but\u00a0urged powerful exporters like Germany to carry out economic overhauls aimed at boosting imports and investment.\u201cNobody tells Germany to reduce its exports,\u201d he said.The 60-year-old economist took over as the head of the country\u2019s central bank in 2014, shortly after leaving his job as the finance minister in the ex-coalition government of conservative New Democracy and Socialists Pasok. Mr. Stournaras had to enforce a wide range of austerity cuts and economic overhauls as a finance minister, including a painful property tax, which according to many led to New Democracy\u2019s losing the elections.Since coming to power in 2015, the left-wing Syriza party and its leader,       Alexis Tsipras,        have struggled to cooperate with the central-bank chief, who has criticized Syriza\u2019s reluctance to implement the terms of Greece\u2019s international bailout.The spat escalated last year when police raided a business owned by Mr. Stournaras\u2019s wife, the morning after Mr. Stournaras had told the government he wouldn\u2019t approve its preferred candidate for chief executive of Attica Bank, a small Greek lender.The tensions have since eased. Mr. Stournaras welcomed the government\u2019s recent deal with its creditors, which he said helped to reduce uncertainty for investors and encourage depositors to place more money in Greek banks.Mr. Stournaras suggested the ECB could yet change its mind and discuss buying Greek debt this year, provided the Greek government continues to implement reforms and creditors reach a deal on debt relief.\u201cThere is plenty of time because QE won\u2019t end abruptly,\u201d he said.The future of the ECB\u2019s bond purchases, currently set to run at least through December, is perhaps the biggest question hanging over global investors. Financial markets shuddered late last month after the ECB\u2019s Mr. Draghi suggested the \u20ac60-billion-a-month program might soon be wound down.Other top ECB officials have since sought to temper Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks, arguing that the ECB should be patient.Mr. Stournaras argued that it isn\u2019t yet time to change course.\u201cI think the markets overreacted\u201d to Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments, he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t undermine the recovery by making impatient moves, and there is no need for that. Core inflation is not rising, we do not see any financial instability problems either.\u201dEurozone inflation slid to 1.3% last month, some way from the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. Mr. Draghi indicated last month that weak inflation might not deter policy makers from shifting toward higher interest rates.But Mr. Stournaras highlighted continuing economic risks, including lower commodity prices and a weaker dollar, which hurts large eurozone exporters. The euro has risen more than 2 cents against the dollar, to $1.14, since Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech last month.Still, that assessment could change, he added. \u201cWe meet every month, so\u2026\u201dWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 11:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-stournaras-says-its-too-early-for-greece-to-tap-bond-markets-1499782119", "news_title": "Greece Should Avoid Tapping Bond Market Too Early, Says Central Bank Chief ", "keywords": "greece bailout,greece bond,greece debt,Yannis Stournaras,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "For months leading up to this week\u2019s U.S. Women\u2019s Open, organizers came under criticism for their decision to host the tournament at a course owned by President Donald Trump. At the men\u2019s U.S. Open last month, a women\u2019s advocacy group flew a plane banner urging the U.S. Golf Association to \u201cdump Trump.\u201dBut the governing body isn\u2019t merely sticking with Trump\u2019s Bedminster, N.J., club as the host of this tournament\u2014a plan it made years before his run for office. In an interview, USGA executive director Mike Davis said he also wouldn\u2019t hesitate to bring future events to Trump courses.\u201cAs good as the Trump Organization is with their portfolio, I can\u2019t imagine if they invite us in the future that we wouldn\u2019t seriously look at it,\u201d Davis said.That stance reflects a revival in the aspirations of the Trump Organization as a host of major golf tournaments, which just one year ago seemed imperiled by Trump\u2019s polarizing campaign.In June 2016, the PGA Tour announced that it was moving its longtime stop at Trump\u2019s Doral, Fla., course to a Mexico City club. It cited a lack of sponsorship interest related to fears of Trump overshadowing the branding of the event. That move followed the PGA of America\u2019s 2015 decision to yank its Grand Slam of Golf from a Trump-owned course in Los Angeles, in the wake of his comments about Mexican immigrants.There were reports that Trump\u2019s Turnberry course in Scotland would be removed from the rotation of courses that hosts the British Open. But since the election, golf\u2019s organizing bodies have hardly run from their association with Trump and his 18 clubs.In February, the R&A reaffirmed Turnberry\u2019s place on the rotation of courses that host the British Open, albeit with the timing of its next turn unclear. In May, the Senior PGA Championship was held as planned at a Trump course in Potomac Falls, Va. The European Tour is also considering bringing the Scottish Open to a Trump course in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter.The upshot: Professional golf on the whole is finding that it doesn\u2019t need to distance itself from Trump, and doesn\u2019t particularly want to.Last week, Phil Mickelson signed on to redesign a course in Bali that will become Trump\u2019s 19th golf property. Several other prominent golfers have joined the president for casual rounds since the election, including       Tiger Woods,        Rory McIlroy, Ernie Els and Lexi Thompson. \u201cIf Trump asks me to play, I\u2019m going to play,\u201d Els said. \u201cIt\u2019s the respect I have for this country that has given me so much.\u201dCritics have called on female golfers to boycott the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, citing Trump\u2019s history of disparaging comments about women. But there was no such resistance from the LPGA, whose players will compete this week for $5 million in prize money, the highest purse in women\u2019s golf.\u201cWe play the courses the check writer chooses,\u201d said LPGA commissioner       Mike Whan.The check writer in this case is the USGA, and the companies that fund the organization have felt no discernible backlash. Fox pays for the broadcast rights as part of a larger deal that also covers the U.S. Open. The USGA\u2019s corporate partners\u2014            American Express,       Lexus, Rolex and Deloitte\u2014sponsor the organization as a whole, not one particular event.\u201cWe have no role in the site selection process,\u201d a Deloitte spokesman said.In the absence of resistance from participants and major financial backers, organizers can bring tournaments to whichever sites they view as most attractive.It would be a stretch to say they need Trump, as there are plenty of other courses that would come without the threat of protesters at the gates. But as a host, many golf bodies still like Trump.Ted Bishop, a former president of the PGA of America, said the sheer acreage required for the infrastructure around major tournaments eliminates many otherwise fine courses from consideration. And not all owners are eager to cater to organizers\u2019 every desire on issues ranging from course preparation to ticket sales. Trump, on the other hand, has repeatedly talked about his desire to host major championships on his courses, many of which are well-equipped to host big events.\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to find these major championship sites,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd you never know what you\u2019re going to get into with who your partner is going to be.\u201dTrump, who bought the Bedminster club in 2002, became a bigger figure in the industry during the recession and the years that followed. At a time when many financiers wanted nothing to do with golf courses, Trump spent millions buying, building and renovating them.Whether his investments prove wise remains to be seen. A Wall Street Journal analysis in April found that the value of Trump\u2019s golf properties hasn\u2019t kept pace with the amount of money he has spent to make long-term upgrades. But what matters to tournament organizers is that Trump is willing to make those investments in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s always been, \u2018What can we do to make this better? How can we help you?\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the Trumps or somebody else\u2014that plays into it.\u201dBedminster, which has become Trump\u2019s favored summer retreat from the White House, is also set to host the PGA Championship in 2022.       Eric Trump,        who oversees his father\u2019s golf business, said in a statement, \u201cWe have developed terrific relationships with all of the major golf organizations.\u201dTo be sure, the USGA\u2019s association with Trump has caused it some headaches. After a recording emerged in October 2016 of Trump bragging in lewd terms about groping women, three U.S. senators urged Davis to relocate the Women\u2019s Open. And before that, when controversy swirled around the early days of Trump\u2019s campaign, he threatened to sue the USGA if it moved the event, USA Today reported late Monday. The USGA declined to comment on the report.UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group, organized a small protest at an LPGA event in March and is planning a protest at Bedminster during Sunday\u2019s final round. Shaunna Thomas, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, said its objection is with the USGA \u201cchoosing to give millions in revenue, free advertising and branding to a self-professed serial sexual predator.\u201dBut organizers seem more emboldened than cowed by the whole experience. Whan, the LPGA commissioner, pointed to the USGA\u2019s history of creating opportunities for women in the sport. By contrast, he said of protesters, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them spend any money to lift up women\u2019s golf.\u201dWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-pro-golf-isnt-shying-away-from-trump-1499774279", "news_title": "Why Pro Golf Isn\u2019t Shying Away From Trump", "keywords": "donald trump,president donald trump,trump golf,trump golf courses,trump national,u.s. women's open,usga,Trump Organization,U.S. Golf Association,management,corporate,industrial news,women executives,golf,sports,routine general news,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "D.A.

My parents separated soon after I was born and moved to separate cities\u2014my father to Chicago, and my mother and me to Quakertown, Pa., where she was from.Later, when I was 5 and my mother was living in New York, I began shuttling between New York and Chicago. I\u2019d be put on a train with a nametag tied to my coat. For the next day and night I was on my own with a whole train at my mercy. I rarely saw much of my parents at either end. I was cared for by sitters or hurried off to boarding schools.John Paul,        my father, was a commercial photographer specializing in advertising. My mother, Lucille, was a model at             Macy\u2019s                   and wasn\u2019t really equipped to look after me. I was put into a boarding school in Ossining, N.Y.I was too young to take classes, but I liked being with older kids. I didn\u2019t see much of my mother. In-between my trips back and forth to Chicago, she remarried.When I was 9, I was sent off to live with my father in Chicago. But I saw little of him. He had remarried, so I was sent to boarding school there, too.My high school years were spent at Salisbury School in Connecticut. I was an OK student, but I had a strange talent for math. While I was at Salisbury, my mother rented a little walk-up apartment in New York on Madison Avenue. I stayed there occasionally, and she took me to Broadway shows.More often, though, I stayed with the McCullochs, who lived in New York.       Ginny McCulloch,        their daughter had come to a dance at Salisbury and we became fast friends. Her family provided me with the home and companionship I had always longed for. Ginny and I remained best friends.After graduation, I enlisted in the Navy V-12 College Training Program, which sent me to Yale as an engineering student. Halfway through my first year, the Navy transferred me to MIT, where I studied math. Then, midway through MIT, the Navy sent me to the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C., before transferring me to the Naval Air Corps. I spent the last months of World War II learning to fly airplanes in Iowa.After my discharge, I returned to Yale to finish my engineering degree. In the late 1940s, I moved into a Greenwich Village apartment with two roommates. I loved building furniture, so I started a carpentry shop.By the start of the 1950s, I was married and had a daughter. To support my family, I took a job with       Julien Bryan,        a filmmaker who shot 16mm films.       Francis Thompson       was one of his directors. Thompson was making an abstract experimental film called \u201cN.Y., NY.\u201d I offered to help him finish it, and for the next two or three years we drove around the city shooting.In 1953, when I heard there were plans to tear down the Third Avenue elevated line, I made a five-minute film about it using       Duke Ellington\u2019s       \u201cDaybreak Express\u201d for the soundtrack. But I needed Ellington\u2019s permission to use his music.I called on him at his Brill Building office in Manhattan and screened the film for him on his office wall. He loved it and asked what I needed. I said I wanted to use his recording, and he gave me the rights on the spot.My first feature-length film was in 1959, called \u201cOpening in Moscow,\u201d about an American trade show there. I went with filmmaker       Albert Maysles.       We were the first American documentarians turned loose in Russia during the Cold War.But the cameras were heavy and bulky. You couldn\u2019t really move around much by yourself. When we returned, Al and I designed a lighter, portable 16mm camera. The new design allowed me to mount it on my shoulder and work without a tripod. It was liberating. You could hold it as steady as a tripod for long periods as you moved around.I shot my       Bob Dylan       documentary \u201cDont Look Back\u201d with one. By the time I shot \u201cMonterey Pop,\u201d I had five cameras, allowing the crew to go anywhere and shoot whatever they wanted.But the cost of filmmaking was rising and recouping the expense grew difficult. Just as I was about to give up in the 1970s, Chris Hegedus appeared looking for a job. After a brief talk, I knew I had found the collaborator\u2014and wife\u2014I had long been seeking.Today, Chris and I live in a three-bedroom apartment on the 20th floor of a building on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side.The views are great. I can look north to Harlem, south to Midtown and west to New Jersey. My favorite space is our kitchen, with its north view and a long uptown stretch of four-story brownstones.When I\u2019m on the streets, I sometimes use my iPhone to shoot stills. I\u2019m amazed at how far picture-taking technology has come.I\u2019m particularly interested in cats, when they\u2019re just sitting and watching.

Here is an abridged transcript of his conversation with Journal reporters in Athens on Monday.WSJ: Greece reached an agreement with its creditors in June. What do you think about it\u2014doesn\u2019t it just kick the can down the road again?  Yannis Stournaras: No, I think it is a good agreement. It was long overdue. It will remove uncertainty regarding the payment of Greece\u2019s obligations in July so it is important as such. Of course I would have preferred to have more clarity on debt relief because the expression regarding the extension of maturities of interest payments and amortization from zero to 15 years does not say much and did not allow the [European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund] to work out a debt sustainability analysis. So I hope that soon the Eurogroup will say something more about that and preferably closer to the 15 years.WSJ: So you don\u2019t think it gave much clarity regarding Greece\u2019s debt?  YS: No it didn\u2019t. It gave a direction, we now know the Eurogroup thinks of extending maturities, interest and amortization payments. And the closer this extension is to 15 years the better. As you may know, in the             Bank of Greece                   we have done a study which shows that at a minimum we need about 8.5 years of weighted-average extension of interest payments to secure debt sustainability. But this is only a minimum, this is at the margin. So I prefer something closer to 15 years that the Eurogroup has included in the statement.WSJ: Does the agreement allow the Greek economy to breathe and to grow?  YS: It means that Greece is not going to have a liquidity problem. Arrears will be paid to the private sector. Uncertainty will be removed, which means that deposits are expected to come back, as they have actually in the last 1.5 months. And in general banks will be able to make more repos in the open market as they are already doing. We already see the first seeds of liquidity improvement.WSJ: Does it give Greece the ability to tap markets soon?  YS: It remains to be seen. I think it\u2019s a bit early. There are steps in the right direction but it is only the beginning. I think it would be even better for instance if Greece proceeds with two or three emblematic privatizations in the period to come. That would be more helpful to tap markets later.WSJ: Is there something Greece can do for the ECB to consider quantitative easing, or does it totally depend on the creditors?  YS: I think Greece can be more proactive on privatization, on structural reforms, on the liberalization of certain professions, on the independence of institutions, the improvement of the quality of governance. All these would help. The creditors should do the rest, mainly providing more clarity on debt relief.WSJ: Do you think another Greek bailout is a possibility?  YS: We work on the assumption that after the program ends, Greece will tap markets, so we will not need a further bailout. What matters is to be able to tap markets after the end of the program in a sustainable way. It is immensely important for Greece\u2019s partners to clarify their position on debt so that this goal [tapping markets after the end of the program] is achievable.WSJ: In your last report you mentioned the possibility of another bailout. Why?  YS: What I mentioned in the report is that if Greece\u2019s partners fail to clarify their position on debt, and if Greece is not able to tap markets at reasonable interest rates because of this, then I\u2019m afraid that a further bailout is inevitable. But nobody wishes that: neither Greece\u2019s partners nor Greece itself.WSJ: Is there a lot of work to do before Greece could return to markets, in terms of hiring staff or reaching out to investors?  YS: There\u2019s a lot of investor interest after the agreement, but I think Greece needs to do something more, especially on planning ahead as well as on privatization. Greece needs to convince markets that it means business. I would prefer to tap markets even before the end of the year if we make two or three emblematic privatizations before.WSJ: How much confidence do you have in the state of the Greek economy and the banks.  YS: I\u2019m more confident now after the agreement. For this year we expect a positive growth rate of 1.6%; and 2.4% next year. As you know we still have a large output gap, unemployment is still exceeding 20% so there\u2019s a lot of scope for a rapid recovery exceeding 2% for a number of years. I think Greece has an opportunity for catching up, which means to grow more than its partners.WSJ: The IMF says Greek banks need additional capital of around \u20ac10 billion. Do you share this view?  YS: Banks now have core Tier 1 capital of close to 17% one of the highest in Europe. They also have high provisions. The challenge for banks is to achieve their [nonperforming loan] targets. Actually they stand or fall on achieving this target. If they do achieve these targets then the tier 1 ratio at the end of the period will go up by almost 2 percentage points. So in that case they will not need any more capital.WSJ: Will the banks achieve their NPL targets?  YS: I\u2019m quite confident. I can tell you that a small non-systemic bank,             Attica Bank,       had an agreement in the previous few days with an investor and if this agreement is finalized by end of month then at a stroke it will be able to cut its NPL ratio from 46% to 23%. So it\u2019s a huge reduction. Which is perhaps something the bigger banks, the systemic banks, should look at carefully. That is, bold moves to reduce NPLs going beyond the targets.WSJ: Was it a big discount? Twenty cents on the euro?  YS: Yes but it was only the denounced loans. That is, the worst of all nonperforming loans.WSJ: Do you think Greece will be included in the ECB\u2019s QE program?  YS: Provided the Greek government continues on the right path and its partners in the Eurogroup take a specific position on the extension of maturities, interest payments and amortization, yes I think the executive board of the ECB will bring the issue for discussion in the governing council. I hope this year. I think Greece deserves it after all. There is plenty of time because QE will not end abruptly.WSJ: In which industries could Greece be competitive in future?  YS: Greece has strong comparative advantages, starting with the agricultural sector but even more in manufacturing, services, tourism, shipping, health, IT. Despite the brain drain due to the crisis, the quality of the scientific personnel in Greece is much higher than the technological component of our exports. That means we have a lot of upside. But we need better cooperation between the private sector and universities and research institutes. The government should modernize the framework governing this relationship.For instance, health: medical tourism. Instead of exporting very good doctors, there could be patients with chronic diseases who could come to Greece, where we have excess capacity in hospitals, many doctors of very high quality. People from Asia, the Middle East, European countries, the U.S. They could combine high-quality treatment with holidays.WSJ: Do you think the euro has been good for Greece?  YS: The Eurozone is part of our identity, I cannot imagine Greece outside the euro. It would be a disaster. All those in Greece and abroad who thought that Greece would find a solution outside the euro made a huge mistake. They contributed to a delay of recovery and of exiting from our problems.WSJ: Financial markets reacted strongly to ECB President       Mario Draghi\u2019s       speech in Sintra. How did you understand his remarks?YS: I think the markets overreacted. Mario Draghi didn\u2019t say something which would have led normally to such a reaction. In my opinion, it\u2019s true we have stronger growth now for many quarters, but this growth is not robust yet. It\u2019s mostly consumption-led, it\u2019s not so much investment-based. Second, core inflation remains still very low. So I think we should be patient. It\u2019s not the time yet to change our policies.WSJ: Investors understood Draghi to be arguing that inflation is going to stay low but the ECB is going to go ahead and taper anyway.  YS: Our number one priority in the ECB is inflation, this is our mandate. Growth is important, but if we grow with inflation well below our target, we cannot change our monetary policy. The other reason we shouldn\u2019t change it now is that we don\u2019t see any serious threats to financial stability.WSJ: Investors expect the ECB to announce tapering in September or October, and to start to reduce its bond purchases early next year. Is that a reasonable timeline?  YS: We have to be very patient. We have to review the evidence. I do not belong to those who want to trigger a change without conclusive evidence. As the ECB came late to QE, I think it shouldn\u2019t move in a way that would risk undermining recovery. And I\u2019m glad the executive board and my colleagues are taking this position up to now, and especially Mario Draghi. I fully agree with him on the issue.WSJ: Is there a lot of consensus on the governing council about the exit?  YS: There is a huge consensus. We are not dogmatic, we do not use a specific rule, we examine all evidence, all markets: labor market, product markets, output trends, inflation, financial markets, external effects. The atmosphere is very positive. We are pleased that our policy has contributed to the recovery and to the increase in inflation. But this is also one of the reasons that we should not rush to move, because we don\u2019t know whether the recovery will continue if we stop this unconventional monetary policy now. So we have to be convinced that the recovery is sustainable. And there isn\u2019t enough evidence on that yet.WSJ: How long will it take to have enough evidence. Another year?  YS: We are flexible and pragmatic. Each time there is a monetary policy meeting, we review the evidence. In my view, this time, in July, is not the time to review our stance. There is still evidence that the recovery is not robust enough. Commodity prices are still down, which is a leading indicator of world recovery. There are also geopolitical risks. There are many external uncertainties. There is a weakness of the dollar which, to a certain extent, implies monetary tightening in the eurozone. Investment in the eurozone is not robust yet. I take into account all these factors, and I\u2019m sure my colleagues in the governing council do too.WSJ: Might the ECB make a small move in July, such as removing the easing bias on QE?  YS: It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t discussed yet. I\u2019ll tell you my own position\u2014looking at today\u2019s evidence, there isn\u2019t something on the table that convinces me that we should change our stance.WSJ: Investors think the ECB can\u2019t continue QE for much longer given the constraints on the program.  YS: We have not yet discussed the parameters of QE. There are ways to overcome these constraints if needed by changing the parameters of the program. Of course there are certain sensitive parameters that cannot easily change. But there are many other parameters too that may change if needed. To a certain extent the reason that we continue this expansionary, unconventional monetary policy is that other policies, such as fiscal policy, still have some unused space. For instance, there are member-states with a large current account surplus for a number of years. This is a problem. Germany for instance could invest more. This is good for Germany too, not only for the eurozone. There are many technical problems though because Germany is near to closing the output gap. It should look at its wage policy, at its investment policy. It should perhaps look at its investments abroad, real investment in the European south, or increasing the capital of the European Investment Bank. There are many options to deal with this problem, in a mutually advantageous way.WSJ: Would it involve fiscal transfers from Germany?  YS: No, I\u2019m talking about real investment. Investment from member-states where the return on capital is low to member-states where it is much higher. And the risks now are much smaller. Now there are queues of investors looking at the prospects for Greece.WSJ: How much of a risk would it be for Greece and other southern European countries if interest rates started to rise?  YS: Our monetary policy has nothing to do with fiscal policy, but we look at markets of course. We look at excessive market reaction, which we must take into account. This is part of the evidence which we are reviewing.WSJ: Can the ECB avoid a taper tantrum in Europe?  YS: There is always the right timing and the right pace [of exit]. We shouldn\u2019t undermine the recovery by making impatient moves, and there is no need for that. Core inflation is not rising, we do not see any financial stability problems either.WSJ: Isn\u2019t that an argument to keep QE running for another few years?  YS: Our forward guidance is clear. We have to see especially core inflation rising closer to our target. The labor market has changed a lot and the reason inflation is low perhaps has to do with the labor market, perhaps it has to do with outsourcing, with new technologies. This is an example of the evidence we are reviewing, why this is happening. Why we have growth without inflation. This presents certain dilemmas for the central bank.WSJ: That would suggest the ECB could overlook a slight weakness in core inflation and still taper?  YS: I\u2019d like to be very careful here. My position is that we shouldn\u2019t risk any abrupt moves at this moment. There\u2019s no need to at this specific moment.WSJ: But this could change by September, say?  YS: Yes, this could change. If I could repeat, pragmatism and flexibility. We meet every month, so\u2026WSJ: Some investors have suggested the ECB could reverse its forward guidance and start raising interest rates before ending QE.  YS: We don\u2019t see a need to.WSJ: The ECB\u2019s communication says it won\u2019t raise rates until well past the end of net asset purchases. How long is well past\u2014are we talking six months, or 12 months?  YS: This needs judgment, I cannot tell you now, it depends on circumstances. We are not dogmatic. If needed to move, we will move.WSJ: So it could be a relatively short period?  YS: Yes it could.WSJ: Has the ECB already started exiting its stimulus, by reducing its purchases from \u20ac80 billion [$91 billion] a month to \u20ac60 billion?  YS: I think this movement took into account the improvement we had in the economy. That\u2019s an example of pragmatism. Also the slight change in our forward guidance reflects our understanding of the better situation in the real economy.WSJ: In terms of the side-effects of QE, do you see any dangers in continuing the program?  YS: I think that, if you take the whole package, it was positive for companies, it was positive for the economy, it was positive for banks even. Many people who object should ask themselves what would have happened if we hadn\u2019t followed this QE policy. Where would inflation be now, and real growth? Of course there are limits too, which we do not overlook.WSJ: Some members of the ECB\u2019s governing council have argued against certain aspects of the package. Has everyone now agreed that the policies have worked?  YS: Yes. We have a very strong consensus.WSJ: How do you think the Italian government handled the recent resolution of two Italian banks\u2014what message does it send?  YS: Taking into account that the banking union in Europe is still incomplete because it lacks a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme, what happened was rather a good result.WSJ: There seemed to be a huge amount of public money involved.  YS: I\u2019m not sure the alternative would be less costly. For instance the alternative could be paying depositors with public money. At least now we know these are the limits of the costs for saving people\u2019s deposits and senior bondholders. I think that, overall, the European institutions and Italian authorities acted responsibly.WSJ: The eurozone seems to be a global bright spot now. Have political risks now disappeared?  YS: It\u2019s true. Despite the uncertainties we had at the start of the year, we have a good result. The anti-European spirit was defeated, which is extremely important. Of course we had the most negative result, which was Brexit. But in the eurozone, I think the political developments are benign and they give hope that after the German elections there would be a serious discussion about mending certain flaws in the architecture of the eurozone and making it stronger. We need that.WSJ: Do you think French President Macron will be able to negotiate a common finance ministry or budget for the eurozone?  YS: Yes I think that President Macron brings something fresh to the eurozone. I agree with most of his ideas and I\u2019m sure that Germany will respond positively. I\u2019ve discussed it with many German politicians of the two major parties, and they find President Macron\u2019s ideas very interesting, that they can discuss with him after the elections.WSJ: What still needs to be done in the eurozone?  YS: We need more symmetry in the adjustment. Not only deficit countries should adjust, if needed, but also surplus countries should adjust too. And we need more risk-sharing and more common decisions. We need to share risks and responsibilities as well. We need more, not less, integration.WSJ: How do you get surplus countries like Germany to adjust?  YS: Germany can invest more, for instance. The government in infrastructure and the private sector too. Nobody tells Germany to reduce its exports. But large current account surpluses entail certain risks for financial stability. Actually the EU\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances procedures have been violated. This is not only in Germany, it includes other member-states as well. Also, the reason that in the European south it took so long for the internal devaluation to succeed and cut deficits is because the surplus member-states did not reduce their surpluses. Actually they increased their surpluses at the time others tried to reduce their deficits. Hence, more recession resulted in member-states such as Greece, in order to achieve the given primary surplus in the budget.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 10:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/q-a-with-greek-central-bank-chief-yannis-stournaras-1499783697", "news_title": "Q&A With Greek Central Bank Chief Yannis Stournaras ", "keywords": " greece bailout, greek bailout, greek central bank,greek debt, greek economy,Bank of Greece,TELL.AT,European Central Bank,Yannis Stournaras,monetary policy,central bank intervention,government finance,government borrowing,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,interviews,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Merrill Lynch has lost to the independent ranks a broker who managed $1 billion, as Wall Street\u2019s biggest brokerages continue to struggle with keeping top talent.The broker,       Matthew Celenza,        said he resigned from Merrill on Friday to launch his own wealth-management firm, known as Boulevard Family Wealth, in Beverly Hills, Calif. Mr. Celenza had been with Merrill for six years and was a part of its private banking and investment group, the team of brokers who focus on clients with $10 million or more in assets.Mr. Celenza launched his firm with the help of Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York-based shop that provides independent-adviser teams with trading, clearing, research and other support services. Boulevard Family Wealth is the 10th firm launched by Dynasty so far this year, and its 45th since its founding in 2009.He says his move solved his biggest competitive problem: Navigating tight strictures within Merrill Lynch on what brokers can and can\u2019t do.\u201cWithout a wirehouse regulating every move you make, going independent gives us better positioning in the business,\u201d Mr. Celenza said in an interview, referring to the traditional name given to Wall Street brokerages.Specifically, Mr. Celenza said the wirehouses limit brokers from using certain services or products offered by rivals even if they would yield a better outcome for clients, such as getting a lower interest rate on a loan. Boulevard Family Wealth won\u2019t be subject to those restrictions as a standalone firm, he said.\u201cThe wirehouses just seem to be a bit cumbersome when it came to more esoteric insurance strategies and family wealth transfers,\u201d Mr. Celenza said.A Merrill spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Celenza\u2019s departure but declined to comment further.Mr. Celenza is leaving Merrill as the             Bank of America Corp.      -owned brokerage weathers broader wealth-management shifts. The firm is in the midst of complying with the Labor Department\u2019s recently instituted fiduciary rule requiring brokers to act in the best interest of retirement savers, while taking a step back from the costly practice of recruiting rival brokers. ((https://www.wsj.com/articles/merrill-lynch-to-halt-broker-recruiting-1494612667))Besides that, Merrill and other brokerages have been losing brokers who prefer to manage their own investment firms. By 2020, researcher Cerulli Associates estimates, traditional brokerages will advise on less than 48% of the market\u2019s assets, while independent advisers will oversee more than 52%. In 2010, traditional brokerages commanded a 63% asset market share, while independent advisers oversaw 37%. Much of that shift comes from brokers who defect from firms like Merrill to launch their own practices.Merrill has lost several teams of brokers in recent months, including more than half a dozen brokers managing more than $900 million who have gone to             Raymond James Financial Inc.       and a $900 million team that left for UBS Group AG. One of Merrill\u2019s biggest departures took place in January, when a group of brokers who oversaw $1.3 billion left for First Republic Securities.Just before Merrill\u2019s moratorium on recruiting, it announced several new hires from rivals like UBS Group, J.P.

My collection of U2 memorabilia runs from the very first-ever released recording, a three-song record from 1979 called \u201cThree\u201d (only 1,000 were pressed) to original Joshua Tree bedsheets (so rare, many die-hard fans do not know they even exist).At the same time, I have been a lifelong car guy. I have two Ford Model As (a 1931 and a 1928) in my garage.The Trabant was like a pot of gold, because it gave me a chance to combine my two passions.Around 1990, U2 was recording the album \u201cAchtung Baby\u201d in Berlin. At the time, the Trabant was an East German car that had become a symbol of the failures of communism. Millions were built in East Germany. They were utilitarian vehicles with no frills and lawn mower-like two-stroke engines. When Germany reunified, there were dead Trabants all over the streets. A famous mural had been painted on the Berlin Wall of a Trabant crashing through.When U2 went on the Zoo TV tour in 1992, they used Trabants\u2014stripped of their drivetrains and painted by artists\u2014in their traveling stage set. Today, three of these Trabants hang in the atrium of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.One U2 Trabant ended up in the hands of a New Jersey woman. I got in touch with her, and in 2011, she reached out to say she was looking for a new home for her Trabant. She would give it to me free on one condition: I was to come to New Jersey, look her in the eye, and promise I would take care of it.I borrowed a trailer, drove to Baltimore for a U2 show, then up to New Jersey to pick up the Trabant. It was painted by the Irish artist       Catherine Owens,        who collaborated a lot with U2 over the years. There is only one direct reference on the car to the band, words on the back bumper\u2014\u201cone but not the same\u201d\u2014a reference to the song \u201cOne.\u201dTo me, the Trabant is an important piece of artwork and rock history.

CMHC said May\u2019s figures were revised slightly upward, and now show seasonally adjusted housing starts of 194,955 for the month.The June figures represent a strong rebound in housing activity, mostly centered across Ontario, the country\u2019s most populous province, according to CMHC data. While overall figures in Toronto are relatively little changed from the previous month, construction of ground-oriented homes, which includes single-detached, semis and townhomes, has hit a five-year high, CMHC said.\u201cThe trend in housing starts for Canada reached its highest level in almost five years,\u201d said Bob Dugan, CMHC\u2019s chief economist, in a statement. \u201cSo far this year, all regions are on pace to surpass construction levels from 2016 except for British Columbia.\u201dPolicy makers have moved in recent months to help cool Canada\u2019s frothy housing market, notably in Toronto and Vancouver, two of the country\u2019s biggest cities. Home sales in Toronto, for example, have dropped 37.3% in June, the second-straight month of double-digit declines, after Ontario lawmakers introduced more than a dozen new measures in April to help contain the market. Home prices in Toronto, however, have yet to decline, according to recent data from the city\u2019s real-estate board.Further cooling may arrive in the coming months following the Bank of Canada\u2019s monetary-policy announcement on Wednesday. Economists widely expect the central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in seven years.CIBC World Markets economist Nick Exarhos said strength in residential homes investment firmed Canadian housing starts in the first quarter, and early indications suggest home-building will continue to be a solid growth contributor for the rest of the year.\u201cStill, a softening in permit activity, and a smaller backlog of unused permits, signal that there won\u2019t be much upside for starts from here,\u201d he said.CMHC\u2019s June report said urban housing starts rose 9.6% to 194,773 units.

Sunac will use the borrowed funds to pay Wanda to gain ownership of its theme-park business, according to the documents filed by Sunac on Tuesday.Neither Dalian Wanda nor Sunac disclosed the arrangement when Wanda announced the blockbuster deal on Monday. Both companies declined to provide further details beyond the public filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sunac\u2019s shares rose 14% Tuesday.In selling off its prized hotel and theme-park assets, Wanda is paring a heavy debt load that has attracted the scrutiny of China\u2019s banking regulator, which last month asked lenders to review loans to overseas deal makers including Wanda.Sunac will assume all the loans associated with the theme parks on its balance sheet, both companies have stated. Neither has specified the level of leverage involved.The financing arrangement with Sunac allows Wanda to pay for its own sale without incurring debt, according to Cheong Yin Chin, an analyst for independent financial research firm CreditSights Inc.Wanda would record the $4.35 billion bank loan as an asset rather than debt if it acts as a lender to Sunac, Ms. Cheong said. Sunac would record Wanda\u2019s loan as debt on its books.\u201cSunac will be the one assuming the entire debt,\u201d Ms. Cheong said. \u201cAlthough the [property] assets and debt ultimately appear on Sunac\u2019s books, Wanda can still have the brand name, and all the expenses come from Sunac itself\u2026that is the advantage for Wanda.\u201dFor Sunac, the deal set off an alarm: S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday placed the company\u2019s corporate credit rating on CreditWatch negative.The credit-ratings firm said the acquisition of Wanda\u2019s assets and a large investment in technology company LeEco \u201cwill further pressure the developer\u2019s already high financial leverage and increase the burden on future cash flow.\u201dWanda, controlled by billionaire       Wang Jianlin,        started as a property developer but moved into entertainment to diversify and expand its holdings. It owns the world\u2019s largest cinema chain,             AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,       as well as Legendary Entertainment, a Hollywood film producer and financier.In the deal with Sunac, Wanda will sell four theme parks and at least nine others that are planned. The existing parks recorded a net profit of $562 million last year, up 28% from the previous year, regulatory filings show. The net value of the theme-park assets was $3.65 billion, according to the filings. The amount of debt held by those attractions wasn\u2019t disclosed.Wanda is a private company and not much is known about its overall debt. However, its property unit, which accounted for 55% of its revenue in the first half of 2017, was saddled with about $33 billion in debt as of 2016, according to Wanda\u2019s regulatory filings. Those regulatory filings also reveal that Wanda\u2019s consolidated liabilities, which include debt, totaled more than $100 billion at the end of last year.Wanda\u2019s chairman, Mr. Wang, said the company will use proceeds from the sale to trim debt at the property unit, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co., which is seeking a listing on a Chinese stock exchange but has yet to receive approval.Write to Dominique Fong at Dominique.Fong@wsj.com and Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 09:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wanda-to-lend-borrowed-billions-to-sunac-to-close-deal-1499773733", "news_title": "Wanda to Lend Borrowed Billions to Sunac to Close Deal ", "keywords": " china,dalian wanda, hotels, sunac, theme parks, wanda,Dalian Wanda Group,Sunac China Holdings,1918.HK,HK:1918,Wang Jianlin,Yin Cheong Chin,corporate funding,financing agreements,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,diversified holding companies,real estate transactions,property managers,business,consumer services,real estate,construction,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Rising home prices have turned the great home-equity-line reset into a small setback rather than a disaster for the banking industry.Banks let home-equity lines of credit, or Helocs, flow freely in the run-up to the financial crisis, often to borrowers with bad credit or living in overvalued homes. Typically, the borrowers were allowed to pay back only the interest for 10 years. In recent years, banks worried those borrowers wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up when the lines reset, which can raise monthly payments by hundreds of dollars.Now, more than halfway through the problem resets, banks are more optimistic. Borrowers with Helocs taken out in early 2007 are falling behind at lower rates than the Helocs that reset over the past three years, according to data provided to The Wall Street Journal by credit-reporting firm             Equifax.About 3.8% of borrowers who signed up for Helocs in early 2007 were a month or more late on their payments four months after the lines reset, according to Equifax. That delinquency rate had been above 4% for each of the past three\u00a0years, moving as high as 4.43% for loans made in 2004.What\u2019s changed: The economy and jobs picture have improved and the housing market has recovered enough in recent years to give borrowers more flexibility. Specifically, it has become less common for mortgage borrowers to owe more than their house is worth, a condition known as being \u201cunderwater\u201d that makes it harder for Heloc borrowers to handle a reset.In the first quarter, 9.7% of U.S. properties with a mortgage were seriously underwater, according to research firm Attom Data Solutions. In early 2014, that proportion was 17.5%. The firm defines seriously underwater as loans where the borrower owes at least 25% more than what the home is worth.Also, big lenders including             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. and             Wells Fargo                   & Co. say they have reached out to customers whose Helocs were about to reset, offering options the borrowers can afford. That can include taking out another loan to pay off the Heloc before it resets or applying for a new Heloc to keep the interest-only payments, both of which can allow a bank to mark a Heloc as \u201cpositively\u201d closed.Equifax estimates that nearly 16% of the 2007 Helocs had been positively closed in recent months by the time they were about to reset. Four months after the reset,\u00a0more than 24% had been positively closed.\u201cIt\u2019s really just sitting down with customers and assessing their needs and offering them good options,\u201d said       Pete Boomer,        head of mortgage production at             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.,       which set up a task force for customers with resetting Helocs.The overall economy has helped, too. Since problem Helocs began resetting around early 2014, housing prices have risen, making it easier for banks to refinance customers into new loans. U.S. home prices, after dropping throughout the 2008 crisis and its aftermath, have risen nearly 35% since the start of 2014. The median sales price of an existing home was $252,800 in May 2017, according to the National Association of Realtors, up from $187,900 in January 2014.Unemployment has also fallen, making banks more comfortable with extending credit. \u201cAt the end of the day, lenders do want to have Helocs on their books,\u201d said       Guy Cecala,       \u00a0publisher of the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. \u201cThey like the income on them\u2014they just want to make sure they\u2019re all in order.\u201dHelocs from late 2007 and 2008 are the only problem lines that still need to reset. By then, cracks were already starting to show in the housing market, and banks were getting stingier with making Helocs.

They transcribed the interviews and examined the questioners\u2019 language, finding that two-thirds of the questions asked of male entrepreneurs focused on the company\u2019s potential for success.The 23 female founders had the opposite experience. Two-thirds of their questions sought answers about preventing failure, including \u2018What are the opportunities for leakage?\u2019\u2014an industry term for lost customers.The analysis also suggests that female investors were just as likely as their male counterparts to ask the woman-led teams prevention-focused questions, contradicting the attitude among some firms that hiring more female VCs alone improves the odds that female founders get funded.The questioning patterns appeared to be linked to how much money the startups fetched. Entrepreneurs who were asked promotion-focused questions were more likely to win one of the top four prizes in the startup competition. Male-led teams raised an average of $17.1 million each, over five times the $3.3 million earned by the female-led companies.The paper, titled \u201cWe Ask Men to Win & Women Not to Lose: Closing the Gender Gap in Startup Funding,\u201d offers a window into gender stereotypes of what an entrepreneur is supposed to look like, Ms. Kanze said. \u201cWomen seem to be violating that norm, and are inadvertently penalized for that by venture capitalists.\u201d\u2014Kelsey GeeWrite to Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/questions-posed-in-startup-funding-suggest-gender-bias-1499778000", "news_title": "Are Female Founders Prone to Failure?

Most agree the flight path indicates the missile would be able to reach Alaska and possibly further in a conflict.More specific details are largely dependent on images released by North Korea and guesswork. The tip of the missile, where the warhead, or re-entry vehicle, would be located, has drawn attention from experts because it appears to consist of a simple hollow fairing.The fairing looks too small to fit the re-entry vehicle that North Korea has shown on other missiles,       John Schilling,        an aerospace engineer, wrote in an analysis of the Hwasong-14 published Monday on the North Korea-focused website 38North.Yi Wan-young,        a South Korean lawmaker who attended a briefing by the National Intelligence Service, said in televised comments that the spy agency assessed that North Korea hasn\u2019t developed re-entry technology for the Hwasong-14.The agency reached the assessment because it wasn\u2019t able to confirm a successful re-entry of the missile, and because North Korea doesn\u2019t have testing facilities for re-entry vehicles, Mr. Yi said.South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service declined to commentDeveloping a ballistic missile that can carry a nuclear weapon in a warhead at its tip and successfully detonating the device at a predetermined target is one of the biggest challenges in missile science. When it re-enters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on its descent, the warhead is exposed to temperatures of thousands of degrees and extreme vibration.Following the Hwasong-14 launch, North Korea said through its state media that the test verified all the technical features of the missile \u201cincluding the heat-resisting features and structural safety of the warhead tip of (the) ICBM made of (a) newly developed domestic carbon compound material.\u201dSouth Korean authorities tend to be more skeptical of North Korea\u2019s weapons progress than their U.S. counterparts. American officials have stated that the latest North Korean missile appeared to have intercontinental range but haven\u2019t commented publicly on whether it has a viable warhead.Mr. Schilling, the analyst, said the missile will likely need a year or two of testing before it can reliably deliver a nuclear warhead to targets along the U.S. west coast.The new capabilities displayed in last week\u2019s test brought new urgency to Washington\u2019s efforts to halt North Korea\u2019s weapons programs.Separately on Tuesday, China pushed back on attempts by Washington and others to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Corporate bonds are sitting right on it.Global government bonds have been shaken as central banks, most notably the European Central Bank, have signaled that the clock is ticking on ultra-loose monetary policy. Ten-year German bond yields have risen about 0.3 percentage point from their late-June lows, pushing up U.S. Treasury yields too.Yet corporate bonds haven\u2019t even blinked. Indeed, the yield spread on European and U.S. investment-grade bonds versus underlying government debt has actually compressed since the turmoil started,             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch indexes show. Yields have risen, just not by as much as on government bonds. At 0.99 percentage point in Europe and 1.12 points in the U.S., investment-grade spreads are close to their tightest level since the global financial crisis.There are some reasons for resilience. The search for yield\u2014or to be more accurate, the search for higher-yielding paper, or spread\u2014is still in effect. And even though the focus is on whether the ECB will wind down its bond purchases, the corporate-bond market is still receiving significant support. In the three months since the ECB cut its overall monthly bond purchases to \u20ac60 billion ($68.3 billion) from \u20ac80 billion, corporate-bond buying has only slowed to an average of \u20ac7.1 billion a month from \u20ac7.6 billion, BlueBay Asset Management notes.But there is also cause for concern. Supply has been heavy as companies have looked to lock in low interest rates, transferring risk to bondholders: in the U.S. investment-grade issuance in the first half was $714 billion, in line with 2016 when full-year issuance set a record, according to trade body Sifma. In Europe, first-half supply of \u20ac183 billion was up 10% from 2016, according to             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.       A further rise could easily turn returns negative in Europe, denting investor appetite; the market is now up just 0.7% for 2017.And credit conditions may be shifting. Activist investors are making waves in Europe: perhaps the best example is       Dan Loeb       at hedge fund Third Point targeting consumer giant             Nestl\u00e9,       pitting shareholder interests against those of bondholders. The company promised to double its leverage ratio to fund stock buybacks, yet spreads on its bonds barely reacted. Better earnings prospects should support corporate bonds; but the real benefit will accrue to shareholders, not bondholders. Spreads do offer some protection against falling bond prices, but little against a deterioration in credit quality.Corporate bonds have benefited greatly from central-bank support and benign credit conditions. Shifting tides mean relying on those factors persisting looks risky.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 08:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-bond-markets-asleep-at-the-wheel-1499775164", "news_title": "Corporate Bond Markets Asleep at the Wheel", "keywords": "bond buying,corporate bonds,european central bank,government bonds,qe,quantitative easing,sovereign debt,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,high-yield corporate bonds,monetary policy,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Career websites such as Glassdoor have become regular reading for job seekers. Now chief executives are increasingly perusing their online reviews to find out what employees think of them\u2014to evaluate policies and even to talk back.A growing number of sites such as Indeed.com, Vault.com, Kununu and Fairygodboss let people post anonymous appraisals of their employers. A poster can comment on everything from pay and benefits to workplace likes and dislikes. Glassdoor is one of the most extensive sources of online employee feedback, displaying reviews of more than 700,000 companies and whether reviewers approve or disapprove of their CEOs.The public-yet-personal critiques are prompting more company bosses to track and respond to reviews. In the process, they have come to treat them as a necessary evil or a useful management tool, and a performance measure akin to using stock prices to gauge investor confidence.In the past three years,       Spencer Rascoff,        CEO of real-estate website             Zillow Group Inc.,        Z -1.91%       has responded to some 70 reviews on Glassdoor and has a 95% CEO approval score on the site. His company was co-founded by       Rich Barton,        the same entrepreneur who also helped start Glassdoor.Like Mr. Rascoff, some of the most active CEOs on Glassdoor enjoy high ratings.\u201cGetting caught up on recent @Glassdoor employee reviews of @zillow,\u201d he tweeted last fall, adding afterward: \u201cReviews were almost all good lately. But a few things we need to work on.\u201dSome CEOs use responses simply to show they are listening. When, for instance, a worker at Nagarro, a division of Germany-based information-technology company Allgeier SE, complained about undermining colleagues, Nagarro CEO Manas Fuloria replied: \u201cYour experience is your reality and we must fix it. Do reach out.\u201dDaniel Chait,        head of recruiting-technology firm Greenhouse Software Inc. gets an email alert every time someone posts a Glassdoor review of his company and has responded to nearly all 74 of them over the past few years. \u201cWhere people get into trouble is if they ignore it, or they try to use it as a way to win the argument\u201d with a negative reviewer, says Mr. Chait, who has a 95% approval rating.For some business leaders, that isn\u2019t always easy.\u201cGosh, I am sorry we have made our cafeteria so good and so inexpensive that people would rather stay here than go out. How evil of us,\u201d wrote             Overstock.com Inc.\u2019s       CEO,       Patrick Byrne,        in response to a reviewer this spring who complained that the online retailer\u2019s cafeteria encouraged people not to leave work.Meghan Tuohig,        vice president of people care at Overstock, says Mr. Byrne\u2014who has a 58% approval rating on Glassdoor\u2014is one of a number of people at the company who receives an alert when someone posts a Glassdoor review about working there. The company responds to both positive and negative reviews, particularly when they are about specifics that \u201cwe can straighten out or investigate further,\u201d she says.Increasingly, outsiders are listening too. Zillow\u2019s Mr. Rascoff and leaders at other companies say they also look at Glassdoor ratings of acquisition candidates. A leaked Salesforce presentation of potential targets last year included each company\u2019s overall and CEO rating on Glassdoor.\u201cWe have walked away from dozens of acquisitions that looked good on paper and made strategic sense\u201d because of poor reviews, says Mr. Rascoff. \u201cIt really lets you look under the hood,\u201d he says.Some companies have been accused of being too involved in their Glassdoor feedback. After a string of scathing reviews for underwear startup Thinx LLC and its then-CEO and founder       Miki Agrawal       last winter, an anonymous employee alleged in a Glassdoor post that Ms. Agrawal ordered some employees to write positive reviews. Ms. Agrawal, who has since stepped down as Thinx CEO, denies she requested flattering feedback and only asked some employees \u201cshare their authentic experiences.\u201dShe likens the Glassdoor process to restaurant reviews on             Yelp,       arguing that people with good experiences rarely post a review. \u201cBut when they have a bad experience they are the loudest,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cSo sometimes reminding customers who love their favorite restaurant to share their authentic experiences is perfectly ok to do.\u201dGlassdoor declined to comment on the Thinx allegations. But it says all company reviews undergo a series of checks before appearing online to guard against abuse and to verify they are, indeed, from a current or former employee. A handful of times, the website has received emails from workers saying their employers coerced or incentivized them to write positive reviews, says Glassdoor spokesman       Scott Dobroski.       If an investigation finds that is the case, he says, the review is removed.Employers can\u2019t alter or remove bad reviews, though in some cases Glassdoor says it will disallow or remove reviews if they reveal confidential business information or otherwise violate its guidelines.Like a number of employers, Mr. Chait says Greenhouse invites employees to write reviews, while making clear it is optional. Occasionally the critiques have led to changes, such as when some reviewers complained a take-home test that Greenhouse gave job seekers was too arduous. This year, he says, the firm tweaked how it presented the test, stressing that candidates shouldn\u2019t spend more than a few hours on it.\u201cI need that negative feedback,\u201d Mr. Chait says of some reviews. \u201cAs a CEO, my life is full of people saying nice things to me.\u201dWrite to Vanessa Fuhrmans at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'CEOs Head to Web for Critiques.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-reading-employees-online-reviews-their-ceos-1499774400", "news_title": "Who\u2019s Reading Employees\u2019 Online Reviews?

It\u2019s a nice little neighborhood supermarket\u2014newly renovated and well organized. There\u2019s even a strange mannequin named Gregory greeting shoppers at the door, and a stuffed orangutan overseeing the bananas.But the prices! My grocery bills suddenly were 20% higher than I\u2019d been paying at the Key Food I\u2019d left behind in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.Still, it beats the nearby Gristedes three blocks north on Henry Street. The prices there\u2014$4 for a quart of half-and-half, $3.50 for an avocado\u2014are what you\u2019d expect to find on a remote island inhabited by zillionaires. And the store is a scruffy maze.Being a lazy daisy who prefers to shop local, I started walking, with great reluctance, the extra half-mile to Trader Joe\u2019s. It\u2019s worth it. My typical grocery haul, which costs $59.16 at Gristedes and $48.40 at the Key Food, runs just $35.12 at the national chain.Surveying my neighbors, I discovered I\u2019m far from alone. One lady told me she avoids Traders Joe\u2019s only because everyone else is going: \u201cThe lines freak me out!\u201dIt\u2019s a mystery. Local markets clearly are losing business to national outfits such as             Whole Foods Market,       Trader Joe\u2019s and Target. So why don\u2019t they up their game?To my surprise,       Enrico Palazio,        who co-owns the Montague Street Key Food with his uncle, says he doesn\u2019t view Trader Joe\u2019s as competition. It doesn\u2019t have a deli, butcher or even a respectable detergent section. \u201cThis is one-stop shopping,\u201d he says of his store.The real competition, he notes, is FreshDirect. I checked, and Mr. Palazio indeed offers lower prices than the online delivery service.Still, wouldn\u2019t he like more business from cheapskates like me? I never see long lines at his store.But that\u2019s not Mr. Palazio\u2019s strategy. He spent a lot of money on last year\u2019s renovation, aiming to outdo FreshDirect by making his store a pleasant place to shop. His markups reflect that investment, he says, but his prices are still lower than FreshDirect.Because his 10,000 square-foot Key Food is too small to carry products at every price point, Mr. Palazio caters to neighborhood preferences. He doesn\u2019t sell the cheapest ice cream brand, for example, but he does stock McConnell\u2019s Fine Ice Cream.\u201cI can\u2019t believe people spend $10 on a pint,\u201d Mr. Palazio says. \u201cBut that younger generation is really asking for more of a high-end product.\u201dTo handle more customers, Mr. Palazio says, he\u2019d have to cram the store with more cashiers, baggers and stock clerks. The busy, hectic atmosphere wouldn\u2019t appeal to his clientele, he believes.Burt Flickinger,        managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, says this strategy is typical of many local supermarkets. \u201cIt\u2019s the slow dollar versus the fast nickel,\u201d he says.In a city where few people drive, supermarkets count on the fact that the typical shopper won\u2019t schlep groceries more than a few blocks, he says.Mr. Palazio\u2019s strategy is clearly working. His sales per square foot are in the top 1% of the area\u2019s Key Food stores, he says.But what about the Gristedes, which, aside from its super sweet clerks, doesn\u2019t even seem to be trying?John Catsimatidis,        chief executive of the Red Apple Group, which owns the Gristedes chain, blames the location\u2019s high rent\u2014nearly $100,000 a month. If he renovates or lowers prices, he says, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to pay my bills next month.\u201dSome stores get caught in a vicious cycle, Mr. Flickinger says. When they hike prices without investing back into the business, traffic falls, forcing them to raise prices even higher to cover short-term expenses.Shoppers may console themselves with the idea that their zany grocery bills aren\u2019t making the billionaire Mr. Catsimatidis any richer.\u201cI\u2019m not buying any corporate jets with Gristedes profits,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I can buy a bicycle.\u201d\u2014anne.kadet@wsj.comWrite to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/neighborhood-supermarkets-chase-the-slow-dollar-1499774402", "news_title": "Neighborhood Supermarkets Chase the \u2018Slow Dollar\u2019", "keywords": "gristedes,grocery stores,key food,local ,neighborhood supermarket,retail,retail food stores,Enrico Palazio,political,general news,personal finance,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,specialty stores"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese passenger-car sales bounced back in June, raising hopes that the world\u2019s biggest auto market is gaining momentum after a tepid start to the year.Passenger-car sales\u2014which had declined in April and May, the biggest dip in two years\u2014were up 2.3% in June from a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said on Tuesday. The 1.83 million vehicles sold pushed the first-half total to 11.25 million, up 1.6% from a year earlier.After last year\u2019s exceptional 16% growth in passenger-car sales, China\u2019s auto industry had expected a slowdown in 2017. Growth is still on track for 5% this year, assuming sales accelerate as expected in the second half, said Xu Haidong, the association\u2019s assistant secretary-general.Total Chinese vehicle sales in the first half were up 3.8% to 13.35 million, buoyed by strong demand for commercial vehicles.Among foreign makers, Japanese companies had the biggest first-half games:             Honda Motor Co.       increased its China sales by 18.7%,             Nissan Motor Co.       by 6.7% and             Toyota Motor Corp.       by 5.4%.Some nimble product launches struck a chord with Chinese buyers, said Yale Zhang, managing director of Automotive Foresight. For example, in March Honda launched the UR-V, a large sport-utility vehicle that taps into rising demand for SUVs.Other foreign auto makers struggled in the first half.             General Motors Co.       had a 2.5% drop in sales and             Ford Motor Co.       slumped 7%Political tensions between Beijing and Seoul over South Korea\u2019s missile-defense program contributed to a nightmare first half for             Hyundai Motor Co.      , whose sales plunged 47%.Both GM and Ford drew encouragement from strong June sales as they look to China to compensate for weak U.S. demand. GM posted a 4.3% sales bump last month, while Ford soared 15%.\u201cThe momentum we\u2019ve found in Q2 and June, we\u2019re optimistic about that rolling forward through the rest of the year,\u201d Ford\u2019s Asia-Pacific president Peter Fleet said in an interview, adding that the company expects high single-digit growth in China in the third quarter.GM plans to introduce 10 new models in China before the end of 2017, China head       Matt Tsien       said in a statement.Both U.S. makers benefited from their luxury brands: sales of GM\u2019s Cadillac increased 75% in the first six months of the year, while Ford\u2019s Lincoln doubled its sales.Auto sales in China surged in late 2016 as consumers bought ahead of an increase in the sales tax on small-engine vehicles to 7.5% from 5%.A planned increase to 10% at the end of the year\u2014which would complete the unwinding of a tax cut made in 2015 to buoy a slumping market\u2014could produce a similar late-year spike in sales, said Mr. Fleet, though he noted that some auto analysts think the government may put the plan on hold to help keep the market stable.It is unclear whether Beijing will go ahead with the tax increase, said Chen Shihua, assistant secretary-general at the automobile association, calling for greater policy continuity to assist the auto industry.Among Chinese makers posting strong first-half sales was             SAIC Motor Corp.      , the country\u2019s biggest car company. Its group sales were up 5.8% to just over 3 million vehicles, including joint-venture production with GM and             Volkswagen.       Sales of SAIC\u2019s own-brand passenger cars more than doubled, albeit from a relatively low base.Geely Automobile Holdings                  \u2019 sales nearly doubled in the first half, putting it on track to sell over 1 million vehicles in a year for the first time.Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.\u2019s sales, including of joint-venture vehicles, were up 32% in the first half, with sales of own-brand cars up 57%.\u2014Lilian Lin in Beijing contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-07-11 07:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-car-sales-bounced-back-in-june-1499774298", "news_title": "China Car Sales Bounced Back in June", "keywords": "china auto market,china auto sales,china car market,china car sales,china passenger-car sales,china vehicle sales,China Association of Automobile Manufacturers,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,car registrations,vehicle sales,economic news,retail,wholesale,motor vehicle dealing,specialty stores"}, {"content": "Good morning.

As Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein explained in a note to clients, Snap Map likely will help marketers advertise to people based on the real-world locations they have been visiting. Snap Map ad units are also a possibility. If the Snap Map gets high-enough usage rates, it could help those advertisers more accurately determine whether Snapchat ads drove retail footfall. Google has been using Android to track store visits for years, but Snapchat\u2019s point of difference might be its young audience. As Mr. Helfstein wrote, \u201cWho spends the most time hanging out in shopping malls, going to the movies, dining at fast-food chains and buying branded apparel?\u201d It might take a while to convince the rest of Wall Street, however: Snap\u2019s stock fell below its $17 IPO price for the first time Monday.Unilever\u2019s Dove brand made a marketing misstep earlier this month with a U.K. ad that inexplicably stated \u201c75% say breastfeeding in public is fine. 25% say put them away. What\u2019s your way?\u201d Three hundred seventy-eight complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority and a social-media backlash later, Dove has decided to pull the ad, Campaign reports. In a statement, Unilever said the campaign aimed to \u201ccelebrate the diversity of parents and parenting choices\u201d but said it now realized \u201cour message in this instance has not come across as we intended,\u201d adding it didn\u2019t mean to cause offense. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on what the intended marketing outcome possibly could have been beyond scoring cheap engagement numbers by deliberately stirring the pot. \u201cPut them away,\u201d--really?! That\u2019s not to mention that it is illegal in England, Scotland and Wales to ask a breastfeeding mother to leave a public place.As far as being on brand is concerned, Burger King\u2019s head of brand marketing, Fernando Machado, walks the walk. He rocks up to his interview with Marketing Week \u201cwearing a white T-shirt featuring a Whopper burger draped in rainbow colors.\u201d The interview is stuffed with colorful marketing insights, too. Mr. Machado describes how Burger King gets more attention than its big-spending rivals by being \u201ca bit edgy\u201d when it comes to creative, which he says has helped the fast-food chain outpace the market in terms of sales growth. \u201cThe worst thing that can happen for any brand in any market is to not be noticed\u2014you waste a ton of money on media and just become noise in the background. For us to win, we need to value creativity, push boundaries and make it happen,\u201d Mr. Machado said. What\u2019s all the more impressive about running risky creative, such as its Cannes Lions award-winning print ads that featured real restaurants that had burned down, is that Burger King was acquired by 3G Capital in 2010. Often, when companies are acquired by private-equity firms, the spark can be gutted out of brands that have been lumped with layoffs and budget cuts. Burger King is a case study of when creativity can conquer.Facebook is cutting the price of its Oculus Rift VR headset, the second time it has done so in 2017 alone, The Wall Street Journal reports. For the next six weeks, Facebook will charge $399 for a bundle that includes the Rift headset, Touch motion controllers and some games, which brings it more in line with the price of Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR. While Facebook doesn\u2019t disclose the numbers, analysts predict sales of the Rift are trailing its rivals by a wide margin, as Bloomberg\u2019s Gadfly outlined with a telling chart using IDC estimates. But will a cheaper price\u2014which doesn\u2019t include the amount consumers will need to spend on a high-end computer powerful enough to operate the headset\u2014lift sales? Oculus\u2019s head of content, Jason Rubin, said a price cut worked last time.

First on the list for many is real estate, which is typically the second-biggest cost, after payroll.As store owners scrutinize their store footprints, they are turning increasingly to professionals who can help them get better deals from landlords.A growing roster of retailers, including             Bebe Stores Inc.       and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., are tapping lease-consulting firms to get landlords to agree to take less money.\u201cThe C-suite, as well as the company\u2019s board, are more engaged in real estate than ever before,\u201d said Andrew Grasier, co-president of A&G Realty Partners, a real-estate advisory firm that has worked with hundreds of retailers on restructuring leases and shrinking store fleets. \u201cSales trends and margins aren\u2019t as predictable as in the past, which puts more pressure on getting occupancy costs more in line with a store\u2019s performance.\u201dLandlords say they will make their own assessment by studying the tenant sales at the store, its rent-to-sale ratio and how that compares to the retailer\u2019s national average and the national average of the industry. Sometimes, the retailers might be the ones trying to bully the landlord to accept their terms, asking for as much as zero dollars in gross rent.\u201cSome retailers we\u2019re working with, some a little less, and others, we\u2019d politely say go ahead and order the moving truck,\u201d said Ami Ziff, director of national retail for Time Equities Inc., a real-estate firm with a portfolio that includes malls and open-air shopping centers across the country.Landlords of weaker shopping centers that don\u2019t attract alternative tenants are more likely to amend leases, while owners of stronger malls say they can ignore such requests from retailers that aren\u2019t on the brink of bankruptcy or buy out the lease from a struggling tenant and replace it with a higher-paying tenant.When a tenant is a highly leveraged retailer facing pressure from creditors to restructure or terminate leases outright, landlords can feel pressure to make a deal.Last week, jeans maker True Religion Apparel Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection, following in the footsteps of retailers Rue21 Inc., Wet Seal LLC, and Gymboree Corp. in recent months. True Religion said it plans to use bankruptcy laws to close or consolidate underperforming stores and renegotiate leases.A bankruptcy filing makes it more difficult for landlords to pursue and collect the full amount of rent, since the bankruptcy code effectively halts legal action against a company.\u201cYou want to reset the table before a bankruptcy filing,\u201d said Michael Sirota, a lawyer at Cole Schotz who works with retailers and landlords in lease negotiations.Sometimes landlords are at the mercy of tenants.             Spirit Realty Capital,       a real-estate investment trust that owns free-standing buildings that it leases to single tenants such as electronic stores, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, said during its first quarter earnings call it suffered a \u201cperfect storm\u201d when some tenants stopped paying rents.Appliance seller             Hhgregg Inc.,       outdoor-gear retailer Gander Mountain Co. \u00a0and home d\u00e9cor and apparel chain             Gordmans Stores Inc.       filed for bankruptcy protection in March, while a movie-theater operator and two casual-dining operators defaulted on rent payments.In April alone, the REIT failed to collect $4 million in rent and subsequently had to pause its earlier plans to acquire more real-estate assets.Spirit Realty suffered a \u201cblack eye, bloody nose and broken limbs,\u201d said Green Street Advisors in a recent research note. Spirit Realty declined to comment.Real-estate consultants advise clients looking to cut costs to explain to landlords that the failure to cooperate could end up hurting them more. They counsel tenants with regional or national profiles to negotiate with landlords on a combined-portfolio basis rather than on an individual-store basis.Landlords \u201crarely agree to rent reductions out of the goodness of the heart. Landlords are out there trying to make money, too,\u201d said Gregory Apter, president of Hilco Global, a real-estate services firm that has seen a rise in demand from retailers in lease-restructuring negotiations.Rents are rising in metropolitan areas, especially in locations that are densely populated and where landlords are putting in more effort to spruce up their properties. One other reason is also vacancy rates for many of the stronger centers and malls are still low, which is providing some support to rents.Still, the last thing both sides want to see is a default, Mr. Apter said. For tenants, that means a blow to their credit profile and for landlords, lost revenue and higher costs.\u201cWe need to provide a compelling story that is true and articulate that a rent reduction would provide critical runway for the retailer,\u201d said Mr. Apter.Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/retailers-tap-consultants-to-wiggle-out-of-mall-leases-1499770802", "news_title": "Retailers Tap Consultants to Wiggle Out of Mall Leases ", "keywords": "bankruptcy,consultants,landlords,leases,property report,retailers,bebe stores,BEBE,A&G Realty Partners,Pacific Sunwear of California,Time Equities,Ami Ziff,Andrew Grasier,Gregory Apter,Michael Sirota,political,general news,society,community,welfare,social services,retail,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,real estate agents,brokers,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "In Britain, an unlikely group is piling into commercial real-estate investments: local governments.The central U.K. government has cut back on funding for local entities known as councils since the 2008 financial crisis. To plug the gap, local officials have been hunting for yield in property.In all, local councils have poured \u00a31.8 billion ($2.32 billion) into commercial real estate in the past 12 months, up from \u00a3406 million in the previous 12-month period, according to property data firm Real Capital Analytics.The bet is that income from renting out offices and malls will help cover costs for libraries, social services and other expenses.\u201cThe level of demand has taken everybody by surprise,\u201d said a property broker who has worked on more than a dozen deals with councils.But the surging activity has sparked warnings that the risks being taken with public money are too great.\u201cConcerns center on the perceived lack of expertise of councils in this specialized arena, which could lead to costly errors that have consequences for taxpayers,\u201d said       Tom Leahy,        director of market analysis at Real Capital.U.K. councils, ranging in size from major counties to smaller districts, often are responsible for services such as education, transport and housing. They typically receive funding from a combination of central government grants and local taxes.Ultralow interest rates at central banks around the world have pushed down yields on asset classes like bonds. In response, institutional investors increasingly have turned to commercial real estate, where yields tend to be higher.For U.K. councils, the government spending cuts have only exacerbated the need for new ways to generate revenue. The decision to invest in property \u201cis just a function of the search for yield,\u201d the broker said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get it in the bond market. They don\u2019t trust the stock market. Property is what makes sense.\u201dIn recent months, Surrey Heath Borough Council has bought two retail properties and one industrial property in Camberley, where it is based, according to Mr. Leahy. Barnsley Borough Council, meanwhile, this year invested \u00a370 million to fund the construction of a new shopping center. In May, Uttlesford District Council in Essex bought a 50% share in Chesterford Research Park, a biotechnology and pharmaceutical research facility, for \u00a345 million.\u201cAs funding from central government diminishes, Uttlesford, like other councils across the U.K., is seeking alternative routes through which to generate long-term income,\u201d the council said in a statement in May.Late last year, Spelthorne Borough Council spent \u00a3360 million to buy an office campus of oil giant             BP                   PLC, the biggest deal in the past 12 months. The council said its central-government funding will be withdrawn completely by 2018, forcing it to find innovative ways to fund services and create new revenue streams.When bidding against other investors, these councils have a distinct advantage: cheap debt.The Public Works Loan Board, an arm of the U.K. Treasury, can lend to councils at interest rates derived from U.K. government bonds, which are at record lows. The body doesn\u2019t ask about the purpose of the loan, because \u201cresponsibility for local authority spending and borrowing decisions lies with the locally-elected members of the council, who are democratically accountable to their electorates,\u201d according to the PWLB website.The benefits for councils are clear. \u201cIt\u2019s access to long-term, very cheap finance,\u201d said       John Duxbury,        head of retail at London-based M&G Real Estate.But the investments being fueled by the cheap money require some expertise. Unlike bonds, for example, income from real estate requires upkeep and maintenance of the assets, investors said. A shopping center, for example, \u201cneeds a lot of active management, expertise and access to capital for improvement and refurbishment,\u201d said Mr. Duxbury.To be sure, deal-making from councils still makes up a small part of the total volume of U.K. commercial property transactions, which was \u00a344.4 billion in the past 12 months, according to Real Capital.But the pace of buying is expected to accelerate as long as cheap debt is available, brokers and investors said.\u201cThere seems to be no halt to this spending spree,\u201d said Mr. Leahy at Real Capital.Write to Art Patnaude at art.patnaude@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-county-governments-pile-into-real-estate-investments-1499770801", "news_title": "U.K. County Governments Pile Into Real-Estate Investments ", "keywords": "britain,commercial real estate,local councils,local governments,u.k. property,U.K. government,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,real estate transactions,commercial,industrial real estate,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.The U.S. wheat crop is withering, endangering one of the bright spots in the country\u2019s commodities shipping business this year. Drought in the Great Plains is decimating an important portion of the U.S. wheat crop, the WSJ\u2019s Benjamin Parkin reports, sending futures prices soaring and roiling the agriculture market. The sharp swings in pricing are a lesson in the difficulty in mapping out future supply and demand in farm commodities. Weeks of hot, dry weather in the Dakotas and Minnesota have been hard on spring wheat, which is prized for its high protein content. The damage follows meager planting early in the season after wheat farmers saw crop values clipped by a global grain glut and booming production abroad. The volatility could undermine a strong performer for rail networks. Grain shipments on U.S. railroads were up 12.2% in the first five months of 2017, including a 24.5% year-over-year increase in May, according to the Association of American Railroads.German metals trading and processing firm             Kl\u00f6ckner & Co. SE                   is far from worried that the Trump administration will impose new tariffs on foreign-made steel. With 50 branches in the U.S. and much of its steel traded in the country sourced locally, the company believes it could see a net gain if White House moves to protect American producers send prices higher, the WSJ\u2019s Nina Trentmann reports, particularly if it undercuts Chinese steel dumping. The German company\u2019s outlook highlights the varied impact that new U.S. steel sanctions could have as the impact of tariffs moves through the supply chain. The administration is considering additional tariffs on steel imports in the name of national security, and is expected to announce a decision any day. Kl\u00f6ckner expects to pass along any higher steel costs, but the company\u2019s U.S. customers may have a tough time doing that as the tariffs test the pricing power of steel\u2019s suppliers and producers.Australia has turned into a liquefied natural gas exporting powerhouse, but that\u2019s cold comfort to many Australians. A recent heat wave in Adelaide on the country\u2019s southern coast highlighted a cruel reality: resource-rich Australia, the world\u2019s No. 2 exporter of natural gas, didn\u2019t have enough power to meet the city\u2019s air-conditioning demand. The country\u2019s experience provides a lesson for the U.S. in what can go wrong, the WSJ\u2019s Rachel Pannett writes, as the country rapidly ramps up its own LNG apparatus to boost exports amid a gas glut. Resource-rich Australia exported 62% of its gas production last year, but policy makers didn\u2019t ensure enough gas would remain at home as state governments allowed older coal plants to close, leaving the regions more reliant on gas. One big difference is infrastructure: while Australia has focused on export facilities, the U.S. has a large pipeline grid in place, making it easier to move supplies around the country during shortages.After watching its store sales slide for four straight years, Abercrombie & Fitch                   now can\u2019t even sell itself. The struggling apparel retailer halted discussions with potential buyers, the WSJ\u2019s Dana Mattioli reports, saying instead that its best option is \u201c\u201cthe rigorous execution of our business plan.\u201d That business plan so far has left the company closing stores, lowering prices and revamping its marketing to address deep troubles at Abercrombie and in the market for teen and young adult apparel. The retailers have been hit hard by declining mall traffic, changing tastes and new competition, pushing several of Abercrombie\u2019s rivals into bankruptcy protection. There\u2019s a sobering message in Abercrombie\u2019s failed sale for other struggling apparel retailers, Miriam Gottfried writes in the WSJ\u2019s Heard on the Street column, who now should understand that they shouldn\u2019t expect to be bailed out by private equity or their peers.\u2018Flour mills and bakers will do what is necessary to secure their supplies.\u2019Estimated year-over-year percent increase in imports into major U.S. ports in June, according to the Global Port Tracker report.Zinc prices have been moving sharply higher, spurred by tight supply amid tougher Chinese environmental regulations.

That could force Beijing to rely on a cheaper yuan to turbocharge China\u2019s sizable export sector. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is predicting further U.S. interest-rate increases, which should boost the dollar against the yuan.And while China has clamped down on capital outflows in recent months, there is still demand for foreign assets from Chinese people as they seek to diversify their wealth. That could exert downward pressure on the yuan.Conversely, the central bank\u2019s chief objective is yuan stability, The Wall Street Journal has reported, as it seeks to keep the economy on an even keel.The tension is showing up in how the yuan trades inside China.China\u2019s central bank sets the yuan\u2019s value against the dollar 15 minutes before trading starts at 9:30 a.m. each day. The currency is then allowed to trade 2% above and below that so-called fix.In recent months, the yuan has usually started weakening from the fix once trading starts. On May 18, it closed 0.4% lower: A bigger one-day drop has happened just 10 times since the PBOC devalued the yuan in August 2015.The downward pressure persisted until the central bank stepped in later that month, market participants say, directing state-owned banks to buy yuan and sell dollars. It also changed the way it calculates the fix by adding a \u201ccountercyclical\u201d component that gives it more control over the currency.The PBOC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The central bank\u2019s apparent intervention didn\u2019t shift Chinese investors\u2019 expectations for long. The yuan closed at a weaker level versus the central bank\u2019s fix for most of June. That has continued in July, though to a smaller degree, after another bout of suspected intervention by the central bank late last month. In all, the yuan has closed weaker than the fix on 25 of the past 29 trading days: It weakened 0.1% from the central bank\u2019s fix on Monday and 0.02% on Tuesday.\u201cOnce the PBOC stops intervening, there\u2019s actually great pressure for the yuan to fall because the weak outlook of our economy and the financial risk we\u2019ve accumulated are still hanging over our heads,\u201d said a Shanghai-based senior currency trader at a midsize local bank.Chinese exporters, major players in the domestic currency market, appear unconvinced that the yuan will steady.Deposits of foreign currencies at Chinese banks hit a record of $779 billion in May, according to data from Wind Info going back to 2002, suggesting that many big companies are parking their dollars at banks rather than swapping them into yuan.The holdouts include companies such as Shenzhen-based Noncam Technology, a gaming-gadgets maker that sells 80% of its products to clients from the U.S. and Europe. Its chief executive, Frank Shen, expects the dollar to rise after the Fed\u2019s rate increases, while China may be pressured to devalue the yuan to boost exports.\u201cAny short-term fluctuations will not alter the longer trend of a stronger dollar,\u201d Mr. Shen said. \u201cEveryone expects that the dollar will rise further.\u201dThe Chinese central bank\u2019s difficulties with the changing expectations of participants in the domestic market are striking in part because its main struggle in the past has been with overseas investors betting against the yuan in offshore markets, where the currency trades more freely.On several occasions in the past 18 months, the PBOC has squeezed short-term borrowing costs for the yuan in Hong Kong, the main center for offshore yuan trading, making it expensive for investors to bet against the Chinese currency.The message appears to have hit home with yuan skeptics overseas.\u201cWe know when there\u2019s a major selloff in renminbi, the PBOC will intervene,\u201d said Edmund Goh, Asian fixed-income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore, using another name for the yuan. Mr. Goh said he has been slightly overweight the yuan for a while.\u201cI would not want to bet against the PBOC,\u201d he added.\u2014Yifan Xie contributed to this article.Write to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com and Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'People\u2019s Bank of China Fights Market Over Yuan.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 06:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-central-bank-is-battling-investors-at-home-over-the-yuan-1499769131", "news_title": "China\u2019s Central Bank Is Battling Investors at Home Over the Yuan", "keywords": " central bank intervention, central banks, chinese investors, chinese markets, currencies,people's bank of china, yuan, yuan fix,China's central bank,Noncam Technology,Edmund Goh,Frank Shen,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Good morning,The Trump administration is moving toward unilaterally tightening sanctions on North Korea, targeting Chinese companies and banks the U.S. says are funneling cash into Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program. In recently unsealed court filings, the Justice Department pointed to offshore accounts associated with a network of five companies linked to Chinese national Chi Yupeng, including one of the largest importers of North Korean goods into China. Given Pyongyang\u2019s proficiency at evading sanctions, including by disguising its international trade and financial entities through companies in China, raising pressure on North Korea requires targeting more Chinese companies. That risks further straining tensions between Washington and Beijing. But there is no good pure military option for confronting North Korea, seasoned senior U.S. national-security official Robert Gates tells our columnist Gerald F. Seib. \u201cChina is still the key no matter how you slice it.\u201dPresident Trump plans to put his first mark on the Federal Reserve by nominating former Republican Treasury official Randal Quarles to perhaps the country\u2019s most powerful bank-regulatory post: Fed vice chair of supervision\u2014created in 2010 but never filled during the Obama administration. If confirmed, the investment-fund manager\u2014a critic of the Fed\u2019s prolonged near-zero rate policy\u2014would also have a monetary-policy role as a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors. Mr. Quarles, who last year co-wrote a WSJ op-ed calling for fully measuring the impact of the Dodd-Frank rules before \u201carbitrarily taking an ax to big banks,\u201d would take a lead role in carrying out the Trump administration\u2019s rethinking of many Obama-era financial regulations. Earlier Monday, the Obama-appointed director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau completed a rule allowing customers to file class-action lawsuits against banks, setting off a showdown with the administration and congressional Republicans.Iraq\u2019s U.S.-backed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul, but Iran is shaping up to be one of the biggest winners. Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq\u2019s previous prime minister and a favorite of Iran, is campaigning to win back his old job in next year\u2019s election against Mr. Abadi. Already, instead of congratulating Mr. Abadi\u2019s government for reclaiming Mosul, Mr. Maliki has given much of the credit to an umbrella group of mostly Shiite militias, many backed by Shiite-majority Iran, that he formed when in office. The shattering of Islamic State\u2019s empire is also allowing Iran to slowly regain its arc of influence stretching from Tehran through Baghdad to Damascus and Beirut, and is expected to make it easier for Iran to ship weapons to the Hezbollah militia it supports in Lebanon. Although U.S. forces and the Shiite militias maintain an uneasy truce in Iraq\u2014the largest Arab country with a Shiite majority\u2014next year\u2019s election could determine whether the country tilts toward Iran or the U.S.Runners in the U.S. are used to medals at the finish line and paying entry fees to race.

Taiwan was running a similar clandestine operation. Japan sat on a stockpile of plutonium from its civilian nuclear program and then, as now, had all the technology it needed to build a bomb.Only strong U.S. pressure, combined with strategic reassurance to its allies, managed to head off an arms race. In Taiwan\u2019s case, the U.S. confronted it with CIA evidence of its program and shut it down in the 1980s.Today, a nuclear-arms race is one of the nightmare scenarios as China\u2019s ally Pyongyang terrorizes its neighbors.This time, it\u2019s on Beijing to restore a measure of calm.China faces a moment of truth in its own backyard on whether it is ready to assume greater global leadership.So far, writes       John H. Maurer,        a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, \u201cBeijing is flunking the test.\u201dIn Beijing\u2019s view, the current crisis was largely created by U.S. belligerence, and thus the onus is primarily on Washington to fix it, with China acting as facilitator.President       Donald Trump       has tweeted that while he appreciates the attempt by his Chinese counterpart,       Xi Jinping,        to help \u201cit has not worked out.\u201d China insists it has made \u201crelentless efforts\u201d to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula.An irritated China on Tuesday hit back at U.S. pressure to do more. \u201cThe \u2018China responsibility theory\u2019 on the peninsula nuclear issue can stop,\u201d a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.Yet China is Pyongyang\u2019s enabler: Up to 90% of North Korea\u2019s foreign trade runs through its neighbor. And commerce is surging; Pyongyang is a bustling capital.Beijing appears to believe that living with a nuclear North Korea is preferable to the alternatives: the collapse of its socialist ally spilling refugees into its industrial heartland and bringing U.S. troops to its border.This is likely a terrible miscalculation. It may well be true that North Korea\u2019s youthful dictator,       Kim Jong Un,        isn\u2019t driven by a death wish, but it would be unwise to count on restraint from a leader who reportedly had his own uncle blown to bits with an antiaircraft gun. He already has the capability to wipe out Seoul or Tokyo, and a missile that can reach Alaska.A nuclear arms race might itself be a trigger for war. How would Beijing respond if Taiwan reactivated its nuclear program?Right-wing politicians in Seoul are openly debating the nuclear option. Public opposition in Japan, the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack, makes it unlikely that Tokyo would ever build its own arsenal.But then, the unthinkable is now reality: President Trump talks about a \u201cmajor, major conflict.\u201dBack in the 1970s, South Korea attempted a nuclear breakout when it feared U.S. abandonment. The spectacle of U.S. diplomats helicoptering out of Saigon in 1975 magnified the worries. Hundreds of scientists labored on the project. Seoul didn\u2019t drop the effort until 1980\u2014after the U.S. suspended a plan to pull out troops, according to       Seung-Young Kim,        a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield.A North Korea capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile would, once again, raise questions about U.S. willingness to come to the rescue. Would Washington risk Seattle for Seoul? That, in turn, might spur demands for a homegrown nuclear deterrent.White House officials have signaled in recent days that the U.S. is ready to act unilaterally by targeting Chinese banks and companies that Washington says are funneling cash to Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program.Hawks in the U.S. call for tougher action on North Korea, although the regime seems impervious to the effects of sanctions on its own impoverished people and military strikes would risk retaliation and millions of casualties, including among U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.Others press for Washington to open direct dialogue with Pyongyang, though it\u2019s uncertain whether the North would even come to the table.One thing is clear, however: China\u2019s passivity doesn\u2019t jibe with its quest for international respect as a great power capable of solving big problems.In the past, write       Jake Sullivan       and Victor Cha, two prominent North Korean experts, China left it to the U.S. to offer Pyongyang inducements, including energy aid, to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The bill during the Clinton and later Bush administrations came to half a billion dollars.Now, they argue, \u201cwe should tell China that it has to pay to play. The basic trade would be Chinese disbursements to Pyongyang, as well as security assurances, in return for constraints on North Korea\u2019s program.\u201dThe world looks at North Asia as an almost invincible economic powerhouse. Even as the current crisis unfolds, the South Korean stock market booms. Samsung is poised to overtake Apple as the world\u2019s most profitable technology company. Hobbling debt levels and obstacles to entry are far more worrying to foreign investors in China than the nuclear standoff.Yet the region\u2019s gains have always been fragile. It is now the most dangerous corner of the planet.The question now is whether China will come to see that its rogue ally imperils everything\u2014its past victories against poverty, its dreams of future wealth and power. And whether that will inspire it to lead.Write to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'China Fails Critical Test as Pyongyang Makes Nuclear Strides.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 06:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-gets-failing-grade-on-north-korea-1499766915", "news_title": "China\u2019s Inaction on North Korea Risks a New Nuclear Arms Race ", "keywords": "andy browne column,china's world,korean peninsula,north korea,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,nuclear arms race,nuclear proliferation,thaad,trump tweet,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,risk news,military action,weapons programs"}, {"content": "Imagine being told you could no longer talk about anything related to Europe on             Facebook.       That is akin to the problem facing the essential work of financial clearinghouses. Eurozone regulators want their own network to keep track of financial risks after Brexit.Such a change would be highly irritating for users. But the true costs and consequences could be much less dire than some predict.A clearinghouse is a place where transactions in things like foreign exchange and interest-rate derivatives can be safely recorded, monitored and settled.But it is more than that: The key thing is almost all banks go there, reaping the benefits of a network. The more people use one platform, the better it works. With Facebook, you can share news among as wide a group of friends as possible at the same time. In a clearinghouse, banks offset as many overlapping financial claims among as wide a group of counterparties as possible and that dramatically cuts the cost of holding them.LCH, part of the         London Stock Exchange Group,       is the Facebook of derivatives. It typically handles 90% to 95% of all interest-rate swap clearing globally, which generated 18% of the group\u2019s pretax operating profit last year. European Union regulators are worried because it is in London, which will be beyond their jurisdiction after Brexit. The U.S. has direct oversight of LCH because its derivatives regulators made registration mandatory if U.S. clients are going to use it for dollar-denominated trades.Clearing has boomed since the financial crisis because regulators demanded it for more of the global trade in interest rate swaps, currency swaps and interbank funding to help them keep a closer eye on connections between banks. And while lots of clearing takes place in London, the trading of underlying contracts could happen anywhere. The U.S. accounts for about 40% of interest rate swap trades, for example, but only about 5% of their clearing.Banks that use clearing must post collateral, or margin, against their trades in a clearinghouse. But at the same time, having all these trades in one place means they get to offset what they all owe each other. This means less margin is required overall than if all those trades had to be backed with collateral separately.If Brexit forces banks to shift euro-denominated trades within the EU, all the benefits banks get offsetting about 30% of the market against trades in other currencies in London would vanish.Some predict costly ramifications: Europe\u2019s leading finance trade body, Afme, last week predicted the extra collateral needed would be up to $45 billion, which would sap more funding and capital from banks. That is less than a widely quoted $77 billion estimate from a specialist company, ClarusFT, but way more than an estimate of $3 billion to $9 billion from Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche B\u00f6rse and a likely beneficiary should euro settlement business leave London.But the costs might be lower than the higher estimates because these don\u2019t consider efficiencies that clearinghouses have yet to pursue. These could come from offsetting different kinds of trades, for example, derivatives against sale-and-repurchase agreements. Extra costs would encourage them to do this.There may also be reasons to limit the concentration of global business in LCH: if Facebook is our main communication tool, and it goes down, we are all left in the dark; the same problem in clearing spells financial chaos.For now, the business will stay in London anyway. It is hard for banks to hedge their bets by moving some business to a different venue. That only makes sense if your clearing friends all want to do the same thing.There could be disruption in satisfying EU regulators, but some of the costs may be worth paying.Write to Paul J.

That, they say, would crimp economic benefits Iran expected from the agreement by persuading already cautious Western banks and investors to stay away\u2014whereas President       Barack Obama\u2019s       top officials urged engagement with Tehran. European diplomats also worry that if the U.S. commitment remains uncertain, Iran may respond by attempting limited violations.Trump administration officials have raised concerns\u2014echoed in some European capitals\u2014that the deal doesn\u2019t curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear activities once its key commitments expire\u00a0over\u00a0the next 15 years. Washington has also repeatedly criticized the deal for not committing Iran to change its behavior in the region, where it has intervened to support the regime of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       and moved to increase its influence elsewhere through proxy forces such as Hezbollah.While Obama administration officials toured Europe to encourage companies to take advantage of the lifting of most sanctions, the new administration has taken the opposite approach. White House Deputy Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Mr. Trump used last weekend\u2019s Group of 20 leaders meeting in Germany to press his counterparts \u201cto stop doing business with nations that sponsor terrorism, especially Iran.\u201dThe limbo over the deal could strain U.S. ties with Europe, where the governments of France, Germany, and the U.K., as well as the European Union, helped negotiate the deal and strongly support it. They argue the deal averted a military conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and is now allowing the continent to start rebuilding investment ties with Tehran.\u201cI think a situation where the new administration will just keep things under review\u2014I would not say forever, but on and on and on\u2014I don\u2019t think that is unrealistic,\u201d a senior European diplomat said. \u201cNobody has any guarantee of the outcome.\u201dU.S. officials said Washington has informed allies about the basic parameters of the review. A senior administration official said the U.S. had \u201cnumerous bilateral meetings with different European allies\u201d to solicit feedback.Many\u00a0senior U.S. defense and foreign-policy posts remain unfilled, including senior ambassadors including envoys to the European Union. European diplomats say that has hampered communication.As the Trump administration settled in earlier this year, Europeans remained confident that the nuclear deal would remain intact, even as Congress and the new president vowed to increase pressure on Tehran over its regional actions, missile tests and human-rights abuses.EU foreign-policy chief       Federica Mogherini       told reporters she was reassured after her first meeting with U.S. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       in February that the new administration intended to stick to \u201cthe full implementation of the agreement,\u201d which obliged Iran to slash its nuclear facilities, infrastructure and activities in exchange for a lifting of most international sanctions.European diplomats worked with their U.S. counterparts after Mr. Trump took office to identify parts of the nuclear accord where oversight could be tightened, hoping stricter implementation would ease Washington\u2019s doubts.Ms. Mogherini said last month she believed the U.S. review would end with \u201cwise decisions.\u201d Privately, diplomats are less assured about the review\u2019s outcome. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that anything is possible,\u201d a second senior European diplomat said.European officials have repeatedly said they wouldn\u2019t reimpose European sanctions on Iran, regardless of U.S. action, as long as Tehran complied with the deal. The U.S. has kept in place its primary sanctions, which ban most U.S. firms from doing business with Tehran.European officials originally understood the review would be done in mid-July but now expect it could continue through the summer. They have received no assurances that they will be alerted before a decision is made.\u201cI\u2019m not even sure who will be allowed to contribute to the decision,\u201d said another senior European official.The Trump administration official dismissed\u00a0that\u00a0concern. \u201cThe input that we\u2019ve gotten from our European allies has been very constructive on a whole range of issues,\u201c the official said. \u201dAllied countries know very well who they need to reach out to express views and they\u2019re doing that.\u201dThe official said the review\u2019s timetable is being driven by the substance of the work. \u201cThere\u2019s no set date for its completion,\u201d the official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take forever.\u201dWhile the Trump administration has expressed doubts about the accord, European capitals welcomed it as a way to block Iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons in coming years and to re-engage economically and diplomatically with Tehran. They argue, as the Obama administration did, that only by separating the nuclear issue from other concerns about Iran\u2019s regional behavior could the nuclear issue\u2014the most urgent at the time\u2014be resolved.For now, U.S. doubts about the Iran deal don\u2019t seem to have encouraged Tehran to stray from its commitments.

Should the deal go through, Berkshire would be expanding its reliance on running stable and highly regulated industries to deliver growth.Mr. Buffett rose to fame as a stock picker and continues to invest tens of billions in equities and other securities for Berkshire\u2019s portfolio.But today, those investments are \u201cde-emphasized,\u201d as Berkshire earns significantly more income from its operating businesses, Mr. Buffett said in his February letter to shareholders. Berkshire has undergone a \u201cgradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment activities to one that grows in value by owning businesses,\u201d he wrote.The conglomerate\u2019s shift toward regulated businesses began in 1999, when Berkshire announced an agreement to buy its first utility business, and accelerated with the 2009 agreement to acquire railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\u00a0Regulated businesses can yield steady returns, while stock investments are more volatile but can produce bigger wins. Berkshire also operates less-regulated businesses including retailers and manufacturers.The energy and railroad businesses accounted for 24% of Berkshire\u2019s 2016 net earnings, up from 8% a decade ago.\u201cThe franchise has pivoted away from equity investments toward acquisitions,\u201d said       James Shanahan,        senior equity-research analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cThe bigger the utility business gets, I think the more important it becomes that the leader of Berkshire Hathaway has a strong understanding of the operations of utility businesses.\u201dIf Berkshire Hathaway Energy\u2019s deal to buy Energy Future Holdings and its Texas-based utility Oncor is approved, Oncor would increase the conglomerate\u2019s earnings by about 2%, according to             Morgan Stanley                   analysts.The deal has been challenged by hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., which said it plans to put together its own deal with a higher valuation for Oncor.One major ramification of the Oncor deal, should it go through, is that it would give more power to\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway Energy\u2019s chief executive,       Greg Abel.       Analysts say this purchase make them\u00a0increasingly confident Mr. Abel is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Buffett as chief executive of the parent company.Mr. Abel, 55 years old, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy similarly to how Mr. Buffett, 86, runs Berkshire. Both managers maintain small head offices\u201427 employees at Berkshire Hathaway Energy and 25 at Berkshire\u2019s headquarters\u2014and grant their subsidiary managers autonomy to run their businesses.Before making its bid to buy Energy Future, Berkshire Hathaway Energy participated in talks with Texas regulators and major Oncor customers to make sure its bid would be acceptable to them, Oncor executives said in an interview. Regulators have scuttled two previous attempts to buy Energy Future\u2019s 80% stake in Oncor.\u201cThey went to Texas first,\u201d said       Bob Shapard,        Oncor\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBerkshire brought [Energy Future] a deal that essentially had been settled with the major players in Austin.\u201dBerkshire Hathaway Energy, formerly known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., has led some of Berkshire\u2019s biggest acquisitions. This deal would significantly expand its customer base. Dallas-based Oncor serves 10 million Texans, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy serves 11.6 million customers in Midwestern and Western states, the U.K. and Canada through its utility and natural-gas businesses.Mr. Abel joined the company in 1992 and became chief executive in 2008. Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to make Mr. Abel available to comment.Ajit Jain,        who oversees many of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations, is also widely considered a potential successor to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Jain declined to comment. Berkshire has acquired insurers in recent years and launched a commercial-insurance company in 2013.More broadly, Berkshire\u2019s utility investments mark a different strategy than how Mr. Buffett built his firm decades ago, when he sought to buy companies like See\u2019s Candies that required little capital investment.As Berkshire has grown into a behemoth, Mr. Buffett has turned to acquiring regulated businesses that require consistent maintenance. The downside is these businesses require continuing capital investments, but that helps use up some of Berkshire\u2019s massive cash pile. The utility businesses also earn tax credits for their significant investments in renewable energy.\u201cIt is probably a different act to maintain this company than it was to build it,\u201d said       Lawrence Cunningham,        a law professor at George Washington University who has written about Berkshire. \u201cWarren wasn\u2019t doing this when Berkshire was much smaller, but nowadays, in the last 10 years, they\u2019ve got so much capital.\u201dMr. Buffett didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Buffett told shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May that the next CEO\u2019s main job would be capital allocation. Even if the Oncor deal closes, Berkshire has about $50 billion in cash available to spend, according to CFRA Research.Write to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Stock Picking Not Focus It Once Was.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-moves-away-from-stock-picking-1499765400", "news_title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Moves Away From Stock Picking ", "keywords": "berkshire hathaway, energy acquisition, oncor, stock investments, stock picking, warren buffett,Berkshire Hathaway,BRK.A,BRKA,Energy Future Holdings,Warren Buffett,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,electric power distribution,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,electric utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Last August, Maryland\u2019s State Board of Elections noticed something suspicious: Someone was probing the state\u2019s online voter-registration system, using an internet address originating in the Netherlands.\u201cThey were trying to knock at the door to see if they could get in,\u201d said       Nikki Charlson,        Maryland\u2019s deputy state administrator of elections.The system wasn\u2019t penetrated, Ms. Charlson said, nor did the activity affect systems involved in vote tallying, which aren\u2019t connected to the internet.Still, Maryland\u2019s disclosure is one of several new reports indicating that attempts to hack election systems in 2016 were more widespread than previously known. Russian government hackers targeted voting systems in 21 states,       Jeanette Manfra,        acting undersecretary for cybersecurity and communications at the federal Department of Homeland Security, told the Senate Intelligence Committee last month.Previously, only a handful of states, including Arizona and Illinois, had publicly confirmed hacking attempts against their election systems.Maryland\u2019s experience shows the challenges hackers pose to a state, even one that jumps on a problem quickly.\u00a0Federal help to define the threat was slow to arrive, and state elections officials had to walk a fine line between pursuing a security problem and sowing doubts about the soundness of their electoral process.Maryland state lawmakers didn\u2019t find out about the attempted intrusion until\u00a010 months later, via news reports, raising concern about their ability to oversee the elections system.State and local officials nationwide are generally in charge of securing election systems. But as U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies detected Russian hacking attempts last summer, DHS offered help.Ultimately, 33 states and 36 cities and counties used DHS tools or sought advice from the agency,       Jeh Johnson,        former secretary of homeland security, told the House Intelligence Committee the same day Ms. Manfra testified.In Maryland, election officials were able to recognize the unsavory nature of the character rattling their virtual doorknob. That Netherlands address was on a list of suspicious IP addresses provided to states by the nonprofit Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center, which provides cybersecurity services to government entities, around the same time Maryland detected it, Ms. Charlson said.The state\u2019s computer staff blocked the IP address from multiple parts of the network within three days.About\u00a0two weeks later, Maryland officials reported the incident to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which notified DHS. Twenty days after Maryland first detected the incident, DHS completed its own report, confirming that the system hadn\u2019t been penetrated.Linda H. Lamone,        Maryland\u2019s elections administrator, said she learned that DHS was offering additional assistance at a conference on\u00a0Sept. 16. Maryland requested that assistance, which DHS provided beginning a month later, Ms. Charlson said.Since then, DHS has remotely conducted weekly \u201ccyber hygiene scans,\u201d which look for vulnerabilities in Maryland\u2019s internet-connected systems, she said.\u00a0However, DHS said it couldn\u2019t provide more thorough assessments until after the election because of a backlog of requests, Ms. Charlson said. She is still trying to schedule federal on-site assessments of software and physical sites.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of resources on DHS\u2019s end,\u201d said       Philip McNamara,        formerly assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at DHS. \u201cThe [scans], we can do easily. The deeper-dive analysis, that takes a team to do,\u201d said Mr. McNamara, who oversaw DHS outreach to local elections officials in 2016.Maryland also used its own cybersecurity resources and already had hired private contractors to protect its election systems, Ms. Lamone said.Maryland\u2019s online voter-registration system is separate from its voter-registration database, which isn\u2019t connected to the internet. Maryland residents can register or update their information online, but only authorized officials put that data into voter rolls.If\u00a0a hacker had successfully penetrated the online registration system, he or she wouldn\u2019t have gained access to the official voter roll, but could have stolen personal information such as voters\u2019 names, addresses, dates of birth, driver\u2019s license numbers, party affiliation and the last four digits of Social Security numbers.The incident has raised questions about when others in Maryland\u2019s government should have known of the problem. Maryland lawmakers said that neither of the legislative committees that oversee elections were aware of the attempted intrusion, reported earlier by the Baltimore Sun.\u201cTo find out about it in a newspaper, rather than with the agency reporting on what happened and the steps they\u2019ve taken, is of grave concern,\u201d said state Sen.       Cheryl Kagan,        a Democrat.Ms. Lamone, the elections administrator, said that the\u00a0State Board of Elections followed protocol by notifying the Department of Information Technology, part of the governor\u2019s cabinet.Democratic       Delegate Anne Kaiser,        chairman of a committee that oversees elections, plans to hold a hearing on elections security in the fall, she said last month. Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties have asked the State Board of Elections for more information.\u201cThis is an issue that impacts everybody,\u201d said State Sen.       Gail Bates,        a Republican who previously cosigned a letter about the security of voter data with Ms. Kagan.\u00a0\u201cEverybody wants a fair election.

Now it wants to fill those products with Chinese chips. Making semiconductors is far harder than assembling phones, but the experience of dozens of industries shows that it is a mistake to bet against China\u2019s ability to upend an industry.China plans to spend up to $108 billion over the next 10 years on its own chip-making industry, according to Bain & Co. China consumes almost half of the world\u2019s chips, mostly for exported electronics, but it makes less than 10% of those chips, according to Gartner.That, the government believes, is a national security threat, and China has made building its own semiconductor supply chain a national priority.The government is showering money on the country\u2019s chip makers. State-owned chip maker Tsinghua Unigroup, for example, just got $22 billion from a state bank and a government-backed fund in March. At least 20 fabs are currently under construction in China, said industry organization SEMI.Despite the lavish spending, it will be at least a couple of years before the Chinese chips hit the market. Even then, China will find it difficult to close its technological gaps with the top chip makers. In the two areas in which it invests heavily\u2014chip fabrication and memory chips\u2014China is way behind market leaders like             Samsung                   and TSMC, which are also investing billions to keep their leads. Their technological edge also gives them a cost advantage, which could make China\u2019s cash burning unsustainable, despite the state support.China first tried to buy rather than build a domestic chip industry. Chinese companies announced a record $43 billion of foreign acquisitions in the semiconductor sector in 2015, yet only $5.2 billion of those were completed, according to Dealogic. The deals failed largely because it became clear they had little chance to get past U.S. regulators.Among the failed deals are Tsinghua\u2019s $23 billion pursuit of memory chip maker Micron and the $2.5 billion bid for Fairchild Semiconductor by a group led by another state-owned firm China Resources. China\u2019s outbound M&A in the sector for the first six months this year amounted to $1.6 billion\u2014an 81% drop from last year.But there is one area that Chinese chip makers could have some success\u2014devices that don\u2019t require the best chips but ones that are just good enough. Domestic Chinese brands like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo all build cheap gadgets that are popular in China and some developing markets. Those three brands made up almost half of smartphone shipments in China last year as Apple and Samsung continued to lose share.These Chinese vendors likely will be big buyers of Chinese chips, if they can meet at least some minimum standards. Smaller foreign chip makers that don\u2019t have the market leaders\u2019 efficient cost structure could get hurt by a flood of cheap chips. Companies like UMC and Nanya Technology in Taiwan or even Korea\u2019s             SK Hynix                   could be affected.China\u2019s big splash in the chip industry may not unseat the champions, but could weed out the laggards.This column is part of a series on what is next for the booming semiconductor industry.Write to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Watch Out: China Now Has Its Sights on Chip Production.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-a-wild-card-for-chip-stocks-1499765402", "news_title": "China Is a Wild Card for Chip Stocks   ", "keywords": "china semiconductor,chip makers,heard on the street,industry,Tsinghua Unigroup,Bain,TSMC,Samsung Electronics,KR:005930,Micron Technology,MU,Huawei Technologies,Oppo,Vivo,UMC Electronics,JP:6615,Nanya Technology,TW:2408,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,computers,consumer electronics,networking,semiconductors,management consulting,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,business consultancy,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology,wireless area network technology"}, {"content": "U.S. banks are upping their dividends with gusto, but the average dividend fund is missing the party.These funds, which manage hundreds of billions of dollars, will eventually catch on to the payouts, giving investors a chance to build positions ahead of the expected buying. Investors will earn healthy payouts while they wait.The anomaly goes back to the financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s power over what banks can do with their capital. All major banks passed the Fed\u2019s latest round of stress tests last month, which allows them to boost their payouts. Five of the biggest banks in the U.S. announced hefty dividend increases soon after. The sixth,             Goldman Sachs,       is keeping its dividend plans quiet for now but is also likely to increase its payout.On average, these big five banks raised their dividends by 40%, bringing their average yield to 2.24%, above the S&P 500\u2019s yield of just under 2%. Some large regional lenders like             SunTrust Banks                   and             PNC Financial                   also look enticing with yields of 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively.However, many of funds that target high yields or rising dividends aren\u2019t taking advantage. Of the 10 biggest dividend-oriented mutual funds and exchange-traded funds respectively, only three were overweight financials relative to their Morningstar benchmarks, according to the most recent public data. Eleven of them had no banks at all in their top 25 holdings.This represents a significant underinvestment in banks by a pool of funds worth over $300 billion. Strict rules, especially for passively managed funds, explain it. Vanguard\u2019s Dividend Appreciation ETF, for instance, is tied to an index of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for 10 years. Within that time frame, bank dividends were savaged by the financial crisis.Those criteria serve an understandable purpose. But in this specific case, they are causing income-seeking investors to miss out on safe, predictable dividend increases. The Fed\u2019s stress tests, after all, assume bank payouts are maintained, along with hefty buybacks, even during a deep recession on par with the last one.A few actively managed funds with flexible mandates were able to spot what backward-looking formulas missed and have taken hefty stakes in banks. They include the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund,             T. Rowe Price\u2019s       Equity Income fund, and the J.P. Morgan Equity Income fund.Other funds may not add banks until they actually start paying higher dividends in October, or perhaps years afterward in some cases. The present situation gives investors a chance to get in ahead of them.There is another reason to buy the banks. In next year\u2019s stress tests, the Fed is set to scrap its current 30% \u201csoft cap\u201d on dividend payout ratios, which has forced banks to return more capital via share buybacks rather than dividends. The change will allow banks to boost dividends even more aggressively.Passive investment works better most of the time. But occasional changes in the landscape can give an advantage to active investors. This appears to be one such case.Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-beat-the-dumb-money-with-bank-stocks-1499765405", "news_title": "How to Beat the Dumb Money With Bank Stocks ", "keywords": " bank dividends,banking,banks, bank stocks, bank stress tests, dividends,etf, exchange-traded funds,federal reserve, funds, heard on the street,investments, stress tests,Federal Reserve,PNC Financial Services Group,PNC,SunTrust Banks,STI,financial performance,earnings,dividends,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,commercial banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,credit,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014A Chinese startup that sells facial recognition systems to police forces secured venture-capital funding that values it at more than $1.5 billion, underscoring the sector\u2019s emergence as one of technology\u2019s hottest areas of interest.Beijing-based SenseTime Co., which provides surveillance systems using facial recognition to Chinese law enforcement agencies, said Tuesday it raised $410 million in new funding from investors, lifting it to so-called unicorn status with a value of more than $1 billion.Using artificial intelligence, facial recognition systems from SenseTime and others can identify people in a crowd by matching their faces against those on file in image databases.Facial recognition works by breaking down a person\u2019s face into a series of measurements and using them to create a template that can be compared with others in a database.In China, adoption has been especially swift, aided by a large network of surveillance cameras, a national photo ID index and relatively few concerns about privacy.Customers include law enforcement agencies who use the technology to identify and detain criminal suspects. It is also being used by local governments to discourage behaviors like jaywalking. In park near Shanghai, for example, it is being used to identify race participants who take shortcuts on a running track.But commercial uses are growing, as the technology emerges as an alternative way to identify people who are gaining access to workplaces, boarding airplanes, making ATM withdrawals and checking into hotels.American tech companies are active in the sector as well.             Facebook Inc.       is considered a pioneer in the field and last year             Apple Inc.       bought Emotient, a startup whose technology assesses emotions based on facial expressions. Los Angeles-based FaceFirst Inc. provides facial recognition systems for U.S. and international airports and military bases.SenseTime, which also provides facial and image recognition to the finance and mobile internet sectors, was founded in 2014 and has 500 employees. Local Chinese governments are among its biggest clients.The company will use the funding raised to retain and hire talent and pay for research into other technologies that rely on artificial intelligence, including self-driving cars and medical diagnostics, said Chief Executive Xu Li.SenseTime investors include Chinese private-equity fund CDH Investments and Sailing Capital, a VC fund linked to the Shanghai government.\u201cWe are already seeing the early signs of how artificial intelligence is changing traditional industry,\u201d CDH Investments Chairman Wu Shangzhi said. \u201cThe time has come for AI to have a big impact.\u2019\u2019In total, AI-focused tech startups in China raised $500 million in the first six months of the year, preliminary data from Dow Jones VentureSource showed, compared with $700 million for all of last year. No separate data was available for facial recognition startups.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       Chairman Jack Ma and             Foxconn Technology Co.       are investors in these kinds of startups. Yunfeng Capital, a venture fund founded by Mr. Ma, is an investor in Shanghai-based Yitu Technology. Foxconn has a stake in Beijing-based Megvii Technology Ltd.Providing smart surveillance systems for national security gave startups a huge leg up when they began, said Cool Zhang, IDC China\u2019s director for artificial intelligence. China\u2019s annual public-security budget is huge, making it an easy sector for companies to generate revenue, he said.Privacy advocates worry that the technology could be used by governments to conduct random surveillance without cause.\u201cThis is a force multiplier that takes the identification of people in public to a completely different level,\u201d said Clare Garvie, a researcher for the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.Analysts say investment in the sector is expected to continuing growing\u2014especially in China, where the government has made a big push to advance AI technologies. The promotional material that SenseTime provides to potential investors includes photos of Chinese Premier       Li Keqiang       testing out its facial recognition technology at the State Council building in Beijing.\u201cYou\u2019ll likely see more and more attention and investment into this area,\u201d IDC\u2019s Mr. Zhang said. \u201cThe use cases in various industries and businesses are only increasing.\u201d\u2014Josh Chin in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 12, 2017, print edition as 'Facial Recognition Wears a Smile.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 05:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saving-face-investment-in-recognition-technology-heats-up-in-china-1499763603", "news_title": "China Is Using Facial Recognition to Nab Jaywalkers; Investors Get Interested ", "keywords": "china technology,facial recognition ,facial recognition in policing ,facial recognition technology in china ,sensetime,vc funding in china ,vc new money,venture capitalism in china ,SenseTime Group,CDH Investments,FaceFirst,Yitu Technology,Megvii Technology,Jack Ma,political,general news,national,public security,law enforcement,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,biometrics technology,technology,venture capital"}, {"content": "When it comes to managing debt burdens, Chinese companies know how to keep it all between friends.Take this week\u2019s megadeal involving one of China\u2019s most indebted firms, property developer Dalian Wanda Group. It is selling $9.3 billion in hotel and theme-park assets to another big property firm,             Sunac China.        1918 14.77%       The deal looks like an effort by Wanda to reduce its debt to appease regulators. It is more like a game of pass the parcel.To see why, take a look at the deal\u2019s financing. Sunac is using most of its cash balance to pay for half of the purchase amount, in three installments. But given the deal\u2019s size\u2014it is bigger than Hong Kong-listed Sunac\u2019s own $7.5 billion market value\u2014it needs some help.Sunac isn\u2019t looking very far for the rest of the money. In a maneuver that will reduce the need for external financing, Wanda is lending some 29.6 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) to Sunac to buy its own assets.The structure of the loan is a typical example of so-called entrusted lending, a common form of shadow banking in China in which one company lends money to another. Because that isn\u2019t strictly legal, such loans are arranged via a bank that acts as a middleman, often earning a cut of the deal for its pains. Entrusted lending has ballooned to account for some 10% of credit in China, led by cash-rich state-owned companies that have branched out to loans as they struggle to find growth in their core businesses.With the current Sunac-Wanda deal, Sunac should book the loan as debt, although it could bury it in one of its many joint ventures. Wanda will presumably record the loan as an asset, meanwhile. The ultimate effect is that most of Wanda\u2019s debts haven\u2019t been dealt with; they have just been shifted elsewhere within China Inc.Wanda is lending the cash cheaply too. The three-year loan will be at the benchmark lending rate, now around 5%. Typically such loans are priced at a premium, especially those to indebted borrowers like Sunac, which has an eye-popping net debt-to-equity ratio of over 160%.Still, if one of your friends is helping you out, it is rude to make them pay over the odds.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com and Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 05:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dalian-wanda-rides-chinas-financial-merry-go-round-with-latest-deal-1499763717", "news_title": "Dalian Wanda Rides China\u2019s Financial Merry-Go-Round with Latest Deal", "keywords": "dalian wanda sale, deals, deals financing,entrusted lending,heard on the street,Dalian Wanda,Sunac China Holdings,1918.HK,HK:1918,ownership changes,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,divestments,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,commodity,financial market news,diversified holding companies,real estate transactions,property managers,business,consumer services,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "SINGAPORE\u2014Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte.

Temasek\u2019s president,       Chia Song Hwee,        said the company didn\u2019t set out last financial year intending to divest more than it invested, but that \u201cgenerally speaking the market pricing is a bit too high.\u201dTemasek reported a 13% return to shareholders in the last financial year, supported by a stronger global economy. It said its total portfolio value rose 13.6% to S$275 billion in the 12 months ended March 31. Its net profit rose to S$14.2 billion from S$8.4 billion a year earlier. Last July, Temasek reported its first drop in portfolio value since the global financial crisis, largely due to weakness in shares of public companies it had stakes in.Temasek is among several large institutional investors, both state-run and private, that have warned recently of high valuations in public markets at the same time that there are unresolved uncertainties in the global political economy. This week, Singapore\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. said it had built a more cautious investment profile and warned of \u201ccomplacency\u201d in the investment industry due to low volatility in public markets.Many global institutional investors have performed well in the 12 months ended March 31 despite a series of high-risk political events such as Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and a surprising election result in the U.S.Temasek stuck a more positive tone than GIC, however. The company\u2019s executives said Tuesday they are encouraged by an improvement in business sentiment and investment, a trend that, if it continues, could help support markets at a time when central banks around the world are beginning to normalize interest rates.Temasek\u2019s investments in the past year include U.S. technology firm             Amazon Inc.,       Chinese online travel reservations platform Ctrip., and US$800 million in a life sciences company, Verily Life Sciences, which was spun off from             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google.Among deals in its home country of Singapore, which accounts for 29% of Temasek\u2019s underlying assets, the company invested an additional S$1.6 billion in Singapore Telecommunications Inc. and bought out public transport operator SMRT Corp. for S$1.2 billion.The state investment firm\u2019s major divestments completed in the last financial year include Indian telecommunications firm             Bharti Airtel                   and Singapore shipping operator Neptune Orient Lines. It also divested part of its stake in Thai telco             Intouch Holdings.At the end of March, a quarter of Temasek\u2019s portfolio was in financial services, 23% was in telecommunications, media and technology, and 17% was in transportation and industrials.Correction  A photo accompanying an earlier version of this story showed last year\u2019s Temasek review.

U.S. banks have proved willing to finance shale projects even as most companies don\u2019t produce profits or much cash, underpinning a big 2017 for American drillers.There was also \u201cresilient spending\u201d in the oil industries of the Middle East and Russia, said the IEA, a Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations.\u201cThe oil-and-gas industry is undertaking a major transformation in the way it operates,\u201d the IEA said in its annual report on world energy investment, delivered this year at an oil conference in Istanbul.Instead of focusing on megaprojects with price tags in the billions of dollars and lifetimes measured in decades, the industry has \u201can increased focus on activities delivering paybacks in a shorter period of time and the sanctioning of simplified and streamlined projects.\u201dU.S. shale oil producers have been buoyed by a quick rise in oil prices that followed the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to reduce its output. Prices have since fallen back to their pre-OPEC-agreement levels of below $50 a barrel.But a long period of prices below $40 a barrel helped shale producers--once seen as an industry with uncompetitively high costs\u2014increased efficiency and pump with lower expenses, the IEA said. Shale has \u201cbenefited from a reduction in break-even prices as a result of a combination of improvement in costs and efficiency gains,\u201d the agency said.The IEA warned that this year\u2019s investment upswing is relatively modest and cautioned that it may not be enough to head off an oil-supply shortage in the future caused by lack of investment today.Oil-and-gas sector spending plunged by 26% to $650 billion in 2016, the second straight year it declined in a trend that set the industry back. Investment in the discovery of new reserves\u2014rather than the development of existing oil and gas fields\u2014is set to continue contracting by 7% after already halving by in the two years to 2016.That raises \u201cquestion marks about whether sufficient reserves will be available in the coming years to meet rising demand,\u201d the agency said.The IEA is echoing a similar warning by the head of Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company by production, at the same Istanbul conference Monday.Amin Nasser,        chairman of Saudi Aramco, said \u201cthe long-term situation of oil supplies\u2026is becoming worrying.\u201d And with spending needed for 20 million barrels a day of production in the coming five years, \u201cinvestments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-11 03:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iea-says-spending-in-u-s-shale-drives-global-oil-investment-recovery-1499756403", "news_title": "IEA Says Spending in U.S. Shale Drives Global Oil Investment Recovery ", "keywords": " energy, gas markets, iea, investment, oil glut,oil markets, oil prices, opec,International Energy Agency,output,production,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,natural gas markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,machinery,oil,gas field machinery,heavy construction,oil production platform construction,construction,real estate,natural gas,industrial goods,integrated oil,gas,oil sands,shale"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Dalian Wanda Group, the giant Chinese property developer and entertainment company, is selling off most of its theme parks and hotels in a deal that would pare down a heavy debt load that has drawn attention from regulators.The $9.28 billion sale to             Sunac China Holdings Ltd.        1918 14.88%       comes after China\u2019s banking regulator last month asked lenders to review loans made to big overseas deal makers, including Wanda, to assess whether their escalating debt posed a credit risk.The deal, announced Monday, marks an abrupt retreat for       Wang Jianlin,        the Chinese billionaire who founded Dalian Wanda. Just a year ago, Mr. Wang described his burgeoning chain of theme parks as a \u201cpack of wolves\u201d that would encircle and overpower             Walt Disney Co.\u2019s$5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland.Analysts say the turnabout reflects the need for Wanda to cut its debt, which could improve the chances of relisting its main property subsidiary, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co., on a Chinese stock exchange.\u201cIf we assume Wanda will use the proceeds to repay debt, their overall leverage will certainly come down,\u201d said Kaven Tsang, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s in Hong Kong.Wanda paid shareholders $4.4 billion last year to delist the company from the Hong Kong stock exchange with the aim of relisting it in China at a higher valuation. Wanda has sought to relist the property unit but has yet to receive approval.Wanda declined to comment Monday. In an interview with Chinese financial magazine Caixin, Mr. Wang said Wanda would use the sale to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d the debt of Wanda Commercial Properties, adding that it would repay an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of its bank loans this year.Wanda\u2019s property unit accounted for about 55% of its almost $20 billion revenue in the first half of 2017. However, the unit was saddled with about $33 billion debt as of 2016, up 20% from the previous year, according to regulatory filings.Wanda has borrowed heavily to build apartments, malls and hotels. Earlier this year, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the company\u2019s commercial-property units to just above junk status, noting rising leverage as Wanda attempts to build and sell more malls.The ratings firm said in January that it expects the property unit to raise about $5 billion in additional debt for planned projects within two years. The property unit\u2019s debt levels put a commonly used measure of leverage\u2014net debt to equity\u2014at 56%, which is above its peers.Wanda started off as a property developer in the late 1980s but moved aggressively in recent years into entertainment, adding more debt to its books.The company acquired AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. for $2.6 billion in 2012. Last year, Wanda spent $3.5 billion for Hollywood production and finance company Legendary Entertainment.More recently, Wanda\u2019s $1 billion deal to buy Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions fell apart amid heightened Chinese government scrutiny over capital outflows.In theme parks, the \u201cwolf pack\u201d has yet to show much bite. The Wanda Movie Park in Wuhan closed for retooling less than two years after opening, and the park in Nanchang reported attendance of about 1.3 million in its first seven months, far off the 11 million pace set by Shanghai Disneyland in its first year.Wanda is a private company and not much is known about its overall debt. However, regulatory filings for its property unit reveal that the parent\u2019s consolidated liabilities, which include debt, totaled more than $100 billion at the end of last year.Wanda\u2019s debt also includes $4.75 billion in syndicated loans, which are made by groups of banks to corporate borrowers, and about $18 billion in bonds through subsidiaries that include Legendary, AMC and its property unit, according to data provider Dealogic.Under the deal announced Monday, Wanda said it would sell a 91% stake in 13 of its current and planned tourist attractions and 72 of its 102 hotels in China to Sunac. Along with parks in Nanchang, Hefei and Harbin, there are at least nine other planned parks and tourist attractions.Wanda has been selling assets, such as its malls, in recent years, adopting an \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing the assets instead of owning them. Although Sunac is buying the hotels and theme parks, Wanda said it would still manage them under its brand.Some analysts say hotels and theme parks don\u2019t have much synergy with Sunac\u2019s primary business of luxury apartments.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d said Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a risky move.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Sunac will likely pay Wanda a fee to manage its hotels and theme parks\u2014which could put a dent in Sunac\u2019s future cash flow and tighten its operations, Ms. Zhou said.Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin told Caixin that the developer would only use existing capital, not debt, to finance the acquisition.

Saudi Arabia is OPEC\u2019s biggest oil producer. Aramco produced record output in 2016 of over 10.5 million barrels a day on average, according to its annual report.Mr. Nasser said the dearth of investment now would lead to fewer barrels in future, even with shale production.

MSFT 0.76%       plans to put its lobbying and financial muscle behind a long-shot technology that taps unused television bandwidth to bring broadband access to underserved areas of America.In a speech Tuesday in Washington, Microsoft president and chief legal officer       Brad Smith       is expected to announce support for so-called TV white-space technology, which the company says is a frugal way to address the digital divide between U.S. cities and rural areas.He also plans to encourage the Trump administration and Congress to ensure white-space spectrum is available on an unlicensed basis in every market in the country, and to consider the technology as they develop a new national infrastructure proposal.The Federal Communications Commission estimates more than 23 million people in rural areas lack \u201cfast\u201d internet access, defined as having minimum download speed of 25 megabits a second. Cities commonly have service speeds that top 100 MB a second.Microsoft, which has advocated white-space technology for years, said it will form partnerships with rural telecommunications companies to invest in at least 12 projects in 12 states over the next year, hoping to bring broadband connectivity to two million people in rural America by July 4, 2022.The company declined to say how much it will spend on the effort. Mr. Smith in an interview referred to the spending as a \u201ccivic investment,\u201d but acknowledged bringing high-speed connectivity to rural areas will likely bring new customers to the software giant as well.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be good for everybody in technology, including Microsoft,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The technology Microsoft is championing harnesses unused bandwidth between TV channels to wirelessly deliver access. To use that spectrum, telecoms set up base-station radios, which can send and receive signals up to 10 miles in rural areas. Those radios transmit to antennas attached to homes, which connect to Wi-Fi routers inside.The promise is that TV white space could provide access to the distant reaches of the country at a fraction of the cost of other options. Microsoft estimates it would cost $10 billion to $15 billion to connect rural America with broadband access using TV white spaces, compared with $15 billion to $25 billion using fixed wireless technology, and $45 billion to $65 billion running fiber-optic cable to homes.The broadcast industry doesn\u2019t share Microsoft\u2019s support. In a letter to the FCC on Monday, National Association of Broadcasters associate general counsel Patrick McFadden said there are only 800 white-space devices registered in the U.S.\u2014many just test devices.\u201cMicrosoft has been making promises about white spaces technology for well over a decade,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet there remain few tangible consumer benefits associated with white spaces deployments across the U.S.\u201dThe trade group is concerned that the spectrum Microsoft hopes telecom partners will use for white-space services could interfere with broadcast TV channels. Moreover, broadcasters have complained they don\u2019t have enough spectrum of their own.In response to the broadcast group\u2019s criticism, Microsoft noted \u201cmost new telecommunication technologies have taken over a decade\u201d from the regulatory authorization to commercial adoption. \u201cTV White Spaces have been no exception,\u201d a company spokesman said.While the technology hasn\u2019t taken off in the U.S., Microsoft has financially backed white-space efforts to bring internet access to 185,000 people in 20 projects globally, including rollouts in developing countries such as Kenya, Colombia and the Philippines.Microsoft is betting it can catalyze the market in the U.S. now, in part, because the technology is improved and a business model has been established abroad. It plans to help rural telecoms cover capital expenses and take a share of revenue generated to recoup its costs.Microsoft already has doled out $250,000 to Mid-Atlantic Broadband Communities Corp., said Tad Deriso, chief executive of the southern Virginia telecom. With another $500,000 from the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission and $250,000 of its own money, Mid-Atlantic Broadband plans to bring white-space service to 1,000 customers by year-end.The service, which residents acquire through local schools, provides free internet access to a limited number of education-related sites at speeds of about 3 to 4 MB a second. Customers can access the entire web at the same speed for $10 a month, or pay $40 a month for service that hits 8 to 10 MB a second, though that falls below the FCC\u2019s definition of \u201cfast.\u201dAbout 90% of homes have opted for the free service, Mr. Deriso said.The money from Microsoft and others is crucial because the cost of deploying the technology is about $1,000 a home, Mr. Deriso said. \u201cEventually, we\u2019d like to see it be $100,\u201d he said.Write to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.comAppeared in the July 11, 2017, print edition as 'Microsoft Backs Rural Broadband System.'", "news_time": "2017-07-11 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-rural-broadband-solution-tv-white-space-1499745660", "news_title": "Microsoft\u2019s Rural Broadband Solution: TV \u2018White Space\u2019 ", "keywords": " airwaves, bandwidth,digital divide,fcc, federal communications commission, microsoft, rural broadband, rural internet access, spectrum, tv spectrum, white space, white space broadband technology,white-space internet technology, white-space technology,Federal Communications Commision,Microsoft,MSFT,Patrick McFadden,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,sciences,humanities,television,radio,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,telecommunication services,computing,media,technology"}]
